In addition, affected owners of one person companies may also obtain funds from the 'emergency fund' (Notfallfonds). The payments cannot be accumulated though. The hardship fund for self-employed is divided in two phases:\\r\\r* **Phase 1**: Applications are possible until 17 April 2020. Eligible are those who can prove that they are no longer able to cover the running costs or are affected by an officially ordered ban on entry due to COVID-19 or have a drop in sales of at least 50% compared to the same month of the previous year. The amount of the funding is \\u20ac500 if the net income p.a. was below \\u20ac6,000 and \\u20ac1,000 if it was above \\u20ac6,000. The upper income threshold (above which no grant is paid) is \\u20ac33,812 net in the last year for which a tax assessment is available. It essentially applies to one person enterprises (including agricultural and forestry and private accommodation rents) and freelance workers.\\r* **Phase 2**: Applications start on 20 April 2020. The grant depends on the income loss and lies at maximum at \\u20ac2,000 per month for up to three months. No upper income threshold applies, and small companies with less than ten employees and liberal professions are eligible in addition to the group eligible in phase 1. Negotiations with NGOs are currently ongoing.\\rAll applicants (regardless of whether an application has already been submitted in phase 1) will have the same maximum total amount of funding of up to \\u20ac6,000. \\r\\rIn general, applications for the Hardship Fund can be submitted until 31 January 2021. \",\n",

A total of \\u20ac121 million. was paid out in the first phase. \\r\\rAs of mid-September, a total of almost 195,000 people have been supported in phases one and two and around \\u20ac528.7 million have been paid out. In the most recent period under review (mid-July to mid-August), an average of around \\u20ac1,200 was paid out in each case.\\r\\rAs of mid-October 2020, around 203,000 people have applied for assistance from the Corona hardship fund since the beginning and \\u20ac700 million have been spent. On average, \\u20ac1,200 euros were paid per individual in the period between 16 September and 15 October 2020. \\rAccording to a survey conducted in July and August 2020 by KMU Research Austria, 57 percent of one-person enterprises have taken advantage of government support measures in connection with the COVID-19 crisis.
