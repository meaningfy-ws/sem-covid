In addition, affected owners of one person companies may also obtain funds from the 'emergency fund' (Notfallfonds). The payments cannot be accumulated though. The hardship fund for self-employed is divided in two phases:\\r\\r* **Phase 1**: Applications are possible until 17 April 2020. Eligible are those who can prove that they are no longer able to cover the running costs or are affected by an officially ordered ban on entry due to COVID-19 or have a drop in sales of at least 50% compared to the same month of the previous year. The amount of the funding is \\u20ac500 if the net income p.a. was below \\u20ac6,000 and \\u20ac1,000 if it was above \\u20ac6,000. The upper income threshold (above which no grant is paid) is \\u20ac33,812 net in the last year for which a tax assessment is available. It essentially applies to one person enterprises (including agricultural and forestry and private accommodation rents) and freelance workers.\\r* **Phase 2**: Applications start on 20 April 2020. The grant depends on the income loss and lies at maximum at \\u20ac2,000 per month for up to three months. No upper income threshold applies, and small companies with less than ten employees and liberal professions are eligible in addition to the group eligible in phase 1. Negotiations with NGOs are currently ongoing.\\rAll applicants (regardless of whether an application has already been submitted in phase 1) will have the same maximum total amount of funding of up to \\u20ac6,000. \\r\\rIn general, applications for the Hardship Fund can be submitted until 31 January 2021. \",\n",

A total of \\u20ac121 million. was paid out in the first phase. \\r\\rAs of mid-September, a total of almost 195,000 people have been supported in phases one and two and around \\u20ac528.7 million have been paid out. In the most recent period under review (mid-July to mid-August), an average of around \\u20ac1,200 was paid out in each case.\\r\\rAs of mid-October 2020, around 203,000 people have applied for assistance from the Corona hardship fund since the beginning and \\u20ac700 million have been spent. On average, \\u20ac1,200 euros were paid per individual in the period between 16 September and 15 October 2020. \\rAccording to a survey conducted in July and August 2020 by KMU Research Austria, 57 percent of one-person enterprises have taken advantage of government support measures in connection with the COVID-19 crisis. Of these, almost all entrepreneurs have applied for the hardship fund.

    "                \"descriptionBackgroundInfo\": \"As the tourism industry was among the first sectors to be affected by the closure of enterprises and travel restrictions, the Austrian government - following dialogue with the social partners - announced a support package on 4 March to help ensure the liquidity of small and medium sized enterprises operating in tourism as well as in related business activities (i.e. leisure activities or transport services related to tourism). \\r\\rNext to this measure, also the other support measures (short-time work, 'Haertefallfonds', subsidy for fixed costs) are available to companies in the tourism industry.\\r\\r\\r\",\n",
    "                \"descriptionContentOfMeasure\": \"Initially, bank guarantees amounting to \\u20ac100 million were foreseen, but this was increased to around \\u20ac1 billion on 22 March 2020. Also the costs for issuing the bank guarantees (1% administration fee and 0.8% recurring provision) will be covered by the state. The financial measures are administered by the specialised Austrian Bank for Tourism (OHT).\\r\\rIn addition, some regional states (Bundeslaender) have declared they they will support companies by taking on the payment of interest on the loans and some banks have announced they will keep interest rates low (at 1%). The administrative application has been simplified via an online form.\\r\\rFor companies which were already holding loans from the OHT bank (so called 'TOP-tourism-loans'), the repayment of the outstanding capital can be stopped during 2020 upon application.\\r\\r\",\n",
    "                \"descriptionUseOfMeasure\": \"\\rSince 11 March 2020 (until 31 March), 4,000 requests for support were received and by 26 March, more than 150 bank guarantees, with a volume of \\u20ac32.5 million had been drafted.\",\n",
