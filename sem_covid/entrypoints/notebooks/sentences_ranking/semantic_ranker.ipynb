Depending on the activity, this includes, for example, the possibilities for home office, redesigning workplaces to maintain a safe distance, installed barriers such as plexiglass walls or the use of personal protective equipment. The third COVID-19 Law paved the way for defining specific \"risk groups\", to which further protective measures apply. Employed workers with a very high risk of developing a serious illness if becoming infected with the Corona virus are entitled to work from their home office or to a change in working conditions (meaning that the working conditions must be designed in such a way that infection with COVID-19 is almost impossible, taking into account the way to work). An expert group consisting of three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Nursing and Consumer Protection, one representative from the Federal Ministry of Labor, Family and Youth, three representatives from the Medical Association and three representatives from the social security system held several meetings based on previous experience with COVID-19 sufferers in Austria's hospitals and the international scientific results identified the groups of people who could have a higher risk of developing a serious illness.\n",
