       "[\"ANNEX I CALCULATING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION RISK GENERAL PROVISIONS Netting 1. The excess of an institution's long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same equity, debt and convertible issues and identical financial futures, options, warrants and covered warrants shall be its net position in each of those different instruments. In calculating the net position the competent authorities shall allow positions in derivative instruments to be treated, as laid down in points 4 to 7, as positions in the underlying (or notional) security or securities. Institutions' holdings of their own debt instruments shall be disregarded in calculating specific risk under point 14. 2. No netting shall be allowed between a convertible and an offsetting position in the instrument underlying it, unless the competent authorities adopt an approach under which the likelihood of a particular convertible's being converted is taken into account or have a capital requirement to cover any loss which conversion might entail. 3. All net positions, irrespective of their signs, must be converted on a daily basis into the institution's reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate before their aggregation. Particular instruments 4. Interestrate futures, forwardrate agreements (FRAs) and forward commitments to buy or sell debt instruments shall be treated as combinations of long and short positions.\",\n",
       " \"The exposures to individual clients which arise on the trading book shall be calculated by summing the following items: (a) the excess where positive of an institution's long positions over its short positions in all the financial instruments issued by the client in question, the net position in each of the different instruments being calculated according to the methods laid down in Annex I; (b) the net exposure, in the case of the underwriting of a debt or an equity instrument; and (c) the exposures due to the transactions, agreements and contracts referred to in Annex II with the client in question, such exposures being calculated in the manner laid down in that Annex, for the calculation of exposure values. For the purposes of point (b), the net exposure is calculated by deducting those underwriting positions which are subscribed or sub-underwritten by third parties on the basis of a formal agreement reduced by the factors set out in point 41 of Annex I. For the purposes of point (b), pending further coordination, the competent authorities shall require institutions to set up systems to monitor and control their underwriting exposures between the time of the initial commitment and working day one in the light of the nature of the risks incurred in the markets in question. For the purposes of point (c), Articles 84 to 89 of Directive 2006/48/EC shall be excluded from the reference in point 6 of Annex II to this Directive. 2. The exposures to groups of connected clients on the trading book shall be calculated by summing the exposures to individual clients in a group, as calculated in paragraph 1. Article 30 1. The overall exposures to individual clients or groups of connected clients shall be calculated by summing the exposures which arise on the trading book and the exposures which arise on the non-trading book, taking into account Article 112 to 117 of Directive 2006/48/EC. In order to calculate the exposure which arises on the non-trading book, institutions shall take the exposure arising from assets which are deducted from their own funds by virtue of point (d) of the second subparagraph of Article 13(2) to be zero. 2.\",\n",

Where a credit derivative included in the trading book forms part of an internal hedge and the credit protection is recognised under Directive 2006/48/EC, there shall be deemed not to be counterparty risk arising from the position in the credit derivative. 12. The capital requirement shall be 8 % of the total riskweighted exposure amounts. ANNEX III CALCULATING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RISK 1. If the sum of an institution's overall net foreignexchange position and its net gold position, calculated in accordance with the procedure set out in point 2, exceeds 2 % of its total own funds, it shall multiply the sum of its net foreignexchange position and its net gold position by 8 % in order to calculate its ownfunds requirement against foreignexchange risk. 2. A twostage calculation shall be used for capital requirements for foreignexchange risk. 2.1. Firstly, the institution's net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated.\",\n",
       " \"2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions which calculate the capital requirements for their trading-book business in accordance with Annexes I and II, and, as appropriate, Annex V to this Directive, shall monitor and control their large exposures in accordance with Articles 106 to 118 of Directive 2006/48/EC subject to the amendments laid down in Articles 29 to 32 of this Directive. 3. By 31 December 2007, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the functioning of this Section, together with any appropriate proposals. Article 29 1. The exposures to individual clients which arise on the trading book shall be calculated by summing the following items: (a) the excess where positive of an institution's long positions over its short positions in all the financial instruments issued by the client in question, the net position in each of the different instruments being calculated according to the methods laid down in Annex I; (b) the net exposure, in the case of the underwriting of a debt or an equity instrument; and (c) the exposures due to the transactions, agreements and contracts referred to in Annex II with the client in question, such exposures being calculated in the manner laid down in that Annex, for the calculation of exposure values. For the purposes of point (b), the net exposure is calculated by deducting those underwriting positions which are subscribed or sub-underwritten by third parties on the basis of a formal agreement reduced by the factors set out in point 41 of Annex I. For the purposes of point (b), pending further coordination, the competent authorities shall require institutions to set up systems to monitor and control their underwriting exposures between the time of the initial commitment and working day one in the light of the nature of the risks incurred in the markets in question. For the purposes of point (c), Articles 84 to 89 of Directive 2006/48/EC shall be excluded from the reference in point 6 of Annex II to this Directive. 2.\",\n",
       " 'The transferor of securities or guaranteed rights relating to title to securities in a repurchase agreement and the lender of securities in a securities lending shall include these securities in the calculation of its capital requirement under this Annex provided that such securities meet the criteria laid down in Article 11. Specific and general risks 12. The position risk on a traded debt instrument or equity (or debt or equity derivative) shall be divided into two components in order to calculate the capital required against it. The first shall be its specificrisk component this is the risk of a price change in the instrument concerned due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The second component shall cover its general risk this is the risk of a price change in the instrument due (in the case of a traded debt instrument or debt derivative) to a change in the level of interest rates or (in the case of an equity or equity derivative) to a broad equitymarket movement unrelated to any specific attributes of individual securities. TRADED DEBT INSTRUMENTS 13. Net positions shall be classified according to the currency in which they are denominated and shall calculate the capital requirement for general and specific risk in each individual currency separately. Specific risk 14. The institution shall assign its net positions in the trading book, as calculated in accordance with point 1 to the appropriate categories in Table 1 on the basis of their issuer/obligor, external or internal credit assessment, and residual maturity, and then multiply them by the weightings shown in that table. It shall sum its weighted positions (regardless of whether they are long or short) in order to calculate its capital requirement against specific risk.',\n",

ANNEX I CALCULATING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION RISK GENERAL PROVISIONS Netting 1. The excess of an institution's long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same equity, debt and convertible issues and identical financial futures, options, warrants and covered warrants shall be its net position in each of those different instruments. In calculating the net position the competent authorities shall allow positions in derivative instruments to be treated, as laid down in points 4 to 7, as positions in the underlying (or notional) security or securities. Institutions' holdings of their own debt instruments shall be disregarded in calculating specific risk under point 14. 2.\",\n",
       " \"Positions in gold or gold derivatives shall be considered as being subject to foreignexchange risk and treated according to Annex III or Annex V, as appropriate, for the purpose of calculating market risk. 3. For the purposes of this Annex, positions which are purely stock financing may be excluded from the commodities risk calculation only. 4. The interestrate and foreignexchange risks not covered by other provisions of this Annex shall be included in the calculation of general risk for traded debt instruments and in the calculation of foreignexchange risk. 5. When the short position falls due before the long position, institutions shall also guard against the risk of a shortage of liquidity which may exist in some markets. 6. For the purpose of point 19, the excess of an institution's long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity. The competent authorities shall allow positions in derivative instruments to be treated, as laid down in points 8, 9 and 10, as positions in the underlying commodity.\",\n",
       " \"If the sum of an institution's overall net foreignexchange position and its net gold position, calculated in accordance with the procedure set out in point 2, exceeds 2 % of its total own funds, it shall multiply the sum of its net foreignexchange position and its net gold position by 8 % in order to calculate its ownfunds requirement against foreignexchange risk. 2. A twostage calculation shall be used for capital requirements for foreignexchange risk. 2.1. Firstly, the institution's net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated. This net open position shall consist of the sum of the following elements (positive or negative): (a) the net spot position (i.e. all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, in the currency in question or, for gold, the net spot position in gold); (b) the net forward position (i.e. all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward exchange and gold transactions, including currency and gold futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position); (c) irrevocable guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain to be called and likely to be irrecoverable; (d) net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion of the reporting institution and with the prior consent of the competent authorities, net future income/expenses not yet entered in accounting records but already fully hedged by forward foreignexchange transactions may be included here). Such discretion must be exercised on a consistent basis; (e) the net delta (or deltabased) equivalent of the total book of foreigncurrency and gold options; and (f) the market value of other (i.e. nonforeign-currency and nongold) options. Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its capital ratio may be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions should be of a nontrading or structural nature and their exclusion, and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, shall require the consent of the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions as above may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calculation of own funds.\"]"
