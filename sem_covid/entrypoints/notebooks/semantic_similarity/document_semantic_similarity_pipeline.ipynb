During the COVID-19 crisis, teleworking has been identified as a vital pillar to keep companies working and prevent social hardship. Discussions between the two representative social partners OGBL and LCGB and the employer association UEL, together with the Ministry of Work and Employment, led in a first instance to a joint assessment on teleworking at the level of the Economic and Social Council CES. From there, discussions continued between the social partners and an inter-professional agreement could have been signed between the social partners in October 2020. . Applied for a period of three years and covering all sectors in Luxembourg (with the exception of transport), the agreement provides a definition of teleworking: \\r\\r* Teleworking is identified as a form of organisational work, conducted by digital means and usually done at the company, but that is transferred to the location where the employee lives. \\r* The work is considered as teleworking when it is applied to occasional and exceptional circumstances, and when it remains below the 10% threshold of the annual working time. \\r* Teleworking is based on a written agreement between the employer and the employee, containing several compulsory elements, such as for example the location where telework takes place and the number of hours, and an employee can't be dismissed if he/she does not accept a teleworking scheme and an employer can't be made accountable if the employer refuses a teleworking scheme. \\r* The employer must also provide to the employee all the technical equipment to efficiently work under a teleworking scheme. \\r* The company staff delegation is regularly informed about the teleworking schemes. . All employees in the private sector (with the exception of transport sector) and covered by the Code of Work are concerned.. The agreement is a social partner initiative within the Economic and Social Committee. The two representative trade unions OGBL and LCGB, as well as the employer association UEL signed the agreement.   \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

In the face of the Corona crisis, employers have taken numerous measures to protect employees from infections. Depending on the activity, this includes, for example, the possibilities for home office, redesigning workplaces to maintain a safe distance, installed barriers such as plexiglass walls or the use of personal protective equipment.\\r\\rThe third COVID-19 Law paved the way for defining specific \"risk groups\", to which further protective measures apply. Employed workers with a very high risk of developing a serious illness if becoming infected with the Corona virus are entitled to work from their home office or to a change in working conditions (meaning that the working conditions must be designed in such a way that infection with COVID-19 is almost impossible, taking into account the way to work). Ultimately, if this is not possible, a paid temporary leave of absence can be obtained with full payment by the employer, who will be reimbursed in full by the social security system for the wage costs (including ancillary wage costs).\\r\\rAn expert group consisting of three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Nursing and Consumer Protection, one representative from the Federal Ministry of Labor, Family and Youth, three representatives from the Medical Association and three representatives from the social security system held several meetings based on previous experience with COVID-19 sufferers in Austria's hospitals and the international scientific results identified the groups of people who could have a higher risk of developing a serious illness. . The COVID-19 risk group regulation lists the medical reasons (indications) for belonging to the COVID-19 risk group. Based on these indications, a doctor may issue a COVID-19 risk certificate.\\r\\rThe main medical indications are:\\r\\r1. advanced chronic lung diseases that require permanent, daily, dual medication\\r2. chronic heart diseases with end organ damage that require permanent therapy, such as ischemic heart diseases and heart failure\\r3. active cancer with oncological pharmacotherapy (chemotherapy, biologics) and / or radiation therapy within the past six months, and metastatic cancer even without ongoing therapy\\r4. diseases that need to be treated with immunosuppression\\r5. advanced chronic kidney disease\\r6. chronic liver diseases with organ remodeling and decompensated liver cirrhosis from Childs stage B\\r7. pronounced obesity from obesity grade III with a BMI> = 40\\r8. diabetes mellitus\\r9. arterial hypertension with existing end organ damage, especially chronic heart or kidney failure, or uncontrollable blood pressure adjustment.\\r\\rThese main medical indications are further divided and described in detail in the regulation.\\rIn addition, other, similarly serious diseases with functional or physical limitations can provide special protection through a COVID-19 risk certificate.\\r\\rMost members of the risk group were identified through their medication via their health insurance. They received letters by their social security institution after the legal provisions came into force in May. Furthermore, an individual risk analysis can be obtained by a physician (e.g. for patients with a cancer therapy who do not take any \"prescribed medication\" because they receive their treatment in the hospital or dialysis patients). The doctor carries out the risk assessment together with the patient based on the recommendations for individual risk analysis for a severe course of the disease. If there is a serious underlying illness that meets these recommendations, a COVID-19 risk certificate is issued.\\r\\rEmployers and those affected must jointly consider whether special protective measures are possible in the workplace. If this is not possible, home office can be used. If this is not possible either, workers belonging to the risk group are entitled to paid leave from work.\\r. According to information from the Minister from 21 April 2020, around 90,000 workers are expected to belong to the risk group. No exact data are available and no information on how many have made use of a paid leave are available as of now.. The expert group which elaborated the definition of risk groups consisted of representatives of the relevant ministries, of doctors and representatives of the umbrella association of social security institutions. The latter's board consists of social partner representatives so it can be assumed that they were included in the expert group meetings.  \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

The Council of Ministers has agreed to authorise the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE) a call for aid for investment in thermal energy production facilities with renewable energy sources in Andalusia and two calls for investment aid in Electric power generation facilities with renewable energy sources in the autonomous communities of Andalusia and Extremadura.. In total, €136.3 million will be allocated to boost renewable energies in both regions - €124.3 million in Andalusia and €12 million in Extremadura. In these calls, the aid will range on average between 20 and 30% of the cost of the projects, and will be assigned, by competitive competition, depending on the level of maturity, technological innovation and management, assessing its link with the Just Transition and the Demographic Challenge or job creation.\\r\\rThese are the first calls for a renewable energy promotion package initially endowed with €316 million, of which the calls for the rest of the Autonomous Communities are being finalised, in collaboration with the respective autonomous governments..

The Act 136/2020 Coll., selected modifications in the area of contributions to social security and contributions to the state employment policy and pension has been approved. This Act foregoes the obligation of self-employed persons to pay social and health insurance advance payments from March to August 2020. This measure should help self-employed to keep cash-flow when their business activities are limited by government measures against COVID-19. \\r\\rThere is no need to individually apply for the waiver of the obligation to pay advance premiums for March to August 2020, it is a legal regulation that will be applied to all self-employed persons by default.\\r\\r\\r. Eligible are all self-employed persons performing major or subsidiary gainful activity. They are not obliged to pay advance health and social insurance premiums from March to August 2020. If the self-employed person pays or has already paid any of these advances, they will be used for any other already due liabilities and further as advance insurance premiums for September to December 2020.\\r\\rMinimum monthly payment for self-employed persons performing major gainful activity is for health insurance is CZK 2,352 (€86 approx.), for social insurance CZK 2,544 (€93 approx.) which now self-employed can use for different reasons. However, she/he will have to pay the health and social insurance payments for March-August 2020 in 2021, when she/he submits income and expenses report for 2020.\\r\\rIn case the self-employed is obliged to pay advance health and social insurance payments of higher assessment than the minimum monthly amount (depends on the income in previous year, e. g. 2019), he/she pays the difference between the minimum and real advance payment assessment in the form of balance insurance premium for the year 2020 (therefore it will be used for health and social insurance payment in 2021)..

On 29 August 2020, a tripartite agreement wage compensation that had been in function since 14 March expired. It was replaced on the 31 August by a new tripartite agreement on work sharing, which on one hand is less cost-intensive for the state than wage compensation, but on the other it is a helping hand to the unemployed and the companies since the periods not at work will be supported by a higher remuneration than the existing. \\r\\r **Legal reference** : \\r\\r* LOV nr 1336 af 11/09/2020\\r* Lov om adgang til iværksættelse af midlertidig arbejdsfordeling som led i håndteringen af covid-19\\r* Act no 1336 of 11 September 2020 \\r* Act on access to effectuate temporary work sharing as part of handling Covid-19\\r\\rDue to a significant increase in the number of persons contaminated with corona virus at the end of November 2020, the social partners and the government agreed to prolong the tripartite agreement on work sharing until the end of 2021.\\r\\r. The purpose of the new tripartite agreement of 31 August on work sharing is to mitigate a possible wave of redundancies on the private labour market, which is still affected by the corona crisis, after phasing out the wage compensation measure. The agreement implies that employees in the companies that chose to make use of the measure will work between 50% and 80% of the time. The rest of the working time, they are furloughed. They will receive full pay when at work and receive unemployment benefit for the time at home. \\r\\rThe normal unemployment benefit rate is increased 20%, that is, to maximum DKK 23,000 (€3,087). In addition, non-insured, i.e. employees not member of an unemployment benefit fund will receive the same benefit rate. An employers’ contribution will primarily finance the increased unemployment benefit rate. According to the original work-sharing scheme, the time not at work is deducted in the allowed number of unemployment hours while still receiving a benefit rate. In the new temporary work-sharing agreement, this mechanism is set on hold, so that time not at work does not count as unemployment time. \\r\\rCompanies that are already using the existing work-sharing agreement that in an easier accessible form was agreed in March 2020 as a support measure against the effects of the corona crisis can choose to change to this work-sharing scheme containing an enhanced benefit rate. Applications are still sent to the local job centre but is merely a formality. The new work-sharing scheme is so far valid for the rest of this year.  It will be evaluated and re-negotiated in the end of November. \\r\\r\\r. The parties to the agreement, the government and the Danish Trade Union Confederation, FH, the Confederation of Professional Associations in Denmark, AC, and the Confederation of Danish Employers, DA, estimate that around 30,000 workplaces will have been encompassed by the work-sharing scheme during the period in force, i.e. until the end of 2020.\\r\\rAccording to FH, 7,000 employees were in work sharing as of November 2020. \\r\\rThe Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment (STAR) registers new cases work sharing every month. \\r\\rNew cases of work sharing up to a period of 13 weeks:\\r\\r* Aug 2020: 1,537 persons \\r* Sept 2020: 1,604 persons\\r* Oct 2020: 908 persons\\r* Nov 2020: 815 persons\\r* Dec 2020: 219 persons\\r\\rThe effect of the prolonged period of work sharing will first be seen in the beginning of the 2021.\\r\\r . The social partners was, as it is normal practice in Denamrk, invited by the government to tripartite discussions about the design and implementation of an enhanced work sharing instrument with the aim to prevent a significant high number of redundancies connected to company closures. The social aprtners were also involved the measure that this measure replaces, ie. the wage compensation scheme.  \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

As part of the announced aid measures to the economy, the government has allowed renters to request a deferral of income tax lump sums for the first quarter 2020. However, the question remains what will happen to the second quarter 2020, since it is likely that there will be no tourists and therefore still no income. Renters demanded writing off tax lump sums for the second quarter 2020. The Tax Administration has announced that it is writing off all renters' income tax liability for the second quarter 2020. Otherwise, they would be required to pay lump sum tax for the second quarter by 30 June 2020. Furthermore, no write-off requests will be required or submitted.\\r\\rThis measure is aimed at renters who have lost their guests in the situation of a coronavirus pandemic, as well as the entire tourism sector, and therefore without income. The situation is still unknown for the summer months, but renters hope if there would not be tourists and revenues that the Tax Administration will implement the similar measure.  \\r\\r\\r. In 2019, around 600,000 beds in private rental apartment and houses have been offered to tourists. According to the current tax rules adopted, the owners pay between HRK 150 and 1,500 (€ 20 -200) per bed in annual taxes. The amount is determined by the Assembly of the municipality. If the Assembly does not define the amount, it is paid HRK 750 (€100) per bed annually. The total amount paid to the budgets of local government units, towns and municipalities, amounted to about HRK 140 million annually. \\r\\rThe amount of the flat-rate tax may not be less than HRK 150,00, nor more than HRK 1.500,00. If the representative body does not decide on the amount of the lump-sum tax (per bed/accommodation unit in the campsite/accommodation unit in the Robinson tourism facility), the lump-sum tax is set at HRK 750.00.representative body of the local self-government unit.\\r\\r\\r. Not yet known at this stage. Rough calculations show that each of about 100,000 individual owners paid to the budget HRK 1,400 (€ 185) a year on average. .   \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

Edubox is a Start-Up created by the University of Aveiro and is specialised in creating educational solutions for the public sector.\\r\\rDue to the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent closure of schools, the distance from the client and the need for confinement of education professionals, Edubox developed a platform (Go4All) for interconnection between education professionals, family and students to better respond to effective needs.. Due to the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent lock-down and closure of schools, Edubox, in a short period of time, developed the collaborative platform “Go4All”.\\r\\rThis collaborative platform allowed the interconnection between teachers, students and parents. The platform aims at allowing access to educational content, to work collaboratively and to share contents among teachers, parents and students.\\r\\rOn the other hand, this platform provides a contact center with teachers and multidisciplinary teams (such as psychologists, speech therapists, among others) in order to help and training those who were using the platform during the confinement period.. The 'Go4All' educational platform has been implemented in more than 500 schools, in Portugal Mainland and in the Azores. With the “Go For All” project, Edubox grew 50% compared to the same period in 2019, reached a turnover of €2 million, gathered two new markets and hired five new employees..

Since the introduction of quarantine in Lithuania (16 March 2020), VšĮ “Versli Lietuva” (Enterprise Lithuania) has launched an initiative, “No quarantine on the Internet”, offering assistance to small- and medium-sized businesses to transfer their activities/businesses to the virtual space. VšĮ \"Versli Lietuva\" is inviting people to join the business support campaign by purchasing goods and services at their platform. Such assistance is especially relevant for Lithuanian businesses which are facing temporary difficulties as a result of being unable to trade in their usual trading venues. . VšĮ “Versli Lietuva” remotely consults companies on how to transfer their business to the virtual space. Having created their online store, business representatives are encouraged to register store links using the website www.internetekarantinonera.lt. All store links are made public, and people are invited to join the business support campaign by purchasing goods and services online. This way, the buyer can find Lithuanian entrepreneurs selling various goods and services in one place and immediately buy or reserve goods and services. VšĮ “Versli Lietuva” also invites mentors to register for helping businesses digitize and for providing consultations on various issues of business transfer to the Internet.. \\rThere were 830 online shops on the web platform [ https://www.verslilietuva.lt/pleskis/internete-karantino-nera/lietuvos-e-parduotuves/apsilankyk-e-parduotuvese/ ] at the time of reporting on [8 April 2020].\\r[Verslo zinios (2020), 'Nuo karantino pradžios įsisteigė 80 e. parduotuvių', 8 April.

Ricoh is active in both consultancy and IT related services. The Belgian division has approximately 800 employees. The company decided to act quickly with centralised coordination at the beginning of the pandemic. For some employees it was necessary to fall back onto the temporary unemployment system, others started working from home on a fulltime basis.. Apart from the usage of telework and temporary unemployment the company management started with regular direct digital contact with their employees via digital coffee corners. In the early phases of the pandemic a system was installed to make sure that certain heads of HR were always physically present at the office in case of questions or issues. In addition HR services commissioned their local managers to contact their employees directly.\\r\\rIn addition the company allowed for their employees to be tested for COVID at their head offices voluntarily and free of charge. In total 330 employees made use of this offer to be tested.. The entire country (800 employees).. Involvement of social partners is unknown (not mentioned). The trade unions do however have an important role to play via the obligatory H&S committees.  \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

This measure is part of the raft of support introduced as part of the Budget 2020 policy response, with this scheme being designed by the Bank of England in conjunction with HM Treasury. The Coronavirus Act 2020 is the major piece of legislation covering the government response.\\r\\rAs part of the further measures announced on 17 March, the Bank of England and the Treasury launched a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). This recognises that prior to the crisis, companies often sell short-term debt ('commercial paper') to the market as a quick and effective way of raising working capital/ Thus, under CCFF, the Bank of England will instead buy this short-term debt..

This recognises that prior to the crisis, companies often sell short-term debt ('commercial paper') to the market as a quick and effective way of raising working capital/ Thus, under CCFF, the Bank of England will instead buy this short-term debt.\\r\\rThe scheme then aims to \"…help businesses across a range of sectors to pay wages and suppliers, even while experiencing severe disruption to cashflows.  The facility will offer financing on terms comparable to those prevailing in markets in the period before the Covid-19 economic shock, and will be open to firms that can demonstrate they were in sound financial health prior to the shock. The facility will look through temporary impacts on firms’ balance sheets and cash flows by basing eligibility on firms’ credit ratings prior to the Covid-19 shock.\"\\r\\rSo the scheme will support companies which are fundamentally strong, but have been affected by a short-term funding squeeze, enabling them to continue financing their short-term liabilities. It is also designed to support corporate finance markets overall and ease the supply of credit to all firms.\\r\\r\\rThe scheme is open to larger firms whether or not they have previously sought credit in this way. It will operate for at least 12 months. The Bank of England has set out overall guidance about eligibility and notes that the scheme is “normally” intended for:\\r\\rUK incorporated companies, including those with foreign-incorporated parents and with a genuine business in the UK; companies with significant employment in the UK; firms with their headquarters in the UK. It will also consider whether the company generates significant revenues in the UK, serves a large number of customers in the UK or has a number of operating sites in the UK.  Thus, companies – and their finance subsidiaries – that make a material contribution to the UK economy are eligible to participate.\\r\\rUK Finance provides further coordination of the scheme and lists main contacts..

The data series begins on the 10 May and the most recent reporting is from the 28 June.\\r\\rOn the 10 May, there had been 450 applications, with 59 approved. The total value of these approved facilities was GBP 0.36 billion. By the 31 May, the number of applications had increased to 579, with 191 of these being successful. The total value of facilities approved by this date was GBP 1.1 billion.  By the 28 June, 745 applications had been received; 359 had been successful in total and the cumulative total of all facilities approved under the scheme was GBP 2.33 billion.\\r\\rIt should be noted that the applications figure includes:\\r\\r1. approved applications\\r2. applications that are still to be processed\\r3. applications that have been declined or turn out not to be eligible\\r4. withdrawn applications, where borrowers decide not to proceed.\\r\\r. It is not known whether there was any involvement of the social partners. Any such involvement would have been conducted informally rather than formalised institutionalised fora.\\r  \\rPlease note that the UK does not have formal institutional settings for involvement in the design, implementation and monitoring of policies although often, there will be information exchange and consultation, conducted on informal bases (this exists in addition to formal responses from the social partners to official consultations).\\r\\rIt is reported that the Chancellor held discussions with both the CBI and the TUC before launching the raft of emergency measures at the start of the epidemic. Therefore, there will have been discussion but there is no further detailed information available on these.  \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

Amidst fears that the health sector would be overwhelmed because of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Luxembourg, the government introduced through a law from 29 October 2020 the temporary possibility to have employees in the health sector and in the aid and care sector work for up to to twelve hours per day and sixty hours per week, in a temporary exemption from Article L. 211-12 of the Labor Code. \\r. By way of derogation from Article L. 211-12 of the Labor Code, the law from 29 October 2020 introduced the possibility to extend the maximum working time to up to a maximum of twelve hours per day and sixty hours per week for employees in the health sector, including in hospitals and medical analysis laboratories, in the aid and care sector as well as for staff supervising accommodation structures for minors placed under a custody measure. To be able to apply this exemption, the employer concerned had to request an authorisation from the Minister in charge of Labor, who granted it after verification of the conditions set by the law. Before requesting the extension, the employer had to ask for the opinion of the staff representation body. . No information available..

The Dutch government presented a package of emergency measures to support businesses and workers during the corona crisis. The cultural and creative sector appears especially badly hit by the crisis and this has led to extra measures being taken. On 27 March, the Minister for Education, Culture, and Science sent a letter to Parliament explaining the need for and content of the planned measures. \\r\\rFollowing this first letter on plans to initiate a package of measures, a few weeks later, the announcement was made (after lobbying form the cultural and creative sector), that more support was needed. The Minister for Education, Culture and science announced on April 15th that more financing would be provided to the sector, in the amount of €300 million.\\rSeveral plans were later published in May 2020 which indicated what the extra financial injection would be used for. This measure is one of the cultural and creative measures.. The measure targets privately owned, publicly accessible national monuments and heritage sites. This includes churches, windmills, castles, outdoor areas, industrial heritage sites, museum institutes, and city renovation and restoration sites. The measure constitutes a loan for owners of these types of heritage and monument sites and aims to provide those private owners of heritage sites with income they have missed as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The loan, granted by the National Restoration Fund (NRF), runs 15 years at 1% interest, varies from €10,000 to €2 million, and has the option for delayed payments. The loan is open until the end of 2020.. No information available.. Since the outbreak of the Corona crisis, the government has had regular and close consultation with the social partners. Together the national level social partners and the government arrived at the first and second packages of emergency measures, announced 17 March and 20 May respectively. The cultural and creative sectors indicated that their sectors required extra support as it was especially hard hit by the crisis from an early stage.  \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

Independent artists will be entitled to one minimum wage, together with social security contributions, for the period of emergency plus one month thereafter - that is, for three months. \\rThe money will be donated through the Culture Fund and will be applied for online and by mail. \\r\\rAcceptance of applications and then disbursements should start by 15 April 2020. The idea is to support the most needy artists, who have relatively lower incomes compared to others in their industry.\\r\\rMore projects are being considered through the National Culture Fund, for example a drastic increase the budgets of these projects. So far, 10% of their value has been for administrative expenses. In addition, the duration of many cultural projects, which have been delayed by the pandemic, will be extended. In this way the ministry hopes to sustain art teams.\\r\\rThere are around 2,200 freelance artists in Bulgaria. According to preliminary estimates, at least 50% of them will be able to benefit from the measure.. Freelance artists can receive a creative scholarship in the amount of the minimum wage BGN 720 (€360) per month for a period of three months. The measure aims to provide income for the artist who have been affected by the pandemic measures between March and June 2020. \\r\\rOnly artists who had average monthly incomes of less than BGN 1,000 (€500) last year could benefit from the support. The measure will cost BGN 2.7 million (€1.35 million) to the budget of the Ministry of Culture.\\r\\rA further requirement is that applicants have not received an interest-free loan or other financial support on another basis under a financial assistance measure in the conditions of the COVID-19 epidemic.\\r. Some 1,028 applications were submitted during the application period from 21 to 30 April 2020. \\r\\rHowever, on 17 June 2020, artists gathered to protest in front of Ministry of Culture as only 323 independent artists have been approved to receive the aid. Nevertheless, many of the approved applicants did not receive the aid up until end of June 2020, although the programme has been announced in March.\\r\\r. The measure has been proposed after a group of freelance artists sent a letter to the minister of Culture affairs with the request to be supported during the state of emergency. The letter was signed by artists engaged in several cultural projects like 'Sofia Film Fest', 'Derrida Dance Center', 'ONE for Art Culture' Foundation, organising 'One Dance Week', 'Bulgarian Music Association', 'ACT Association for Free Theatre' and many others small theatre companies, producers and independent artists  \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

During the period of validity of the extraordinary measures in the field of public health adopted by the authorities to combat the effects of the extension of COVID-19, which involve limiting the mobility of citizens or affecting the operation of public services whose action affects the management of unemployment protection, the Public Employment Service will extend automatically the unemployment benefit to those workers whose entitlement ended during this period.. Through this measure, the social security system is authorized to extend automatically the right to receive the unemployment benefit in the cases subject to the semi-annual extension of the right, so that the lack of application by the worker does not entail the interruption of the perception of unemployment benefits or the reduction of its duration.\\r\\rMoreover, in the case of beneficiaries of the subsidy for over fifty-two years, the payment of the subsidy and the contribution to social security will not be interrupted even when the presentation of the required annual income statement is made outside the legally established period.. There are no estimates as to the number of workers affected by this policy.. Social partners were only consulted, but not involved in the implementation and monitoring of this measure.  \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

The Dutch government presented a package of emergency measures to support businesses and workers during the corona crisis. The cultural and creative sector appears especially badly hit by the crisis and this has led to extra measures being taken. On 27 March, the Minister for Education, Culture, and Science sent a letter to Parliament explaining the need for and content of the planned measures. \\r\\rFollowing this first letter on plans to initiate a package of measures, a few weeks later, the announcement was made (after lobbying form the cultural and creative sector), that more support was needed. The Minister for Education, Culture and science announced on 15 April that more financing would be provided to the sector, in the amount of €300 million.\\rSeveral plans were later published in May 2020 which indicated what the extra financial injection would be used for. . This particular measure aims to provide extra subsidies to some 70 cultural institutions which form the foundation of Dutch cultural infrastructure. These institutions receive standard subsidies for a programming period of 2017 to 2020. With this measure, these institutes receive extra subsidies due to the COVID-19 crisis to help these institutes to survive and to continue to offer their services to the public. The extra subsidy per institute is no more than three times the size of the subsidy received by the institute in 2018. The financing goes through one of the 6 main National cultural funds in the Netherlands.  In total the Ministry of Education, Cultural and Science puts aside €113 million and the six main funds another €40 million so that the total budget for this measure is €153 million.. No information available yet.. The main peak level social partners have been involved in developing the emergency packages of March 2020 and the second of May 2020. These measures were of a general nature. The cultural and creative sector social partners lobbied for more specific support at the beginning of the crisis as their sector was particularly vulnerable and hard hit by the crisis. As such the government agreed to attribute extra funding to these sector.  \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

The case was initiated by the Dutch government, specifically by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate. This measure is part of the package of emergency solutions to deal with the COVID-19 that have been taken to combat the outbreak and its effects.\\rThis measure is more a permanent feature that is being temporally expanded in consequence of the emergency condition of the economy after the implementation of the social distancing measures taken by the government.. Enterprises (large and SMEs) need to offer guarantees when applying for bank loans and bank guarantees. The Netherlands has a measure in place for this issues, called the Guarantee for Enterprise Financing (Garantie Ondernemersfinanciering, or GO), where the government acts as a guarantor for up to 50% of an enterprise’s loan. \\rTo help enterprise continuity, the national government has raised the ceiling of the GO from €400 million € to €1,5 billion in March 2020. \\rThe maximum guarantee per enterprise is €150 million. \\rAs of April 2020, the credit guarantee has been increased from 50% to 75%. This enables banks to extend credit more easily and quickly, and enterprises to lend more money faster. The GO ceiling has been raised to €10 billion.  . No information available..

The measure is intended for businesses that are officially recognised as being in difficulty or restructuring. This official recognition has some specific support measures in place to try and keep businesses afloat, this new measure being one of them. It allows employers to reduce a part of their labour costs by reducing the amount of working hours performed within the company.. A company can reduce working hours collectively and therefore respond to reduced production and/or turnover due to the COVID-19 crisis. The workers concerned receive a converted salary supplemented by a lump-sum wage compensation, which covers all or part of the wage loss and is financed by a temporary reduction in the employer's social security contribution.\\r\\rThe measure is reserved for companies that are formally recognised as being in difficulty or undergoing restructuring with an approval period starting between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020.  This measure allows companies in difficulty or restructuring to reduce their wage costs as long as they suffer from reduced activity. The measure is very similar to one that was implemented during the 2009-2011 crisis.. No data available on uptake of the measure.. It is unclear to what extent the social partners were involved in the design of the matter, as there is no public documentation about it available. The measure was regulated via royal decree and not via a collective agreement signed by the social partners.  \\\nAgreement on a teleworking regime.

Compared to other sectors, the construction sector was less affected by COVID-19. The sector also profits from the public recovery programme and public investments in infrastructure and building retrofits. In the 2020 collective bargaining round, the construction workers union IG BAU raised demands for a wage rise, for a reimbursement of transport costs to and from a construction site and, additionally, for a COVID-19 premium. The negotiations with the employer organisation failed and the collective bargaining partners had to involve an arbitrator who decided in favour of several union demands. The social partners accepted the arbitrator decision on 17 September 2020. On 3 September 2020, the arbitrator decided in favour of travel-to-and-from work reimbursements, wage increases, and a one-time COVID-19 premium. The COVID-19 premia are €500 for workers and €250 for apprentices. No taxes or social security contribution apply to the premia, meaning the workers receive the full amount with no deductions. The wage increase includes a recognition of workers' travel expenses for the journey to and from work. This wage increase alone is equivalent to 0.5% increase of one hourly wage.

During the COVID-19 crisis, teleworking has been identified as a vital pillar to keep companies working and prevent social hardship. Discussions between the two representative social partners OGBL and LCGB and the employer association UEL, together with the Ministry of Work and Employment, led in a first instance to a joint assessment on teleworking at the level of the Economic and Social Council CES. From there, discussions continued between the social partners and an inter-professional agreement could have been signed between the social partners in October 2020. . Applied for a period of three years and covering all sectors in Luxembourg (with the exception of transport), the agreement provides a definition of teleworking: \\r\\r* Teleworking is identified as a form of organisational work, conducted by digital means and usually done at the company, but that is transferred to the location where the employee lives. \\r* The work is considered as teleworking when it is applied to occasional and exceptional circumstances, and when it remains below the 10% threshold of the annual working time. \\r* Teleworking is based on a written agreement between the employer and the employee, containing several compulsory elements, such as for example the location where telework takes place and the number of hours, and an employee can't be dismissed if he/she does not accept a teleworking scheme and an employer can't be made accountable if the employer refuses a teleworking scheme. \\r* The employer must also provide to the employee all the technical equipment to efficiently work under a teleworking scheme. \\r* The company staff delegation is regularly informed about the teleworking schemes. . All employees in the private sector (with the exception of transport sector) and covered by the Code of Work are concerned.. The agreement is a social partner initiative within the Economic and Social Committee. The two representative trade unions OGBL and LCGB, as well as the employer association UEL signed the agreement.</th>\n      <th>Special protection for COVID-19 risk groups at work. In the face of the Corona crisis, employers have taken numerous measures to protect employees from infections. Depending on the activity, this includes, for example, the possibilities for home office, redesigning workplaces to maintain a safe distance, installed barriers such as plexiglass walls or the use of personal protective equipment.\\r\\rThe third COVID-19 Law paved the way for defining specific \"risk groups\", to which further protective measures apply. Employed workers with a very high risk of developing a serious illness if becoming infected with the Corona virus are entitled to work from their home office or to a change in working conditions (meaning that the working conditions must be designed in such a way that infection with COVID-19 is almost impossible, taking into account the way to work). Ultimately, if this is not possible, a paid temporary leave of absence can be obtained with full payment by the employer, who will be reimbursed in full by the social security system for the wage costs (including ancillary wage costs).\\r\\rAn expert group consisting of three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Nursing and Consumer Protection, one representative from the Federal Ministry of Labor, Family and Youth, three representatives from the Medical Association and three representatives from the social security system held several meetings based on previous experience with COVID-19 sufferers in Austria's hospitals and the international scientific results identified the groups of people who could have a higher risk of developing a serious illness. . The COVID-19 risk group regulation lists the medical reasons (indications) for belonging to the COVID-19 risk group. Based on these indications, a doctor may issue a COVID-19 risk certificate.\\r\\rThe main medical indications are:\\r\\r1. advanced chronic lung diseases that require permanent, daily, dual medication\\r2. chronic heart diseases with end organ damage that require permanent therapy, such as ischemic heart diseases and heart failure\\r3. active cancer with oncological pharmacotherapy (chemotherapy, biologics) and / or radiation therapy within the past six months, and metastatic cancer even without ongoing therapy\\r4. diseases that need to be treated with immunosuppression\\r5. advanced chronic kidney disease\\r6. chronic liver diseases with organ remodeling and decompensated liver cirrhosis from Childs stage B\\r7. pronounced obesity from obesity grade III with a BMI&gt; = 40\\r8. diabetes mellitus\\r9. arterial hypertension with existing end organ damage, especially chronic heart or kidney failure, or uncontrollable blood pressure adjustment.\\r\\rThese main medical indications are further divided and described in detail in the regulation.\\rIn addition, other, similarly serious diseases with functional or physical limitations can provide special protection through a COVID-19 risk certificate.\\r\\rMost members of the risk group were identified through their medication via their health insurance. They received letters by their social security institution after the legal provisions came into force in May. Furthermore, an individual risk analysis can be obtained by a physician (e.g. for patients with a cancer therapy who do not take any \"prescribed medication\" because they receive their treatment in the hospital or dialysis patients). The doctor carries out the risk assessment together with the patient based on the recommendations for individual risk analysis for a severe course of the disease. If there is a serious underlying illness that meets these recommendations, a COVID-19 risk certificate is issued.\\r\\rEmployers and those affected must jointly consider whether special protective measures are possible in the workplace. If this is not possible, home office can be used. If this is not possible either, workers belonging to the risk group are entitled to paid leave from work.\\r. According to information from the Minister from 21 April 2020, around 90,000 workers are expected to belong to the risk group. No exact data are available and no information on how many have made use of a paid leave are available as of now.. The expert group which elaborated the definition of risk groups consisted of representatives of the relevant ministries, of doctors and representatives of the umbrella association of social security institutions. The latter's board consists of social partner representatives so it can be assumed that they were included in the expert group meetings.</th>\n      <th>Funds for innovative renewable projects in Andalusia and Extremadura. The Council of Ministers has agreed to authorise the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE) a call for aid for investment in thermal energy production facilities with renewable energy sources in Andalusia and two calls for investment aid in Electric power generation facilities with renewable energy sources in the autonomous communities of Andalusia and Extremadura.. In total, €136.3 million will be allocated to boost renewable energies in both regions - €124.3 million in Andalusia and €12 million in Extremadura. In these calls, the aid will range on average between 20 and 30% of the cost of the projects, and will be assigned, by competitive competition, depending on the level of maturity, technological innovation and management, assessing its link with the Just Transition and the Demographic Challenge or job creation.\\r\\rThese are the first calls for a renewable energy promotion package initially endowed with €316 million, of which the calls for the rest of the Autonomous Communities are being finalised, in collaboration with the respective autonomous governments.. No data available.. No involvement reported</th>\n      <th>Waiver of advance payments for social and health insurance for self-employed. The Act 136/2020 Coll., selected modifications in the area of contributions to social security and contributions to the state employment policy and pension has been approved. This Act foregoes the obligation of self-employed persons to pay social and health insurance advance payments from March to August 2020. This measure should help self-employed to keep cash-flow when their business activities are limited by government measures against COVID-19. \\r\\rThere is no need to individually apply for the waiver of the obligation to pay advance premiums for March to August 2020, it is a legal regulation that will be applied to all self-employed persons by default.\\r\\r\\r. Eligible are all self-employed persons performing major or subsidiary gainful activity. They are not obliged to pay advance health and social insurance premiums from March to August 2020. If the self-employed person pays or has already paid any of these advances, they will be used for any other already due liabilities and further as advance insurance premiums for September to December 2020.\\r\\rMinimum monthly payment for self-employed persons performing major gainful activity is for health insurance is CZK 2,352 (€86 approx.), for social insurance CZK 2,544 (€93 approx.) which now self-employed can use for different reasons. However, she/he will have to pay the health and social insurance payments for March-August 2020 in 2021, when she/he submits income and expenses report for 2020.\\r\\rIn case the self-employed is obliged to pay advance health and social insurance payments of higher assessment than the minimum monthly amount (depends on the income in previous year, e. g. 2019), he/she pays the difference between the minimum and real advance payment assessment in the form of balance insurance premium for the year 2020 (therefore it will be used for health and social insurance payment in 2021).. Not available yet.. Social partners, who are members of the tripartite body (Council of economic and social agreement, Rada hospodářské a sociální dohody, RHSD) were informed and consulted in both formal (requested by institutional settings) and informal ways.

On 29 August 2020, a tripartite agreement wage compensation that had been in function since 14 March expired. It was replaced on the 31 August by a new tripartite agreement on work sharing, which on one hand is less cost-intensive for the state than wage compensation, but on the other it is a helping hand to the unemployed and the companies since the periods not at work will be supported by a higher remuneration than the existing. \\r\\r **Legal reference** : \\r\\r* LOV nr 1336 af 11/09/2020\\r* Lov om adgang til iværksættelse af midlertidig arbejdsfordeling som led i håndteringen af covid-19\\r* Act no 1336 of 11 September 2020 \\r* Act on access to effectuate temporary work sharing as part of handling Covid-19\\r\\rDue to a significant increase in the number of persons contaminated with corona virus at the end of November 2020, the social partners and the government agreed to prolong the tripartite agreement on work sharing until the end of 2021.\\r\\r. The purpose of the new tripartite agreement of 31 August on work sharing is to mitigate a possible wave of redundancies on the private labour market, which is still affected by the corona crisis, after phasing out the wage compensation measure. The agreement implies that employees in the companies that chose to make use of the measure will work between 50% and 80% of the time. The rest of the working time, they are furloughed. They will receive full pay when at work and receive unemployment benefit for the time at home. \\r\\rThe normal unemployment benefit rate is increased 20%, that is, to maximum DKK 23,000 (€3,087). In addition, non-insured, i.e. employees not member of an unemployment benefit fund will receive the same benefit rate. An employers’ contribution will primarily finance the increased unemployment benefit rate. According to the original work-sharing scheme, the time not at work is deducted in the allowed number of unemployment hours while still receiving a benefit rate. In the new temporary work-sharing agreement, this mechanism is set on hold, so that time not at work does not count as unemployment time. \\r\\rCompanies that are already using the existing work-sharing agreement that in an easier accessible form was agreed in March 2020 as a support measure against the effects of the corona crisis can choose to change to this work-sharing scheme containing an enhanced benefit rate. Applications are still sent to the local job centre but is merely a formality. The new work-sharing scheme is so far valid for the rest of this year.  It will be evaluated and re-negotiated in the end of November. \\r\\r\\r. The parties to the agreement, the government and the Danish Trade Union Confederation, FH, the Confederation of Professional Associations in Denmark, AC, and the Confederation of Danish Employers, DA, estimate that around 30,000 workplaces will have been encompassed by the work-sharing scheme during the period in force, i.e. until the end of 2020.\\r\\rAccording to FH, 7,000 employees were in work sharing as of November 2020. \\r\\rThe Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment (STAR) registers new cases work sharing every month. \\r\\rNew cases of work sharing up to a period of 13 weeks:\\r\\r* Aug 2020: 1,537 persons \\r* Sept 2020: 1,604 persons\\r* Oct 2020: 908 persons\\r* Nov 2020: 815 persons\\r* Dec 2020: 219 persons\\r\\rThe effect of the prolonged period of work sharing will first be seen in the beginning of the 2021.\\r\\r . The social partners was, as it is normal practice in Denamrk, invited by the government to tripartite discussions about the design and implementation of an enhanced work sharing instrument with the aim to prevent a significant high number of redundancies connected to company closures. The social aprtners were also involved the measure that this measure replaces, ie. the wage compensation scheme.</th>\n      <th>Writing off all renters' income tax liability for the second quarter 2020 in the tourism industry. As part of the announced aid measures to the economy, the government has allowed renters to request a deferral of income tax lump sums for the first quarter 2020. However, the question remains what will happen to the second quarter 2020, since it is likely that there will be no tourists and therefore still no income. Renters demanded writing off tax lump sums for the second quarter 2020. The Tax Administration has announced that it is writing off all renters' income tax liability for the second quarter 2020. Otherwise, they would be required to pay lump sum tax for the second quarter by 30 June 2020. Furthermore, no write-off requests will be required or submitted.\\r\\rThis measure is aimed at renters who have lost their guests in the situation of a coronavirus pandemic, as well as the entire tourism sector, and therefore without income. The situation is still unknown for the summer months, but renters hope if there would not be tourists and revenues that the Tax Administration will implement the similar measure.  \\r\\r\\r. In 2019, around 600,000 beds in private rental apartment and houses have been offered to tourists. According to the current tax rules adopted, the owners pay between HRK 150 and 1,500 (€ 20 -200) per bed in annual taxes. The amount is determined by the Assembly of the municipality. If the Assembly does not define the amount, it is paid HRK 750 (€100) per bed annually. The total amount paid to the budgets of local government units, towns and municipalities, amounted to about HRK 140 million annually. \\r\\rThe amount of the flat-rate tax may not be less than HRK 150,00, nor more than HRK 1.500,00. If the representative body does not decide on the amount of the lump-sum tax (per bed/accommodation unit in the campsite/accommodation unit in the Robinson tourism facility), the lump-sum tax is set at HRK 750.00.representative body of the local self-government unit.\\r\\r\\r.

Ultimately, if this is not possible, a paid temporary leave of absence can be obtained with full payment by the employer, who will be reimbursed in full by the social security system for the wage costs (including ancillary wage costs).\\r\\rAn expert group consisting of three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Nursing and Consumer Protection, one representative from the Federal Ministry of Labor, Family and Youth, three representatives from the Medical Association and three representatives from the social security system held several meetings based on previous experience with COVID-19 sufferers in Austria's hospitals and the international scientific results identified the groups of people who could have a higher risk of developing a serious illness. . The COVID-19 risk group regulation lists the medical reasons (indications) for belonging to the COVID-19 risk group. Based on these indications, a doctor may issue a COVID-19 risk certificate.\\r\\rThe main medical indications are:\\r\\r1. advanced chronic lung diseases that require permanent, daily, dual medication\\r2. chronic heart diseases with end organ damage that require permanent therapy, such as ischemic heart diseases and heart failure\\r3. active cancer with oncological pharmacotherapy (chemotherapy, biologics) and / or radiation therapy within the past six months, and metastatic cancer even without ongoing therapy\\r4. diseases that need to be treated with immunosuppression\\r5. advanced chronic kidney disease\\r6. chronic liver diseases with organ remodeling and decompensated liver cirrhosis from Childs stage B\\r7. pronounced obesity from obesity grade III with a BMI&gt; = 40\\r8. diabetes mellitus\\r9. arterial hypertension with existing end organ damage, especially chronic heart or kidney failure, or uncontrollable blood pressure adjustment.\\r\\rThese main medical indications are further divided and described in detail in the regulation.\\rIn addition, other, similarly serious diseases with functional or physical limitations can provide special protection through a COVID-19 risk certificate.\\r\\rMost members of the risk group were identified through their medication via their health insurance. They received letters by their social security institution after the legal provisions came into force in May. Furthermore, an individual risk analysis can be obtained by a physician (e.g. for patients with a cancer therapy who do not take any \"prescribed medication\" because they receive their treatment in the hospital or dialysis patients). The doctor carries out the risk assessment together with the patient based on the recommendations for individual risk analysis for a severe course of the disease. If there is a serious underlying illness that meets these recommendations, a COVID-19 risk certificate is issued.\\r\\rEmployers and those affected must jointly consider whether special protective measures are possible in the workplace. If this is not possible, home office can be used. If this is not possible either, workers belonging to the risk group are entitled to paid leave from work.\\r. According to information from the Minister from 21 April 2020, around 90,000 workers are expected to belong to the risk group. No exact data are available and no information on how many have made use of a paid leave are available as of now.. The expert group which elaborated the definition of risk groups consisted of representatives of the relevant ministries, of doctors and representatives of the umbrella association of social security institutions. The latter's board consists of social partner representatives so it can be assumed that they were included in the expert group meetings.</th>\n      <td>0.496512</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n      <td>0.454741</td>\n      <td>0.496707</td>\n      <td>0.476957</td>\n      <td>0.494780</td>\n      <td>0.458312</td>\n      <td>0.466210</td>\n      <td>0.466761</td>\n      <td>0.488558</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>0.471000</td>\n      <td>0.508366</td>\n      <td>0.489993</td>\n      <td>0.474225</td>\n      <td>0.492451</td>\n      <td>0.472163</td>\n      <td>0.477105</td>\n      <td>0.480377</td>\n      <td>0.484822</td>\n      <td>0.464472</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Funds for innovative renewable projects in Andalusia and Extremadura.
