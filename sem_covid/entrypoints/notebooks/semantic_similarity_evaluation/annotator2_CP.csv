In face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the collective bargaining partners interrupted the ongoing bargaining round and settled an agreement aimed at supporting the companies and workers in getting through the crisis by an extensive use of short time work.

The so-called 'Solidarity collective agreement' was first concluded by the collective bargaining partners in North-Rhine Westfalia and subsequently copied by the partners in all other regions.

It is noteworthy that the collective bargaining partners build on experiences in the economic crisis 2009/2010 when they also cooperated in campaigning against direct dismissals and for short time working. The agreement settles:

* that annual bonus payment shall be cut in twelve and used for raising the short time working allowance from 60% of the net monthly wage (standard) to 80% of the net monthly wage;
* in case an annual bonus payment is not in place, a solidarity fund shall be established and the employer shall pay €350 per full-time equivalent into this solidarity funds. The funds shall be used for workers facing particular hardships. In case the money is not used up by the end of the year, it shall be distributed to the workers;
* parents with children up to twelve years get five extra days of care leave. Also, they may choose between the annual bonus payment (resp. the extra on the short time allowance) or extra days of leave.

Wage negotiations are postponed until the end of the pandemic. The short time working scheme was very strongly used in April and May 2020 during and shortly after the first strict COVID-19 lockdown; since spring 2020, the application of the scheme  persistently declined in all metal and electrical subsectors. The car manufacturing sector stands out by a stronger use compared to other subsectors.

This measure applies to all job-seekers that have been temporarily laid off between 16 March 2020 and 6 June 2020 and meet the criteria for either basic unemployment allowance (earnings-related unemployment allowance. 

For those job-seekers that have been temporarily laid-off and who qualify for earnings-related unemployment allowance, this measure has financial significance since it extends the period they can receive earnings-related unemployment allowance in case they are dismissed after the lay-off or in the following months. The average earnings-related unemployment allowance is €65 per workday whereas the basic unemployment allowance and the labour market subsidy are €34 per workday.  By the end of May 2020, there were 158,100 temporarily laid off job-seekers in Finland. This was 5,600 less than in April 2020. In comparison to May 2019,  the number of temporarily laid off job-seekers had increased by 149,800. This includes only those job-seekers that were laid-off on a full-time basis.  In March 2020, the peak-level social partners (the Confederation of Unions for Professional and Managerial Staff in Finland, the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions SAK, the Finnish Confederation of Professionals STTK and the Confederation of Finnish Industries EK) 
jointly proposed a set of actions for the Finnish Government. The measures were proposed as a package that includes both measures that support adaptation of businesses to the new market situation and measures that improve the situation of employees who have been dismissed or temporarily laid off. 

Cancellation of the unemployment allowance deductible period was part of this joint proposal.

The average earnings-related unemployment allowance is €65 per workday whereas the basic unemployment allowance and the labour market subsidy are €34 per workday.  By the end of May 2020, there were 158,100 temporarily laid off job-seekers in Finland. This was 5,600 less than in April 2020. In comparison to May 2019,  the number of temporarily laid off job-seekers had increased by 149,800. This includes only those job-seekers that were laid-off on a full-time basis.  In March 2020, the peak-level social partners (the Confederation of Unions for Professional and Managerial Staff in Finland, the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions SAK, the Finnish Confederation of Professionals STTK and the Confederation of Finnish Industries EK) 
jointly proposed a set of actions for the Finnish Government. The measures were proposed as a package that includes both measures that support adaptation of businesses to the new market situation and measures that improve the situation of employees who have been dismissed or temporarily laid off. 

Cancellation of the unemployment allowance deductible period was part of this joint proposal. 

Furthermore, peak-level social partners were consulted during the drafting period of these amendments. ",ref2,2,1

Support to self-employed - First aid Plus Measure 2


 To respond to the 2nd wave of COVID-19 pandemic, the government prolonged the state of emergency since 1 October 2020 and the Public Health Office adopted new preventive measures. They had negative impact on employers and self-employed performing wellness, fitness, sport, cinema, life performance activities, bars, canteens, restaurants and hotels. Most of them temporarily interrupted or significantly reduced their activities this caused a drop in their revenues. This resulted in missing resources to cover their operational costs, including compulsory contributions to insurance funds and particularly wages of their employees or missing income of self-employed. To support concerned employers, self-employed and employees, the government adopted new, modified measures included in the First aid Plus package. Measures are available since 1 October 2020. The Measure 2 is designed to better support the self-employed suffering from adopted anti-COVID-19 measures. The measure replaces the previous measure 
[SK-2020-15/872](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/SK-2020-15_872).
Self-employed running business no later than 2 September 2020, who had at least a 20% drop in revenue in October 2020 and in the following months, can apply to the labour, social and family office (UPSVaR) for subsidy in a form of fixed sum per month. The measure also covers self-employed running business after 1 February 2020, who were not covered by the previous measure 2. The drop in revenue can be calculated, e.g. by comparison with the same month in 2019, 2019 average or with September 2020. According to the rate of drop in revenues, following subsidies are available:

* 20% to 39.99% drop: €270 (by €90 more than in the previous Measure 2)
* 40% to 59.99% drop: €450 (by €150 more)
* 60% to 79.99% drop: €630 (by €210 more)
* 80% and more drop: €810 (more by €270). Presently, data on the number of recipients of subsidies according to the modified Measure 2 are not available. According to the Institute of Social Policy (ISP) data by 30 November 2020, the use of the previous Measure 2 was stable during July- September 2020 when in average about 23,400 self-employed received a subsidy at €435 monthly average. However, significant increase in its use is expected in November and December 2020. According to the estimations, expenditures for measures 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the First aid Plus project will amount to €389,792,725 in October - December 2020. Next €201,759,248 expenditure is assumed for the period January - March 2021. Expenditures are covered by approved financial limit of €1,382.5 million. Funding is provided from the European Social Fund (SURE) and the state budget.  

According to the ISP data published in March 2021, the number of recipients of the measure  has been increasing. For instance, in October, it was 39,164 and increased to 42,372 in December. During the validity of measure, total number of subsidised self-employed reached almost 165,000 and the total amount of provided support made almost €111,409 million. The average monthly subsidy to one self-employed increased, from €624.22 in October 2020 to €744.73 in January 2021.

The CGT is not a signatory. This framework agreement, which covers all the French sites of the third largest European meat process manufacturer, applies to 13,000 employees. It should make it possible both to enhance, throughout the crisis, the commitment of employees, whose activity is essential, and to manage the under-activity of certain establishments. It also sets out the procedures for informing employee representative bodies throughout the crisis. The agreement underlines that a significant drop in activity will affect certain services, workshops or establishments. This situation is due to the cancellation of orders, supply difficulties, or the impossibility of maintaining an activity _'due to the failure of service providers or absenteeism'_. If setting up work-study teams or internal mobility measures are not enough to address this situation of underemployment, the agreement proposes the mobilisation of 'hours and days off counters'. 

**Measures to avoid recourse to partial unemployment**

At the sites, the management can use the following four devices in the order of priority set by the group agreement. These are:

* the modulation of working hours, for workers and employees, with the setting of the schedule within the lower limit of 35 hours ;
* asking managers and supervisors to take days granted as part of agreements on the reduction of working hours;
* the use of rest days deposited in a time-saving account;
* the taking of paid holidays.

Each system is implemented with a 24-hour notice period. The first three tools can be used within an overall limit of ten days. Paid holidays may be taken for up to five working days.
Recourse to short-time working is envisaged as a last resort. The deployment of partial activity, whether in the form of reduced working hours or the closure of an establishment, must be validated and then monitored by senior management.

**Management of essential skills**

According to the agreement, it is necessary to develop the skills essential to the continuity of the group's ""vital"" activity. Indeed, the ""novel"" measures made necessary by the health crisis are disrupting personal life. In addition, the ""barrier"" measures implemented by the employer have a significant impact on the organisation of services and workshops. This valorisation of skills is primarily based on an increase in the internal professional mobility bonus paid for each day of mobility (increase of €10 per day).

Another counterpart provided for in the agreement concerns the remuneration of overtime worked from 16 March to 26 April. Employees who wish to do so, for any hours worked between 35 and 42 hours, are offered the option of benefiting from the social and tax regime for overtime and a 25% pay rise, rather than having them managed under the usual working time modulation scheme. The pay increase is increased to 50% for hours worked beyond 42 hours.
The agreement specifies that the succession of busy weeks must remain under control. 
Management may refuse to allow certain essential employees to take paid leave. The taking of the fifth week's holiday can be postponed beyond 31 May 2020.

**Information for employee representatives**

The agreement organises information for the Information and consultation bodies at the level of each establishment. It covers the implementation of each work organisation measure applied within the framework of this agreement. It is specified that recourse to short-time working is the subject of information and consultation with the establishment's social and economic committee. At group level, management will inform the trade union coordinators (the shop-steward of the representative unions at group level) at weekly telephone briefings. The exchange will enable, in particular, the monitoring of the group's activity levels and absenteeism. It provides for a 'specific focus' in the event of partial activity. This framework agreement, which covers all the French sites of the third largest European meat process manufacturer, applies to 13,000 employees on national level and 28 slaughterhouses.

The Robert Schuman Hospitals group invested in the fight against the effects of the COVID pandemic by entrusted its subsidiary Santé Services S.A. with the implementation of a production line for protective masks. But they start from nearly zero as they have no machine able to produce these masks. Therefore, Santé Services worked hard to become operational in a very short time: a machine has been completely reconfigured from its initial state in order to produce these masks (first in China and then in Luxembourg for adjustments) and they obtain at the same time the ‘Medical Device’ certificates. Following this first initiative, Santé Service explained that the profits from sales are used for operating costs or reinvestment. Thus, 1 October, Santé Services announced that it had invested in a second machine producing masks, this time of the FFP2 type (in test phase for the moment). Launched in end of August, the production line has a capacity of 20,000 surgical masks per day. The machine produces 7 hours a day and 8 workers are working in this production line.

523,Sick leave during pandemic covered by state funds,"Sick leave during pandemic covered by state funds The 'Intervention measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 infectious disease epidemic on citizens and the economy Act' (ZIUZEOP), adopted on 2 April 2020, alleviate the negative consequences of the epidemic on companies, exempting them from paying sick leave compensations in the period from 11 April to 31 May 2020 (Article 56). Normally, employers are paying compensations for the first 30 days of sick leave, and the Health Insurance Institute covers those exceeding 30 days of sick leave. In the reference period, an insured person has the right to the sick leave compensation paid by the Health Insurance Institute since the very first day of sick leave.

The level of compensation usually depends on the reason for sick leave: it is, for instance, determined at 100% for workplace injuries and 80% for illness.

The Intervention act (ZIUZEOP) envisages higher compensation levels for infected persons: 90% compensation for those who, according to doctor’s instruction, have to be isolated, 100% for those who get infected at the workplace.

Healthy persons are not entitled to sick leave compensation. Belong to this category parents who have to look after small children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; persons who cannot come to work due to the suspension of public transport or border crossing; persons with chronic diseases; and healthy persons who have been in contact with infected people. The measure addresses companies as well as self-employed persons, but not organizations directly or indirectly financed by the state budget.

The request to receive the sick-pay compensation from the Health Insurance Institute can be filed within 30 September 2020. The Health Insurance Institute estimates that the costs for sick leave compensation will be about €30 million (Dnevnik, 8 April 2020).

According to the Labour Inspectorate, about 2,000 companies reported on workers who worked at home in the past. Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the number has increased to 10,000 companies (involving about 100,000 employees) (Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia - GZS, 11 June 2020). Teleworking will become a more frequent form of work in the future. During the epidemic, when employers had to send workers to work from home, they experienced the rigidity and ambiguities of the current regulation in this respect  (MDDSZ, Instructions, 22 June 2020). Employer organisations are now proposing certain reforms on that topic.  Employer organisations addressed the initiative for simplifying the regulation concerning the work at home to social partners and the government in particular (for instance, the Association of Employers Slovenia – ZDS, 15 May 2020). On 11 June, Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia (GZS) organised an informative webinar in which speakers (representatives of the employer organisation, ministry of labour, labour inspectorate, and private business) presented the state of the art and proposals of how to adapt regulations to new needs and necessities. 

For now, if a worker starts to work at home:
 
* the employer must conclude a new employment contract (because the place of work has changed);
* he must inform the Labour Inspectorate;
* he must pay compensation to the worker for the material costs (maximum five per cent of the average national salary);
* he is fully responsible for the health and safety of workers. 

The proposal presented at the webinar entails that the law would differentiate between the situation when the worker habitually works at home, and when the worker only occasionally works at home. In the first case, the current legislation would still apply; in the second situation, the employer would only have an obligation to set up rules on health and safety at work, but the worker would be responsible for taking them in the account. 

Rules on health and safety at work usually encompass requirements on the working environment (lightening, noise, temperature), job post (separate mouse, keyboard and screen at a certain height), flexible office chair on five wheels, determination of working time and rest periods The proposal explicitly suggests the necessity of legal changes. It is interesting to add that half of all 26 collective agreements include a general clause about work from home. A quarter of them stipulates that the employer and employee can draw an annex to the employment contract on this – a controversial clause as the webinar has shown. Employer organisation GZS expects that more collective agreements are going to include clauses about work from home. GZS, for instance, supports the idea that the ‘right to switch off’ is included in collective agreements.

The case study organisation is the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA), which represents the 32 local authorities in Scotland. COSLA runs myjobscotland, a national recruitment website for public sector jobs across nearly all Scottish local authorities. Since launching in 2008, the platform not only advertises around 40,000 jobs each year, but also has an applicant tracking system that helps councils streamline their hiring process.

But when the pandemic hit and the prime minister issued his ‘stay at home’ message, the organisation saw an almost overnight move from 5% of public sector staff working from home to more than 80%. Their issue was that there were numerous people within recruitment processes but that COSLA could no longer arrange organise face-to-face interviews as part of those processes. 

With vacancies still needing to be filled despite the lockdown restrictions, the organisation had to quickly come up with an alternative process, all the while further hindered by the usual challenges of tighter council budgets and limited resources. Like many organisations, COSLA considered making use of popular videoconferencing platforms as a virtual alternative to conducting interviews. However, this would have been difficult to streamline with its applicant tracking system. Instead, the project coordinators realised that their  current system offered the option for candidates to add a video as part of their application, and so piloted using this with 10 councils. 

Candidates were asked to put a video together, answering questions they would usually be asked at the interview stage. Not only was this a relatively quick process to roll out, but all the data could be tracked, and hiring managers just had to log in to the system as normal to view it, which saved COSLA time spent on training. To date, more than 5,200 candidates have produced a video as part of their application process, and 253 roles across Scotland have been filled using this system over the last year.

COSLA found that the new process created greater efficiency when recruiting. For example, the time to offer for vital home career vacancies reduced from 74 days to 15 days, and time to hire decreased from 119 days to 44 days.

Feedback from candidates has also been positive: one applicant with dyslexia said they relished the opportunity to not type out lengthy text responses. It also highlighted how “archaic” the recruitment process was before and that the change in practices imposed by the pandemic could be the shift needed for what is typically a very traditional sector to become more digital in the future.

Moreover, given how varied public sector jobs are, managers have been generally positive about the addition of video to the application process.  They have found that it provided them with a real insight into the candidate and gave recruiters an idea of candidates' soft skills. 

The organisation now plans to work with the remaining councils so as to roll out the new system.  No involvement; this is company practice albeit at a consortium level. The Consortium oversees recruitment and selection for public sector bodies in Scotland. Social partners thus have no involvement in what is essentially managerial practice.",ref2,2,4

With vacancies still needing to be filled despite the lockdown restrictions, the organisation had to quickly come up with an alternative process, all the while further hindered by the usual challenges of tighter council budgets and limited resources. Like many organisations, COSLA considered making use of popular videoconferencing platforms as a virtual alternative to conducting interviews. However, this would have been difficult to streamline with its applicant tracking system. Instead, the project coordinators realised that their  current system offered the option for candidates to add a video as part of their application, and so piloted using this with 10 councils. 

Candidates were asked to put a video together, answering questions they would usually be asked at the interview stage. Not only was this a relatively quick process to roll out, but all the data could be tracked, and hiring managers just had to log in to the system as normal to view it, which saved COSLA time spent on training. To date, more than 5,200 candidates have produced a video as part of their application process, and 253 roles across Scotland have been filled using this system over the last year.

COSLA found that the new process created greater efficiency when recruiting. For example, the time to offer for vital home career vacancies reduced from 74 days to 15 days, and time to hire decreased from 119 days to 44 days.

Feedback from candidates has also been positive: one applicant with dyslexia said they relished the opportunity to not type out lengthy text responses. It also highlighted how “archaic” the recruitment process was before and that the change in practices imposed by the pandemic could be the shift needed for what is typically a very traditional sector to become more digital in the future.

Moreover, given how varied public sector jobs are, managers have been generally positive about the addition of video to the application process.  They have found that it provided them with a real insight into the candidate and gave recruiters an idea of candidates' soft skills. 

The organisation now plans to work with the remaining councils so as to roll out the new system.  No involvement; this is company practice albeit at a consortium level. The Consortium oversees recruitment and selection for public sector bodies in Scotland. Social partners thus have no involvement in what is essentially managerial practice.",523,Sick leave during pandemic covered by state funds,"Sick leave during pandemic covered by state funds The 'Intervention measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 infectious disease epidemic on citizens and the economy Act' (ZIUZEOP), adopted on 2 April 2020, alleviate the negative consequences of the epidemic on companies, exempting them from paying sick leave compensations in the period from 11 April to 31 May 2020 (Article 56). Normally, employers are paying compensations for the first 30 days of sick leave, and the Health Insurance Institute covers those exceeding 30 days of sick leave. In the reference period, an insured person has the right to the sick leave compensation paid by the Health Insurance Institute since the very first day of sick leave.

The level of compensation usually depends on the reason for sick leave: it is, for instance, determined at 100% for workplace injuries and 80% for illness.

The Intervention act (ZIUZEOP) envisages higher compensation levels for infected persons: 90% compensation for those who, according to doctor’s instruction, have to be isolated, 100% for those who get infected at the workplace.

Healthy persons are not entitled to sick leave compensation. Belong to this category parents who have to look after small children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; persons who cannot come to work due to the suspension of public transport or border crossing; persons with chronic diseases; and healthy persons who have been in contact with infected people. The measure addresses companies as well as self-employed persons, but not organizations directly or indirectly financed by the state budget.

The request to receive the sick-pay compensation from the Health Insurance Institute can be filed within 30 September 2020. The Health Insurance Institute estimates that the costs for sick leave compensation will be about €30 million (Dnevnik, 8 April 2020). No information yet available.",ref2,1,3

Until further notice, in any case until 1 May 2020, _'no one in Austria will turn off electricity, gas or heat,'_ the Minister and the E-Control board assured. This applies to the population, but also to micro and small companies. Energy minister Ms Gewessler said it was a quick and unbureaucratic consensus in the industry. _'This is a good and important contribution,'_ said the Green politician. However, this is not a legally fixed regulation. The energy suppliers would share the risk with the network operators, said the minister responsible for energy and the environment. According to Urbantschitsch, it is also possible to arrange a deferral of payments or an installment plan with the utilities, or at most a reduction of advance payments for companies, since there is a reduction in energy consumption for company closings.

**Chamber of Labour AK favours legal regulation**

The major energy suppliers for electricity and gas have already announced that they will not switch off during the Corona crisis. The AK also expressly welcomes this voluntary principal. ""But all energy suppliers, including small and above all local and district heating suppliers, have to be brought on board,"" says Christa Schlager , head of the economic policy department at the AK. That seems to have succeeded with Thursday's agreement.

According to E-Control, there were around 43,000 shutdowns in electricity and around 4,000 in gas in 2018. There are no official shutdown figures for the heating sector, but one thing is certain: In Austria around 140,000 people could not afford to keep their home sufficiently warm in 2018. This is also shown by a current study of heating types by the AK. Therefore, the AK is now calling for a legal shutdown ban for electricity, gas and heat during the duration of the Corona crisis. Unknown. It seems that the Chamber of Labour was somewhat involved, even though the extent is unknown. However, their demand seems to have been taken into the sector agreement (see source).",294,Bridging subsidy Corona for self-employed with a disability,"Bridging subsidy Corona for self-employed with a disability Self-employed people with a disability have been entitled to a specific ""bridging subsidy"" in the amount of €267 per month (equalisation tax, amount for 2020), long before the Corona crisis hit the country. This support is available to self-employed people with a degree of disability of at least 50%. The subsidy applies to disabled persons who are either self-employed in companies with a maximum of five employees at the time of application or are mainly active themselves (sole proprietors) and who can demonstrate a disability-related additional expenditure, which represents a significant burden for entrepreneurial activity.

In the face of the COVID-19 crisis, the subsidy was slightly amended: The need to demonstrate the need for the subsidy due to disability-related expenses has been omitted. The bridging subsidy is available to disabled persons whose employment is threatened by the Corona pandemic, even without proof of disability needs. This applies to applications submitted until 30 June 2020 for a period of three months. The amount received per month is at €267.

827,Expansion and increase of the job security allowance and wage allowance,"Expansion and increase of the job security allowance and wage allowance A job security allowance can be granted for people with disabilities who have a degree of disability of at least 30%. The concrete amount of such a subsidy for wage costs is determined by the extent of the endangerment of the job, the age of the concerned employee and his or her ability to find another job at short notice.
This measure has been in place in Austria for many years.
The wage subsidy has also been in place for many years. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the job security allowance has been increased by 50%. For new applications, the possible/maximum amount of the job security allowance is increased by 50% for a period of three months. No additional application is required for existing grants - their increase is automatic for the months of April, May and June 2020. 

The funds for this allowance are taken from the compensation fund as provided for in the Act on the Employment of People with Disabilities (BEinstG). According to this act, all companies that employ 25 or more people are obliged to employ one registered disabled person for every 25 employees. If the employment obligation is not or not completely fulfilled, the company has to pay a compensatory tax per open compulsory position and month (in 2020, the tax lies at €267 per person in companies with 25-99 employees, €375 for companies with 100-399 employees and €398 for companies with 400 an more employees). The entire amount of the compensation tax received is paid into the compensation tax fund and the funds are earmarked to support the labour market integration of people with disabilities. Grants from this fund can be received by the persons concerned themselves as well as their superiors.

No details on the specific amount of the job security allowance is available.

Also, pre-existing wage subsidies for persons with disabilities have been increased by 50% in the event of a (to be explained) risk to the workplace, for a period of 3 months. This applies to applications that are submitted up to and including 30 June 2020. No information on the use is available.

However, due to the containment measures, the transport service volumes decreased, which resulted in decreased work-load and decreased remuneration for drives by 20-30%. Therefore, they actively looked for new business directions to stay afloat. First of all, Bolt Food service, which provides an opportunity for people to order food from restaurants via a mobile app, was changed contactless.

Secondly, Bold Food launched an entirely new measure – food delivery from food stores. This means that clients were able to order all regular groceries from stores and also prepared foods sold by the stores. The service is provided through the Bolt Food app just like the regular service (food delivery from restaurants). The number of stores that allowed such service increased rather quickly. This also allowed shorter waiting times compared to the food stores’ own delivery services, e.g. the waiting time was approximately one hour.

See for example a [Eurofound report from 2010](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/report/2010/austria/working-conditions-labour-market-business/austria-short-time-working-subsidy). A short-time work scheme applies if a company temporarily reduces the working time. In order to prevent dismissals and to protect businesses and employees from negative economic and social impacts of COVID-19, social partners (Chamber of Labour, Trade Unions, Economic Chamber) negotiated the current scheme. 

Working hours of employees can be reduced up to zero hours keeping full / almost full pay. The employer only pays for the actual working time. 

Reduced working hours: The reduced standard working hours must be on average between 10% and 90% of the collectively agreed working hours (this applies to (pre-short-time work) full-time workers, an aliquot reduction applies to employees who were on part-time before short-time work). A new aspect of this is that it may temporarily also be set at zero. Thus, for instance, in the context of a short-time working period of six weeks, it may be set at 0% for five weeks (i.e. no work will take place, and for one week at 60%). Another important point to note is that, in some business sectors, the agreement on short-time work may also include overtime.

In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government adopted a ‘temporary lay-off scheme’ and reimbursement of wage compensations to workers who cannot work due to force majeure. The measure addresses laid-off workers for whom company temporary fails to provide work and workers who cannot work due to force majeure:

* workers in quarantine, who cannot work from home; 
* workers who look after children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; 
* workers who cannot come to work on the grounds of the suspension of public transport or ban on the border crossing. According to the Employment Relationship Act, when a company temporarily fails to provide work for business reasons (in the event of a temporary layoff), the worker is entitled to wage compensation in the amount of 80% of the wage basis. The wage basis is determined at the worker’s average monthly wage for full-time work during the past three months. On the other hand, if a worker cannot carry out his work due to force majeure, he is entitled to half of the payment he would have received if he was working, but not less than 70% of the minimum wage. The temporary laid-off worker is obliged to respond to the employer’s invitation in a manner and under the conditions laid down in the lay-off letter (Employment Relationship Act, Articles 137, 138).

The measure being examined, attempting to cushion the economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, grants the employers with 80% reimbursement of the sums payed to provide the economic treatment mentioned above to workers (in case of temporary lay-off as well as force majeure). This reimbursement is funded with the state budget. Reimbursement is limited to the average monthly salary in 2019 and cannot be lower than the minimum wage (it is thus higher than statutory determined compensations).

The maximum length of receiving compensation is from 13 March to 31 May. To be eligible for the reimbursements, a company had to demonstrate a 20% lower income in the first half of 2020 and 50% lower income in the second half of 2020, compared to 2019. Companies that are not eligible are:

* State institutions.
* Financial and insurance companies with more than 10 employees. 
* Companies having outstanding debt with the Financial Administration.
* Foreign or international organisations (not including humanitarian and disability organisations).

The Employment Service of Slovenia administers employers’ requests for compensations. Up to 31 May, the Employment Service received requests for wage compensation for 275,317 employees and additional 54,168 since 1 June.

According to the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities data, employers submitted 46,009 applications for wage reimbursement of 275,317 employees under the first and second emergency laws (adopted in the period from 13 March to 31 May 2020). Under the third emergency law (adopted in June 2020), employers submitted 10,930 applications for 64,667 employees. Under the fourth emergency law, there were 6,787 applications for almost 24,200 employees by 20 July 2020. Until September 2020, the government paid off €281 million to employers for temporary layoff scheme.

Unlike the short-time scheme, the temporary layoff scheme this was very well accepted by employers who demanded the prolongation of this measure.

1230,Measures to support the construction and property industries ,"Measures to support the construction and property industries  COVID-19 had a marked negative financial impact on several sectors in Malta. By means of a tripartite agreement, a package of measures to save jobs and organisations was agreed and announced by the Government on 24 March 2020. Amongst the measures in this package, wage subsidies were offered to sectors which were worst hit. During a 'mini budget' announced on the 8 June 2020, which aimed to regenerate Malta's economy, government announced another package of measures. Some of these measures aimed at supporting the property market, and in so doing also supported the construction industry, as the sale of properties slumped during the first few months of COVID-19. In order to stimulate the property market, the Government introduced the following measures:

* **Reduction of stamp duty:** The stamp duty rate on property purchases of less than €400,000 was reduced from 5% to 1.5% on contracts to be signed between June 9 and March 31 of next year.
* **Reduction in sales tax:** Tax for those selling property under development and tax on those contracts made after 1 June  up to 31 March 31, 2021 will be reduced from 8% to 5%.
* **First time buyers scheme:** Those who bought property before the scheme was introduced in 2013 were not eligible, these will now be eligible for the scheme. The scheme allows buyers purchasing their first property to be exempt from paying stamp duty on the first €175,000 of the property’s price.
* **Home Deposit Scheme:** aimed at assisting those who are unable to afford a home loan deposit, a government loan covering the 10% deposit (or up to €17,500) payable upon signing a promise-of-sale agreement is being offered. This measure is limited to the first 300 applicants and is means tested depending on martial status, income and capital assets.  The Malta Developers Association (MDA) announced that according to its data, June, July and August 2020 were record months for property sales since 2017. They stated 4,088 promise of sale agreements were registered with a value of €860 million.

Citing the impact of these measures, the head of the MDA stated in June 2021 that the collective value of promises of sale had risen by €1.4 billion over the past twelve months. This was seen as beneficial to the country as the construction sector employed over 40,000 people. By means of a tripartite agreement, a package of measures to save jobs and organisations was agreed on 24 March 2020. This was the third but most significant package of measures announced by the Government. Following this agreement, social partners remained in direct contact with the government highlighting their proposals of what was felt was still necessary to save the Maltese economy and jobs. In the case of measures for the construction and property market, this involvement was often through proposals submitted by the Malta Developer's Association (MDA). 

In view of this, on the 8 June 2020, the government announced a 'mini budget' to help the Maltese economy to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Essentially, this was the fourth package of measures announced by the government. With the exception of the government loan for first time buyers, the current measures formed part of this package. The loan was announced prior to COVID-19 (Budget October 2019) but was implemented in June 2020. ",219,Two practical handbooks for employers and employees on COVID-related OSH,"Two practical handbooks for employers and employees on COVID-related OSH The Ministry of Labour and Health Insurance has compiled the measures to be observed and useful advice to combat the risk of contamination by COVID-19 in two guides for employers and employees, which were put online on 6 and 9 October 2020. They present, for example, the procedure to be followed by the employer in the event of an outbreak of contamination in the company or the actions that an employee can take if the prevention measures taken by the employer are inadequate. On 6 and 9 October 2020, the Ministry of Labour and the Health Insurance published two handbooks 'COVID-19: advice and good practices', one for employers and the other for employees.

**What should the employer do in the event of a cluster in the company?**

In the event of an outbreak of contamination (""cluster"") in the company, i.e. when three employees have been diagnosed positive for COVID-19 over seven days, the employer must alert the ARS (regional health agency) and the labour inspectorate and follow their instructions. He must inform the works council (CSE) of the cluster and the measures envisaged as a matter of urgency, involving it in the discussion on their implementation and 'while respecting the anonymity of the persons concerned'. It can also 'ensure that contact cases have been contacted by the Health Insurance so that they remain isolated, consult a doctor and get tested' and 'reinforce telework when possible'. On the other hand, the employer may not establish a 'file of infected persons and contact cases', disseminate the names of these persons, require employees to inform him/her of the result of the screening test and keep this result, or oblige an infected employee to come to work. 

**What can an employee do if prevention is insufficient?**

Employees are invited to alert staff representatives, the occupational health service or the labour inspectorate if they consider that the measures taken to prevent the risk of contamination are insufficient.
The guide recalls that they can exercise their ""right of withdrawal"" if they consider that there is a serious and imminent danger, by alerting their employer to the situation, provided that the withdrawal does not endanger others. However, if the employer has implemented the recommendations of the Ministries of Labour and Health to protect its employees from the risk of contamination, the handbook states that an employee cannot, 'in principle', legitimately exercise his or her right of withdrawal. However, in the event of a withdrawal that is considered abusive, the employer may withhold wages. Furthermore, it is recalled that an employee cannot telework if his employer has not given his consent. Neither can he refuse to wear a mask (provided by the employer) where this is compulsory and, failing this, he may be sanctioned if this is provided for in a memorandum or in the company's internal rules. Similarly, a temporary employee, service provider or subcontractor may not refuse to wear a mask if it is compulsory in the undertaking in which he works. The handbook applies to all private law companies and private law employees in France. Social partners participate to the management of the Health Insurance, therefore they must have been consulted on the handbooks.",728,Agreement on terms of reference for report on move to Living Wage,"Agreement on terms of reference for report on move to Living Wage In April the Government agreed terms of reference for a report by the Low Pay Commission on a move to a Living Wage.

He said: “The pandemic has caused us to redefine frontline or essential workers and to reconsider the value we place on their work and the reward they should get for that work.

“Traditionally, when we thought of frontline or essential workers, we thought of nurses, doctors, Gardaí or firemen. Generally, people working in the public service with relatively well paid, secure and pensionable jobs. Now with think also of retail workers, drivers, security guards, transport workers and cleaners.

“One of the legacies of the pandemic must be a more inclusive society that rewards work and enterprise better. That means better terms and conditions for lower paid workers. Moving to a living wage is an important part of this. Of course, in doing so we need to recognise that many businesses are closed and are now loss-making, so we must do it in way that that does not cost jobs or cause people’s working hours to be reduced.

942,Periods of isolation assimilated into work accidents in terms of economic benefits,"Periods of isolation assimilated into work accidents in terms of economic benefits Article 5 of Royal Decree Law 6/2020, of 10 March, establishes that in order to protect the public health, periods of isolation or infection of workers caused by COVID-19 shall be considered, exceptionally, as a situation similar to a work accident, exclusively for the economic benefit of temporary disability.

It must be understood that if the contagion occurs ""at work"", the sick must be considered an occupational accident at work for all purposes (not only the economic benefit).

The measure also applies to self-employees registered in any of the Social Security systems. 



 Royal Decree Law 6/2020 establishes that periods of isolation shall be considered as a situation similar to a work accident in terms of economic effects. 

The measure provides more protection to the beneficiaries because the benefits are higher (75% of the base) in case of work accident than in case of temporary disability (60%). And it is also more advantageous for the companies because the cost is assumed by the social security from the first day of leave - in case of temporary disability, the social security assumes the cost from the 3rd day until the 20th and later on, it assumes the 75% of the cost.

The duration of the exceptional benefit will be determined by the time the sick leave (isolation leave) is registered. However, the date of the causal event will be the date on which the isolation or the illness of the employee is agreed, without prejudice to the fact that the sick leave is issued after that date. 

This measure also applies to self-employees registered to any of the social security systems on the date of the causal event.

The measures are precedent by de minimis subsidy due to COVID-19, paid for April, May and June 2020, within the scope of the current PRD. 

 Sub-measure for agriculture COVID I offers farmers subsidies according to the size of their arable land or number of livestock. The measure varies in accordance to the type of agrarian production and livestock. The state aid starts from BGN 300 (€150) for a vineyard hectare and goes up to  BGN 5,000 (€2,500) for a hectare in vegetable production. The state aid is paid once. 

Sub measure COVID II offers employment subsidiaries for employees in the agricultural industry as follows:

* BGN 30 (€15) per employee, equated to the average number of staff - for applicants growing crops;
* BGN 245 (€122) per employee, equated to the average number of staff - for applicants keeping pigs;
* BGN 430 (€215) per employee, equated to the average number of staff - for applicants raising birds.

The measure targets farmers who have applied for support under the direct payment schemes in the national agricultural campaigns 2019 and 2020 or have applied and have been approved for de minimis state aid for beekeeping in 2019. Beneficiaries will also receive support with a valid contract or approved application under other measures within the scope of PRD 2014 - 2020.

A total of about 30,000 farmers have (by the final date of the measure: 13 November 2020) received support under the measure, according to Bulgaria's agriculture minister. This met the initial expectations for the effect of the measure, as almost the entire allocated resource of €35 million was spent.

A total of about 30,000 farmers have (by the final date of the measure: 13 November 2020) received support under the measure, according to Bulgaria's agriculture minister. This met the initial expectations for the effect of the measure, as almost the entire allocated resource of €35 million was spent.

It must be understood that if the contagion occurs ""at work"", the sick must be considered an occupational accident at work for all purposes (not only the economic benefit).

The measure also applies to self-employees registered in any of the Social Security systems. 



 Royal Decree Law 6/2020 establishes that periods of isolation shall be considered as a situation similar to a work accident in terms of economic effects. 

The measure provides more protection to the beneficiaries because the benefits are higher (75% of the base) in case of work accident than in case of temporary disability (60%). And it is also more advantageous for the companies because the cost is assumed by the social security from the first day of leave - in case of temporary disability, the social security assumes the cost from the 3rd day until the 20th and later on, it assumes the 75% of the cost.

The duration of the exceptional benefit will be determined by the time the sick leave (isolation leave) is registered. However, the date of the causal event will be the date on which the isolation or the illness of the employee is agreed, without prejudice to the fact that the sick leave is issued after that date. 

This measure also applies to self-employees registered to any of the social security systems on the date of the causal event.

Within the programme, Profesia cooperates with other organisations, particularly, the Institute for professional rehabilitation or the Slovak Blind and Partially Sighted Union.
The programme’s goal is to help people with disabilities to gain a job, retain or return to the employment in the open labour market. The programme includes persons with all types of disabilities with the focus on more serious ones (such as intellectual disability, autism, Asperger syndrome, people with hearing impairment).
The main activity is the position of Assistance of job inclusion, which has been performed on a voluntary basis without any regulatory background, yet. There is an effort of the programme provider to include this position to the legislation.   Within the programme the recruitment company Profesia offers the employers the free of charge access to CVs of applicants with disabilities and informs employers on the process of inclusion at the workplace. 
The support of the job-seeker with disabilities consists of: 

* The career guidance (abilities and possibilities mapping, help with CV, job search and job interview training – either face-to-face or online)
* The training for the particular employment (guidance during the trial period, inclusion at the workplace, setting the supervision at the employer)

The support is provided by the position of the Assistant for the job inclusion. The assistant supports and helps the job-seeker to be prepared for the job interview and advocates for him/her to be employed, retain to workplace or return to employment.

The support also includes motivation videos of persons with disabilities already employed. These videos and also online counselling and communication seem to be the main activities during pandemic in spring 2020. According to communication with Profesia, career motivation videos have been published for pupils and students with disabilities.
Also the Research Institute of Child Psychology and Patopsychology (VUDPaP) uses these videos in its career guidance National project. Two more videos were being finalised in October 2020. According to communication with Profesia, there were about 1,600 CVs of applicants with disabilities in the database of Profesia company by 30 September 2020.

It will enable consumers to discover and book Irish experiences and accommodation through the channels that are most convenient for them and that offer them the best value.

Currently only 15% of Irish activity and attraction providers currently have a suitable online booking engine.

* Activate connected online booking systems, capable of accepting direct bookings on own website and traditional channels as well as distributing their product to third party channels like tour operators, destination management companies or online travel agents.
* Enhance their own websites to drive consideration and conversion for their product offering and focus on a destination first sell.
* Improve digital capabilities of business owners/staff to utilise the functionality of ‘connected’ booking systems to enhance and streamline the management of inventory, staff, equipment, marketing, communications, invoicing, reporting, and other businesses processes.

415,Help with heart: Labour market re-integration for disabled workers,"Help with heart: Labour market re-integration for disabled workers A programme developed by the recruitment company Profesia has been implemented since 2018. However in spring 2020 its activities were adapted to the new circumstances and the national epidemiological measures. Within the programme, Profesia cooperates with other organisations, particularly, the Institute for professional rehabilitation or the Slovak Blind and Partially Sighted Union.
The programme’s goal is to help people with disabilities to gain a job, retain or return to the employment in the open labour market. The programme includes persons with all types of disabilities with the focus on more serious ones (such as intellectual disability, autism, Asperger syndrome, people with hearing impairment).
The main activity is the position of Assistance of job inclusion, which has been performed on a voluntary basis without any regulatory background, yet. There is an effort of the programme provider to include this position to the legislation.   Within the programme the recruitment company Profesia offers the employers the free of charge access to CVs of applicants with disabilities and informs employers on the process of inclusion at the workplace. 
The support of the job-seeker with disabilities consists of: 

* The career guidance (abilities and possibilities mapping, help with CV, job search and job interview training – either face-to-face or online)
* The training for the particular employment (guidance during the trial period, inclusion at the workplace, setting the supervision at the employer)

The support is provided by the position of the Assistant for the job inclusion. The assistant supports and helps the job-seeker to be prepared for the job interview and advocates for him/her to be employed, retain to workplace or return to employment.

The support also includes motivation videos of persons with disabilities already employed. These videos and also online counselling and communication seem to be the main activities during pandemic in spring 2020. According to communication with Profesia, career motivation videos have been published for pupils and students with disabilities.
Also the Research Institute of Child Psychology and Patopsychology (VUDPaP) uses these videos in its career guidance National project. Two more videos were being finalised in October 2020. According to communication with Profesia, there were about 1,600 CVs of applicants with disabilities in the database of Profesia company by 30 September 2020. It makes about 2% of all CVs in the company's database.

There were 16 clients in Help with heart programme in spring 2020. 
Regarding the particular companies, by the end of September 2020 four employees in Curaden went back to work after spring lockdown and one person will be employed at Bratislava Municipality. 

In the school year 2019/2020, there were 14 secondary vocational school students with disabilities performing their paid practical training in Johnson Controls. They did not return back to the company since the cooperation between Johnson Controls and two secondary vocational schools has been interrupted. 

There have been 30 new employees with disabilities being prepared for a shipping and delivery service company.

The Ministry of Culture has proposed a measure to support the freelance creative persons by mitigating the conditions for applying for a  support benefit. The support is paid from the Ministry to the artistic associations who use it as 1) support to creative persons engaged in a liberal profession for creative activity and 2) grants for the creative activities of creative persons. Changes to the conditions were made in the Creative Persons and Artistic Associations Act. The changes are meant for creative persons, who are not in civil service or not employed on the basis of an employment contract or similar contract, and who are active in the following artistic fields:

 1. Architecture.
 2. Audiovisual arts.
 3. Design.
 4. Performing arts.
 5. Sound arts.
 6. Literature.
 7. Visual arts.
 8. Scenography.

The support for creative persons must be used solely for creative persons support (and not for grants and trainings) until the end of 2020, in case specifically allowed by the Ministry. Additionally, current eligibility criteria for the support will be relaxed:

* a person can apply for the support if at least two years have passed since the end of the previous support period - this restriction will be abolished
* a person cannot apply for the support if they have received other income under service contract the previous month and they cannot receive income while receiving the support - the changes will allow income in the sum of national minimum wage.

This resulted in a prohibition of assemblies over 500 people as a containment measure of COVID-19. As a result of the measure many large arrangements and events were cancelled at the expense of the organising body; for example concerts, festivals and sporting events. In order to support some of the arrangers, the government and the parties in parliament agreed on a compensation scheme for cancelled larger arrangements on 20 March 2020.

BEK nr 456 af 20/04/2020
Bekendtgørelse om forbud mod store forsamlinger i forbindelse med håndteringen af COVID-19. The compensation scheme applies to the economic loss of organising bodies as an effect from cancellation, postponement or substantial changes from one or several arrangements due to COVID-19. In order for the applicant to receive compensation, the arrangement has to meet the following requirements:

* Period of cancellation is between 6 march 2020 and 31 March 2020
* Open to public enlistment
* Minimum 1,000 participants
* Minimum 500 participants from risk groups

The compensation for cancelled larger arrangements was the first out of four large subsidy schemes that the Danish government has introduced: The intent is to support the businesses, while protecting the jobs of the individuals in order to ensure a faster recovery of the economy on the other side of the pandemic.  The Danish Business Authority (Erhvervsstyrelsen) has a webpage that regularly updates information regarding number and payments of the different compensation schemes. As of 28 June 2021the numbers from the compensation scheme for cancelled larger events are:

1087,Financial support to hire workers with disabilities,"Financial support to hire workers with disabilities On 26 August 2020, the government announced the availability of exceptional support for the hiring of workers with disabilities. This new measure has been included in the recovery plan. This exceptional aid for the recruitment of disabled workers covers employment contracts concluded within a period of six months from 1 September 2020. The terms and conditions for implementing this aid of up to €4,000 were set by a decree of 6 October, based on the model of aid for the recruitment of young people under the age of 26. All employers in the private sector are eligible for assistance (companies, associations, etc.). Public administrative establishments, public industrial and commercial establishments, semi-public companies and individual employers are not eligible for the scheme.

**The conditions to be met to benefit from the aid**

The aid is only granted for the recruitment of an employee with the recognition of the status of disabled worker (RQTH), and under the following cumulative conditions:

* the contract is concluded between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2021;
* the employee is hired under an open-ended contract or a fixed-term contract for a period of at least three months;
* the employee is kept on the employer's payroll for at least three months from the first day of performance of the contract;
* the remuneration provided for in the employment contract, on the date of its conclusion, is less than or equal to twice the hourly amount of the minimum wage (i.e., to date, €20.30);
* the employer is up to date with his reporting and payment obligations to the tax authorities and social security or unemployment insurance bodies;
* the employer does not benefit from any other State aid for integration, access or return to employment paid in respect of the employee concerned over the period. It cannot therefore be combined with either aid for hiring young people or aid for hiring young people on work-study contracts. On the other hand, this aid can be combined with the aid provided by the organisation in each case to finance aid for the integration of disabled people into employment (Agefiph);
* the employer has not, since 1 January 2020, made any redundancies for economic reasons in the position concerned;
* the employee has not been part of the employer's workforce since 1 September 2020 under a contract that did not give entitlement to the aid.

**The amount of the aid**

The maximum amount of recruitment aid is €4,000 for a single employee. It is due from the first day of the employment contract and is paid in arrears by the State services (Service and Payment Agency - ASP), at a maximum rate of €1,000 per quarter, up to a limit of one year. This amount must be prorated according to the employee's share of working time and the actual duration of his or her employment contract.

The aid is not due for periods:

* of absence of the employee, which have not resulted in the employer maintaining the remuneration;
* during which the employee is placed in a partial activity under ordinary law or in a long-term partial activity (APLD).

When an employee previously linked to the employer by a fixed-term contract that has given rise to entitlement to aid concludes a permanent or fixed-term contract of at least three months before 28 February 2021, the employer continues to receive aid up to a maximum amount of €4,000. The employer continues to receive aid even if the employee lost the status of disabled worker during the previous contract.

**Procedure for applying for aid**

To benefit from the aid, the employer must submit a request via an online platform to the ASP. The application must be made within a maximum period of six months following the start date of the contract. Applications may only be submitted from 4 January 2021. When applying for aid, employers must certify on their honour that they meet the conditions for eligibility for aid.
The aid is then paid by the ASP on the basis of a certificate from the employer justifying the employee's presence and periods of absence that do not give entitlement to aid. The employer is required to send this certificate before the four months following the end of each quarter of the contract. Failure to submit one of these certificates will result in the definitive loss of aid for the quarter concerned. According to Agefiph, 2.8 million people were recognised as disabled in 2018 (data published in June 2019), i.e. 7% of the population aged between 15 and 64. Of this total, 988,000 were in employment, while 515,000 were registered as jobseekers. The measure therefore potentially concerns these two categories: disabled people in employment who change employers and disabled people registered as jobseekers.

454,Staggered working times - exceptional and transitory regime,"Staggered working times - exceptional and transitory regime The Resolution of the Council of Ministers 63-A/2020 of 14 August, now revoked, proposes the implementation of different clock-in and clock-out times as well as different times for breaks and meals, as an alternative to telework.

This same measure was included in the Resolution of the Council of Ministers 70-A/2020 of 11 September.

Following the return of most Portuguese to pre-essential work and the start of the school year, the circumstances lead to higher levels of contact and a larger number of social interactions, as well as of people on the move, especially in areas with a higher population density and commuting. 
With Decree-Law 79-A/2020 of 1 October, the Government establishes rules for the reorganisation and risk mitigation in businesses in order to prevent the transmission of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the disease COVID-19.

These are based on staggered working times.



 The Decree-Law 79-A/2020 of 1 October establishes an exceptional and transitory regime of reorganisation of work, in order to avoid gatherings of people performing presential work.

This measure applies to businesses with work places with 50 or more workers, in the territorial areas where the epidemiological situation justifies the application of such a measure - areas to be defined by the Government (article 2). 

The employer should organise staggered clock-in and clock-out times, ensuring a time span of at least 30 minutes and up to a maximum of one hour between groups of workers. The employer should also organise alternating breaks, including for meals, among teams or departments. (Article 3)

For the purposes described above, the employer may change working times up to the maximum limit of one hour, unless this causes serious harm to the worker (article 4). It is considered as serious harm notably: the lack of public transports with adequate operating schedules; and the need to provide immediate and necessary assistance to the family.

This change in working times must remain stable for at least one week. This cannot imply the change of the maximum daily or weekly working hours, nor the change from day work to night work or vice-versa.

Some groups of workers are exempted of working according to the new working schedules defined by the employer: workers who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding; minor workers; workers with reduced working capacity, with a disability or chronic disease; and workers caring for children under 12 years old or, regardless of age, with a disability or chronic disease.

According to the Release from the Council of Ministers of 1 October 2020, it was approved a resolution that extends to Public Administration the rules on staggered working times, with the due adaptations.



 No information is available on the use of this measure. The social partners were invited to issue written opinion on this measure but the topic was not discussed in the Standing Committee for Social Concertation.

In order to change working times, according to this Decree-Law, the employer should do a prior consultation to the workers involved and to the works council or, in its absence, to the trade union or inter trade union commission or to the trade union representatives.

This Decree-Law is in force until 31 March 2021 but it may be extended following consultation of the social partners.

",849,Event support ,"Event support  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe negative impact on event organisers. Due to the social distancing rules, the number of participants in events has been limited and many events have been cancelled. As a result, event organisers face significant financial risks.

In order to support the recovery of the event industry, the Swedish Government has proposed a new form of support for companies. Event support is a form of guarantee available for companies that plan events between June 2021 and December 2021. It decreases the final risk of organising events since in the case of cancellation or stricter social distancing measures, the state covers part of the costs.

Only public events with at least 250 participants are eligible to apply for this support. Only event organisers whose events are cancelled or who have to significantly restrict the number or participants, can apply for event support. The support covers up to 70% of the costs that are not covered by the revenue or other forms of subsidies.

401,Measures for simplifying conduct of teleworking,"Measures for simplifying conduct of teleworking The telework contracts number have exploded after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the data provided by the Labour Inspection, there were 50.577 individual labor contracts with a teleworking clause in March 2020, but their number has reached 383.300 in December 2020 and 394.415 in March 2021. Although Romania has adopted a Telework Law back in 2018 (Law no 81/2018), several aspects needs to be flexibilised in order to support the use of telework. Against this background, the Government adopted an emergency ordinance (GEO 36/2021) which introduced amendments aimed mainly at regulating use of electronic signatures in labour relationships and simplifying conduct of teleworking. The GEO 36/2021 provides that the parties to an individual employment contract or addendum may choose to use the advanced electronic signature accompanied by an electronic time stamp when signing the documents. Such documents may be electronically archived by the employer and shall be made available to the competent control bodies at their request.

GEO 36/2021 also modifies the definition of telework by eliminating the requirement that the employee's activity be carried out under the teleworking regime at least one day per month (as provided by Law 81/2018). The obligation to mention in the individual employment contract the place / places for carrying out the telework activity has been eliminated.

In addition, the right of employers to verify teleworker activity has been introduced. Such verification can mainly be done using information and communication technology. The measure will apply to the employees carrying telework in accordance with the Telework Law 81/2018. Data of the Labour Inspection indicate that in March 2021 the number of telework contracts was 394,415. The number of telework may increase in the future.

Although Romania has adopted a Telework Law back in 2018 (Law no 81/2018), several aspects needs to be flexibilised in order to support the use of telework. Against this background, the Government adopted an emergency ordinance (GEO 36/2021) which introduced amendments aimed mainly at regulating use of electronic signatures in labour relationships and simplifying conduct of teleworking. The GEO 36/2021 provides that the parties to an individual employment contract or addendum may choose to use the advanced electronic signature accompanied by an electronic time stamp when signing the documents. Such documents may be electronically archived by the employer and shall be made available to the competent control bodies at their request.

GEO 36/2021 also modifies the definition of telework by eliminating the requirement that the employee's activity be carried out under the teleworking regime at least one day per month (as provided by Law 81/2018). The obligation to mention in the individual employment contract the place / places for carrying out the telework activity has been eliminated.

In addition, the right of employers to verify teleworker activity has been introduced. Such verification can mainly be done using information and communication technology. The measure will apply to the employees carrying telework in accordance with the Telework Law 81/2018. Data of the Labour Inspection indicate that in March 2021 the number of telework contracts was 394,415. The number of telework may increase in the future. All trade unions and employers organizations which are representative at national level have been informed and consulted in the process of elaboration of the measure. Some trade unions (such as National Trade Union/ Blocul National Sindical, BNS) have opposed the measure, which was adopted despite their criticism.",ref1,2,1

In the light of the above, the private textile company Zornica, located in Bánovce nad Bebravou, decided to switch its production, becoming available to provide the government, and possibly other customers, with a wide supply of sanitary protective masks.
 As there was a lack of personal protective sanitary masks, a private company Zornica Banco Fashion in Banovce nad Bebravou was the first company which came with the initiative to stop the production of fashion textile, mainly shirts, for the open market and replace it by the production of personal sanitary protective masks for the use in Slovakia, preferably for the government. According to the available information, by changing the production, the company also responded to the expected decline of demands of its usual customers. The competent government body, consequently, concluded a temporary contract with the company for urgent production of sanitary masks. About 140 workers are engaged in the fulfilment of the contract. The company responded quickly and delivered the fist 20,000 personal masks on 17 March 2020. According to the agreement mentioned above, the company will deliver about 650,000 sanitary masks in total.

",435,Cash grant for companies to produce products related to COVID,"Cash grant for companies to produce products related to COVID COVID-19 had a negative impact upon the majority of organisations in Malta. In response to this impact on the economy, the Government produced a variety of measures to aid organisations to get back on their feet. One such measure was the Investment Aid COVID Products measure which provide a cash grant to support organisations to increase or initiate production of COVID-19 relevant products.  Administered by the Malta Enterprise, the measure provided organisations with a cash grant (and the possibility of an additional tax grant) not exceeding 80% of the eligible costs to support organisations to carry out investment projects to increase or initiate production of COVID-19 relevant products or to diversify existing production to be able to produce COVID-19 relevant products. 

Costs need to have been incurred after 1 February 2020 and investments need to be completed within a period of six months. The grant can be increased by an additional 15% if the project is completed within two months or if the organisation is carrying out the project in collaboration with another organisation established in another Member State which is also providing funding. 

Amongst the supported investments are: 

* assets procured to develop, manufacture and provide COVID-19 relevant products; wage costs of individuals engaged in the development of tools, processes and solutions for the manufacturing of relevant products; wage costs for those developing data collecting and processing tools supporting issues related to COVID-19; 
* costs incurred for trial runs of the new (or diversified) production facilities such as cost of materials required for trial runs of production facilities and cost of data sets acquired to test data processing and collection solutions.
 This incentive has a cash budget of €10,000,000 and a fiscal budget to be awarded as tax credit
of €1,500,000. The overall budget is hence of €11,500,000. The measure was announced by the Government and did not result in any public comments by employer associations or unions.
