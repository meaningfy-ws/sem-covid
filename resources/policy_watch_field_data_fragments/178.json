Companies may now receive a subsidy of up to \u20ac3 million to cover their fixed costs. For the time being, applications for up to \u20ac800,000 can be made.\rThe threshold for loss of sales/turnover is lowered from 40% (phase I) to 30% (minimum). Furthermore, other framework conditions were improved for concerned businesses: the fundable fixed costs were expanded, so  that the depreciation, the fictitious depreciation for movable assets as well as frustrated expenses and personnel expenses that are necessary to maintain the minimum operation can be claimed. Leasing installments are also taken over to 100 percent.\r\rThe fixed costs must have been incurred between 16 September 2020 and 30 June 2021, for up to ten observation periods that are chronologically related or two consecutive blocks. The fixed cost subsidy is based on the percentage of sales losses( e.g. a sales loss of 50% means that 50% of the fixed costs are covered by the subsidy). There is the option for a flat-rate fixed cost subsidy of 30% of the loss of sales for companies with sales of less than \u20ac120,000 in the last year that is assessed. The payment is made in 2 tranches (the first one being up to 80% of the total subsidy), which must be requested separately. Applications for the subsidy may be brought in from 23 November 2020 until 31 December 2020. Applications for the first payment are to be brought in from 23 November 2020 until 30 June 2021, applications for the second tranche from 1 July until 31 December 2021.
