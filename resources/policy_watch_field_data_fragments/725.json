The scheme will replace the [general compensation scheme](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-10_730.html?utm_source=externalDashboard&utm_medium=powerbi&utm_campaign=covid-19) from September until the end of the year. Tourism is among the industries hardest hit by infection control measures and travel restrictions. The aim is to avoid bankruptcy and maintain activity in particularly hard-hit industries.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The proposed scheme will apply from September to December 2020. The scheme will be based on regulations from the [general compensation scheme](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-10_730.html?utm_source=externalDashboard&utm_medium=powerbi&utm_campaign=covid-19) that were abolished on 1 September 2020, and the state will cover a share of the tourism companies' fixed, unavoidable expenses. The scheme will apply to the accommodation industry, the catering industry, the mediation industry (such as tour operators and the like), and parts of the industries for passenger transport and experiences. Exhibition and conference organisers are also proposed to be included in the scheme. Applications will be open in January 2021 and the support will be paid as a one-off payment in total at the beginning of 2021.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners have been consulted regularly during the design and implementation of the measure.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-36_1230.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1638", "sources::title": "Nye tiltak for reiselivet", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/nye-tiltak-for-reiselivet-narmere-15-milliarder-kroner-til-reiselivet-i-host/id2765308/", "sources::d_date": "09/21/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "dcb49207ba5f18f2c43c3e0cac09fa0787940f0f9935bdbaf8ba52e9d328ffea"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "3", "actors::name": "Trade unions", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "4", "actors::name": "Employers' organisations", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "83", "sectors::code": "I55", "sectors::name": "Accommodation", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "84", "sectors::code": "I56", "sectors::name": "Food and beverage service activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "109", "sectors::code": "N79", "sectors::name": "Travel agency, tour operator and other reservation service and related activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1140", "modId": "12"}
