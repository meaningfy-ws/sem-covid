The Minister for Education, Culture and science announced on 15 April that more financing would be provided to the sector.\r\rIn April extra budget (\u20ac300 mio) has been made available by the government to raise subsidies to the institutions crucial to the sector at national and regional level. \r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The target group of the measure are the approximately 70 institutions involved in the \u201cbasic cultural infrastructure\u201d in the Netherlands, approximately 178 institutions, and the Film Fund for film producers.
