In many cases, work in such institutions was restricted due to  the pandemic. As people working in the social services sector are very important in dealing with the current crisis, the Federal Governmetn decided to adopt a new law helping social services providers survive. The so-called Social Service Provider Act is applicable to the full range of social service providers, regardless of their ownership (publicly, privately run commercial providers or not for profit organisations).", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Social Care Provider Act provides compensation payments for social service providers that are currently out of work or have to work shorter hours due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It came into effect at the end of March 2020. It creates the legal framework for service providers to keep paying social institutions their fees, even if the agreed service (e.g. taking care of people with disabilities or work with them in workshops) was not or not fully performed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In such a case, a maximum of 75% of the average amount received by the social service provider throughout the last 12 months can be continued to be paid. In addition to this national rule, the federal states can top up the amount if they consider this an adequate measure. The described measure is available to all social services providers, except for statutory health insurers. \r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information yet.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners are usually involved are heard by the Federal Government when drafting national laws or other major regulations concerning the labour market.
