However, the question remains what will happen to the second quarter 2020, since it is likely that there will be no tourists and therefore still no income. Renters demanded writing off tax lump sums for the second quarter 2020. The Tax Administration has announced that it is writing off all renters' income tax liability for the second quarter 2020. Otherwise, they would be required to pay lump sum tax for the second quarter by 30 June 2020. Furthermore, no write-off requests will be required or submitted.\r\rThis measure is aimed at renters who have lost their guests in the situation of a coronavirus pandemic, as well as the entire tourism sector, and therefore without income. The situation is still unknown for the summer months, but renters hope if there would not be tourists and revenues that the Tax Administration will implement the similar measure.  \r\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In 2019, around 600,000 beds in private rental apartment and houses have been offered to tourists. According to the current tax rules adopted, the owners pay between HRK 150 and 1,500 (\u20ac 20 -200) per bed in annual taxes. The amount is determined by the Assembly of the municipality. If the Assembly does not define the amount, it is paid HRK 750 (\u20ac100) per bed annually. The total amount paid to the budgets of local government units, towns and municipalities, amounted to about HRK 140 million annually. \r\rThe amount of the flat-rate tax may not be less than HRK 150,00, nor more than HRK 1.500,00. If the representative body does not decide on the amount of the lump-sum tax (per bed/accommodation unit in the campsite/accommodation unit in the Robinson tourism facility), the lump-sum tax is set at HRK 750.00.representative body of the local self-government unit.\r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Not yet known at this stage.
