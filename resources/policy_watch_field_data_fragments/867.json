To reduce contacts and further spreading of the virus, the federal government has decided to restrict the activities of a large group of shops and HORECA that are considered to be non-essential. Because of this, many businesses that were struck by previous measures are now confronted with another period of little to no income. Because of this, new measures were implemented, like the New Flemish Protection mechanism. This provides financial support to businesses that have been faced with significant turnover losses in the period of October until mid November.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Concretely businesses that have been faced with a reduction of their turnover (because of federal measures) by 60% in the period between October and the 15 November are able to make use of additional financial support from the Flemish government. This support also applies to businesses that were forced to shut down because of these measures.\r\rThe calculation of the loss in turnover is calculated in comparison with the same period last year. This is firstly done based on a declaration on honour, the applicant is obliged to keep the documentary evidence for five years. \r\rThe mechanism will from now on repeat on a periodic basis, every time businesses that are struck can apply for financial support for the previous period.\rThe financial support amounts to 10% of turnover with a minimum of \u20ac1000 and a maximum of \u20ac60,000 (mainly based on the number of employees).", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The measure is very new and it is therefore currently not possible to estimate the amount of applicants.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "It is unclear to which extent the social partners were involved in this measure.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/BE-2020-40_1442.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "2055", "sources::title": "Statement EO Unizo", "sources::url": "https://www.unizo.be/nieuws-pers/unizo-opgetogen-nu-het-vlaams-beschermingsmechanisme-als-nieuwe-krachtig", "sources::d_date": "10/23/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "f1fabc33d0d751172e1a7621e255ada236f05167cc3243d908809de4dc572ead"}, {"recordId": "2056", "sources::title": "Vlaanderen.be information on the measure", "sources::url": "https://www.vlaanderen.be/economie-en-ondernemen/subsidies/steunmaatregelen-voor-zelfstandigen-en-ondernemers-die-schade-lijden-door-de-coronamaatregele", "sources::d_date": "10/01/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "dd4df7bbc3ef29ce5533cc1370cc533429b362f6a83dacf462c3f99a77337785"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "7", "actors::name": "Local / regional government", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "8", "funding::name": "Regional funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": [{"recordId": "1829", "regions::countryCode": "BE", "regions::level": 1, "regions::name": "VLAAMS GEWEST", "regions::nutsCode": "BE2", "modId": "5"}]}, "recordId": "1352", "modId": "14"}
