The cultural and creative sector appears especially badly hit by the crisis and this has led to extra measures being taken. On 27 March, the Minister for Education, Culture, and Science sent a letter to Parliament explaining the need for and content of the planned measures. \r\rFollowing this first letter on plans to initiate a package of measures, a few weeks later, the announcement was made (after lobbying form the cultural and creative sector), that more support was needed. The Minister for Education, Culture and science announced on April 15th that more financing would be provided to the sector, in the amount of \u20ac300 million.\rSeveral plans were later published in May 2020 which indicated what the extra financial injection would be used for. This measure is one of the cultural and creative measures.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure targets privately owned, publicly accessible national monuments and heritage sites. This includes churches, windmills, castles, outdoor areas, industrial heritage sites, museum institutes, and city renovation and restoration sites. The measure constitutes a loan for owners of these types of heritage and monument sites and aims to provide those private owners of heritage sites with income they have missed as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The loan, granted by the National Restoration Fund (NRF), runs 15 years at 1% interest, varies from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac2 million, and has the option for delayed payments. The loan is open until the end of 2020.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Since the outbreak of the Corona crisis, the government has had regular and close consultation with the social partners.
