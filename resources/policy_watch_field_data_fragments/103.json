In this connection, the Minister for Social Security and Labour issued a recommendation to mayors of municipalities to pay one-off bonuses to employees of social service institutions who, during quarantine, provide social services to elderly or disabled people, families at social risk and children at residential institutions. These bonuses would provide some support for workers who are in direct contact with social service recipients and are therefore at a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Minister for Social Security and Labour issued a recommendation to mayors of municipalities to pay one-off bonuses to employees of social service institutions who, during quarantine, provide social services to different groups of people. According to the Minister for Social Security and Labour and the Minister for Finance, expenditure for employees of social service institutions should be included in the costs of municipalities and their subordinate institutions/agencies, as incurred in relation to the state of emergency and quarantine declared by the Government, and subsequently reimbursed. Although the provision of social services and the remuneration of employees in this field fall within the area of municipal activities, reimbursement of the award of bonuses by the Government would prevent a negative effect on municipal budgets.
