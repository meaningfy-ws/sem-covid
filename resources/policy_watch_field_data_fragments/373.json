The government regards the crisis in aviation as significant, and observe that many countries are establishing major schemes to ensure liquidity for the airlines. The Norwegian government\u2019s loan guarantee totaling NOK 6 billion. Of these, 3 billion are directed to Norwegian, 1.5 billion to SAS and the remaining 1.5 billion to Wider\u00f8e and other airlines.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "It established a state loan guarantee for airlines with Norwegian operation permits totaling NOK 6 billion. The guarantee scheme will be organized through the Guarantee Institute for Export Credit (GIEK). The state contributes 90 percent of the guarantee provided that external banks, credit institutions or other commercial counterparties provide the remaining 10 percent. To take part in the scheme it is required that the company is solvent. For companies that did not have an equity ratio of at least 8% at the end of the last quarterly report prior to the corona crisis, financial creditors must waive interest and defer repayment for three months to gain access to the guarantees. SAS and Wider\u00f8e satisfy the equity requirement. For Norwegian, an immediate facility of NOK 300 million will be made available. When and if the company achieves a reduction in interest and repayments from creditors, an additional NOK 1.2 billion will be made available. The last NOK 1.5 billion will be made available when the company has improved its solvency to a satisfactory level. If the state is to provide guarantees to Norwegian, both owners and lenders must contribute to a better financial situation for the company. The EFTA Surveillance Authority ESA has approved the guarantee scheme.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners have been consulted regularly during design and implementation of the measure.", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-14_728.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "656", "sources::title": "Prop. 57 S (2019 \u2013 2020) Endringer i statsbudsjettet 2020", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/prop.-57-s-20192020/id2694281/", "sources::d_date": "03/20/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "24be3b57888f165641fc13fe8c0b133d61b7c9833667e75c28d5f58a8a3cef4c"}, {"recordId": "657", "sources::title": "Forvaltning av garantiordning for luftfarten \u2013 oppdrag til GIEK", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/59250e9c2e014a338074c00e573ce461/oppdragsbrev-til-giek-garantiordning-for-luftfart.docx.pdf", "sources::d_date": "04/30/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "c988ca2aaffedc334541c06c6bcd7d6ec9591fd653455deaea193a99aab7fae9"}, {"recordId": "658", "sources::title": "Comprehensive package of measures for Norwegian aviation: 6 billion in loan guarantee", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/omfattende-tiltakspakke-for-norsk-luftfart-6-milliarder-i-lanegaranti/id2694265/", "sources::d_date": "03/19/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "13426930274b0f7f3577eb446f82e490579833d5c05a4db4ad29a1467f7c4782"}, {"recordId": "1664", "sources::title": "Proposes changes to the loan guarantee scheme for aviation", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/foreslar-endringer-i-lanegarantiordningen-for-luftfart/id2704388/?utm_source=www.regjeringen.no&utm_medium=epost&utm_campaign=nyhetsvarsel%2029.05.2020&utm_content=N%C3%A6rings-%20og%20fiskeridepartementet", "sources::d_date": "05/29/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "c385882dde38d6751efbf9dc840e036fae99891cf2d951687c56b271d2426d01"}, {"recordId": "1665", "sources::title": "Forlenger l\u00e5negarantiordningen for luftfart", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/ny-side16/id2765145/?utm_source=www.regjeringen.no&utm_medium=epost&utm_campaign=nyhetsvarsel%2021.09.2020&utm_content=N%C3%A6rings-%20og%20fiskeridepartementet", "sources::d_date": "09/20/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "124d9b92c321294d390584ad11c3ac079f5e1c9810ce028dd88822c52b773c09"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "60", "targetGroups::name": "Sector specific set of companies", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "79", "sectors::code": "H51", "sectors::name": "Air transport", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [{"recordId": "314", "updates::d_date": "05/29/2020", "updates::description": "The 29 May, the government proposed three changes to the guarantee scheme:\r\r* Extension of the scheme from 30 June to 31 October 2020. \r* Possibility to deviate from the requirement for risk sharing on equal terms (the pari passu condition) and replace the condition by other terms.\r* In addition, the government will open a dialogue with ESA on an adjustment that imply that shareholder contributions in the form of equity injection can be accepted as a \"commercial tranche\" corresponding to 10 percent of the state guarantee, so that GIEK in the scheme can guarantee 100 percent of loans.
