The cultural and creative sector appears especially badly hit by the crisis and this has led to extra measures being taken. On 27 March, the Minister for Education, Culture, and Science sent a letter to Parliament explaining the need for and content of the planned measures.\r\rFollowing this first letter on plans to initiate a package of measures, a few weeks later, the announcement was made (after lobbying form the cultural and creative sector), that more support was needed. The Minister for Education, Culture and science announced on April 15th that more financing would be provided to the sector, in the amount of \u20ac 300 million.\rSeveral plans were later published in May 2020 which indicated what the extra financial injection would be used for.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This particular measure targets enterprises in the cultural and creative sectors who cannot make sufficient use of the generic governmental support measures. The loan is meant for the development of publicly orientated productions, programmes, exhibitions, performances or projects. The loan can also be used in combination with a loan from a bank. The interest on the loan is 1% and can be paid back early (without any financial consequences attached).  \r\rThe government has made \u20ac30 million available to finance these loans. An institution may receive a minimum of \u20ac10,000 to a maximum of \u20ac500,000 per loan application. One institute can take out a maximum of two loans.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Since the outbreak of the Corona crisis, the government has had regular and close consultation with the social partners.
