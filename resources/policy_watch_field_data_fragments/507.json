The plan is focused on boosting economic recovery, following the UK's lockdown and the recent easing of restrictions. The Chancellor described the plan as the 'second phase' of response to the coronavirus crisis and as being about jobs. He began his speech by stating that the government will not accept rising unemployment and that it will do all it can to give 'everyone the opportunity of good and secure work.' The Plan for Jobs has 'a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs', given the 25% contraction in the UK economy in the preceding months and the predictions by the\u00a0Office for Budget Responsibility and Bank of England as to\u00a0significant job losses.\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "These initiatives are aimed at supporting young people, who it is predicted, will be hardest hit by the crisis (the Chancellor reported that the under-25s are two and a half times more likely to work in a sector that has been closed e.g. retail and hospitality).\u00a0The new Kickstart Scheme is thus a\u00a0'new programme to give hundreds of thousands of young people, in every region and nation of Britain, the best possible chance of getting on and getting a job.'\r\rUnder the scheme, employers will be directly paid to create new jobs for any\u00a016 to 24-year-old at risk of long-term unemployment.\u00a0These will have to be new jobs, as the\u00a0funding will be conditional on proof that\u00a0these jobs are additional. The jobs will have to be 'decent';\u00a0with a minimum of 25 hours per week paid at least the National Minimum Wage.\u00a0 Employers will also have to provide\u00a0'Kickstarters' with training and support to find a permanent job.\u00a0If employers meet these conditions, the Government\u00a0will pay young people\u2019s wages for six months, plus an amount to cover overheads. Thus, for\u00a0a 24-year-old, the grant will be around GBP 6,500.\r\rEmployers can apply to be part of the scheme from August. There is to be no cap on the numbers of places available and the Chancellor has pledged\u00a0an initial GBP  billion, a sum he says will be enough to fund hundreds of thousands of jobs.\r\rThe Government also pledged on the 8 July\u00a0to: \r\r* pay employers GBP 1,000 to take on new\u00a0trainees, with triple the number of places;\r* provide GBP 100 million to create more places on Level 2 and 3 courses, so as to support 18-19-year olds leaving school or college to find work in high-demand sectors like engineering, construction and social care;\u00a0\r* funding for\u00a0new careers advisers to support over a quarter of a million more people; \r* for the next six months, paying employers to create new apprenticeships and paying businesses to hire young apprentices, with a payment of GBP 2,000 per apprentice. \r* In addition, there will be a new bonus for businesses to hire apprentices aged 25 and over, with a\u00a0payment of GBP 1,500.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As yet unknown.

This will make the process easier and less labour intensive to apply for these smaller companies who only want to hire one or two Kickstarters.
