The scheme is based on the fact that, in order to avoid redundancies, companies can reduce employees' working hours for a temporary period during which they can then receive supplementary unemployment benefit.\r\rFinally, if necessary, the government will temporarily expand the pool of funds for financing measures targeting layoffs by DKK 10 million this year. The money will be able to ensure quick and targeted action for people who lose their jobs as part of major layoffs caused by COVID-19.\r\rIt is proposed that the Bill will come into effect retroactively with effect from 27 February, 2020.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Both employers and self-employed are entitled reimbursement from the first day of sickness of a worker. The measure to increase sick payment entitlements is expected to result in considerable public expenditure, estimated at around DKK 1,650 million.

The funds can be used by the Regional Labour Council to grant funds for initiatives targeting laid off workers.
