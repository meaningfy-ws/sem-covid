In an ordinary situation, the employer must pay sick pay for a period of up to 16 calendar days (the employer period). In its decision 390, 16 March 2020, the Storting asked the government to reduce the employer period for the payment of sick pay to employees from 16 to three days for sick leave related COVID-19. \r\rThe exemption provision is stipulated in the temporary regulations on exemptions from the National Insurance Act and the Working Environment Act in connection with the corona pandemic, and expires on 31 December 2020 or when the Ministry / King decides. The exemption provision means that the National Insurance Scheme reimburses employers' expenses for sick leave for coronavirus-related absences from day four to day 16. The employer offsets sick pay and may claim reimbursement from the Labor and Welfare Agency for the number of days exceeding three.
