This includes landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19. Where a\u00a0tenant is experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19, the government will ensure\u00a0they do not face the threat of eviction for at least three months:\r\r* The government has agreed with mortgage lenders that they will offer repayment holidays of three months to households in financial difficulty due to COVID-19.\r\r* This will also apply to landlords whose tenants are experiencing financial difficulties because of COVID-19.\r* The offer of a payment holiday can be made available to customers who are up to date with payments and not already in arrears.\r* Customers who are concerned about their current financial situation should contact their lender at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss whether this is a suitable option for them.\r* Under the Coronavirus Act,\u00a0landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a three month period. This applies to private and social renters.\r* At the end of this period, landlords and tenants will be expected to work together to establish an affordable repayment plan, taking into account tenants\u2019 individual circumstances. \r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Currently unknown.\r\rHowever, research by the Resolution Foundation published on the 30th May (Judge, 2020), analysed\u00a0the findings of a YouGov survey of 6000\u00a0working-age adults, focusing on levels of housing stress, and how families in different housing tenures are coping.\r\rThe study found\u00a0that while the earnings hit has been widely experienced across tenure groups, renters are one-and-a-half to two times more likely to have fallen behind with their housing payments compared to mortgaged home owners. Owners entered the crisis with lower average housing costs and a bigger financial buffer than renters, and have also been more successful at directly reducing housing costs in recent weeks. While just one-in-twelve home owners applying for a mortgage holiday have been refused, that figure stands at one-in-two for those renters who have sought a rent reduction. While the social security system potentially offers a (more generous) backstop for renters, eligibility rules and caps leave some renters without adequate support. The study\u00a0showed that one-third of new benefit claimants are in housing cost arrears.\u00a0 ", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Whilst the social partners were informed as to the total raft of measures, they were not involved in the design, implementation or formal monitoring of this measure.", "socialPartner_form": "Unknown", "socialPartner_role": "Informed", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/GB-2020-12_587.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "477", "sources::title": "HM Treasury 'How to access government financial support if you or your business has been affected by COVID-19.'", "sources::url": "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878995/Covid-19_fact_sheet.pdf", "sources::d_date": "03/17/2020", "modId": "3", "downloaded_to": "2b1b9e5353bbc2ec22e9bbb74da3ea9750b87f686ea459c15bd445131c3c31ce"}, {"recordId": "1054", "sources::title": "Judge, L.
