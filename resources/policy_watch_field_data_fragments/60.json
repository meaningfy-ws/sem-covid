The Ministry of Finance prepared Instruction (OG 46/20) applies to all local and regional self-government units, the Croatian Health Insurance Institute and the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute, which have experienced falls in revenue due to deferred payments, reimbursement or exemption from income tax and surtax, in accordance with the special regulation governing the general tax procedure. The Ministry of Finance has published also the proper forms for applying for these aforementioned interest-free loans on its website. According to an announcement from the Association of Cities, the aforementioned assistance offered by the Croatian Government doesn't regard loans from commercial banks, but rather temporary assistance for liquidity from the Croatian state budget itself. According to that same association, the amount of credit or assistance offered will be determined by the Ministry of Finance itself according to the amount of deferred, rescheduled and written-off tax liabilities for 2019. The Ministry of Finance instructions provided for the payment of these interest-free loans to various beneficiaries in two monthly instalments. The first payments of interest-free loans were by the end of April 2020. There are not yet publicly available data on the number of applicants, approved requests and funds spent, but it can be estimated that these figures were significant.
