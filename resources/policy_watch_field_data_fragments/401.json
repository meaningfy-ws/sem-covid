Minister of Employment, Peter Hummelgaard, opens the press release about the measure by stating his condolences over a nurse who contracted the virus and died. Thus, especially mentioned are workers in the healthcare sector, who due to their work are close to infected people and therefore are at risk of infection themselves. This means that the workplace is liable for any costs related to the disease, as opposed to the individual themselves. \r\rLegal reference: VEJ nr 9210 af 21/04/2020 (G\u00e6ldende)", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure covers people who are infected by the COVID-19 during their working hours, as a workplace injury, which naturally emphasizes the healthcare sector as a particularly targeted sector, although other sectors are not necessarily excluded. \r\rIt is hard to say how much money is going to be put towards this measure, as the communication in the legal text also notes. The knowledge of the full extent of long-term effects of the COVID-19 virus is so far limited. It will also depend on how intensely sick the worker will become, which has proven to vary quite significantly. \r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Not yet known.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The Medical Association (L\u00e6geforeningen) and others pressured the government into strengthening the rules for compensation regarding the COVID-19 virus in the workplace.
