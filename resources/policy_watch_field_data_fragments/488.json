The amendments are aimed at protecting the most vulnerable groups that are likely to have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The main changes introduced by the amendments include the following:\r\r1. The property owned by individuals will temporarily not be evaluated for the purpose of granting of cash social benefits or compensations for heating, hot and cold water to deprived persons (it is a temporary measure - it will be valid from the entry into force of the Law until six months after the quarantine is over, i.e. till 16 December 2020).\r2. The amount of state-supported income (SSI), on which the right to social benefits directly depends, has been increased. In accordance with the former procedure, a person was entitled to a social benefit when income per family member did not exceed the amount of the SSI or \u20ac125. From 1 June 2020, persons with an average income per family member of less than 1.1 SSI per month (i.e. \u20ac137.50) will be entitled to the social benefit.\r3. The amount of the social benefit per resident has been increased by \u20ac50 and its amount has been differentiated depending on the length of receiving assistance. The benefit will be paid in the amount of \r\r* up to \u20ac175 (previously - up to \u20ac125) when paid for up to 6 months; \r* \u20ac150 - when paid for 6 to 12 months; \r* and \u20ac137.5 - when paid for more than 12 months.\r\r4. Criteria for granting additional allowance upon employment have been simplified: \r\r* 100% of the social benefit will be paid for the first 3 months, \r* 80% for 4-6 months, and \r* 50% for 7-12 months. \r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners (SPs) consulted only ad hoc, the tripartite meeting was not held.
