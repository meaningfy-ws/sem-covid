Another goal is to keep lending activities afloat despite the crisis. The payment moratorium for companies was one of the first measures announced by the Hungarian government, at the proposal of the central bank.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Every commercial loan or financial lease under a loan contract signed before 2020 March 18 will receive a freeze on loan repayments, capital repayment and any related fees until at least 31 December 2020 (can be extended). The length of the loan will be extended with the period of the freeze. \r\rThe Banking Association said the deferred loan payments would amount to about HUF 450 billion in the 9-month period, but our estimations based on partner interviews suggest it would be at most half of that amount.After the freeze period the loan is extended to the period necessary to keep loan payments to their pre-COVID levels and banks cannot charge compound interest either. These rules apply to any fees related to the loan, too.Based on central bank data, the measure could affect up to HUF 8,300 billion worth of bank loans at 33,000 companies.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In its June Inflation Report, the bank said that the measure was intended to help businesses\u2019 liquidity tensions. Out of a total of HUF 2,500 billion (\u20ac7.44bn) worth of loans eligible for the repayment deferral, HUF 1,500 billion worth of company loan repayments were actually deferred under the scheme by June 2020. This is estimated to be equivalent to about 6.5% of companies\u2019 annual payroll costs. The measure could have an indirect effect on employment, as companies with long-term loans employ about 1.25 million people.
