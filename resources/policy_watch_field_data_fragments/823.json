However, the share of public employees working remotely can be increased by the executives in each administration according to the spread of the COVID-19 infections in the area.\r\rThe Decree also established that all the meetings have to be organised on-line: in presence meetings are forbidden, unless there are specific and justified reasons.\rFinally, the Decree introduced working time flexibility to the personnel working in presence, in terms of entry and exit time, as a way to prevent gatherings at the entrances.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The measures have been introduced very recently: information on the application are not available yet.
