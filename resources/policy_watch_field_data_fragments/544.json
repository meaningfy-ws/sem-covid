Businesses may apply to the local branch of the National Employment Office (which acts as a state authority) for a full grant of 100% of wages for six months for employing a registered job-seeker, which is then reviewed. The candidate for the job can be stated in the application form or it can be selected (recruited) by the Employment Office. If the application is approved, the Office signs a contract with the employer which includes details and conditions about the grant. This is a _de minimis_ subsidy, so the rules of decree 1407/2013/EU apply. (Meaning that certain sectors such as export-linked sectors, farming and fisheries are excluded.)", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Businesses that apply for this subsidy will receive 100% of the wages and social contributions of the employee for six months, but they must promise to keep them on for another three months at least after the grant period at their own expense. The subsidy cannot exceed HUF 200,000 (\u20ac595) per month including social taxes. The employer must choose between two options when applying for the support:\r\r* Headcount increase: the new hire will result in an increase or be level to the existing headcount at the firm (counting part-time workers as one) on the day the application is submitted\r* Net headcount increase: the new hire must be an addition to (or stay level with) the headcount _average in the six months prior to submitting the application_, meaning that any workers laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic can be re-hired with the help of this subsidy.\r\rThe amount earmarked for this subsidy is HUF 80 billion (\u20ac238 million).", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The Ministry for Innovation and Technology announced it can help 70,000 people with the measure (calculated by expecting that most companies will apply for the maximum amount of subsidy). In May 2020, when the measure was announced, the number of those registered job-seekers in Hungary, who were in receipt of unemployment benefit or social assistance (income substitution) stood at around 160,000. In the extension of the programme launched on 15 October, some 25,000 people are expected to benefit from the measure, according to the Ministry\u2019s estimates.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No involvement", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/HU-2020-21_986.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1177", "sources::title": "NFSZ (2020) Munkahelyteremto berkoltseg tamogatas (Support for wage costs for job creation \u2013 announcement", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "05/18/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "1178", "sources::title": "Govt launches wage support programme", "sources::url": "https://index.hu/gazdasag/2020/05/18/bertamogatas_munkahelyteremtes_80_milliard_forintos_program_indul", "sources::d_date": "05/18/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "cb74450cf619279e0dea84bd925945d860daaeda29f1fc350e53cc8dc57db56b"}, {"recordId": "1235", "sources::title": "New criteria for job creation wage support", "sources::url": "https://www.portfolio.hu/uzlet/20200714/valtoznak-a-munkahelyteremto-bertamogatas-igenylesenek-feltetelei-44117", "sources::d_date": "07/14/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "5e1c7b12ed510216bd336bbac54237d5d767fcf14cb518373d27f7a0e49bf1a8"}, {"recordId": "2241", "sources::title": "Wage support programme launched", "sources::url": "https://www.kormanyhivatal.hu/hu/hirek/elindult-az-agazati-bertamogatasi-progra", "sources::d_date": "11/17/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "f9da77ef700f7fc0d47dd494b135d95b78b72feb6ef3555397f57331b50b7c1d"}, {"recordId": "2250", "sources::title": "New state subsidy for wages available", "sources::url": "https://www.portfolio.hu/gazdasag/20201015/matol-igenyelheto-a-legujabb-allami-bertamogatas-dolgozonkent-felmillio-forint-45297", "sources::d_date": "10/15/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "91fd822658286c8c5af4bbc28f8e74109515c92d1218f9698a2f462548ea86e8"}, {"recordId": "2251", "sources::title": "Details of 5-month wage support", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "10/15/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "2252", "sources::title": "Wage subsidy only droplets", "sources::url": "https://nepszava.hu/3095548_mentoov-helyett-csak-csepegtetett-munkaeropiaci-tamogatas\r", "sources::d_date": "10/15/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "475a2f0705d968b3620c34b82674a4bb7a4cca8b6416c04c4870df8c94e5b5d4"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "8", "actors::name": "Public employment service", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}, {"recordId": "35", "targetGroups::name": "Unemployed", "modId": "15"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [{"recordId": "227", "updates::d_date": "07/16/2020", "updates::description": "As of 16 July 2020, the scheme will only accept applications from the following target groups:\r\r* applicants aged 15 to 25\r* the long-term unemployed, that is, persons who have been job seekers for six months or more.\r\rThe applications received before 16 July will still be decided based on the previous criteria.
