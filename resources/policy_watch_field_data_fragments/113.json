The measure is part of the Federal Government's assistance package adopted to cushion the effects of the crisis. The rescue package also includes other changes (for the whole of the economy), such as easing tax burdens for companies improved access to loans or financial help for solo- or micro entrepreneurs.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Federal Government set up a fund entirely dedicated to start-ups that usually face greater difficulties in securing finances by traditional credit instruments. The start-up booster fund is worth \u20ac2 billion and seeks to expand venture capital financing. The government hopes that funding rounds for innovative start-ups will continue and start-ups will remain able to develop their ideas. Therefore, additional public funding will be made available for usage by public venture capital investors, such as the KfW Capital, the High-Tech Gr\u00fcnderfonds or the European Investment Fund. The general idea is that public venture capital investors will use the additional funds to fill-in for other investors that might pull out during the crisis. Small business and start-ups will also be able to profit form venture capital financing and equity replacement financing, if they do not have venture capitalists as shareholders.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The Federal Government released information on the usage of additional funds granted for start-ups on 18 November 2020: Until 6 November 2020, the KfW Capital and the European Investment Fund received 79 applications worth \u20ac1.17 billion.
