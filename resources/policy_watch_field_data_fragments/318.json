The aim of the measure is to allow the employer to make flexible changes in work conditions rather than lay off workers in the adverse economic climate of the covid-19 pandemic.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure applies to all employees working under the legal status regulated by the Labour Code (Act. 1/2012). The employer can change working arrangements, for example order remote work unilaterally. The employer may carry out any measures necessary to ensure the worker\u2019s health and safety during the pandemic. The employer and the employee can make any new arrangement by agreement even if it contradicts the provisions of the Labour Code. Some of the more important issues experienced by workers during the covid crisis are the options available to the employer for sending employees home and paying reduced wages or none at all. In human services-heavy sectors where work has become impossible, unpaid leave or \"standby\" status are common. ", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Four trade union confederations have complained in a joint call that the measure creates new kinds of \u201cdependencies\u201d for the worker, as the employer has gained too much flexibility in the arrangement of working conditions.
