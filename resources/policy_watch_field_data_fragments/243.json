The aim of the measure is to ease the financial pressure on Swedish employers, who would normally bear the economic burden for the first two weeks of an individual employee's sick leave compensation. The measure is regulated in the Act (2020:190) on changes in the Act (1991:1047) on sick pay (Lag (2020:109) om \u00e4ndring i lagen (1991:1047) om sjukl\u00f6n).", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Swedish employers are, under normal circumstances, protected against high costs for sick leave. Normally, employers are reimbursed for sick pay costs exceeding a certain share of the wage costs (maximally SEK 250 000 per year). But due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the parliament and government have decided to relieve all employers of the entire sick pay responsibility during April and May 2020. \r\rUnder the new system, employers pay out sick leave compensation as usual to their employees. They do not need to apply directly for the reimbursement but declares sick pay costs in their usual PAYE tax return for these months. The Swedish Tax Agency then forwards the information to the Social Insurance Agency, which then compensates the employer.\r\rSelf-employed persons will also be compensated in that they can receive standardized sick pay for days 1\u201314.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "All employers in Sweden are covered by this measure. It is too early to say how many will be receiving compensation, but the number is expected to be very high. ", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No information available.
