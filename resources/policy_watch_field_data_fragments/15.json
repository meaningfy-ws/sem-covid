The total amount for COVID II programme was CZK 4,000,000,000 (\u20ac145,190,563).\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure run under the Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness (Opera\u010dn\u00ed program Podnik\u00e1n\u00ed a inovace pro konkurenceschopnost, [OPPIK](https://www.mpo.cz/en/business/grants-and-business-support/opeic-2014-2020/operational-programme-enterprise-and-innovations-for-competitiveness-2014---2020--169167/). \r\rThe loan was aimed at SMEs with trade permission in Czech Republic (except of Prague region) who were forced due to approved anti-COVID-19 measures to shut down or limit their businesses. Business activity of the SME had to be included at the supported economic activities list, which was, however, very wide and included accommodation, logistics, manufacturing industry etc. \r\r\u010cMZRB secured the commercial loan up to 80% with the maximum period of 3 years. SME could also apply for financial support on the loan interest up to CZK 1,000,000 (\u20ac36,298 approx.). Loan to be secured were limited to CZK 15,000,000 (\u20ac544,465). The loans were intended to cover salaries, rent, utility costs and supplier-customer invoices. \r\rThe program was financed from the EU Structural Funds within the OPPIK and was therefore not intended for the implementation of projects in the capital city of Prague.
