The measure was adopted through a law within the framework of the labor market extraordinary and temporary measures aimed to address and limit the spread of COVID-19, with regard to the organization and the place of work (Article 4 of the Official Government Gazette A55, March 11, 2020).\rFurthermore, the circulars of the Ministry of Interior No. 108/OIK.7874/2020 and 109/OIK.8000 provide 'Special purpose leave' for the employees in the public sector. In addition, with Article 35 of Law No. 4690/30 May 2020, parent employees in the private sector are eligible to reduced working hours as it is the case in the public sector.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The working parents of preschool children, compulsory education students (under the age of 15) and children attending special schools, are entitled to use the special purpose leave during the period 11 March 2020 to 10 April 2020 and for the duration of the extraordinary and temporary measures aimed to address the spread of COVID-19. The employer is obliged to grant it. \r\rThe leave applies to employees of the public and private sector. According to the law, the minimum duration of the leave is four days, of which three days are special purpose and one day of regular leave. The regular leave days are deducted from the annual leave. The leave may be used exclusively by one parent or alternatively by both. During the special purpose leave the employee\u2019s salary and social security contributions are paid regularly. Two thirds of the expense are paid by the state and one third by the employer. \rThe utilization of the special purpose leave is not allowed in case of suspension of the operations of the enterprise due to the extraordinary measures. After the decision to extend the closure of schools until 10 May, newer arrangements (decisions of the Ministry of Labour and Interior) provide for the extension of the special purpose leave for working parents until 10 May in both the public and private sectors.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The number of employees affected by the measure is not known.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The measure was considered positive.
