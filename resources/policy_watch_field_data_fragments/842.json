Austrian Airlines, a subsidiary of the German Lufthansa, is to receive - after lengthy negotiations - \u20ac450 million worth in government aid, in order to prevent insolvency. In addition, staff are to remain on short-time work until 2022 and staff reductions (of around 1,100) will also have to be implemented (mostly via natural fluctuations, after the short-time work period, according to the airline). Furthermore, a \u20ac300 million savings package in personnel costs was negotiated between management and works council, to be implemented until 2024.\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This means that personnel will have to waive up to 15% of their wages, with expected savings of around \u20ac80 million per year. After short-time work has run out (expected in 2022), gradual wage decreases will be implemented:\r\r* Ground staff (technicians, commercial staff) will waive between two and 15% of their wages between 20 March 2022 and 31 December 2023, depending on their current wages.\r* Flight staff (pilots, flight attendants) will waive between 5.9% and 12.7% of their wages and pension fund contributions between 2022 and 2024.\r\rThis will help the airline save personnel costs in the range of 20% , according to Austrian Airlines, and allows the company to refrain from crisis-driven dismissals and retain as many staff members as possible.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "All around 7,000 employees are concerned by these wage cuts.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "This measure was negotiated and agreed upon between management and works council at the company level.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-21_1399.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Bipartite collective agreements", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1955", "sources::title": "Austrian agrees with the workforce on years of wage waiver", "sources::url": "https://www.airliners.de/austrian-belegschaft-gehaltsverzicht/55524", "sources::d_date": "05/21/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "564e4513b709e539145dfc71921e768c9ba0c5834d17db59f3f65e45429eecef"}, {"recordId": "1956", "sources::title": "Savings package: AUA reaches agreement with staff", "sources::url": "https://www.austrianwings.info/2020/05/sparpaket-aua-erzielt-einigung-mit-personal/", "sources::d_date": "05/21/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "e7156f2098f666472210bcc31cb6c434d7fb138b2eca7c5002c8520fb02cb0f9"}, {"recordId": "1961", "sources::title": "AUA saves 300 million euros in personnel", "sources::url": "https://wien.orf.at/stories/3049779/", "sources::d_date": "05/21/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "18e183b113dc8bfbb1d5fdd4769be76fb157f22a8cc5d2d383fdf7fdff5f191d"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "2", "actors::name": "Social partners jointly", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "2", "funding::name": "Employees", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "79", "sectors::code": "H51", "sectors::name": "Air transport", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1309", "modId": "17"}
