These measures caused losses in sales of several firms and their business units.

One of the most important measure in the package is Measure 3.   ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure\u00a0was adopted in order to maintain employment at the employers who were not closed compulsorily by the state but experienced losses in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Employers and self-employers, who experienced at least 10% losses in sales from\u00a013\u00a0to the end of March and 20%\u00a0in April and in the next months of 2020, can apply to the employment services UPSVaR for a subsidy\u00a0to replace the wage of employees in two forms: \r\r* **3A)** 80% wage replacement of employees, who can't work due to the obstacle on the side of the employer (maximum \u20ac880 per employee).\r* **3B)** a fixed sum for each employee based on the rate of sales losses. For instance, the minimum subsidy for April and the next months is \u20ac180 (20% - 39.99% losses) and the maximum is \u20ac540 for 80% and more losses. \r\rSince 1 October 2020, a modified Measure 3\u00a0is\u00a0available.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to the Institute of Social Policy (ISP), the largest financial support to retain employees in the firms affected by the pandemic was provided via Measure 3A and 3B. By 10 June 2020, a subsidy\u00a0was provided to more than 30,000 subjects and covered almost 588,000 employees and self-employed in March and April. The total amount of provided subsidies\u00a0was more than \u20ac154 million. The average value of the 3A and 3B subsidy\u00a0increased from \u20ac269 and \u20ac187 respectively in March to \u20ac427 and \u20ac324 in April. \r\rIn the following months, the subsidies have been decreasing. According to\u00a0the ISP (data by 30 November), during July- September 2020,\u00a0via form A and B around 12,100 employers received in average about \u20ac260 subsidy per employee.
