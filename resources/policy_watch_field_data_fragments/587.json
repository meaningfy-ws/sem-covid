Concretely, every employee who became temporarily unemployed as a result of the corona crisis receives a lump sum of \u20ac202.68 from the Flemish government for the payment of the water and energy bill. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Every employee that had to rely on economic unemployment to a certain extent is eligible for the measure. The amount of \u20ac202.68 is given automatically, without any additional actions necessary by the person struck by economic unemployment due to the COVID-19 crisis or any of the measures implemented by the government (for example: forced closure of certain businesses and sectors). The measure applies only to citizens in Flanders. The premium applies to people and not households, meaning that in a household with two adults two premiums can apply. In case of rental the premium is distributed to the tenant and not the landlord (as it is the tenant who pays the energy- and water bills of his/her property).
