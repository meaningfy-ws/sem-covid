This third package is based along three key thematic goals: continuing current support measures for enterprises and workers, stimulating investment where this is possible, and supporting adjustment to sectors and work where this is necessary. The third emergency package outlines a series of policy plans and initiatives which will be taken between October 2020 and 2022, taking a more long-term perspective.\rAs part of this second and third thematic goals, one of the plans presented is to develop and implement at National Social Package to supplement the existing measures for entrepreneurs, enterprises, workers, and sectors. The aim of the National Social Package is to provide longer term employment options and prospects to employers, workers, and entrepreneurs by capitalising on the new economic reality where possible. This National Social Package has four main areas: \r\r* Transition to new or different work\r* Stimulating youth employment\r* Re-education, re-skilling and development\r* Prevention of poverty and problematic household debt\r\rThis case describes the governmental support allocated to preventing poverty and problematic levels of household debt.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The National Social Package involves multiple measures and plans which have yet to be implemented. As it stands, the government reserves \u20ac1.4 billion for a series of actions and investments. Of this overall support allocated to the National Social Package, \u20ac150 million will be allocated to this area. The rationale here is that poverty and problematic debts prevent individuals from fully participating in society. Individuals and household vulnerable to poverty are likely to be hit even worse by the COVID-19 crisis and face larger obstacles in finding employment. To help individuals the government aims to provide better and timelier support to individuals threatened with poverty. The government will also set up a Guarantee Fund to help households and individuals to get rid of their debts more quickly.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "This measure has not yet been implemented.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "National and regional social partners were deeply involved in the design of the social package. Regional and local social partners, including local branches of the public employment service, municipal governments, educational institutes, sectoral education and training funds, and employer organisations will all be involved in helping job seekers to find work through retraining and job matching. Vulnerable groups will be supported through existing municipal and regional services and the same will apply to vulnerable youths who are looking for work.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NL-2020-40_1363.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Other initiatives or policies", "statusOfRegulation": "Not applicable"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1713", "sources::title": "Kamerbrief: Steun- en herstelpakket", "sources::url": "https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2020/08/28/kamerbrief-steun--en-herstelpakket-voor-ondernemers-en-werkenden", "sources::d_date": "08/28/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "59b5259ebe227e733f20336e6b105925aea268218fbe1922bb79813d5c9d3e62"}, {"recordId": "2016", "sources::title": "Kamerbrief: Noodpakket 2.0 Overeenkomst met Sociale Partners", "sources::url": "https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2020/05/29/kamerbrief-verlenging-noodpakket", "sources::d_date": "05/28/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "2258a3113fd77486294ce4e8ffe8404e29cc7c64ee2c9c17c00b1fb72d8849c2"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "3", "actors::name": "Trade unions", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "4", "actors::name": "Employers' organisations", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "6", "actors::name": "Other social actors (e.g. NGOs)", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "7", "actors::name": "Local / regional government", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "8", "actors::name": "Public employment service", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "77", "targetGroups::name": "Other groups of citizens", "modId": "10"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "5", "funding::name": "European Funds", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1273", "modId": "16"}
