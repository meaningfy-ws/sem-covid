To facilitate the approval of liquidity loans at favorable terms and conditions in cooperation with commercial banks and to speed up the recovery of as many entrepreneurs as possible whose operations have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 (coronavirus), necessary guarantees in the form of portfolio insurance policies (guarantees) are offered for loans intended for exporters and the tourism industry.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HBOR) for and on behalf of the Republic of Croatia, approves portfolio insurance policies (guarantees) to commercial banks and to HBOR for new liquidity loans for solving the problems caused by consequences of the pandemic COVID 19. Insurance policies (guarantees) are used as collateral for new liquidity loans approved to exporters, and as a new measure, HBOR has also enabled exporters from the tourism sector to use this benefit. This manner of insurance is available for use by indirect exporters (suppliers of exporters). Insurance policies (guarantees) allow entrepreneurs to obtain new liquidity loans more easily and more quickly with less collateral requirements. The guarantee covers a maximum of 90% of the principal of an individual loan. Losses are borne proportionally - in accordance with the amount of guarantee coverage and under the same conditions by the Lender and the Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure. Target groups and loan beneficiaries are large enterprises operating in the maritime, transport, transport infrastructure and related activities sectors facing business difficulties as a result of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "HBOR will not require the Lender to obtain special security instruments other than those that the Lender will contract under the loan agreement. In recourse collection (proceedings put into the hands of the creditor), inflows from all collateral agreed under the loan agreement will be divided between the Republic of Croatia and the Pro rata Lender in accordance with the level of guarantee coverage (maximum 90:10). Creditors / guarantees are banks in the Republic of Croatia operating in accordance with the Credit Institutions Act and HBOR.
