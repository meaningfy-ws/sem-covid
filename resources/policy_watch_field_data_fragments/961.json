The program aims at fostering the employability and the integration into the labour market of unemployed workers. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The new national program called \u201cEmployability Guarantee for Workers\u201d aims at introducing a series of active labour market policies aiming at fostering the employability and the integration into the labour market of unemployed workers. Within the EU Commission program \u201cReact EU\u201d, the Budget Law allocated \u20ac233 million to the Employability Guarantee to finance activation measures admissible according to the React EU plan. \rBy 60 days since the issue of the Law, the Ministry for Labour and Social Policies, together with the Ministry for Economy and Finance, have to present a plan specifying (art. 1 c. 324):\r\r* the active labour market policies to implement;\r* the relating beneficiaries;\r* the procedures to ensure the respect of the budgetary cap;\r* the characteristics of the services to provide; \r* the timing and the modality of provision of activation service. \r\rFurther \u20ac267 million are instead allocated to finance the relocation allowance (art. 1 c. 325), a financial support provided to support unemployed workers in their active search for a job. It is based on a voucher system: the beneficiaries receiving the vouchers can use these vouchers to buy customised and individual employment support services at any public employment centre or at private accredited centres. Unlike in the past, also unemployed workers receiving payroll subsidies, unemployment allowances or the citizenship basic income are eligible to get the relocation allowance.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The measure has been introduced on 30 December 2020.
