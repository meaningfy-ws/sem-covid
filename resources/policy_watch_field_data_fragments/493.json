The hotels and restaurants have been particularly hit by the lock down. In order to promote their economic recovery, the government proposed a series of legislative measures adopted as a result of the establishment of the state of emergency and applicable on Romanian territory. A tax relief for the payment of the specific tax was offered for the following NACE activities: 5510, 5520, 5530, 5590, 5610, 5621, 5629, 5630. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In April, the GEO 48/2020 stated that taxpayers who were previously obliged to pay a specific tax for certain economic activities for the year 2020, will be exempted for the period in which they had to interrupt the activity totally or partially, during the declared state of emergency. Such taxpayers recalculate the specific tax for 2020 by dividing the annual specific tax by 365 days and multiplying it by the number of days corresponding to the period in the calendar year in which they performed the activity.\r\rIn June 2020, after the expiry of some provisions of GEO 48/2020, the government came with another GEO (99/2020) stating that, for 2020, no specific tax is due for a period of 90 days as of the date of entry into force of GEO 99/2020. The amount due is calculated by dividing the tax by 365 and multiplying the resulting value by 275 (i.e. the difference between 365 days and 90 days). Taxpayers which have ceased their activity, in whole or in part, due to the state of emergency, can similarly recalculate their specific annual tax.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In order to benefit from the above provisions, taxpayers need to fulfill cumulatively the following conditions:\r\r\r* the taxpayers interrupt totally or partially the activity during the state of emergency and hold the certificate for emergency situations issued by the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Business\rEnvironment;\r* they are not insolvent according to the information available on the National Office of the Trade Register website.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The involvement of social partners is unknown.
