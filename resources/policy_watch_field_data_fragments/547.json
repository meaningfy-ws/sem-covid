By means of a tripartite agreement, a package of measures to save jobs and organisations was agreed and announced by the Government on 24 March 2020. Amongst the measures in this package, wage subsidies were offered to sectors which were worst hit. During a 'mini budget' announced on the 8 June 2020, which aimed to regenerate Malta's economy, Government announced that organisations which were eligible for the wage subsidy were now also eligible to apply for a rent refund. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "On the 24 March 2020, a package of measures to save jobs and organisations was announced by the Government. The most meaningful of the measures announced was the [COVID-19 Wage Supplement](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/MT-2020-13_264.html) by which employers in specific sectors were to receive a sum of money per employee, which was in turn to be passed on to the said employees. The amount of money received from the government depended on the sector with the Government dividing organisations into 'Annex A' and 'Annex B'. Those in Annex A received a larger wage supplement than those in Annex B. \r\rOn 1 June 2020, Government announced that organisations listed in Annex A and Annex B, that have been granted the Wage Supplement will now also be able to apply for a rent refund grant of up to \u20ac2,500 by submitting their lease agreements.\r\rFull details of this measure were published on 27 August 2020, this highlighted that the maximum grant of \u20ac2,500 was for those with a single premises. Those with more rental agreements (up to five) could receive a grant of up to \u20ac7,500. To be considered eligible, rent agreements must have initially been signed prior to 9 March 2020.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "A\u00a0budget of up to \u20ac50 million has been allocated for this scheme - no futher information is available. \r\rAt the end of October 2020, Government announced that Malta Enterprise had received 4,405 applications from businesses and the self-employed while there are 4,954 individual lease contracts.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "By means of a tripartite agreement, a package of measures to save jobs and organisations was agreed on 24 March 2020. This was the third but most significant package of measures announced by the Government. Following this agreement, social partners remained in direct contact with the government highlighting their proposals of what was felt was still necessary to save the Maltese economy and jobs. In view of this, on the 8 June 2020, the government announced a 'mini budget' to help the Maltese economy to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
