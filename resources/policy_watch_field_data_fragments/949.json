The scheme will initially apply for the period 1 November 2020 to 28 February 2021. Such companies will receive a standard amount per employee per day in quarantine of NOK 1000 (\u20ac96) under the following conditions: \r\r* The company must have had employees or contractors who were subjected to entry quarantine in the period for which a grant is applied for;\r* Quarantine stays carried out at quarantine hotels are not covered;\r* As an employer or client, the company must have been responsible for the quarantine stay;\r* The quarantine stays must have been carried out at a suitable place of residence in accordance with the infection control rules.\r\rThe Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund Register Centre will administer the scheme.\rNOK 480 million (\u20ac45,8 million) has been set aside for the scheme.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available yet.
