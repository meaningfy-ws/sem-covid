The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac10 billion due for repayment in October 2030 and \u20ac7 billion due for repayment in 2040.\r\rSURE is available for Member States that need to mobilise significant financial means to fight the negative economic and social consequences of the coronavirus outbreak on their territory. It can provide financial assistance up to \u20ac100 billion in the form of loans from the EU to affected Member States. SURE would provide additional EU support to finance Member States' short-time work schemes, and other similar measures, helping to protect jobs.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "There was very strong investor interest in this highly rated instrument, and the bonds were more than 13 times oversubscribed, resulting in favourable pricing terms for both bonds.\rBoth bonds were issued on attractive terms, reflecting the high level of interest. The 10-year bond was priced at 3 basis points above mid-swaps. The 20-year bond was priced at 14 basis points over mid-swaps. The final new issue premiums have been estimated at 1 bps and 2 bps for the 10-year and 20-year tranches respectively, both values being extremely limited given the amounts printed. The banks that supported the European Commission with this transaction (\u201cjoint bookrunners\u201d) were Barclays (IRL), BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Nomura and UniCredit.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Not known yet.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No direct involvement of European social partners.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/EU-2020-43_1350.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1434", "sources::title": "BUSINESSEUROPE proposals for a European economic recovery plan", "sources::url": "https://www.businesseurope.eu/publications/businesseurope-proposals-european-economic-recovery-plan", "sources::d_date": "04/30/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "e9133441935ac0235ad85c0c085a8a10c68a84a8a2e6fe2f75286c0def0ac7ed"}, {"recordId": "1435", "sources::title": "EU urged to swiftly approve 'SURE' to save jobs from C19 breakdown", "sources::url": "https://www.etuc.org/en/pressrelease/eu-urged-swiftly-approve-sure-save-jobs-c19-breakdown", "sources::d_date": "04/02/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "73d7631a01bdf6f5bde381bad80823112516d8c61f12a94ba8547c9cd7a39bb3"}, {"recordId": "1898", "sources::title": "European Commission issues first emission of EU SURE social bonds", "sources::url": "Linki  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1954", "sources::d_date": "10/14/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "HTTPConnectionPool(host='linki%20%20https', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: //ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1954 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7fe4c74ced00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name or service not known'))"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "10", "actors::name": "EU (Council, EC, EP)", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "5", "funding::name": "European Funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1260", "modId": "17"}
