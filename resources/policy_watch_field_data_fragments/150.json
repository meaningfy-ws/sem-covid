In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government adopted a \u2018temporary lay-off scheme\u2019 and reimbursement of wage compensations to workers who cannot work due to force majeure. The measure addresses laid-off workers for whom company temporary fails to provide work and workers who cannot work due to force majeure:\r \r* workers in quarantine, who cannot work from home; \r* workers who look after children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; \r* workers who cannot come to work on the grounds of the suspension of public transport or ban on the border crossing.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to the Employment Relationship Act, when a company temporarily fails to provide work for business reasons (in the event of a temporary layoff), the worker is entitled to wage compensation in the amount of 80% of the wage basis. The wage basis is determined at the worker\u2019s average monthly wage for full-time work during the past three months. On the other hand, if a worker cannot carry out his work due to force majeure, he is entitled to half of the payment he would have received if he was working, but not less than 70% of the minimum wage. The temporary laid-off worker is obliged to respond to the employer\u2019s invitation in a manner and under the conditions laid down in the lay-off letter (Employment Relationship Act, Articles 137, 138).\r\rThe measure being examined, attempting to cushion the economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, grants the employers with 80% reimbursement of the sums payed to provide the economic treatment mentioned above to workers (in case of temporary lay-off as well as force majeure). This reimbursement is funded with the state budget. Reimbursement is limited to the average monthly salary in 2019 and cannot be lower than the minimum wage (it is thus higher than statutory determined compensations).\r\rThe maximum length of receiving compensation is from 13 March to 31 May.\rTo be eligible for the reimbursements, a company had to demonstrate a 20% lower income in the first half of 2020 and 50% lower income in the second half of 2020, compared to 2019.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Companies that are not eligible are: \r\r* State institutions. \r* Financial and insurance companies with more than 10 employees. \r* Companies having outstanding debt with the Financial Administration. \r* Foreign or international organisations (not including humanitarian and disability organisations).\r\rThe Employment Service of Slovenia administers employers\u2019 requests for compensations. Up to 31 May, the Employment Service received requests for wage compensation for 275,317 employees and additional 54,168 since 1 June.\r\r\rAccording to the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities data, employers submitted 46,009 applications for wage reimbursement of 275,317 employees under the first and second emergency laws (adopted in the period from 13 March to 31 May 2020). Under the third emergency law (adopted in June 2020), employers submitted 10,930 applications for 64,667 employees. Under the fourth emergency law, there were 6,787 applications for almost 24,200 employees by 20 July 2020. Until September 2020, the government paid off \u20ac281 million to employers for temporary layoff scheme.\r\rUnlike the short-time scheme, the temporary layoff scheme this was very well accepted by employers who demanded the prolongation of this measure. It is commonly believed that registered unemployment would be much higher without the temporary layoff scheme. The registered unemployment was 9.2 per cent in July 2020, while it was 7.4% at the same time in 2019 (source: Employment Service of Slovenia).\r", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No information available yet.", "socialPartner_form": "Other", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/SI-2020-11_436.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "271", "sources::title": "Zakon o interventnih ukrepih za zajezitev epidemije COVID-19 in omilitev njenih posledic za dr\u017eavljane in gospodarstvo (ZIUZEOP) [Act Determining the Intervention Measures to Contain the COVID-19 Epidemic and Mitigate its Consequences for Citizens and the Economy", "sources::url": "http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO819", "sources::d_date": "04/10/2020", "modId": "9", "downloaded_to": "45c14f3bd2d9aa70159a8f1157fa5b9e713be157d55e8e8db0da35fd4981cc85"}, {"recordId": "300", "sources::title": "Zakon o interventnih ukrepih na podro\u010dju pla\u010d in prispevkov, ZIUPPP [Act on the Interim Measure of Partial Reimbursement of Wage Compensation], Official Gazette RS, no. 36, 202", "sources::url": "http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO818", "sources::d_date": "03/28/2020", "modId": "5", "downloaded_to": "5c96ffc0bd950da16ccf1b426cf233b7c7a6745ee3371a6b0f1b0446e3e29d7b"}, {"recordId": "301", "sources::title": "Financial Administration, 'Preglednica ukrepov' [Table of measures]", "sources::url": "https://www.gov.si/assets/organi-v-sestavi/FURS/Novice-2020/Preglednica-ukrepov-v-zvezi-z-delom-in-placevanjem-prispevkov-za-socialno-varnost-za-vase-zaposlene.pd", "sources::d_date": "04/06/2020", "modId": "8", "downloaded_to": "f2e8c51823805275218e933e0f3bf63bb6a001f24979f798fc34cbc38a59878f"}, {"recordId": "376", "sources::title": "Borut Mekina, \u2018Pravljica o mega protikoronskem paketu\u2019 [A fairy tale about a mega anti-corona package], Mladina, 10 April 2020", "sources::url": "https://www.mladina.si/197558/pravljica-o-mega-protikoronskem-paketu/", "sources::d_date": "04/10/2020", "modId": "4", "downloaded_to": "73c20240bfa0d912d1814e433e841b4c3b3c8abce536193ed484c460097c9bb0"}, {"recordId": "971", "sources::title": "Zakon o interventnih ukrepih za omilitev in odpravo posledic epidemije COVID-19 (ZIUOOPE) [Act Determining the Intervention Measures to Mitigate and Remedy the Consequences of the COVID-19 Epidemic", "sources::url": "https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2020-01-1195?sop=2020-01-119", "sources::d_date": "05/30/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "e60622860f309f35cfeb6f7c42044d9f1d266b483136a8598246bb0eb2c86078"}, {"recordId": "972", "sources::title": "M.
