This is applicable from the 13th of March. The aim of this measure is to further encourage all workers to stay at home if sick, even with only mild symptoms. Furthermore, removing the obligation to provide a doctor's note is expected to ease the pressure on the health care system. This measure is regulated in Ordinance (2020:196) concerning change in ordinance (1995:1051) on the duty to provide a doctor's certificate in sickness benefit-related matters (F\u00f6rordning om \u00e4ndring i f\u00f6rordningen (1995:1051) om skyldigheten att l\u00e4mna l\u00e4karintyg m.m. i sjukpenning\u00e4renden i vissa\rfall).\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Under normal circumstances, an employee is obliged to provide a doctor's certificate in order to prolong sick leave after the seventh (calendar) day of their falling ill. The government has now decided that the first two weeks of sick leave will require no doctor's certificate. To further strengthen this measure, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, has decided that during an interim period, sick pay can be paid until day 21 in the majority of cases, even if a medical certificate is not available. In order to make a final decision, the Social Insurance Agency may request a doctor\u2019s certificate at a later date. Anyone affected by this will be informed in due course.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "This new measure applies to all workers who fall ill, even in cases not related to COVID-19.
