If they do not meet the working requirement, they will receive labour market subsidy instead of unemployment allowance. \r\rDue to market disturbances caused by COVID-19, many workers are or will be temporarily laid off or unemployed. Many of them do not meet the original working requirement of 26 weeks and are not thus entitled to unemployment allowance.\r\rAs a result of the temporary amendments to the Unemployment Security Act, the minimum working requirement has been shortened. The requirement is now 13 weeks instead of 26 weeks (during the past 28 months). ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure applies retroactively to unemployed job-seekers who have worked at least one calendar week since March 2020 and who do not meet the original work requirement of 26 weeks. This applies to both temporarily-laid off job-seekers and job-seekers who are dismissed either due to reasons related to person or financial or production-related reasons. \r\rThe original working requirement of 26 weeks is applied to those that meet the original requirement. The shortened requirement of 13 weeks is applied to those who do not meet the original requirement. \r\rAs a result of this measure, more unemployed job-seekers will meet the working requirement. If they are members to a unemployment fund, they will receive earnings-related unemployment fund instead of the basic unemployment fund. \r\rEarning-related unemployment allowance is dependent on the wage the unemployed job-seeker has earned during the work requirement period, in other words either the past 13 weeks or 26 weeks (or more). \r\rThe average earning-related unemployment fund is \u20ac65 per working day whereas the basic unemployment allowance (and the labour market subsidy) is \u20ac34 per day. \r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date.

The measures were proposed as a package that includes both measures that support adaptation of businesses to the new market situation and measures that improve the situation of employees who have been dismissed or temporarily laid off. \r\rShortening the working requirement was part of the 15-point list suggested by the social partners. \r\rFurthermore, peak-level social partners were consulted during the drafting period of the amendment. \r\rIn May 2020, the peak-level social partners proposed to the Government that the duration of the temporary provisions, including temporarily shortened working requirement, should be extended to the end of 2020. \r\rThe peak-level social partners stress that this measure is part of the wider package of measures (proposed by them in March 2020) and amendments to labour law that include both measures that facilitate adaptation of businesses to the new market situation but also measures that support employees who are being either temporarily or permanently dismissed.
