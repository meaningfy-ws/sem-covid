Employees may be laid off when the potential of the employer to offer work to its employees has diminished (either temporarily or permanently) and the employer cannot provide the employee with other suitable work or training. Due to COVID-19, the notice period for lay-offs is shortened and during the period the temporary provisions are in force, employers need to be informed of the lay-off no more than five days before the lay-off begins. \r\rNot applicable to the following employers: the State, municipalities, KELA, \u00c5land Government, Evangelical Lutheran Church or Orthodox Church. \r\rThis measure does not involve any direct financial support but it makes adaption of workers to the new market situation easier as the right to lay-off is extended to fixed-term contracts.
