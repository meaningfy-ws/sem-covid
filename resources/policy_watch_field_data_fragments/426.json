Workers and technicians in short-time working will thus be paid 92% of their net salary, instead of the 84% provided for by the legal system. This is made possible by the solidarity of managers on partial unemployment, whose net pay will increase from 100% to 92%.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Applicable until July 3, 2020, this agreement was put in place, thanks to the solidarity of managers and an additional contribution from the company, to erase the disparities in compensation between the different categories of employees, resulting from the legal provisions and the collective agreement of the Metallurgy. The agreement brings the remuneration of all employees to 92% of their usual net remuneration. According to the President of Renault Trucks France, \"this agreement makes it possible to treat all employees fairly during this unprecedented period of crisis. It offers each employee who wishes to do so, the opportunity to approach 100% of his or her remuneration through the use of days off, while safeguarding the future of the company. In addition to the solidarity contribution of the employees, the company's contribution amounts to 8% of the payroll\". \r\rIn detail, on a voluntary basis, it is possible for all employees on short-time work to give 1.6 days for every 20 days they are unemployed to the company in order to keep their full pay. \rThis agreement also secures the maintenance of individual salary increases with effect from 1 April 2020 and the payment of the profit-sharing bonus (prime d'int\u00e9ressement) in June. The company will limit mandatory leave during the period of partial employment to a maximum of 5 days in 2020.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In total, Renault Trucks employs around 7,500 employees (excluding consultants and temporary workers) in France. The agreement applies to this entire workforce. A large majority of them are on short-time working. 700 out of 4,500 employees are teleworking.
