This presented a problem to many working parents who were also advised not to leave their children with elderly relatives who may be at greater risk to COVID-19. As many such parents now needed to remain at home with their children, a benefit was introduced by the government. Parents working in the private sector with children under the age of 16 who cannot go to work to take care of their children following the 8 March 2020, and who are unable to work from home may apply for this benefit. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Applicants must be parents of children under 16 years of age; they work full-time or part-time in the private sector (excludes  employees working with private companies who work/provide an essential service to a government entity). who cannot work from home and are not attending work after the 8th of March 2020 to look after their children. \r\rEligible individuals receive a direct payment of \u20ac166.15 Euro per week if they work full-time or \u20ac103.85 Euro if they work part time. \r\rAdditionally, their social security contribution is paid and future contributory pension rights safeguarded, children's allowance will be adjusted taking into consideration the individual's new income and therefore may increase to maximum rate (\u20ac24.08 per week per child). Individuals can continue to receive other benefits without deduction that they already may have been receiving including the 'In Work Benefit' and 'Tapering of Benefits'\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "\u20ac13.2 million have been paid out to 8,360 beneficiaries for benefits related to parents, those with medical conditions, disability and those who applied for the additional unemployment benefit. A total of \u20ac17.5 million will be handed out by the end of June. A further breakdown is unavailable.  ", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "This measure was announced by the Government as part of a second package of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement of such measures was precipitated by social partner pressure who aired their concerns publicly in the media and directly with Government. On the announcement of these measures, social partners stated that whilst the measures were beneficial, they were not sufficient. It was also stated that consultation was limited and insufficient. This changed a few days later when a third package was agreed between the social partners; the current measure was retained as part of that package too. The measure is administered by the social security department.
