However, due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions, the entry of seasonal workers to Finland has been limited since March 2020. \r\rThis raised concerns over the negative impact on enterprises in rural areas as they are often dependent on foreign labour force during the summer months. At the same time, large numbers of the domestic labour force working in other sectors has been either temporarily laid-off or unemployed and struggle finding new employment. \r\rThe Work from Finland \u2013 service is a way to connect employers located in the rural areas with unemployed or temporarily laid-off employees often living in urban areas. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In 2018, the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) established an online service called Work in Finland (in Finnish 'T\u00f6it\u00e4 Suomesta'). Since 2018, employers and job-seekers have been publishing job announcements on the website. It is possible to look for work as an entrepreneur or as a job-seeker (work with an employee-status). \r\rThe online service has been active since then but it was developed further in Spring 2020 when travel restrictions set due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid increase of labour shortage in the rural areas. MTK together with expert organisation ProAgria and interest organisation Suomen Kyl\u00e4t ry received financing from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to expand and develop the service. The organisations then established T\u00f6it\u00e4Suomesta Oy, a company that now runs the service \r\rDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the service opened a new section where people can assist each other on a voluntary basis. The service now also provides information for employers and job-seekers regarding the complementary services available for them for instance through the public employment services. \r\rThe service is free of charge for the users. No monetary support is provided. ", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "By 19 May 2020, 5,500 job-seekers and employers had registered to the service and the website had been visited 80,000 times.
