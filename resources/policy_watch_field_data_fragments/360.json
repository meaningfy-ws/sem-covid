During the economic crisis 2009/2010 some employer-alliances were set up for exchanging staff at regional level. The bilateral inter-company cooperation by McDonalds and ALDI was developed by the human ressource departments of the two companies. When the measure started Aldi was in need of 3,000 addtional workers whereas Mc Donalds' franchise companies employed 60,000 workers at risk of unemployment. As explained by McDonald's HR manager, the comapny aimed at a very fast solution and and therefore focussed on the individual transfer to another company. \rMcDonalds is affiliated to the federal association of system caterers BdS which negotiated a sectoral Corona-protection agreement with trade union NGG (see factsheet) which states that dismissals shall be avoided. \r\rAldI's staff needs are communicated to regional McDonald's companies (franchises) which offer leaves for workers who want to take up these fixed-term jobs  During the leave, wages are paid by ALDI.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No data provided.
