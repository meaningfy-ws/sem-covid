The measure has reduced financial pressure on businesses that are faced with reduced income because of the COVID -19 crisis but are still faced with significant fixed costs.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Flemish government will advance a maximum of two rental periods, provided that the landlord waives one or two months' rent. This voluntary agreement with the landlord is an interesting option: if the landlord waives two months' rent, the landlord is guaranteed payment of the rent for the next two months.\r\rPayment is made directly to the landlord, while the tenant takes out the loan. The maximum amount for the loan has been increased to \u20ac 35,000. The repayment of capital and interest only starts after six months and must be repaid 24 months after the loan has been granted. There is an interest rate of 2%.\r\rThe Brussels regional government has implemented a quasi identical measure as well. The tenant may request an advance finance payment from Brussels for the payment of a maximum of two months rent. Upon approval the Brussels regional government will pay the amount to the owner of the property. This advance is repayable (up to a maximum of \u20ac25,000) with an exemption from repayment during the first six months.\r\rThe measure has been extended to the events and entertainment sectors as well, as they are both sectors that have been struck very hard.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "There is no data available yet on the uptake of the measure with business owners.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The involvement of the social partners is unknown, as there is little to no public statement or report available from them on the measure specifically.
