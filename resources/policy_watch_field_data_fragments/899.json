The aim is to support both employees and employers in the context of the pandemic crisis.\r\rThe reduction of working time is regulated by Government Emergency Ordinance no. 132/2020 and Government Decision no. 719/2020, for the approval of the settlement and payment procedure of the amounts granted based on GEO no. 132/2020.

In addition, employees receive an allowance of 75% of the difference between the gross basic salary according to the individual employment contract and the gross basic salary for the hours actually worked as a result of the reduction in working time. The allowance is paid by the employer, afterwards settled from the unemployment insurance budget. So the impact of the measure is divided between: the state, which pays the allowance, the employer - which pays the salary corresponding to a part-time job and the wage earners - whose revenues can go down to 87.5% of normal salary.\r\rThe measure to reduce working time and corresponding salary must affect at least 10% of the number of employees in the company. The reduction in activity must be justified by a decrease in turnover by at least 10% compared to the same month of the previous year. During the application of the measure, the employer is prohibited from operating collective redundancies or hiring staff in positions similar to those of employees whose working hours have been reduced.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to the Ministry of Labour, approximately 700,000 people benefit from the new measures adopted by the Government, the budgetary impact being estimated at RON 2.4 billion.
