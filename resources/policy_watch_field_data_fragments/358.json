Other health personnel will receive a \u20ac500 bonus, he added, specifying that these bonuses will be free of charges and taxes. All of the hospital staff will also receive a 50% increase in overtime, i.e. an average of more than \u20ac600 per employee, also without taxes or charges, according to the Minister of Health, Olivier V\u00e9ran. Each member of staff will therefore receive an average of \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac2,000, he said, with a total cost to the State of \u20ac1.3 billion. In addition to this, there will be a future bonus for staff in the medico-social sector, in particular those in home for the elderly and dependent persons (EHPAD), which have had to reorganise. To launch this bonus, the government has to discuss with local authorities, particularly with the departments that often finance them, to determine the conditions for financing this bonus", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "There are about 140,000 medical staff working in Public hospital by 2017. \r\r\r", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Not applicable", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/FR-2020-18_711.html", "isOccupation": "Yes", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "621", "sources::title": "De\u0301claration de M.
