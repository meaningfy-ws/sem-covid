(VI. 12.) health-care workers received a one-off bonus of HUF 500,000 (\u20ac1,300) in the summer rewarding them for their extra effort demonstrated in the handling of the COVID-19 epidemic during the months of March to June. The funding for the measure came out of Hungary's newly set-up Covid Defense Fund, see related [case HU-2020-18/710] (https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/HU-2020-18_710.html?utm_source=externalDashboard&utm_medium=powerbi&utm_campaign=covid-19)", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The one-off bonus of HUF 500,000, pre-tax, which compares to the average monthly gross salary of HUF 367,800 or \u20ac1,009 registered in Hungary in 2019. Employers must apply to receive the bonus on behalf of their employees to the National Health Insurance Fund (NEAK) starting June 10, 2020. Eligibility is specified in a 5-page information leaflet issued by NEAK. The employers whose employees are eligible are: Hospitals, one-day clinics, laboratory service providers, dialysis centres, patient transport services, National Ambulance and Blood Transport Services. \r\rIn addition, a wide-range of health-care professions were specified as recipients of the award: from GPs and pediatricians and dentists, to school nurses and hospice workers and medical students involved in COVID-19 defense activities. The bonus is also given to part-time workers, and employees on leave, sick- or maternity leave. The recipient must have had a contractual relationship with the employer on 1 April 2020. Applications were to be received by 19 June 2020.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As HUF 101 billion (\u20ac277 million ) was earmarked for the measure which is sufficient for bonuses to 170,000 workers, including administrative assistants, business and technical support staff. The health-care trade union FESZ reported that only about 120,000 workers are expected to receive the bonus and that many would not get it despite promises that all workers in the sector were eligible.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Since there was broad agreement even outside the sector, nationally, that health-care workers must be rewarded for their extra efforts, there was not much involvement necessary from social players in the design and implementation of this measure. It was met with approval on all sides, with the caveat that it should not weaken the prolongued fight for better wages in the health-care sector", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/HU-2020-27_1213.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only public sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1588", "sources::title": "NEAK: Information on health-care workers' bonus", "sources::url": "http://www.neak.gov.hu/friss_kozlemenyek/koronavirus_kozlemeny_19.htm", "sources::d_date": "06/16/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "a5a269b633bba7bbff913b837cf1bef6e1f4fd2cd32a54c38b46539d77c36c21"}, {"recordId": "1589", "sources::title": "Govt decree 275/2020", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "06/12/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "1590", "sources::title": "Social workers on 'hunger strike' for missed reward", "sources::url": "https://nepszava.hu/3082745_ehsegsztrajkba-kezdenek-a-szocialis-dolgozo", "sources::d_date": "06/24/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "76cbd9ea2ef28f46f462eb54988d1b73078e39cc1cd5d09bbd760190c53b756a"}, {"recordId": "1591", "sources::title": "Exclusion from covid reward unacceptable", "sources::url": "https://merce.hu/2020/06/14/elfogadhatatlan-hogy-az-egyszeri-500-ezer-forintos-juttatasbol-rengeteg-egeszsegugyi-dolgozo-kimarad", "sources::d_date": "06/14/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "1e56370324c855192d2f53884a7aaf1299339f279d331807adeb4b185fd15aa2"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "11", "actors::name": "Social insurance", "modId": "1"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "118", "sectors::code": "Q86", "sectors::name": "Human health activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1123", "modId": "24"}
