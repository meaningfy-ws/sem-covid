Exceptionally, due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, that resulted in the interruption of activity of thousands of freelancers, the Government decided they shall benefit from an indemnity of 75% of the average gross salary for 2020 RON 5,429  (\u20ac1,100) during the entire state of emergency. \r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "GEO 30/2020 establishes that professionals within the meaning defined by the Civil Code, such as authorized individuals, as well as the individuals deriving incomes exclusively from copyright and related rights and the persons who entered into individual employment conventions based on Law 1/2005, who interrupt their activity as a result of COVID-19 during the state of emergency instituted by the Decree shall benefit from an indemnity of 75% of the average gross salary for the year 2020 RON 5,429 (\u20ac1,100). Similarly, trainers, athletes, masseurs, physical therapists, whose activities have been suspended during the state of emergency, at the initiative of the sports organisation, shall  benefit from an indemnity of 75% of their monetary rights, within the same threshold applicable to employees (maximum 75% of RON 5,429 RON (\u20ac1,100).
