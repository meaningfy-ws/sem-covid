These partly stem from EU rules on driving times and rest periods for the transport sector, but also affect working hours of health care staff in hospitals. The law defines exceptions to avert an immediate danger to the safety of life or human health or in the event of an emergency. In this context, the Federal Ministry for Labour, Family and Youth (BMAFJ) issued decrees clarifying exceptions to these rules.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Federal Ministry for Labour, Family and Youth (BMAFJ) issued several decrees to clarify on occupations which qualify as 'exceptional cases' according to the law. \r\rIn a decree from 4 March 2020 it is defined that hospitals are an 'exceptional case' when they treat patients or perform tests in the context of COVID-19 and when other organisational measures (such as the purchase of additional test equipment and the inclusion of additional qualified personnel) are not possible on short notice. While rules on the daily maximum working time, duration of extended service hours, maximum number of extended service hours, and maximum weekly working hours in individual weeks will not apply in these cases, the average weekly working time can only be increased with written approval by the employee.\r\rIn a decree from 16 April 2020, and applicable as of 11 April, it was also clarified that rules on driving and rest periods stemming from (EC) No 561/2006 will be adjusted. Daily driving time has been increased to 11 hours, weekly driving time to 60 hours, and the sum of driving time in two consecutive weeks to 100 hours. These changes have been approved by the European Commission.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Currently no information available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The social partners were informed and are consulting their members on the topic.", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "Informed", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-10_818.html", "isOccupation": "Yes", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Permanent measure applied "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "804", "sources::title": "Exceptional cases due to the appearance of the corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) (Au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliche F\u00e4lle wegen Auftretens des Corona-Virus (SARS-CoV-2); KA-AZG; AZG)", "sources::url": "https://www.bmafj.gv.at/dam/jcr:d8e9bb7c-5578-430e-8b34-c18b4232d3ea/Erlass_04.03.2020_.pdf", "sources::d_date": "03/04/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "5c37e6c833c5c5ed3bc6123773680efa892f83f3c425f7f03acca9c3532d3b6b"}, {"recordId": "805", "sources::title": "Exceptions to VO (EG) 561/2006, new BMK decree (Ausnahmen von der VO (EG) 561/2006, neuer Erlass des BMK)", "sources::url": "https://www.arbeitsinspektion.gv.at/Zentrale_Dokumente/Gesundheit_im_Betrieb/Erlaesse/20200237699__Ausnahmen_von_der_VO_EG_561_2006_neuer_Erlass_d.pdf", "sources::d_date": "04/16/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.arbeitsinspektion.gv.at', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /Zentrale_Dokumente/Gesundheit_im_Betrieb/Erlaesse/20200237699__Ausnahmen_von_der_VO_EG_561_2006_neuer_Erlass_d.pdf (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1123)')))"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "10", "actors::name": "EU (Council, EC, EP)", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}, {"recordId": "32", "targetGroups::name": "Particular professions", "modId": "14"}, {"recordId": "60", "targetGroups::name": "Sector specific set of companies", "modId": "12"}, {"recordId": "61", "targetGroups::name": "Companies providing essential services", "modId": "12"}, {"recordId": "78", "targetGroups::name": "Workers in essential services", "modId": "9"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [{"recordId": "34", "occupations::name": "Drivers and mobile plant operators", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "12", "occupations::name": "Health associate professionals", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "6", "occupations::name": "Health professionals", "modId": "0"}], "sectors": [{"recordId": "77", "sectors::code": "H49", "sectors::name": "Land transport and transport via pipelines", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "118", "sectors::code": "Q86", "sectors::name": "Human health activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "728", "modId": "90"}
