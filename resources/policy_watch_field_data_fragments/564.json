Thus, the deadlines for concluding collective agreements have been reduced until 10 October 2020, since the purpose of these agreements is to deal with the economic, financial and social consequences of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In order to ensure that companies act quickly to deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic, Ordinance No. 2020-306 of 25 March 2020, as amended by Ordinance No. 18044 of 17 April 2020, reduced the legal deadlines for collective bargaining for so-called \"Covid-19\" agreements, i.e. those concluded to deal with the economic, financial and social consequences of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic as well as the consequences of the measures taken to limit this spread. This provision covered agreements concluded up to 24 June.\rA new Ordinance of 17 June 2020 extends this time reduction measure to Covid-19 agreements concluded up to 10 October 2020.\rHowever, an exception is made for the provision reducing the minimum period from 15 to 5 days for organising staff consultation on a draft employer's agreement in companies with fewer than 11 employees without a trade union delegate. This measure will be repealed from 11 August 2020.\rOn the other hand, for agreements concluded until 10 October 2020, the period will remain reduced to :\r* eight days for the time limit for trade union organisations to oppose an agreement or a branch agreement of 15 days (C. trav., art. L. 2232-6), for agreements concluded as from 12 March 2020 which have not been notified to the trade union organisations by 17 April;\r* eight days, the period of one month during which trade union organisations may express their wish for consultation of employees with a view to validating an enterprise or establishment agreement signed by the employer and the representative trade union organisations having received between 30 and 50 per cent of the votes cast at the last elections (C. trav., art. L. 2232-12, \u00a7. 2);\r* five days, the period of eight days during which the trade union organisations may sign a company or establishment agreement, before it may be submitted to employee consultation (C. trav., art. L 2232-12, \u00a7. 3);\r* eight days, the period of one month within which elected representatives who wish to negotiate an agreement in undertakings of at least 50 employees without a trade union delegate and works council must make this known (C. trav. art. L 2232-25-1, para. 2).\r\rThe Ministry of Labour has also published a questions-answers circular to clarify the use of visioconference, audioconference and electronic signature in the framework of collective bargaining to ease the negotiation process during the COVID-19 crisis.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of 2 July 2020, according to data provided by the Ministry of Labour (DGT), 30 branch-level agreements and 6,848 company-level agreements have been concluded to address the COVID-19 crisis.
