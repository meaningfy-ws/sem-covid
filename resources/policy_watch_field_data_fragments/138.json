The purpose is to alleviate the economic  pressure and reduce costs related to social contributions for self-employed (and their assisting partners) facing serious financial problems. More specifically these measures allow for delays in payments of social insurances and/or reductions or exemptions from social contributions if necessary to stay afloat.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Self-employed who face difficulties due to COVID-19, may apply for the following three types of measures with regard to the payment of social contributions: \r\r1. Deferred payment and waiving the increments : the self-employed and assisting partner may submit a form to their social insurance fund to request a one-year delay of the provisional social contributions payment. This measure already applies to the provisional contributions related to the first and second quarter of 2020.\r\r2. Reduction of the provisional social contributions: The self-employed may apply for a reduction of their provisional social contributions for the year 2020 if their professional income is lower than one of the legal thresholds.\r\r3. Exemption of social contributions: self-employed may ask for such an exemption if deemed necessary.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "It is unclear how many self-employed will make use of the measure as it is upon request by the self-employed themselves.
