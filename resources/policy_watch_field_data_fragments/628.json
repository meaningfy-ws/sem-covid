In this case the parties agreed to make it possible to deviate\u00a0from the applicable notice of termination according to the sector agreement.\r ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Several important support measures\u00a0with one purpose only - to mitigate the effects of COVID-19\u00a0on working and living condition in Denmark -\u00a0were urgently passed in the parliament when it became clear that several\u00a0branches in the private sector\u00a0had to close down in order to avoid further spreading of the coronavirus\u00a0in the country. They had in common that they were completely new and that the social partners were involved in most of them - in particular measures that\u00a0aimed at preventing\u00a0severe employment effects. Thus, the participation of the social partners entirely took place at tripartite level.\u00a0The social partners did not conclude\u00a0unilateral or new bipartite agreements\u00a0with the aim solely to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 at the labour market.\r\rHowever, already existing provisions in the sector agreements were taken up again as a consequence of COVID-19. In this case a right to deviate a provision in the sector agreement stipulating the terms of notice in connection with layoffs.\u00a0DI and 3F have entered into agreements in a number of collective bargaining areas, which stipulate that companies can layoff/fourlough employees without pay when there is a shortage of work as a result of COVID-19. Most agreements have been extended so that they are valid 29 August, after which they expire. The agreements cover a number of situations in which the company's operations are suspended or undergo a significant decline as a consequence of COVID-19. According to the agreements, the companies do not have to pay wages for the hours that the employees are sent home. When conditions normalise, employees must resume their work. Thus, the agreements should be used as an alternative to a termination due to lack of work in the company. Meanwhile the employees receive unemployment benefits\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The agreements on\u00a0layoffs without pay were extended for a number of agreements, so that they are provisionally valid until and including 29 August 2020.
