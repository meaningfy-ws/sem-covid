The company has temporarily laid-off large parts of its employees. In Finland, it is possible for temporarily laid-off employees to work for another employer. Usually it is up to the employee to seek for new employment but Finnair partnered up with private healthcare providers Mehil\u00e4inen and Attendo in order to facilitate temporary re-employment of its employees.  ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Many of the employees of Finnair have previously worked in the long-term care sector or have an education related to this sector. This sector in Finland suffers from a labour shortage, especially in the capital area. Therefore, Finnair has coordinated transfer of employees to some of the largest private healthcare providers in Finland. The transfer is voluntary. \r\rDepending on their background, the transferred employees work as practical nurses, personal care assistants, or in digital services. \r\rFor the employees, this is an opportunity to learn something new and get meaningful things to do during the lay-off. In addition, it makes it easier for the laid-off employees to make ends meet as they continue to receive a normal salary instead of an unemployment allowance. \r\rAfter the lay-offs, employment at with Finnair will continue.
