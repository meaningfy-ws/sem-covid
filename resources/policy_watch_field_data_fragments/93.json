A fixed-term employment contract for a permanent seasonal job obliges employers to pay contributions for their seasonal workers throughout the year and obliges employers to offer their employees new employment contracts for the following season. According to the Act on Labour Market (OG 118/18) a permanent seasonal worker is entitled to financial assistance for a maximum of six months after termination of employment, and the employer is entitled to financial support from the Croatian Employment Service for financing contributions for extended pension insurance. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Parliament accepted the Law on Amendments to the Act on Labour Market (OG 32/20) which  prescribes the authority of the Governing Board of the Croatian Employment Service in the case of special circumstances to decide on: \r\r* prolongation of the entitlement to financial assistance for permanent seasonal workers; and \r* to enable the employer co-financing the costs of the extended pension insurance. \r\rCurrently, the Governing Board of the Croatian Employment Service has not decided about the mentioned changes. During extended insurance, the worker receives 100% of the minimum wage in the first three months (gross monthly wage in 2020 is HRK 4,062.51 or \u20ac541.67), and in the next three months 50% of the minimum wage.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Every year around 8,000 people obtain the status of a permanent seasonal worker, mostly in tourism and a smaller part in agriculture.
