Only businesses and their bookings registered with the national Tourism Data Supply Centre and made before 8 November 2020 (but pertaining to stays before 11 December) are eligible.\r\rIn addition, under the European Commission\u2019s Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support  the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak (2020/C 91 I/01), businesses are also eligible for aid to cover their expenses as \u201ctemporary limited amounts of aid to undertakings that find themselves facing a sudden shortage or even unavailability of liquidity\u201d (Section 3.1) or, \u201cMember States may envisage *contributing to the uncovered fixed costs* of those undertakings  for  which  the  COVID-19 outbreak  resulted in the suspension or reduction of their business activity.\u201d (Section 3.12).", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure applies to the following economic activities:\r\r* Hotel and similar accommodation services (NACe 5510),\r* Holiday and other short stay accommodation services (NACE 5520),\r* Camping ground, recreational vehicle park and trailer park services (NACE 5530)\r* Other accommodation services (NACE 5590).\r\rOther criteria:\r\r1.

In a second type of subsidy, businesses in the above activities may also receive grants for covering up to 70% (or 90% for small and micro companies) of their expenses in shortages of liquidity. \r\r\rFor this type of subsidy the businesses eligible are:\r\r* those not classified as ailing businesses on 31 December 2019 (or for ailing small and micro businesses if they are not subject to collective insolvency procedures and have not received rescue or restructuring aid)* those whose revenue in November 2020 fell by 30% or more compared with November 2019.\r* The overall aid should not exceed \u20ac3 million per undertaking.\r\r1. In a third type of subsidy, *temporary aid* is granted to those businesses that were not eligible for the other types of subsidy. \r\rCriteria:\r\r* those not classified as ailing businesses on 31 December 2019 (or for ailing small and micro businesses if they are not subject to collective insolvency procedures and have not received rescue or restructuring aid)* should not exceed \u20ac800,000.\r\rDecisions on the above two types of aid can be made until 30 June 2021.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "There is no information as yet on the uptake of these measures. A survey by the MKIK economic research institute found that the proportion of businesses with no financial reserves is especially high in catering (71%) and accommodation services (62%). It is estimated that out of an average of 400,000 people employed in tourism, some 150,000 have already left the sector due to COVID-19.\r\rA government official estimated that 928,000 guest nights in a value of HUF 15 billion (\u20ac41.7m) could be involved in the reimbursement programme. The bookings were made at 11,000 hotels, which is about one-third of all registered in the official system, so this is how many hotels could be getting the compensation. Many hotels, especially in Budapest, chose not to apply for the support, as they do not want to agree to a ban on laying off staff.
