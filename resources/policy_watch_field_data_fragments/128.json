All companies/entrepreneurs can apply at the local tax authority office to have their tax prepayments reviewed and lowered. This measure is part of the support package to stabilise the German economy and help out firms during the Corona crisis. \rThe package was adopted by the Federal Government at the end of March 2020.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure regards income and corporate tax. Companies, self-employed people and freelancers can ask the tax office to adjust their pre-payments. The same is possible for the measurement amount for business tax prepayments. These pre-payments are usually based on the taxpayers' income from the last year(s). With the new rules, applicants can ask for lower pre-payments as soon as they can show that their income is likely to be lower in 2020. This is part of a broader package that also includes other changes in tax law, all of them directed at easing tax burdens for companies in times of crisis; and also includes easier acces to loans, start-up support or financial help for solo- or micro entrepreneurs.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information currently available on this particular measure. However, the Federal Ministry of Finance estimated that the new tax rules will lead to a decline in tax revenues by 10% at the federal level as well as at the level of the federal states in 2020. Such a decline would equal around \u20ac64 billion. Not included in these figures are further tax losses at the municipal level.
