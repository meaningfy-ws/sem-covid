", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Government allows the entities that are beneficiaries of loans from financial institutions to suspend their payment obligations for up to 9 months, but no longer than 31 December 2020. Any individual or legal entity, be they persons, enterprises or other forms of activity (self-employed persons, family businesses) who have acquired a loan or a leasing qualify for a temporary suspension. The debtors must be in good standing, having settled their financial obligations to the date before making the request for suspension. A sworn statement must be provided by the debtors, attesting the fact that their activity has been affected by the pandemic. The legal entities must provide proof, in the form of certificates for emergency situations, obtained from the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Business. The precondition is for the entity asking for suspension to be directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic. \rThe months of suspension are to be added to the initial credit period, and the total credit period that result cannot exceed the sum of the initial credit period and the months of suspension.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Romanian banks have approximately 1,5 million retail clients and 100.000 corporate costumers.
