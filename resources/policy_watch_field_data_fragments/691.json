The regulation is in force from 22 August 2020 and allows for remote work, work in a post in which the worker does not come into contact with the public or, if this cannot happen, suspension of the employment contract of persons belonging to vulnerable groups until 30 September 2020. This Act replaced the relative previous article 2 of the law 4682/2020. With  a  new one Joint Ministerial Decision of 30 September 2020 (Article 6 of Act. No 39363/1537, FEK 4262/30-9-2020) the measure was extended until  31 December 2020.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This legislative act A.161 stipulates that workers, if they belong to vulnerable groups, will be able, at their request (by any means - telephone, computer or mobile phone message) to work remotely. The employer in turn, has to accept the request, if the work can be provided remotely.  \r\rIf the work cannot be done remotely, the employer must take all measures to ensure that the applicant worker belonging to a vulnerable group does not work in a setting that requires contact with the public.  \r\rWhere none of the above can be applied, the employer shall, as a last resort, suspend the employee's job contract until 30 September 2020. \r\rBy a joint decision of the Ministers of Labour and Health, a concept was developed which defines the vulnerable groups in regards to the consequences of the possible transmission of COVID-19 virus. In this case all required medical certificates are to be presented by the applicant worker.   \r\rIf the employer, despite the employee's request, does not respect this law, the employer shall be fined \u20ac5,000 for each infringement.\r\rWith a new one Joint Ministerial Decision of 30 September 2020 (Act.
