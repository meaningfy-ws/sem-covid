The basic percentage of employers contribution in 2020 is 25.3% of employees salary. Company size and other factors may however increase or decrease this percentage. In order to ease the pressure the outbreak of COVID-19 puts on employers and financial stability, amendment to the Employees Pensions Act and other relevant acts that temporarily decrease the employers contribution by 2.6%, have been passed. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure applies to all private sector employers. \r\rThe Government estimates that temporary deductions to employers' pension contribution will amount to  \u20ac1,05 billion.  \r\rIn order to cover for deductions made in 2020 and increase the buffer of the workpension system that is used for financing these temporary deductions, employers' pension contribution will be increased by 0,4 between 2022 and 2025. The monetary support provided with the help of this measure is thus temporary. \r\rThere is no estimate regarding how much this temporary deduction will affect the contribution of an individual employer to its employees pensions. \r\rEmployees' contribution to pension will not be affected by this measure.\r\r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information up to this date.
