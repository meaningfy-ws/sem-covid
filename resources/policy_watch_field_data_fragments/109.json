A total of \u20ac20 million would be used for it.\r\rThirdly, passenger international shipping companies will be paid a quarterly subsidy equal to the difference between the labor taxes calculated on the salary paid to the crew member and the labor taxes calculated from the tax base (1.5 or 2.5 times the minimum monthly wage).
