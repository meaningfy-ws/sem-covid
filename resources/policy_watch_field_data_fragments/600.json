Affected employers in the automotive industry, needed to respond properly to maintaining employment and restart of production.

", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "During the standard operation, the remuneration system in VW Slovakia in Bratislava includes\u00a0 bonuses based on the defined production goals, e.g. bonuses for working groups make 5-10% over the wage tariffs.

To stabilise the workforce, the management of Volkswagen Slovakia in Bratislava\u00a0and the Modern Trade Unions Volkswagen (MOV) agreed on exceptional\u00a0rules for the remuneration of employees\u00a0in the existing collective agreement.
