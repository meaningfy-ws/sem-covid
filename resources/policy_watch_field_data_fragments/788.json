Retail workers were especially exposed to catching the disease as they had to keep the businesses running as so-called \"system-critical\" workers. Other areas in the retail/commerce sector, on the other hand (like clothes stores, furniture stores,...), were severely concerned by business closures during the lock-down phase and tremendous financial losses, with many workers on short-time work or becoming unemployed.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The large collective agreement for white-collar workers in the retail sector in Austria applies to 415,000 workers and 18,000 apprentices and is a uniform collective agreement for all diverse sections of the commerce sector. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the food (and drugstore) sector generally made (large) profits, the non-food sector encountered (large) losses. These two very distinct developments had to be taken into account in this autumn's annual collective bargaining round. Similar to the metalworkers a few weeks earlier, the conclusion was reached already in the first negotiating round, foreseeing a basic wage increase of 1.5% (compensating for inflation). \rIn addition, all companies \"which can afford it\" are called upon to pay a bonus of at least \u20ac150 to their employees. According to the union, every fourth retail worker will benefit from this measure. For apprentices, which were by regulation exempt from home-schooling during the lockdown in order to work, this bonus is mandatory.\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Several supermarket chains (Rewe, Lidl, Hofer, Spar) have announced that they would pay such a bonus to their employees, also higher than the minimum amount of \u20ac150. Exact amounts and timing of the payment have yet not been announced. Some supermarkets (e.g. Rewe) have already paid their employees a voluntary bonus in spring, and support their employees now for a second time.
