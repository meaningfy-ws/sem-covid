Two rounds of wage support are introduced. First round of the scheme will apply to all employees who are taken back from redundancy at the beginning of July and August, provided that the employee was laid off from a company seeking support and is taken back in at least as high a position as before the layoff. People for whom support is sought cannot be laid off again during the support period, nor can the company lay off other employees during the period. The cash subsidy can be up to NOK 15,000 (\u20ac3,500) a month in support for each laid-off person who is taken back to work. \r\rRound two was introduced 10 September, and will apply for October, November and December. The prerequisite for receiving support is that the employee was laid off as of 31 August 2020 and will be brought back to work at the beginning of the month for which support is provided.
