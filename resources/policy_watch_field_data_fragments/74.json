The CCC employed about 520 people in the central office, branches, but also in foreign representative offices. The number of dismissals was almost 200. The reason is the decline in revenue from membership fees that have not been collected for three months, and will fall in 2021 year due to the reduction of membership fees. Therefore, the Croatian Chamber of Commerce is preparing a reorganization. For year 2020, the CCE planned revenues of HRK 233 million (\u20ac 31. 07 million), and about 70 percent or about HRK 165 million (\u20ac 22 million), should have come from the mandatory membership fee paid by all companies operating in Croatia. After the outbreak of the COVID19 crisis, the CCE decided that companies would not pay membership fees for three months. From all revenues, annually around HRK 90 million (\u20ac 12 million) was spent for employees\u2019 salaries and social contributions. The rest of the costs were material costs, organisation of trips to fairs, external services and the like. Entrepreneurs advocate that membership be voluntary, not mandatory as soon as a company is established.", "modId": "1"}], "regions": []}, "recordId": "226", "modId": "105"}
