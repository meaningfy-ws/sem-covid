The situation became even more tense after an attempted move by the government to limit the autonomy of the Social Dialogue Council (RDS), the central tripartite body see case [PL-2020-13/1158](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/PL-2020-13_1158.html?utm_source=externalDashboard&utm_medium=powerbi&utm_campaign=covid-19). \r\rIn late summer the climate started to improve somewhat see case [PL-2020-10/1378](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/PL-2020-10_1378.html?utm_source=externalDashboard&utm_medium=powerbi&utm_campaign=covid-19) and in late September RDS met for the first time in several months, which resulted in a series of bipartite (employee and employers sides, no government) resolutions on vital issues of the body's interest in the current situation.  \r\rThis entry is about the Resolution no. 91. The Resolution expresses disapproval for the intended changes to fiscal regulations on PIT and CIT pushed through by the government without proper social consultation.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Resolution 91 does not include any specific postulates, as its main purpose is to protest against governmental plans which are described as violating the fundamental rules of social dialogue by using tactics of a \"last-minute throw in\", so that in procedural terms the process is conducted properly but social partners are de facto left with no time to react. \rAs stated in the Resolution the protest \"is due to the fact that the employees' side and the employers' side are prevented from expressing their opinions to the draft within the statutory deadline. [...] The employees' side and the employers' side of the Social Dialogue Council had only two working days to express a position on a very important project with far-reaching business and financial implications for employers and employees. The draft envisages, inter alia, taxing tens of thousands of limited partnerships and some general partnerships with CIT, cancellation of the abolition relief or obligating largest companies to make their tax strategies publicly known\".", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The bipartite resolutions have declaratory power and symbolic meaning only, as government does not have to acknowledge any postulates of social partners expressed in such form.
