The measure was designed to make working arrangements more flexible for the employer to help protect jobs in companies where business has shut down or work reduced due to the pandemic.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The new measure states that the rules of the Labour Code capping the working time banking period at 4 months (or 6 months in some professions) will now not apply. The Labour Code (modified in late 2018) earlier allowed the working time banking frame to be raised to 36 months only by collective agreement. Now employers can use this method of working time arrangement for up to 24 months without signing/modifying a collective agreement. This means that an employer who is unable to give work to the employee during the pandemic period will continue to pay full wages, but can order extended working hours to make up for the loss when business returns to normal.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "There are about 50 companies known to have taken advantage of this measure and extended working time banking due to COVID-19. These include 42 electronics, metal, machinery and car manufacturers. The Vasas union noted that this means in some places when business returns to normal after the pandemic slowdown, working time could grow to 10-12 hours a day, with no paid overtime and workers could only have one Sunday off in a month. Vasas was only able to be involved in negotiations about working time banking changes at one company, as trade union involvement, by the new law, is not compulsory. The trade union VDSZ said the measure was used mainly by the auto industry. The were involved in talks at six companies.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "MGYOSZ was part of the covid defence action group (financial section) where it had the opportunitiy to put forward proposals for covid defense measures, however, the nature of these consultations did not feel genuine, according to interviews with partners.\rThe Permanent Consultation Forum of the Private Sector and the Government (VKF) meets regularly with employer and employee representatives both present, as well as the government, but trade unions also reported that no genuine consultation takes place there, only information is exchanged.", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "Informed", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/HU-2020-17_722.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "533", "sources::title": "Government decree 47/2020 (EN)", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "03/18/2020", "modId": "4", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "643", "sources::title": "Government decree 104/2020", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "04/25/2020", "modId": "2", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "644", "sources::title": "Emergency state: deviating from Labour Code", "sources::url": "https://ado.hu/munkaugyek/veszelyhelyzet-csokkentett-munkaidos-foglalkoztatas-es-elteresek-a-munka-torvenykonyvetol", "sources::d_date": "04/14/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "2a713601cb70c5de171ad6758bc892b5b8039b3ae599d024074b5acf5fc885eb"}, {"recordId": "1473", "sources::title": "Act 58/2020 on state of pandemic emergency", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "06/16/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "1474", "sources::title": "VDSZ: Regional government office to decide on working time banking", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "06/18/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "1735", "sources::title": "Trade unions: New draft is like 'slave law 2.0' for workers", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "03/26/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "1736", "sources::title": "MASZSZ: The government is crushing the 200-year-old achievements of unions", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "04/15/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "1737", "sources::title": "Unions: Slave law seen as magic but will have dire consequences", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "07/02/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "3", "actors::name": "Trade unions", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "1", "funding::name": "Companies", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "632", "modId": "104"}
