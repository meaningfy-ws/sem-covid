P. (Institute of Housing and Urban Rehabilitation) was created.

The financial support, under the form of a loan, was approved to be in force during the State of Emergency and the following month.\r\rTenants can ask for an interest free loan to support the difference between the monthly rent and a maximum effort rate of 35% of the household income, allowing them to pay the rent. The outstanding income cannot be inferior to the Social Support Index. \rLandlords who have demonstrated reductions in their household income above 20% of the previous month, and whose tenants did not make use of the IHRU loans (see above), can request an interest free loan to compensate the monthly rents that have not been paid, if the available household income diminishes below the Social Support Index for that reason.   \r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Information not available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Tripartite consultation involving the government, the trade union confederations CGTP and UGT and the employer confederations CIP, CCP, CTP and CAP at the Standing Committee for Social Concertation.\r", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/PT-2020-14_978.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1147", "sources::title": "Resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do Conselho de Ministros n.\u00ba 40-A/2020", "sources::url": "https://data.dre.pt/eli/resolconsmin/40-A/2020/05/29/p/dre", "sources::d_date": "05/29/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "ce0e4cd99329ced4c7b8d53b8222f929ba51e650275c70bd816a48795b5928d8"}, {"recordId": "1240", "sources::title": "lei 17/2020", "sources::url": "https://dre.pt/web/guest/pesquisa/-/search/134762424/details/maximized", "sources::d_date": "05/29/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "b83c8bfcc5fc43bd695ac6de25881ac0c13c1baccb397f636ab412febc5f2476"}, {"recordId": "1241", "sources::title": "Lei 4C/2020", "sources::url": "https://dre.pt/pesquisa/-/search/131193441/details/maximized", "sources::d_date": "04/06/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "52c687e46f170934a8146d41ddc3bf92027a114901579238150b4ed5c18d8fb8"}, {"recordId": "2606", "sources::title": "Decreto-Lei n\u00ba 106-A/2020 ", "sources::url": "https://dre.pt/application/file/a/15263971", "sources::d_date": "12/30/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "cd1e5cf17132683c7aa9e4fb97e986dacc2eb861ba1f61aa30a062ff00a6b9a4"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [{"recordId": "633", "updates::d_date": "12/30/2020", "updates::description": "Decree-Law 106-A / 2020 of 30 December amends exceptional and temporary measures relating to the COVID-19 disease pandemic.\rThis Decree-Law proceeds to the fourth amendment to Law 4-C / 2020, of 6 April, amended by Laws 17/2020, of 29 May, 45/2020, of 20 August, and Law 75-A / 2020, of 30 December, which establishes an exceptional regime for situations of delay in the payment of rent due under the terms of urban housing and non-housing lease agreements, within the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic.\rWith the amendment of articles 3, 5 and 14 of Law 4-C / 2020, the support scheme for the payment of rent is extended until 1 July 2021 and changes to this exceptional and temporary regime are introduced in view of the effects of the COVID-19 disease pandemic.
