They are spending several weeks there, cut off from the outside world, to prevent infection with all possibilities. All workers had been medically tested before isolation. \rThese employees are to move in when no one else can. The tasks range from system control to maintenance and minor repairs. At the same time, operations at the locations continue as normal. \r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "To make this isolation possible, residential containers were set up at power plants and waste incineration plants. In addition, provisional power plant controls were set up or conference rooms converted into dormitories, as Wien Energie wrote in the company blog . There is also a supply of food. In addition, they offer occupational psychological support.\rShift plans were adjusted according to emergency plans in the areas critical for the supply (e.g. power plants, waste incineration plants, control centers and waiting rooms). No workers who are not required for operations are allowed on the factory premises. As far as possible, work for other employees is to be provided in the home office. Precautions have been taken for possible quarantine cases. Certain areas of the plant, such as crane systems in the waste incineration plants, could be operated in part automatically.
