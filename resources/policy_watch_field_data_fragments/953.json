Especially many citizens are affected in The North Denmark Region (North Jutland) and the Capital area. It places extraordinarily high demands on the professional organisations, employers and authorities to work closely together to ensure that dismissed employees return to employment quickly.\r\rThe measure is part of the Finance Act on 6 December 2020 between the Government and the other political parties constituting the Government's parliamentary basis.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "With the Finance Act on 6 December 2020, the Government have allocated 50 million DKK for an increased training and qualification effort in the areas that have been particularly hit hard by the pandemic. These are North Jutland and the Capital area. \r\rWith the money, special temporary training initiatives will be set up for particularly affected municipalities, and several VET-coordinators will be hired to ensure that the workforce is quickly ready to take jobs in other industries.\r\rIn the two areas, special temporary training efforts will be launched during the spring of 2021. The training initiatives will be implemented as initiatives for defined groups of those affected, for example employees in individual companies or industries. The efforts will be particularly targeted at skilled and unskilled workers, but may also include citizens with a higher education who want retraining for new professions.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Unknown", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No involvement", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/DK-2021-14_1670.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Not applicable"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "2481", "sources::title": "Finance Act", "sources::url": "https://fm.dk/media/18311/aftale-om-finansloven-for-2021-og-aftale-om-stimuli-og-groen-genopretning.pdf", "sources::d_date": "01/07/2021", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "62ac0dbd9bb66a2e6fd7333850336a1a2e48bcbee7db0ab7bb703c7874be8df5"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": [{"recordId": "1953", "regions::countryCode": "DK", "regions::level": 2, "regions::name": "Hovedstaden", "regions::nutsCode": "DK01", "modId": "5"}, {"recordId": "1967", "regions::countryCode": "DK", "regions::level": 2, "regions::name": "Nordjylland", "regions::nutsCode": "DK05", "modId": "5"}]}, "recordId": "1580", "modId": "23"}
