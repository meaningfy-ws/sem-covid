The aim of the programme is to support innovative **companies with high added value** and to help the economy recover quickly after the crisis. It targets start-up and fast-growing companies active in **key areas** such as:\r\r* innovation, \r* digitalisation \r* bio-and nanotechnology\r* mechatronics\r* robotics\r* clean and information technology\r* pharmacy \r* fintech_ and others. \r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The total budget amounts to BGN 120 million (\u20ac60 million) and it is co-financed by European Funds.\r\rInvestments through equity instruments in four **venture capital funds**. The amount of investment varies in a wide range with different intermediaries and according to the stage of development of the companies.\r\rThe average value is \u20ac400 000 in the form of equity investments, investments in the capital of the companies or convertible debt, in exchange for which the investor receives the right to acquire a share in the capital of the company under certain conditions. Most of the investments are aimed at financing the company's growth potential, as well as current costs related to the development of the main product or activity.\r\rGiven the fact that startups and fast-growing companies are facing challenges that have not been foreseen so far, the Fund's efforts are focused mainly on further facilitating and accelerating this type of investment.\r\rMore information about mutual funds is available on the website of the Fund of Funds, as well as on the websites of the respective intermediaries - Innovation Accelerator Bulgaria, Vitosha Venture Partners, New Vision 3, Morningside Hill.\r\rStartups and innovative companies can apply depending on the stage of development and the amount of investment required and must have a presentation of the business, team and growth potential, business plan, analysis and financial forecasts. The funds review the documents, approve and make the investments.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "A limited number of companies can benefit from the measure.
