Many artists working in the cultural sector are solo-self employed and therefore do not qualify for other income support measures. The Bavarian government therefore introduced measures not previously introduced by the Federal government to support the cultural sector.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "For solo artists, the Bavarian Council of Ministers has decided on a new aid program for solo artists up to \u20ac90 million. It is intended to register up to 30,000 solo artists insured in the artists' social security fund who have not previously been included in the COVID-19 emergency aid program. They will receive \u20ac1,000 per month for three months if their ongoing income is insufficient to ensure their livelihood due to the corona pandemic. The Ministry of Science defines the exact funding principles. The program is handled by the district governments and the state capital of Munich.\r\rFor state-sponsored non-governmental art and cultural institutions, including singing and music schools, considerable 'corona-related' loss of income / consequential costs can be expected. The Bavarian Council of Ministers has therefore planned 10 million euros to compensate for hardships at these facilities. Over 300 institutions can benefit from this.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Currently no information available, however demand was likely high, as the budget for the measure was further increased in May 2020.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No involvement of social partners known.", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/DE-2020-17_855.html", "isOccupation": "Yes", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "868", "sources::title": "Information about the new aid program for self-employed artists (Informationen zum neuen Hilfsprogramm f\u00fcr soloselbstst\u00e4ndige K\u00fcnstlerinnen und K\u00fcnstler) - Bayerisches Staatsministerium f\u00fcr Wissenschaft und Kunst", "sources::url": "https://www.stmwk.bayern.de/allgemein/meldung/6504/informationen-zum-neuen-hilfsprogramm-fuer-soloselbststaendige-kuenstlerinnen-und-kuenstler.html", "sources::d_date": "05/14/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "89bd628f04c4d0d6d91c5b15a457d6455ed0fd3404f005ccba00dca4dc21da1b"}, {"recordId": "869", "sources::title": "Report from the cabinet meeting (Bericht aus der Kabinettssitzung)", "sources::url": "https://www.bayern.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200421-ministerrat.pdf", "sources::d_date": "04/21/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "150ca898ffc1a3b749f6bb4edde80f437e0b47fa6f2e830a5c647b62c1b67acc"}, {"recordId": "1762", "sources::title": "Corona aid for artists", "sources::url": "https://www.stmwk.bayern.de/allgemein/meldung/6504/informationen-zum-neuen-hilfsprogramm-fuer-soloselbststaendige-kuenstlerinnen-und-kuenstler.html", "sources::d_date": "06/16/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "89bd628f04c4d0d6d91c5b15a457d6455ed0fd3404f005ccba00dca4dc21da1b"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "7", "actors::name": "Local / regional government", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "55", "targetGroups::name": "Solo-self-employed", "modId": "16"}, {"recordId": "63", "targetGroups::name": "One person or microenterprises", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "8", "funding::name": "Regional funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [{"recordId": "10", "occupations::name": "Legal, social and cultural professionals", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "14", "occupations::name": "Legal, social, cultural and related associate professionals", "modId": "0"}], "sectors": [], "updates": [{"recordId": "32", "updates::d_date": "05/14/2020", "updates::description": "The measure was extended to include further groups of cultural institutions, such as cinemas, and the budget was increased by an additional \u20ac90 million (see source dated 14 May 2020).", "modId": "6"}, {"recordId": "353", "updates::d_date": "10/09/2020", "updates::description": "In May 2020, the programme\u2019s budget was increased to \u20ac140 million. \rThe measure has run out on 30 September 2020, with no information on a possible extension.
