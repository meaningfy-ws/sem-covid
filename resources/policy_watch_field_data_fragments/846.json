The companies TARON and Blue Air, which have 2,900 employees (as of 30 March 2020) are unable to continue their activity, due to the lack of financial resources necessary to make current payments, so that the transport activity can be carried out safely and securely. A possible closure or restriction of the activity of the two companies could bring to the state budget bigger losses than the requested state aid, in the next three-five years. This aid - authorised by the European Commission - will help companies to continue their activity and avoid the dismissal of employees.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The companies TAROM - Romanian Air Transport (\u201eCompania na\u021bional\u0103 de transporturi aeriene rom\u00e2ne - TAROM\u201c) and Blue Air Aviation benefit from state-guaranteed loans, through the Ministry of Public Finances, amounting to up to RON 300,775,000 (\u20ac62 million. \u2013 for Blue Air) and, respectively RON 312,744,200 (\u20ac64.2 million. - for Tarom), in order to cover the losses generated by the pandemic (on a six year time period). The value of each loan should not exceed the (estimated) losses suffered by each company due to the pandemic. The loans should be granted before 31 October 2020. The provider of state aids is the Ministry of Finance and their administrator - the Ministry of Transport.\r\rFor the same purpose, five Romanian regional airports (from Cluj, Iasi, Sibiu, Bacau and Craiova) are to receive a financial aid from the state, in a total amount of RON 22.28 million (\u20ac4.58 million.), to cover direct losses caused by the pandemic.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "This measure will benefit two airlines, one with state capital, another with private capital, which have 2,900 employees (on 30 March 2020).", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The involvement took place within the Economic-Social Council, a tripartite body with a consultative role, which assists the activity of the Government and the Parliament.
