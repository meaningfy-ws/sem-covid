Due to recession following COVID-19, employers are facing a decline in business, poorer liquidity and higher costs due to the necessary adjustments to safe work processes. This circumstances are especially burdensome for the employers employing people with disabilities. They also face greater absence of employees and other uncertainties due to employing most vulnerable groups of workers. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "From 1 June 2020, the 10% higher wage subsidies can be claimed by social enterprises, employment centres and other employers of the people with disabilities, that are entitled to a wage subsidy at the Public Scholarship, Development, Disability and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia (SRIPS Fund) in accordance with the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment of Persons with Disabilities Act (Zakon o zaposlitveni rehabilitaciji in zaposlovanju invalidov - ZZRZI).\r\rAccording to the ZZRZI people with disabilities are entitled to different percentage of wage subsidy, depending on the assessment and proposal of the occupational rehabilitation provider (40% to 70% of the minimum wage in protected employment and 10% to 30% in supported employment and in social enterprises). Minimum gross wage in Slovenia in 2020 is \u20ac 940.58.\r\rThe ZIUOOPE contains one restriction: even after a 10% increase in the subsidy, the total amount of all subsidies may not exceed 75% of the wages of the workers with disabilities.\r\rThe total value of this measure is estimated at around \u20ac1 million (1 June 2020 - 31 December 2020). Higher subsidies are not financed from the budget of the Republic of Slovenia, but from the contributions collected by the SRIPS fund and paid by employers who do not meet the statutory employment quotas for the workers with disabilities. \r\rThis measure is expected to be valid until the end of 2020. However, in the latest draft of anti-COVID-19 legislation (Government proposal of the Act on interim measures to mitigate and eliminate the effects of COVID-19, 29 September 2020), the government is proposing to extend the measure for six months, but only if the SRIPS Fund will have enough funds from contributions.
