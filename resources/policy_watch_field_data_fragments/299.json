But of course artists also have access to the entire range of support. We want to prevent people from losing their jobs, their income and at all costs everyday life can no longer afford. Nobody should be left behind.'_ explains State Secretary for Art and Culture Ulrike Lunacek on the unprecedented situation, which is very challenging for the entire art and culture business.\r\rThe federal government's mix of measures to combat the effects of COVID-19 includes a range of support for the cultural sector. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "An overview of measures for artists is available on the [Federal government's page:](https://www.bmkoes.gv.at/Themen/Corona/Corona-Kunst-und-Kultur.html)\r\rIn addition to the general support measures set by government (for example, the [Corona short time work scheme](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-10_229.html) or the [hardship fund for self-employed](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-13_212.html)), the page also lists specific funds which are only available for artists.\r\rThis includes, for instance:\r\r* COVID-19 fund for artists and intermediaries ('Kulturvermittler');\r* All artists who are not eligible to apply the hardship fund of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce can bring an application to the KSVF (Artist Social Insurance Fund) from 30 March 2020. \r\rThe support is intended to compensate for the loss of income caused by closings and cancellations. \r\rThe KSVF's COVID-19 fund is endowed with up to \u20ac5 million and is intended to ensure rapid aid. In addition to artists, cultural mediators can now apply for this grant. The amount paid out by the KSVF corresponds to that of the hardship fund. The fund consists of two phases:\r\r* in the first phase \u20ac1,000 are paid as emergency aid (until 2 July 2020), \r* in the second phase (starting on 10 July 2020), a one-time payment of \u20ac3,000 is paid (amount received from phase one is deducted)\r\rA separate service page has been set up for loss of income due to the Corona measures: KSVF service fund.\r\rIndividual funds run by copyright collecting societies (e.g. music, visual arts, film-making, etc.). Seven dedicated funds are also listed on the webpage.\r\rIn addition to the state instruments for compensating artists' loss of income, there is now also a private initiative. To help artists in the current crisis, foundations have joined together to form the \"Foundations Help Artists\" initiative and are supported by well-known people.\r\rWork grants from the City of Vienna due to COVID-19: Since the end of March, freelance artists and freelance scientists with their main residence in Vienna have been able to apply for one-time work grants of up to \u20ac3,000. In this crisis situation, there should be the opportunity to continue to pursue artistic and scientific activities (project development, reading, exhibition and lecture preparation and the like).", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Since 10 July 2020, 1,147 persons could be supported by the KSVF's COVID-19 fund with \u20ac2.714 million, and together with the emergency aid, \u20ac4.846 million have already been paid. The initially planned \u20ac5 million from the COVID-19 Fund has been exhausted, taking into account the still open applications.
