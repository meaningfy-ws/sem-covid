To provide equivalent relief to sole traders, a reduction of individual contributions was also introduced. This measure can also be used by companies that receive short-term work allowance, new-start job subsidies and other types of financial support from the central government.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The temporary reduction in employers' social security contributions means that employers are now only obliged to pay the old age pension contribution (\u00e5lderspensionsavgift) (10.21%). This reduction applies to up to 30 employees and on that portion of the employee\u2019s wage that does not exceed SEK 25,000 per month. This entails tax relief of up to SEK 5,300 per employee and month. To provide equivalent relief to sole traders, a reduction of individual contributions has also been introduced. The proposal\u2019s cost to public finances are estimated to SEK 33 billion.\r\rThe rules came into force on 6 April. But if tax returns were submitted before then, a new one can be submitted to receive the reduction.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As all companies can benefit from the reduction for up to 30 of their employees and the reduction is applied for (almost) automatically, the use of the measure is expected to be widespread.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No information available.
