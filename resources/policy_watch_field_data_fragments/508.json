Under the BBLS, businesses will be able to apply for quick and easy-to-access loans between GBP 2,000 and up to 25% of their turnover; the maximum loan available under the Scheme is GBP 50,000. No loan repayments are required for the first 12 months and the government will cover the interest repayments for the same period.\r\rFor those businesses seeking more than GBP 50,000, BBLS is intended to sit alongside the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).   Under CBILS, a participating lender can provide up to GBP 5 million in the form of term loans, overdrafts, invoice finance or asset finance.  Both schemes are operated by the British Business Bank, through accredited lenders\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The scheme helps small and medium-sized businesses to borrow between GBP 2,000 and up to 25% of their turnover. The maximum loan available is GBP 50,000. The government guarantees 100% of the loan and there are\u00a0no fees or interest to pay for the first twelve\u00a0months. After twelve months, the interest rate will be 2.5% a year.\r\rAn SME can apply for the loan if the business: \r\r* is based in the UK\r* was established before 1 March 2020\r* has been adversely impacted by the coronavirus.\r\rSMEs from any sector can apply with the exception of banks, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers); public-sector bodies and state-funded primary and secondary schools. \r\rIf a firm is\u00a0already claiming funding under the CBILS (a loan of up to GBP 50,000), then this can be transferred into the Bounce Back Loan Scheme. Businesses have until the 4th of November to arrange this with their lender. \r\rThe loan will run for six years\rThe length of the loan is 6 years, but businesses\u00a0can repay early without paying a fee.
