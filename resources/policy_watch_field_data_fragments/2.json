Also the costs for issuing the bank guarantees (1% administration fee and 0.8% recurring provision) will be covered by the state. The financial measures are administered by the specialised Austrian Bank for Tourism (OHT).\r\rIn addition, some regional states (Bundeslaender) have declared they they will support companies by taking on the payment of interest on the loans and some banks have announced they will keep interest rates low (at 1%). The administrative application has been simplified via an online form.\r\rFor companies which were already holding loans from the OHT bank (so called 'TOP-tourism-loans'), the repayment of the outstanding capital can be stopped during 2020 upon application.\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "\rSince 11 March 2020 (until 31 March), 4,000 requests for support were received and by 26 March, more than 150 bank guarantees, with a volume of \u20ac32.5 million had been drafted.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The social partners were consulted.", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-10_213.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "62", "sources::title": "State support for Tourism", "sources::url": "https://orf.at/stories/3159574/", "sources::d_date": "03/27/2020", "modId": "5", "downloaded_to": "8f4377c070efb0739776b03f238de8a03e263fd12a79c7a08e26ae91e06c4140"}, {"recordId": "63", "sources::title": "Package of measures for tourism (Ma\u00dfnahmenpaket f\u00fcr den Tourismus)", "sources::url": "https://www.bmlrt.gv.at/tourismus/corona-tourismus/corona-ma%C3%9Fnahmenpaket.html", "sources::d_date": "03/30/2020", "modId": "7", "downloaded_to": "beb29fd1b9ae14ae4c2fe2dcbfaee950d5bf6a928e680e3721b2717790160057"}, {"recordId": "64", "sources::title": "WKO information on Tourism package", "sources::url": "https://www.wko.at/service/coronavirus-ueberbrueckungsfinanzierung.html", "sources::d_date": "03/31/2020", "modId": "6", "downloaded_to": "f2bfe7120d20de99e67855a7fe64129d7fa756044ae292029676fdfc46fa9640"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "12", "actors::name": "Public support service providers", "modId": "1"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "60", "targetGroups::name": "Sector specific set of companies", "modId": "12"}, {"recordId": "62", "targetGroups::name": "SMEs", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "83", "sectors::code": "I55", "sectors::name": "Accommodation", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "84", "sectors::code": "I56", "sectors::name": "Food and beverage service activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "125", "sectors::code": "R93", "sectors::name": "Sports activities and amusement and recreation activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "96", "modId": "117"}
