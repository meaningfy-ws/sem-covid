For business that were not active in the previous year, the basis of comparison will be the months proceeding March 2020. The Scheme is in accordance with Decree 131 Law 27(1) 2020 'Emergency Measures taken by the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurances for the Confrontation of the Pandemic of Coronavirus COVID 19'.  \r\rOn Wednesday 8 April, the President of the Republic announced the decision of the Cabinet to extent the measure up until 12 June 2020. Currently, the Ministry of Labour undertakes a legal and technical processing of the measure. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The basic requirement for participation in the scheme is that no employee has been fired. Business participating, in addition, should not dismiss any employee during the participating period, during an additional month equal to the period of participation and plus one additional month. \r\rBusinesses up to 50 employees may join the scheme by declaring the 75% of their total number of employees to receive the special unemployment benefit. Similarly, businesses employing more than 50 employees may declare  60% of their total number of employees. \r\rThe maximum amount for a period of a month may not exceed \u20ac1,214. \r\rOn the 23 April 2020, the Cabinet amended the calculation of the payable amount to the beneficiaries in order to support as many employees as possible. The insurable earnings of the year 2018 will be taken into account, but in addition, a comparison will be made based on the declared salary of January 2020. The payable amount will be the highest amount that results from this comparison.  \r\rAdditionally, a minimum payable amount of \u20ac356 has been defined for beneficiaries. Also, a special plan will be implemented for employees who first started work in February and March 2020.\r \rAn additional amendment to the scheme is the inclusion of persons over 65 years of age who do not receive statutory pension and continue to work. \r  \r \r\r\r ", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Currently, there is not an estimation for the beneficiaries of the scheme.
