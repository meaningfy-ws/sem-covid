", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure is available for workers who have been confirmed having COVID-19  (or other infectious disease that poses danger to public health). Furthermore, employees who suspect they may have COVID-19 may apply for this allowance for the time they visit doctor and/or visit test results.  \r\rThe disease carriers allowance is available to all workers, including the currently unemployed (who are searching for work) and the self-employed. It is however not a replacement for the regular sickness benefit. If an employee is too sick to work, their employer would normally pay for the first two weeks of the disease, and then the public insurance agency. It can instead apply to those employees that do not get symptoms, or get mild symptoms and who otherwise would go to work.\r\rEligible employees receive approximately 80% of their salary. The maximum amount is SEK 804 (\u20ac80) per day. In addition, employees may receive compensation for travel costs (e.g. visits to the hospital).  \r\rThis allowance is paid out by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. \r\r\r\r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available.
