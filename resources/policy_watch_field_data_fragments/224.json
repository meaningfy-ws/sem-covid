As a result of this, temporary amendments to the Unemployment Security Act and other related Acts have been made. These amendments remove the waiting period in the sense that job-seekers will receive benefits from day one of the unemployment period. During this period, the state will cover for the expenses (after the waiting period unemployment funds will cover parts of the earnings-related unemployment allowance of their members). \r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure applies to all job-seekers. As for usual, persons who are laid off temporarily or dismissed (either for personal reasons or financial or production-related reasons) need to register with the TE-services as unemployed job-seekers on the first day of the lay-off or unemployment period. \r\rAlso during the waiting period the amount of financial support is dependent on whether the job-seeker is a member of an unemployment fund and meets the specific criteria (temporary changes due to COVID-19 has been made) and can apply for earnings-related or basic unemployment allowance or not. Those who do not qualify for earnings-related or basic unemployment benefit receive labour market subsidy. \r\rThe temporary removal of the waiting period applies to cases where the waiting period has started between 16 March 2020 and 7 July 2020.
