It provides daily updates ('Everything you need to know today)'; links to previous webinars; facilities for future webinar registration; an overview of the CBI's political engagements/campaigning/lobbying activity focused on the coronavirus outbreak; a facility for businesses to comment and 'get involved'; links to a number of factsheets; links to case studies of how other businesses have responded.\r\r\rAmounts spent on creating resources are unspecified.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Uptake unknown; no publicly-available\u00a0evaluation data provided on number of visits/site usage.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The initiative has been designed and implemented by the CBI.
