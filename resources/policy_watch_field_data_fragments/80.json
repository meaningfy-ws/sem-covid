Due to the decrease revenues of mandatory payers of contributions for common forest functions, the government proposed different use of mentioned fee in the Law on Amendments to the Forest Act published in the Official Gazette no. 32/20. According to new article  (Article 68a) funds for compensation for common forest functions can be used to eliminate or mitigate the consequences caused by special circumstances or events or a certain condition that could not be predicted and could not be affected, which threatens the life and health of citizens, property higher values, significantly disrupts the environment, disrupts economic activity or causes significant economic damage.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Forest Public Benefit Function Fee is paid by companies and other business associations once a year.
