The derogations were allowed for a 30-days period. According to the decree, the COVID-19 crisis is 'an exceptional situation making it impossible to supply the territory in strict compliance with European regulations on driving and rest periods for road drivers'.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The maximum durations for national and international road haulage operations, as provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No. 605/2006 of 15 March 2006, are increased by 30 days. The daily driving time is thus limited to 10 hours per day or 11 hours per day twice a week, instead of the nine hours which may be increased to 10 hours twice a week. And the weekly driving time is temporarily limited to 60 hours per week and 102 hours over two consecutive weeks, as opposed to 56 hours and 90 hours over two consecutive weeks under normal circumstances. These provisions are applicable from 21 March 2020 by virtue of a decree dated the same day.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No data yet available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Informed", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/FR-2020-12_743.html", "isOccupation": "Yes", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "678", "sources::title": "D\u00e9cret no 2020-280 du 20 mars 2020  \rrelatif \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur imm\u00e9diate de quatre arr\u00eat\u00e9s", "sources::url": "https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041740985", "sources::d_date": "03/20/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "e45c17689efc4520a58586b3fc7cd4a52a1e657602967e87cfa790a3169331a9"}, {"recordId": "679", "sources::title": "Arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 20 mars 2020 portant d\u00e9rogation temporaire aux r\u00e8gles \ren mati\u00e8re de temps de conduite pour le transport routier de marchandises ", "sources::url": "https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041741033", "sources::d_date": "03/20/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "1bb04f68657c36538af9d12601a4a15ab372cb42065ff8f7cd0b74d980612265"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}, {"recordId": "31", "targetGroups::name": "Self-employed", "modId": "15"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [{"recordId": "34", "occupations::name": "Drivers and mobile plant operators", "modId": "0"}], "sectors": [{"recordId": "77", "sectors::code": "H49", "sectors::name": "Land transport and transport via pipelines", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "653", "modId": "73"}
