This is regulated in section 11 of  the Unemployment Security Act (Ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myysturvalaki) (2002/1290). Labour market subsidy is a form of unemployment benefit aimed for unemployed persons entering the labour market for the first time or who do not qualify for the basic or earnings-related unemployment allowance (in Finnish 'ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myysp\u00e4iv\u00e4raha'). \r\r\rThe outbreak of COVID-19 has had a major impact on entrepreneurial activities in Finland. In order to ease the pressure caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 on entrepreneurs, the Parliament approved an amendment that will give entrepreneurs a temporary right to labour market support under the Unemployment Security Act (2002/1290).  \r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "To be eligible for labour market support, the following conditions must be met: \r\r1. the entrepreneur's full-time employment has ended or the income from the entrepreneurial activities is less than \u20ac1,089 per month\r2. the reduction of income or full-time work is due to the COVID-19 outbreak \r\rThe entrepreneur may continue their business activities while receiving labour market support. \r\rThe support can be paid to entrepreneurs between 16 March 2020 and 30 June 2020. The support can be received retroactively. \r\rThe labour market support is \u20ac33.6 per day and it is paid 5 days a week. Income from entrepreneurial activities decreases the labour market support. ", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "\rIn total 32,600 entrepreneurs received labour market subsidy in April and May 2020. Over half of the recipients were over 45 years old. A majority of them were women but there are no significant differences between women and men. By the end of May 2020, in total \u20ac35.5 million was paid out to entrepreneurs. \r\rAs of 26 August 2020, in total 48,000 applications had been made and 41,000 entrepreneurs have received labour market subsidy. The numbers of entrepreneurs applying has decreased significantly since the spring and summer months. KELA, the social insurance institution that pays out the subsidy, has been receiving approximately 300 applications per week. \r\rAccording to a survey made by the Federation of Finnish Enterprises (Suomen Yritt\u00e4j\u00e4t) in November 2020, especially entrepreneurs in the trade sector and entrepreneurs employing 1-4 persons have applied for labour market subsidy. \r\r", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No information available.
