Industrial relations are poorly developed, a sectoral collective agreement is not in place; a statutory minimum wage is set by a sectoral minimum wage commission composed of various stakeholders. Major church-related organisations, NGO and private employers do not engage in collective bargaining; employers criticize the underfinancing of the statutory heath insurance.   \r\rAgainst this background the new sectoral agreement on a COVID-19 bonus for health care workers is a very new development. Some NGO founded the employer organisation BVAP for changing employment relations in the sector by engaging in collective bargaining. Wage negotiations with the United Services Union ver.di are ongoing since late 2019. Business organisations are highly critical of the new agreement saying that they do not see where the money shall come from. \r\rThe collective bargaining partners BVAP and ver.di wish for their agreements - this one as well as future ones - to be extended by the labour minister.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The agreement covers skilled and unskilled care workers as well as workers in managerial positions in residential care homes and in ambulant care. They shall be paid an extra \u20ac1,500 bonus in July 2020 on top of their monthly wage as compensation for the very strong burden they carry because of COVID-19. Part time workers shall receive the bonus depending on the number of hours worked. Trainees in vocational training shall receive \u20ac900 extra.\r\rThe agreement is independent of the collective bargaining partners' ongoing negotiations of a sectoral wage agreement. The bonus shall be paid on top of  and shall have no impact on the level of the wage.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The applicaton of the measure has not started yet.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Other", "socialPartner_role": "Agreed (outcome)", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/DE-2020-27_592.html", "isOccupation": "Yes", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Bipartite collective agreements", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "523", "sources::title": "Sectoral agreement on bonus for elder care workers", "sources::url": "https://www.arbeitgeber-pflege.de/news/tarifvertrag-fuer-corona-sonderpraemie-von-1500-euro-der-pflegebranche\r\r\r\r\r\r", "sources::d_date": "04/06/2020", "modId": "3", "failure_reason": "HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.arbeitgeber-pflege.de', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/tarifvertrag-fuer-corona-sonderpraemie-von-1500-euro-der-pflegebranche%0D%0D%0D%0D%0D%0D (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: certificate has expired (_ssl.c:1123)')))"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "2", "actors::name": "Social partners jointly", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "1", "funding::name": "Companies", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "3", "funding::name": "Employer", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [{"recordId": "6", "occupations::name": "Health professionals", "modId": "0"}], "sectors": [{"recordId": "118", "sectors::code": "Q86", "sectors::name": "Human health activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "119", "sectors::code": "Q87", "sectors::name": "Residential care activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "483", "modId": "78"}
