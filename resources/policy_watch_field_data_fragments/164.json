These measures are new and exceptional, and aimed at extending the COVID-19 quarantine periods with some legal instruments already into force for normal sick-leaves.\r\rThe measures for workers of the private sector have been introduced with the Decree Law No. 18/2020 of 17 March 2020 (art. 26). For workers in the public sector, the legal reference is the Decree Law No. 9/2020 of 2 March 2020 (art. 19). ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure sets that the period spent in quarantine by workers in the private sector is equalised to sickness for what concerns its economic treatment, but cannot be calculated within the maximum number of leave days for sickness (i.e. the maximum number of days a worker can stay home for sickness without losing his/her entitlement). The costs for this measure are financed by the State and not by the National Social Security Institute or the employers. \r\rFor workers in the public sector, according to this measure, the period spent in quarantine with active surveillance is equalised to hospitalisation. In this way, the quarantined civil servants are not subject to the deduction set by Article 71 of Law No. 133/2008, that in normal conditions allow them to get an indemnity calculated only on their basic monthly wage, excluding all the additional treatments.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners were not involved in the decision making process.", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/IT-2020-12_452.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "283", "sources::title": "DECRETO-LEGGE 17 marzo 2020, n. 18", "sources::url": "https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legge:2020-03-17;18", "sources::d_date": "03/17/2020", "modId": "4", "downloaded_to": "87b843afe2a51087e62c5fe1e6dcb70d7865fa44cc85ecd01cd2d48a3d897368"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "343", "modId": "89"}
