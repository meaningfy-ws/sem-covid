This caused severe economic strain on many companies and also the prospects for the phase to come, with an easing of restrictions, are overshadowed. As part of the gradual relaunch of public activity, gastronomic establishments may reopen from 15 May onwards, but with special obligations, such as keeping minimum distances between tables, maximum numbers of guests per table, waiters wearing masks among others. It is believed that the 'return to normal' will not be easy under such conditions, not-least as consumers are advised not to go out too often and many have faced a loss of income. Lower revenues are therefore expected in the months to come. \r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "It is against this background that the city of Vienna, in collaboration with the Vienna Economic Chamber, has decided to issue vouchers, to be spent in the Viennese gastronomy. It is considered as a complementary measure to the Federal support package for the gastronomic services, and aimed to stimulate consumer demand and the appetite to go out again. \r\rThe campaign 'Vienna Gastro Voucher' will start in June, and it is envisaged to run until September 2020. All 950,000 Viennese households are going to receive a voucher by post. One-person households receive a \u20ac25 voucher, households with more people receive a voucher worth \u20ac50. The vouchers can be redeemed in Viennese restaurants, pubs and cafes participating in the scheme. Alcohol can not be purchased with the vouchers.\r\rAccording to the city of Vienna, the campaign is expected to amount to \u20ac40 million euros. ", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "**Information from May**: Use is still unknown, as the measure hasn't been rolled out yet to the 950,000 households. It will reach potentially the 6,500 businesses in the sector, employing about 60,000 workers in Vienna.\r\r**Information from 6 October 2020**: according to a press release from the city of Vienna: Vouchers worth \u20ac25 for one-person households (426,731) and \u20ac50 for multi-person households (515,452) were sent to exactly 942,183 households in Vienna in June 2020. Of the more than 940,000 vouchers issued, 781,006 were redeemed in 3,721 catering establishments such as restaurants or coffee houses, which corresponds to a value of \u20ac30.75 million or a redemption rate of 83% which is significantly higher than the redemption rate of purchased consumer vouchers.\r", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The Economic chamber of Vienna (WKW) was involved in the design of the initiative.", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-20_851.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Other initiatives or policies", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "861", "sources::title": "City of Vienna issues gastronomy vouchers for every household", "sources::url": "https://www.diepresse.com/5813028/wien-verteilt-wirtshaus-gutscheine-an-alle-haushalte", "sources::d_date": "05/13/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "a78d41611a3f8451b91bfe3c0c58d35c8783f5f34cc6808b82f72cb3764f9712"}, {"recordId": "862", "sources::title": "Das geht aufs Haus - Stadt Wien legt Gutscheine fuer Restaurant Besuch auf", "sources::url": "https://www.wien.gv.at/presse/2020/05/13/das-geht-aufs-haus-stadt-wien-legt-gutscheine-fuer-restaurant-besuche-auf", "sources::d_date": "05/13/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "814ccb58e99cefa006680e822a3492c5711b75a47aafca6e275cacc8ed856ece"}, {"recordId": "1707", "sources::title": "More than 30 million euro paid out to businesses", "sources::url": "https://www.wien.gv.at/presse/2020/10/06/wiener-gastro-gutschein-mehr-als-30-millionen-euro-an-betriebe-ausbezahlt", "sources::d_date": "10/06/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "75f21b92366c57a78aecb89d631829213394378f0b92511e1fabd388cc43aa81"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "7", "actors::name": "Local / regional government", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "60", "targetGroups::name": "Sector specific set of companies", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "6", "funding::name": "Local funds", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "8", "funding::name": "Regional funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "84", "sectors::code": "I56", "sectors::name": "Food and beverage service activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": [{"recordId": "3078", "regions::countryCode": "AT", "regions::level": 2, "regions::name": "Wien", "regions::nutsCode": "AT13", "modId": "5"}]}, "recordId": "761", "modId": "67"}
