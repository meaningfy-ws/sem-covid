This allowance can be granted free of social security contributions to all employees who work from home, including those who did not work from home prior to the pandemic situation, and therefore without the employer and employee having concluded a formal telework contract beforehand.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The temporary expense allowance for working from home is an office allowance of \u20ac126.94 per month. This amount is the same for all homeworkers. The office allowance covers a range of costs: the office in the private home, small office equipment, electricity, water, heating, insurance, property tax, etc. In order to avoid double use of the expense allowances, employees have to renounce the already existing monthly homework allowance.\r\rIn addition to the office allowance, the employer may also reimburse an expense allowance of up to \u20ac40 per month for the use of a private Internet connection with a subscription (maximum \u20ac20 ) and a private computer (maximum \u20ac20).\r\rIf the employee has to incur other costs such as the use of his own telephone or the purchase of a screen, the employer may also reimburse them. But this reimbursement is based on the actual costs. There is no general lump sum for this.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The use of the measure is entirely up to the employer in question and is nationwide across all sectors.
