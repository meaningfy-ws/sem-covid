The employer should also organise alternating breaks, including for meals, among teams or departments. (Article 3)\r\rFor the purposes described above, the employer may change working times up to the maximum limit of one hour, unless this causes serious harm to the worker (article 4). It is considered as serious harm notably: the lack of public transports with adequate operating schedules; and the need to provide immediate and necessary assistance to the family.\r\rThis change in working times must remain stable for at least one week. This cannot imply the change of the maximum daily or weekly working hours, nor the change from day work to night work or vice-versa.\r\rSome groups of workers are exempted of working according to the new working schedules defined by the employer: workers who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding; minor workers; workers with reduced working capacity, with a disability or chronic disease; and workers caring for children under 12 years old or, regardless of age, with a disability or chronic disease.\r\rAccording to the Release from the Council of Ministers of 1 October 2020, it was approved a resolution that extends to Public Administration the rules on staggered working times, with the due adaptations.\r\r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information is available on the use of this measure.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The social partners were invited to issue written opinion on this measure but the topic was not discussed in the Standing Committee for Social Concertation.\r\rIn order to change working times, according to this Decree-Law, the employer should do a prior consultation to the workers involved and to the works council or, in its absence, to the trade union or inter trade union commission or to the trade union representatives.\r\rThis Decree-Law is in force until 31 March 2021 but it may be extended following consultation of the social partners.\r\r", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/PT-2020-40_1273.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1790", "sources::title": "Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 79-A/2020 ", "sources::url": "https://data.dre.pt/eli/dec-lei/79-A/2020/10/01/p/dre ", "sources::d_date": "10/01/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "1870d218499fcfeca36e694926be203150dc8656a61b0999f3282af8ca6c06a4"}, {"recordId": "1791", "sources::title": "Resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do Conselho de Ministros n.\u00ba 63-A/2020", "sources::url": "\rhttps://data.dre.pt/eli/resolconsmin/63-A/2020/08/14/p/dre", "sources::d_date": "08/14/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "HTTPConnectionPool(host='%0dhttps', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: //data.dre.pt/eli/resolconsmin/63-A/2020/08/14/p/dre (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7fe4c74d94c0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name or service not known'))"}, {"recordId": "1792", "sources::title": "Resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do Conselho de Ministros n.\u00ba 70-A/2020 ", "sources::url": "https://data.dre.pt/eli/resolconsmin/70-A/2020/09/11/p/dre ", "sources::d_date": "09/11/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "9ece616882354302bebf9dbbfe69b5a5edccb57379c435bdf6c958df48b70f53"}, {"recordId": "1799", "sources::title": "Comunicado do Conselho de Ministros de 1 de outubro de 2020", "sources::url": "https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc22/governo/comunicado-de-conselho-de-ministros?i=371", "sources::d_date": "10/01/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "8d468ef66451cab1c86705915bffafbaac3683b3054c508c860d6d56c9d851ce"}, {"recordId": "2606", "sources::title": "Decreto-Lei n\u00ba 106-A/2020 ", "sources::url": "https://dre.pt/application/file/a/15263971", "sources::d_date": "12/30/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "cd1e5cf17132683c7aa9e4fb97e986dacc2eb861ba1f61aa30a062ff00a6b9a4"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "3", "actors::name": "Trade unions", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "64", "targetGroups::name": "Larger corporations", "modId": "14"}, {"recordId": "65", "targetGroups::name": "Other businesses", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [{"recordId": "632", "updates::d_date": "12/31/2020", "updates::description": "Decree-Law 106-A / 2020 of 30 December amends exceptional and temporary measures relating to the COVID-19 disease pandemic.\rProceeds the third amendment to Decree-Law 79-A / 2020, of 1 October, as amended by Decree-Laws 94-A / 2020, of 3 November, and 99/2020, of 22 November, which establishes an exceptional regime and transitory reorganisation of work and minimisation of risks of transmission of COVID-19 disease infection in the scope of labour relations.\rArticles 2 and 3 of Decree-Law 79 -A / 2020, of 1 October, in their current wording, are replaced by the following:\rArticle 2\r[...]\r\r1.
