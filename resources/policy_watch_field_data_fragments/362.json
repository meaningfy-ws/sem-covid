The measure has an enormous impact on the employment situation of the sectoral workers. \r\rThe food, restaurant and hotel workers union NGG, an affilliate of trade union confederation DGB, negotiated with two employer organsiations to address the situation - with very different results. The federal association of hotel and restaurant employers DEHOGA has rejected to negotiate an agreement on short time working at all whereas the federal association of system caterers BdS was willing to conclude a Corona protection agreement with some favourable conditions. The new agreement came on top of a sectoral arrangement concluded by the union NGG and the employers' organisation BdS (covering 120,000 workers), agreed in early March which stipluates a wage rise up to \u20ac 12 per hour until 2021. \r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The NGG-BdS Corona protection agreement aims at avoiding direct dismissals and at supporting businesses (often franchises) by settling that in case of need:\r\r* the employers shall apply for short time working with the federal employment agency;\r* that they shall raise the standard short time working allowance paid by the federal employlemt agency (60% of net monthly wage for workers without childen, 67% for workers with children) to up to 90% of the net monthly wage; and\r* that workers shall be covered by dismissal protection until two months after the end of the short time working period.\r\rThe agreement covers about 120,000 workers represented by the affiliaites of BdS, a.o.
