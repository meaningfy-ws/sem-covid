Old-age pensioners with qualifications were regarded as a target group. The government proposed a change in the regulation of pension schemes to prevent that mobilised personnel will experience loss of pension when they receive labour income. The regulation suspends some of the public pension scheme rules on specified terms for a limited period. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The current rules on the reduction and termination of pensions in connection with employment income are clear and absolute in their form, so that any exceptions in general should be limited and well justified. In a pandemic situation, the overall purpose is that the public health service maintains necessary health care. In order to realize this purpose, the Ministry proposes that income from voluntary work in public health services or with private persons who, according to law or agreement, offer health services to the population, should not, however, result in a reduction or loss of pension. To prevent pension reduction for health professionals taking on extra work during the crisis connected to COVID-19, amendments to three pension scheme regulations were passed. The measure cover health and social standby and service, and the regulations comprise The Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund, pension fund for nurses and pension fund for employees in farmacies. The measure will not require any specific funding.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-12_714.html", "isOccupation": "Yes", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "627", "sources::title": "Tidsbegrenset unntak fra avkorting i pensjon for helsepersonell", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/prop.-53-ls-20192020/id2693424/?ch=7", "sources::d_date": "04/17/2020", "modId": "3", "downloaded_to": "32e1d26a9cf6600a8b39d87c54f43f8eb07013245f4ee11fd8338c4b4bb7d70d"}, {"recordId": "628", "sources::title": "Prop. 53 LS (2019\u20132020) Endringer i skatteloven og skattebetalingsloven mv.
