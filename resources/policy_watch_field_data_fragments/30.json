No interest or penalties are to be charged with regards to the eligible taxes. The scheme is targeted at those who have suffered a significant downturn in turnover due to COVID-19. \r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure originally applied to taxes owed until the end of April; tax forms were still expected to be submitted according to normal deadlines. The incentive was primarily aimed at companies and self-employed who suffer a significant downturn in their turnover. A sum of a reduction in 25% is quoted and it aims to target the following sectors but is not limited to them:  tourism and hospitality, entertainment, transport, and manufacturing sectors.  Enterprises will still collect National Insurance on their employees\u2019 wages, but will keep these dues for the duration of the deferral. \r\rThe eligible taxes to be deferred are those due in March and April 2020 and include: provisional tax, employee taxes, maternity fund payments and social security contributions, social security contributions of self-employed persons and VAT.\r\rEligible taxes, other than VAT, are to be settled in 4 equal monthly installments between May and August 2020. VAT is to be settled in 2 equal installments with the 2 quarterly returns that follow the deferred quarter. \r\rExcluded from this initiative are companies and self-employed persons who failed to comply with their tax obligations by 31 December 2019. Applications were to be entered by 15th April 2020\r\rIt was later announced that the period covered by this measure was extended by a further two months, to cover up until the end of June. After this period some contributions will no longer be deferred. National Insurance, income tax and maternity contributions will need to be paid from 1 July. However, other taxes due by organisation have been deferred to the end of August. Companies can pay the deferred tax by May next year, with no interest charged.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Up until the end of May 2020, 3,324 businesses had their application for tax deferral approved\ramounting to an estimated total of around \u20ac60 million being deferred. \r\rThe Ministry for Finance and Financial Services by means of their October 2020 Economic Survey stated that during the first eight months of 2020, tax revenue decreased by 22.1%, reaching \u20ac2,216.6 million as direct tax revenues fell by \u20ac308.1 million, indirect taxes declined by \u20ac321.6 million and non-tax revenues declined by \u20ac35.6 million. The proceeds from income tax decreased by 22.0 per cent while social security contributions declined by 11.3%. These declines were in-part due to Government measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic including the deferral of provisional tax, employee taxes, maternity fund payments and social security contributions, social security contributions for self-employed persons and Value Added Tax (VAT) between March and June 2020. National insurance, income tax and maternity contributions have started to be paid from 1 July 2020. Other taxes due by companies have been deferred to the end of August 2020. Companies may pay the deferred tax by May 2021, with no interest charged.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The measure emerged at the very beginning of COVD-19 following calls from employers' associations for support.
