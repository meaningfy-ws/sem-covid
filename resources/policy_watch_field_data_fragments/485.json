The financing to SMEs will be done through the Cyprus Entrepreneurship Fund (CYPEF) and the bank institutes. Beneficiaries are SMEs with maximum number of employees to be 250 and the maximum amount of loan \u20ac1.5 million that are to be reimbursed over a period of twelve years. Interest rates will be lower than the current rates of banks with the potential of subsidy by the \u2018Scheme of Interest Rates Subsidy\u2019. \r\rThe second measure, the \u2018Scheme of Interest Rates Subsidy\u2019, aims to improve liquidity for businesses and self-employed confronting sudden lack of liquidity through subsidy of new business loans. Competent and financing authority is the General Accounting Office of the Ministry of Finance. Beneficiaries of the scheme are all undertaking companies in accordance with the EU definition \u2013 very small, small, medium and large enterprises and self-employed - and the aim of the loan shall be the covering of liquidity needs for capital and investment purposes. The maximum interest rates for long is defined to 4.25% and the maximum period of subsidy will be four years. For the first two years the subsidy will be up to 3.5 percentage points and two percentage points for the third and fourth years. \r\rThe third measure of this bundle is a lump sum subsidy targeting self-employed and very small businesses that have partially or fully suspended their activities integrated in the special schemes of the Ministry of Labour between 13 April and 12 May 2020. For businesses employing \r\r* up to one person the lump sum is \u20ac1,250, \r* 2-5 persons \u20ac3,000, \r* 6-9 persons \u20ac4,000 and \r* 10-50 persons \u20ac6,000. \r\rThe purpose of the measure is for the covering of rents, operational expenses and other business debts. \r\rThe fourth measure provides for the reduction of VAT from 9% to 5% for the period 1 July 2020 to 10 January 2020 in the sectors of tourist accommodation and catering. It is expected that the reduction will benefit the sectors that have been mostly affected by the pandemic as well as the businesses and consumers due to the increase of consumer demand.
