After a public hearing, a scheme was adopted on 20 July with effect from 1 June 2020.

The scheme applies to June, July and August with a deadline for each month four weeks after the end of the month for which the grant is applied for. (The deadlines have later been prolonged.) NOK 100 million (\u20ac9.3 million) is set aside in the state budget for compensation under the scheme.\r\rThe government wanted to direct the scheme at express buses and boat routes that play a similar role as express buses. Operators of such routes have reported a need for financial assistance, and The Ministry of Transport and Communications found it most important to implement measures to secure public transport along the main transport routes in the country. Applicants, who have a permit to operate passenger transport on a route with a motor vehicle or passenger boat, can apply for subsidy under the scheme when the route is over 80 kilometers one way. It is a requirement that the route is commercial and that there is year-round operation on the route.
