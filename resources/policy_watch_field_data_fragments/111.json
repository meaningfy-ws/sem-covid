The purpose of this measure is to help persons to overcome their lower income during quarantine. A further goal is to contain the costs for employers which might have to pay wage compensation to the employees on a sick leave for not quarantine-related reasons.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In case of obligatory quarantine, the benefit is paid by the Social Insurance Agency from the first day of quarantine at the level of 55% of gross wage (approx. 70% of net wage). \rThe person with diagnosed COVID-19 contacts his or her physician by phone or email. The physician sends the form to the Social Insurance Agency. The sick person also must inform his or her employer about the quarantine. There have been differences from the regular sickness benefit applied in other reasons than COVID-19. In these other cases, the first ten days of sick leave are paid by the employer as a wage compensation (25% of gross wage during first three days and 55% of gross wage from the fourth to the 10th day). The sickness benefit is paid by the Social Insurance Agency from the 11th day of the sickness (55% of gross wage).\rNot all persons in obligatory quarantine with COVID-19 are eligible for this benefit. They have to have paid sickness benefit insurance at least 270 days in the course of two years before the sickness - same as in other cases.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In March 2020 the number of sickness benefits applications due to the all quarantine reasons (all illnesses which required quarantine) reached its peak of 39,413 cases. The exact number of quarantine sickness benefits applications due to COVID-19 is not available. It is assumed that the vast majority of these applications refers, anyway, to COVID-19 quarantine as there were only 10 quarantine sickness benefits in March 2019. Between April and June 2020 the number of quarantine sickness benefits applications decreased steeply compared to its March 2020 numbers (to 1,818 in June 2020).\r\rDuring summer 2020 the number of quarantine sickness benefits application increased slightly but stayed far from March 2020 numbers. There were 2,479 quarantine sickness benefits in July 2020 and 4,243 in August 2020.\rDue to the worsening of the epidemiological situation the number of new applications increased in autumn, especially in October and November (to 63,028 in October and 59,900 in November) and overcame the peak from March 2020.   \r\r\r", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The information on social partner's involvement is not available.", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/SK-2020-13_386.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "242", "sources::title": "Pandemic nursing benefit and pandemic sickness benefit.
