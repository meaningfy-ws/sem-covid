The partial reimbursement of fixed costs is a new measure. Besides the already existing [Temporary layoff scheme and reimbursement of wage related compensation to employers](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/SI-2020-11_436.html), the [Partial reimbursement of fixed costs](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/SI-2020-23_904.html) is the most important state intervention in the sixth COVID-19 law.
