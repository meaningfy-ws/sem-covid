The NPO Support Fund is intended to support organisations with their own legal personality if they pursue non-profit, charitable or ecclesiastical purposes in accordance with the Federal Tax Code. Political parties and organisations subject to the control of the Court of Audit are excluded. It is planned that the Minister of Finance will provide funds amounting to \u20ac700 million from the COVID-19 crisis management fund for this purpose. \r\rThe following types of organisations affected by the Corona crisis are eligible:\r\r1. Non-profit organisations such as sports, cultural and animal welfare associations\r2. Organisations which are responsible for fire brigade tasks according to state law\r3. Legally recognised churches, religious communities and institutions which have legal personality under state law on the basis of religious law provisions\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The aim of the funding is to mitigate the loss of revenue caused by COVID-19 for organisations eligible under the law (i.e. NPO's) by means of grants for eligible costs. The funding consists of two areas:\r\r**Reimbursement of the eligible fixed costs**\r\rSubsidisable fixed costs (rent, insurance, water, sewerage, waste, tax consultant, energy, telco - no personnel costs) will be reimbursed up to 100% for the period from 1 April 2020 to 30 September 2020.\r\rExceptions: Costs incurred as a result of the Corona crisis will already be subsidised from 10 March 2020, e.g. protective equipment or disinfectants. Expenses for cancelled events must have been incurred before 10 March.\r\r **Structural security contribution**\r\rThe flat-rate contribution to structural securities is intended to cover costs that do not fall under the eligible fixed costs (see above), such as maintenance or servicing costs, and normally amounts to 7% of the income generated in 2019.\r\rThe grant is the sum of eligible costs and the structural support contribution, if this sum does not exceed \u20ac3,000.\r\rIf the sum of eligible costs and the structural support contribution is higher than \u20ac3,000, the maximum grant is the amount of the loss of income.\r\rHow is the loss of income calculated?\rNormally, the difference between the income of the first three quarters of 2019 and the income of the first three quarters of 2020.\r\rApplications can be made from 8 July 2020 until 31 December 2020. The grant is paid up to a maximum of \u20ac2.4 million per organisation. The Austrian Promotional Bank AWS is responsible for processing the applications, and reporting obligations to the National Council are planned.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of 24 August 2020, the NPO-Fund has pledged a total of \u20ac107.2 million, as announced by the responsible Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler. 5,245 applications have been processed positively. So far, \u20ac17.6 million have been paid in the sports sector, \u20ac10.3 million in the arts and cultural sector and \u20ac30.2 million for churches and similar institutions. The difference to the \u20ac107 million  results from the payment modalities; they will be paid at the submission of the final invoices.
