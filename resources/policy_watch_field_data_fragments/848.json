There are gaps between Romania and the EU, especially in terms of access to next generation networks and the general use of the Internet and digital skills - which is reflected in the low number of online transactions. Less than a third of the population aged 16-74 years in Romania has basic digital skills. Despite the increase in the percentage of ICT specialists, they represent a smaller proportion of the workforce compared to the EU as a whole (2.1%, compared to 3.7%). Only 8% of SMEs sell online, and only 9% of Romanian companies use social networks (compared to the EU average of 17%). Today, in the current pandemic context, the reorientation of businesses towards the online environment and the increase of digital literacy of employees can ensure the survival of enterprises, an increased competitiveness and maintaining jobs and employment. These needs are addressed through the two approved national programs.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "By Government Decision no. 599/July 2020, the National Program \u201cDigital skills for employees in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises sector\u201d (Programul na\u021bional \u201cCompeten\u021be digitale pentru angaja\u021bii din sectorul \u00eentreprinderilor mici \u0219i mijlocii\u201d) was approved, funded under the Human Capital Operational Program 2014-2020. \r\rThrough this program, employees of SMEs operating in economic sectors with competitive potential will be able to receive funding for participation in training programs in digital skills domain.
