They are therefore prone to face violations of OSH regulation. This situation became more pressing with the COVID-19 situation, as cleaners were simultaneously of essential importance for the protection of other (office) workers from the virus, and more exposed to the pandemic risk.\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Members complain about violations of OSH regulation by employers, according to IG BAU, the Trade Union for Building, Forestry, Agriculture and the Environment, which also organizes industrial cleaners. \r\rThe trade union IG BAU released legal information for industrial cleaners on their right to withhold their work in case the employer does not provide COVID-19 protective clothing. Since March 2020, the union provides draft complaint letters for members to use, in order to better support them in protecting themselves against violations of OSH regulations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not have data on how many members have used the provided legal advice and draft complaint letters.
