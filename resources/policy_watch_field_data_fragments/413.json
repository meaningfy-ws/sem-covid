In Norges Bank's estimation, there is a risk of a marked setback in the Norwegian economy as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus. The buffer requirement is lowered to counteract a tightening of lending practices in the banks. The social partners have been consulted regularly during design and implementation of the measure.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Norges Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee has decided to advise the Ministry of Finance to reduce the buffer rate to 1%. Norges Bank shall advice the Ministry of Finance on the level of the countercyclical capital buffer for banks. The countercyclical capital buffer rate is currently 2.5%. In recent weeks, there has been considerable financial market volatility. \r\rThe outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) and the measures to limit contagion will have a significant negative impact on growth in the Norwegian economy. There is substantial uncertainty about the duration and the consequences of the outbreak, with a risk of a pronounced economic downturn. Norwegian banks are solid. They have sufficient capital to absorb losses in the event of a severe downturn. A tightening of lending standards may, however, amplify the downturn in the economy. Against this background, the Committee has decided to advise the Ministry of Finance to reduce the buffer to 1% with immediate effect. The decision was unanimous.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-11_800.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "763", "sources::title": "Motsyklisk kapitalbuffer settes ned", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/motsyklisk-kapitalbuffer-settes-ned/id2693388/", "sources::d_date": "04/17/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "b0648fdfc2cc0004368e41705c46a474e7f3bc5c06c4d47d5c30f4a60e8a20ab"}, {"recordId": "764", "sources::title": "Advice on the countercyclical capital buffer 2020 Q1", "sources::url": "https://www.norges-bank.no/en/news-events/news-publications/Submissions/2020/2020-03-13/", "sources::d_date": "04/13/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "62621d0542efd2c658b77e7266286ba231da983ff3505746ad85b41b526def44"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "60", "targetGroups::name": "Sector specific set of companies", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "93", "sectors::code": "K64", "sectors::name": "Financial service activities, except insurance and pension funding", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "710", "modId": "60"}
