The cultural and creative sector appears especially badly hit by the crisis and this has led to extra measures being taken. On 27 March, the Minister for Education, Culture and Science sent a letter to Parliament explaining the need for and content of the planned measures.\r \rFollowing this first letter on plans to initiate a package of measures, a few weeks later, the announcement was made (after lobbying form the cultural and creative sector), that more support was needed. The Minister for Education, Culture and science announced on 15 April that more financing would be provided to the sector.\r\rThe \u20ac300 million reserved for the cultural sector is to be allocated via several instruments; the Open Loan for Monuments is one of these instruments.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure is one of the instruments being used to funnel the \u20ac300 million to the cultural and creative sectors. The measure targets privately owned, publicly accessible national monuments and heritage sites. This includes churches, windmills, castles, outdoor areas, industrial heritage sites, museum institutes, and city renovation and restoration sites. The measure includes a loan for owners of these types of heritage and monument sites. The loan, granted by the National Restoration Fund (NRF), runs 15 years at 1% interest, varies from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac 2 million, and has the option for delayed payments. The loan is open until the end of 2020 with a budget or \u20ac50 million reserved for the loan by the government.
