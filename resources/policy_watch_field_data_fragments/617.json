So, almost 80% of SMEs face lack of liquidity and one in seven companies may cease its operations in the next period. \r\rAccording to the research and recognizing that the outbreak of the pandemic has created a new, multi-layered crisis and serious complications in economic and social functioning, the policy text of GSEVEE, addressed to the government and the political parties, develops the main policy axes on which interventions must be made, so that the difficult return to economic and social normality can be achieved with the least losses.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "IME GSEVEE conducted a survey (April 2020) on the impact of the health crisis on small and micro enterprises, that consist of the 99% of companies in Greece and offer 80% of jobs in the private sector. On the basis of the survey, two elements were identified as more important in the operation of SMEs. The first concerns the lack of liquidity for almost 80% of small and micro-enterprises. The second concerns  the viability of the companies. The survey showed that one in seven companies may cease its operations in the next period and it is estimated that 250,000 jobs (self-employed, employers and workers) will be lost in the next period.\rIn this context and  in order to halt the most adverse effects of the health crisis, GSEVEE has compiled the eight main policy axes and interventions to address the effects of pandemic on small and micro-enterprises: \r\r1. financing, liquidity, investments \r2. halting the swelling of private debt \r3. tax issues \r4. employment, unemployment, social security \r5. addressing the digital gap \r6. promotion of business clusters \r7. strengthening the national health system \r8. training, retraining of enterprises and workers.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "This initiative of GSEVEE includes proposal to the government and to the political parties to protect the SMEs and workers and mitigate the consequences of COVID-19.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "This initiative of GSEVEE includes proposal to  the government and to the political parties to protect the SMEs and workers and mitigate the consequences of COVID-19.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/GR-2020-22_1090.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Other initiatives or policies", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1367", "sources::title": "\u0386\u03be\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd, \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Covid-1", "sources::url": "https://www.taxheaven.gr/news/49078/ime-gsebee-axones-protasewn-politikhs-gia-th-diaswsh-twn-epixeirhsewn-kai-twn-oesewn-ergasias-kai-th-diathrhsh-ths-koinwnikhs-synoxh", "sources::d_date": "05/27/2020", "modId": "5", "downloaded_to": "38693db6f020f71a172fa419ce13395388baacc1470c04c79a84aeb981a2da1c"}, {"recordId": "1433", "sources::title": "\u0388\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1 \u0399\u039c\u0395 \u0393\u03a3\u0395\u0392\u0395\u0395 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (\u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2)", "sources::url": "https://www.gsevee.gr/deltiatupou/1114-2020-05-07-08-41-3", "sources::d_date": "04/15/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "18feeb92962d6d6c626589d60c249d3ef1efd4f1b7aa015a12a5ffe7ea30ae2e"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "4", "actors::name": "Employers' organisations", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "62", "targetGroups::name": "SMEs", "modId": "12"}, {"recordId": "63", "targetGroups::name": "One person or microenterprises", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "5", "funding::name": "European Funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1000", "modId": "42"}
