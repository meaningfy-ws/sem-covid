These measures had, hence, a wide impact on some employers, that were totally or partially prevented from work. \r\rAs a partial relief, in order to diminish temporarily the labour-related expenditures (compulsory payments to the social insurance) of those employers, the government adopted the measure by Section 293ew of the amended Act on social insurance.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measures entailed the introduction of some amendments to the Social insurance act, postponing the deadline for compulsory payments of employers and self-employed to social security funds.\r \rAccording to this framework, any employer and self-employed paying compulsory contributions to health and pension insurance funds, and whose revenue from business decreased by at least 40%, are entitled to pay these contributions within 31 July 2020, rather than in March 2020. The government can prolong the deadline. The Government Order (Nariadenie vlady 76/2020) allows more options for the determination of the revenue decrease: comparison with March 2019, February 2020 and 2019 monthly average.
