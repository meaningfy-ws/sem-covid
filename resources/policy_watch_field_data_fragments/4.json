The scheme introduced a legal mechanism that allows businesses to retain employees without the need to work but to still receive a minimum level of salary. The purpose is to reduce redundancies and to avoid people being laid off without pay. Lay off (without pay) is the usual vehicle open to employers when they wish to retain employees but have no work for them to do. Under the job retention scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support from the government to continue paying part of the salary of those employees.  ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a temporary scheme open to all UK employers/employees for at least three months starting from 1 March 2020. It is designed to support employers/employees whose operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Employers can use a portal to claim for 80% of furloughed employees\u2019 (employees on a leave of absence) usual monthly wage costs to enable them to continue paying these wages, up to 2,820 Euros (GBP 2,500) a month. The government will also cover the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and minimum automatic enrollment employer pension contributions on that wage. Employers/employees can use this scheme anytime during this period.\r\rEmployers who have just made workers redundant (because of the emerging impact of coronavirus) can hire them back and place them on furlough and claim the benefit.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The scheme has been criticised for excluding workers starting in a new job after the 28 February 2020 cut off point (and before the government announced the lock down measures). The scheme is set to be up and running by the end of April 2020 with the possibility of claiming payments in arrears.\r\rBy the 19 July (the latest available data), the total number of jobs furloughed was\u00a09.5 million, with 1.2 million employers utilising the scheme, at a total cost to the government of\u00a0GBP 29.8 billion (HM Government, 2020).\r\rOn the 18 September, the Government published data on the scheme's operation up until the 31 July (although\u00a0figures for 31 July are provisional and subject to revision as additional claims for the period are received). The main findings are that:\u00a0\r\r* following on from the last release which covered the period to 30 June, preliminary estimates show that furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to the 31 July;\r* since the peak of 8.9 million employments furloughed on the 8 May, followed by reductions in June, preliminary figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to fall throughout July to 4.8 million on\u00a0the\u00a031\u00a0July - it is estimated that this figure could be in the region of 10% higher, or around 5.3 million once all returns are received and revisions made;\r* furloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on the 24\u00a0April at 1.85 million employments - by the 31\u00a0July, initial figures show 789,000 jobs furloughed in this sector \u2013 a decrease of more than a half since the peak for the sector;\r* across all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between the 30\u00a0June and the 31\u00a0July:\r* as at the 31\u00a0July, the sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furloughed that were actually furloughed was arts, entertainment and recreation at 45% followed by accommodation and food services sector at 43% - in all, 58% of employers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of July and 57% of employers in accommodation and food services;\r* overall, where it was possible to link the CJRS data on individual furloughed employments to other data, for the UK as a whole, 2.26 million women were furloughed at the end of July compared with 2.15 million men;\r* preliminary estimates show there was broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of July;\u00a0London had the highest take-up rate of 17% against the UK average of 16%;\r* in most countries and regions, more women than men were furloughed at the 31\u00a0July, the greatest exception to this being the West Midlands where 187,000 women were furloughed as opposed to\u00a0197,000 men;\r* almost 200,000 employers were using flexible furlough at the end of July for at least one job;\u00a0 in total, over 950,000 employments were on flexible furlough at the end of July,\u00a0around 20% of all furloughed employments;\r* at 29%, the accommodation and food services sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed flexibly;\r* based on the preliminary data for the 31 of\u00a0July, the South West has the highest proportion of employments on flexible furlough at 25% and London has the highest proportion of employments furloughed on a full-time basis at 82%.\u00a0\r\r\rAs of the 13 December, the total value of claims made by that date was \u00a346.6 billion. The  Government released the most recent data on the scheme in December 2020. The main points from the analysis, covering the period to 31 October are that: \r\r* furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to 31 October \rsince the peak of 8.9 million employments furloughed on 8 May, followed by reductions in June, \r* figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to fall throughout July, August and September to 5.4 million at 31 July and 3.8 million at 31 August and 2.8 million at 30 September.\r* Latest figures show that the number of employments has continued to fall throughout October to 2.4 million at 31 October. This is a reduction of 73% from the peak\rfurloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.9 million employments. \r* At 31 October, there were 356,400 employments furloughed in this sector \u2013 a decrease of more than 80% since the peak for the sector\r* As at 31 October, the sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furlough that were actually furloughed was the accommodation and food services sector at 27% followed by arts, entertainment and recreation at 24%. In all, 45% of employers in both the accommodation and food services sector and the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of October\r* Across all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between 30 September and 31 October\r* Overall, where it was possible to link the data, across the UK, 1.19 million women were furloughed at 31 October compared with 1.14 million men. This is a decrease of 229,700 women and 210,400 men when compared to 30 September\r* There was a broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of October. London had the highest take-up rate of 10% against the UK average of 8%\rin most countries and regions more women than men were furloughed at 31 October, the exceptions to this being London where 210,300 women were furloughed and 220,900 men, and West Midlands where 93,500 women were furloughed and 96,800 men\r* 196,400 employers had at least one employment on flexible furlough at the end of October. In total 977,200 employments were on flexible furlough at the end of October, 41% of all furloughed employments\r* At 50%, the other service activities sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed partially.

The new and updated guidance sets out who will be eligible from 1 July 2020 and explains how \u201cflexible furlough\u201d will operate. From the 1 July, employers will be able to bring back furloughed workers on a flexible pattern (ie for any amount of time and on any work pattern). Employers will be able to claim a CJRS grant for the hours which flexibly furloughed employees do not work, compared to the hours they would normally have worked in that period. \rIf an employer wishes to flexibly furlough staff, they will need to obtain their employees\u2019 agreement and keep a written agreement that confirms the new furlough arrangement. This agreement must be kept for 5 years. Employers must also keep records of how many hours their employees work and the numbers of furloughed hours for 6 years.  \r\r\rAlso from this date, employers will only be able to claim a grant for employees who have already been furloughed for three consecutive weeks between the 1st of March and the 30th of June. Thus, the last date an employee could have started furlough for the first time was the 10th of June. Companies are thus no longer able to furlough new employees, unless they have returned from maternity, shared parental, paternity or parental bereavement leave after the 10th of June. These employees can be furloughed after 10 June provided that:\r\r* the employer has previously submitted a CJRS claim for another\u00a0employee in the organisation between 1 March and 30 June 2020;\r* the employee is being furloughed for the first time;\r* the employee started their Shared Parental Leave before 10 June\u00a0and returned from that leave after 10 June 2020; and\r* the employee was on the employer\u2019s PAYE payroll on or before 19 March 2020.\r\rFrom 1 July, the number of employees that employers can claim for in any single claim period cannot exceed the maximum number of employees that the employer claimed for under any claims ending by 30 June. For example, if an employer previously submitted three claims between 1 March and 30 June 2020, in which the total number of employees furloughed was 20, 30 and 50 employees respectively, the maximum number of employees that the employer can furlough in any single claim from 1 July 2020 will be 50.\r\rThe scheme has been extended until the 31st of October. The Government will continue to pay 80% of wages up to a cap of GBP 2,500 in July, as well as national insurance and pension contributions. However, from the 1 of August, the level of government grant provided through the scheme will be limited and employers\u2019 contributions will rise. \r\r\rThe timetable for changes to the scheme is as follows: \r\r* There are no changes to grant levels in June\r* In June and July, the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of GBP 2,500 for the hours the employee is on furlough, as well as employer National Insurance Contributions (ER NICS) and pension contributions for the hours the employee is on furlough. Employers will have to pay employees for the hours they work.\r* For August, the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of GBP 2,500 for the hours an employee is on furlough and employers will pay ER NICs and pension contributions for the hours the employee is on furlough\r* For September, the government will pay 70% of wages up to a cap of GBP 2,187.50 for the hours the employee is on furlough. Employers will pay ER NICs and pension contributions and top up employees\u2019 wages to ensure they receive 80% of their wages up to a cap of GBP 2,500, for time they are furloughed\r* For October, the government will pay 60% of wages up to a cap of GBP 1,875 for the hours the employee is on furlough. Employers will pay ER NICs and pension contributions and top up employees\u2019 wages to ensure they receive 80% of their wages up to a cap of GBP 2,500, for time they are furloughed.\r\rEmployers will continue to able to choose to top up employee wages above the 80% total and GBP 2,500 cap for the hours not worked at their own expense if they wish.
