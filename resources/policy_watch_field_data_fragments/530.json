Numerous choir and dance collectives work continuously to learn and practice the songs and dances performed during the Celebration. Due to the containment measures, the collectives were unable to meet and practice, which in turn affected the income of the leaders of the collectives. To mitigate the financial hardship, the Ministry of Culture developed a temporary support measure for them. Relevant regulation was adopted in May 2020 after the adoption of the supplementary state budget act on 15 April 2020.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The support is meant for leaders of the collectives participating in the Estonian Song and Dance Celebration movement. The target group involves, for example, conductors, folk dance or folk music instructors, concert masters, piano accompanists.\r\rThe support covers 70% of the average income of the period October 2019 \u2013 February 2020 of the collective leader, but not more than \u20ac1,000 per month. The support can be paid for March, April and May 2020.\r\rThe applicant must be a legal person with a valid contract and no tax arrears prior to the emergency situation.
