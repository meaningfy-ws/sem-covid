This result is reached simplifying the rules to adopt work-from-home-based schemes.\r\rThe measure was adopted by the Act No. 66/2020 Coll., amending the Act No. 311/2001 Coll. on the Labour Code and supplementing some laws at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 250b of the Act specifies the possibility of an employer to order the employees to work from home upon defined circumstances. \r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to this measure, the employer and the employee can enter into the work-from-home scheme on the basis of a mutual agreement. The place of remote working must be specified by the parties, while the rules concerning working conditions, health and safety and working hours remain unchanged also while the work-from-home scheme is active.\r\rAdditionally, while the worker is operating from home, the employment relationship is not subject to the provisions on the schedule of weekly working hours, daily and  weekly rest and the idle-time. No wage supplements are paid to the employee for the overtime and night work and for working on Saturdays and Sundays, unless the employee and the employer agree otherwise.\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The measure concerns a large number of non-essential organisations, schools, institutions where there is no risk of production suspension and the supply of raw materials, materials, food, energy is not jeopardised.\r\rThere are no concrete figures available on the total number of employees who used the homework since mid-March till now. Nevertheless, according to the available information, most of the concerned employees were satisfied with the possibility to use it. Some employers consider the option to use homework also after the corona crisis.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "According to the peak organisations of employers AZZZ SR, APZ and KOZ SR, social partners were not involved via usual tripartite consultations nor in the cross-sector commenting procedure.
