Short-time work has been a well established crisis measure for a long time and was last used to a great extent during the 2008/09 financial crisis, alleviating the economic downturn to quite some extent. See for example a [Eurofound report from 2010](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/report/2010/austria/working-conditions-labour-market-business/austria-short-time-working-subsidy).", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "A short-time work scheme applies if a company temporarily reduces the working time. In order to prevent dismissals and to protect businesses and employees from negative economic and social impacts of COVID-19, social partners (Chamber of Labour, Trade Unions, Economic Chamber) negotiated the current scheme. \r\rWorking hours of employees can be reduced up to zero hours keeping full / almost full pay. The employer only pays for the actual working time. \r\rReduced working hours: The reduced standard working hours must be on average between 10% and 90% of the collectively agreed working hours (this applies to (pre-short-time work) full-time workers, an aliquot reduction applies to employees who were on part-time before short-time work). A new aspect of this is that it may temporarily also be set at zero. Thus, for instance, in the context of a short-time working period of six weeks, it may be set at 0% for five weeks (i.e. no work will take place, and for one week at 60%). Another important point to note is that, in some business sectors, the agreement on short-time work may also include overtime.\r\rFor persons with a disability (registered disabled persons according to the Act on the Employment of People with Disabilities (BEinstG), a special job security subsidy applies when making use of the PES' short-time work model. The employers are reimbursed for the remaining wage costs after deduction of the PES short-time work subsidy for the duration of the short-time work. Prerequisites are an application for short-time work (even retroactive) by 30 June 2020 and the existence of a degree of disability of at least 50% (notice of assessment), as well as no existing wage subsidies for the disabled person concerned. \r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of 14 April 2020, short-time work applications have been made for the jobs of 608,607 people, in mid-May, over 1.3 million people were on short-time work.\rThe funds have been increased several times, from originally \u20ac3 billion to currently (mid-June) \u20ac12 billion in mid-May.\r\rThe Federal Ministry for Labour, Family and Youth maintains a regularly updated [webpage on labour market statistics](https://www.bmafj.gv.at/Services/News/Aktuelle-Arbeitsmarktzahlen.html), which keeps track of the number of people currently in short-time work. Peak numbers were reached during three weeks in May, during which time more than 1.3 million people were on short-time work. Numbers remained above 400,000 during the summer months and declined to 290,696 on 28 September 2020.\r\rOn 6 October 2020, according to a newspaper article by 'DiePresse', the financial police had carried out inspections in 13,829 companies for a total of 6,145 hours, primarily to check compliance with the short-time working rules. In sum, there were much fewer violations than initially feared, but an increase of other violations. \r\rOn 21 December 2020, 400,479 persons were on short-time work.\r", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The measure is based on a social partner agreement.", "socialPartner_form": "Bi-or tripartite social dialogue bodies", "socialPartner_role": "Negotiated", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-10_229.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Tripartite agreements", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "89", "sources::title": "Federal Ministry of Labor, Family and Youth, FAQ short-time work (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Arbeit, Familie und Jugend, FAQ Kurzarbeit)", "sources::url": "https://www.bmafj.gv.at/Services/News/Coronavirus/FAQ--Kurzarbeit.html", "sources::d_date": "03/31/2020", "modId": "7", "downloaded_to": "ab8868146249980373d7de35a9ef9dc2d71958c201f8fc418babb5367fc42845"}, {"recordId": "98", "sources::title": "WKO Fact Sheet Corona short-time work (Corona-Kurzarbeit \u2013 Betriebe sichern, Arbeitspl\u00e4tze erhalten)", "sources::url": "https://www.wko.at/service/factsheet-corona-kurzarbeit.pdf", "sources::d_date": "03/26/2020", "modId": "8", "downloaded_to": "f012c9b36bc0792234ac5b02a2caf748a8cbb695397b5d590bd602371ecb3a74"}, {"recordId": "622", "sources::title": "608 000 short time work applications, funds increased from 3 to 5 bio euros", "sources::url": "https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000116827563/kurzarbeit-fuer-608-000-jobs-beantragt-gelder-steigen-von-drei", "sources::d_date": "04/14/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "026ca4027053ba4f92317874d8549709de8030412711dda0e031b404043a5e80"}, {"recordId": "883", "sources::title": "Changes to short-time corona work from 1 June 2020", "sources::url": "https://www.wko.at/service/aenderungen-corona-kurzarbeit-ab-1-6-2020.html", "sources::d_date": "05/25/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "94caf1f91d6f46e8695d7d838d8b01d9a9ad50fca264ff0c910edd4c722cb847"}, {"recordId": "1558", "sources::title": "Short-time work phase III", "sources::url": "https://www.wko.at/service/corona-kurzarbeit.html", "sources::d_date": "09/30/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "9cda85cc7dc0d083de61990f93da7b9f3358861fef501d6560e9430077bfc0f8"}, {"recordId": "1560", "sources::title": "Changes in the social partner agreement phase III", "sources::url": "https://www.wko.at/service/kurzarbeit-aenderung-sozialpartnervereinbarung-phase-3.pdf", "sources::d_date": "09/30/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "3bb748f59b43f85a511abf8008204e3d12bca49fb820dc82310fe5551ce0b6f5"}, {"recordId": "2380", "sources::title": "Important information about the COVID-19 short-time work allowance\rShort-time work phase 3", "sources::url": "https://www.ams.at/unternehmen/personalsicherung-und-fruehwarnsystem/kurzarbeit#oberoesterreich", "sources::d_date": "11/02/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "ea07ef4907b40ff7baf07afadc2d5d8a6bf705a2a84d5e9b89a80d7ca7924880"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "2", "actors::name": "Social partners jointly", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [{"recordId": "35", "updates::d_date": "05/25/2020", "updates::description": "The Austrian social partners negotiated a new agreement which extends the Corona short-time work measure for another three months.
