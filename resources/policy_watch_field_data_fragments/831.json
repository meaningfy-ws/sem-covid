In an extraordinary bill the government has decided to modify the period of validity for payment of the care allowance to support the parents of young schoolchildren who are homeschooling their children. Parents are\u00a0entitled to care allowance as\u00a0long as the ban on school attendance remains in force.\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The current phrasing of the Act No.187/2006 Coll., on Sickness Insurance provides care allowance for a period of nine calendar days to parents of children under the age of 10 who cannot be put in the care of a school / child-care facility; for single parents the care allowance is for a period of 16 calendar days. In the second wave of COVID-19 epidemic and during the second declaration of a state of emergency from the COVID -19 reasons\u00a0(started 12 October 2020) the Czech government decided that parents\u00a0will be\u00a0entitled to care allowance as\u00a0long as the ban on school attendance remains. \r\rThe allowance can be claimed\u00a0by parents taking care of:\r\r*\u00a0child under 10 years of age (The age limit has been decreased compared to the first crisis measure during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave)\r* dependent children (but not older than 26 years) participating in school attendance and being dependent on the care of another person (from grade I onwards)\r*\u00a0persons older than 10 years dependent on the care of another person using the services of daily, weekly hospitals and similar facilities\r\rThe amount of the crisis \u00a0care allowance\u00a0 is 70% of the daily basis of assessment per calendar day. However, the government set newly a minimum amount per day CZK 400 (\u20ac\u00a015 aprox.). \r\rAlso the self-employed are entitled to apply for the money.\u00a0The government has approved a financial contribution for the self-employed who are currently at home to take care of children.
