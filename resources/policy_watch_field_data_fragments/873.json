This agreement takes place in a context of crisis particularly important for the textile retail sector in Spain. Inditex has specifically announced the closure of around 300 stores in Spain.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The agreement between Inditex and trade unions articulates the procedure so that the workforce of closed stores have the option of mobility to the rest of the existing stores or to the new ones that the group will open. Likewise, Inditex will offer employment alternatives in the group's logistics areas and in its administrative central services. In this sense, a maximum of 25 kilometers is set for transfers to other establishments, always prioritizing vacancies in nearby stores in the same city or neighboring towns. Furthermore, if the transfer involves a change of address, the company will reimburse the moving expenses up to a limit of \u20ac3,000. The agreement also offers an alternative to those employees who decide not to accept the transfer proposal: the person will have the right to compensation of 33 days per year worked with a limit of two annualities (45 days for employees in the company before 2012). In any case, the agreement extends these conditions to relocated workers for one year to prioritise maintaining employment. The relocation plan is accompanied by a training plan, especially in digital skills, to be able to tackle their new tasks.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Agreement to be implemented.
