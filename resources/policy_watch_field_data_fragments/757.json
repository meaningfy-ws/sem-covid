The MASZSZ member Vasas trade union tried to re-establish talks regarding the terminated collective agreements, but with no success. Press reports said Dunaferr had not paid part of workers\u2019 wages in September, citing COVID-19 losses as the reason.\r\rAt tyre maker Continental the collective agreement was terminated after workers were \u201ctricked\u201d and fired at its Mak\u00f3 (south Hungary) plant, the tyre industry trade union GSZSZ claimed.In other places, like General Electrics and tyre maker Michelin, the collective agreements were \u201csuspended with guarantees\u201d, trade unionists said.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Terminating collective agreements allows the employer to take measures at the company without consulting employee representatives and it also ends practices like paying certain bonuses or non-wage compensation, or observing special rules about sick pay and leave.
