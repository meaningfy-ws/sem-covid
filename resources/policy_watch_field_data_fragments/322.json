The package, commonly referred to as the Anti-crisis Shield, consist of three legislative acts which all came into force on 1 April.\r\rOf the three acts, the Act amending the Act on Special Measures regrading Prevention, Counteraction and Combating COVID-19 Other Contagious Diseases and Crisis Situations Related and Some Other act of Law is the key piece of legislation regarding the unfolding economic crisis. The Act (abbreviated as the \u201cSpecial Act\u201d) is a follow-up to the initial ad-hoc regulation introduced in early March. \r\rUstawa z dnia 31 marca 2020 r. o zmianie ustawy o szczeg\u00f3lnych rozwi\u0105zaniach zwi\u0105zanych z zapobieganiem, przeciwdzia\u0142aniem i zwalczaniem COVID-19, innych chor\u00f3b zaka\u017anych oraz wywo\u0142anych nimi sytuacji kryzysowych oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In the area of income support for people performing work on basis other than employment the Special Act offers i.a. financial support. The aid is available for self-employed and freelancers (holders of contracts for performing specific tasks or umowa o dzie\u0142o, in Polish). The aid is on request, there are some limitations (those whose monthly revenue in the preceding month exceeded the average pay multiplied by three are not eligible for the aid). \r\rOriginally, the measure targeted self-employed and freelancers who could request the public aid to cover their income lost as a result of halting operations in the amount of 80% of the national minimum wage. In case of freelancers with the reported income below 50% minimum wage, they could request the amount of all their income. Self-employed paying taxes on the basis of a tax card (simplified form of a corporate income tax) could claim an allowance in a lump sum of PLN 1,300 (\u20ac290). In all cases the allowance had a form of a one-time payment. In all cases the aid was not available to those whose monthly revenue in the preceding month exceeded the average pay multiplied by three.  \r\rThe Anti-crisis Shield 2.0 (April) revised the rules, so that the condition of monthly revenue in the preceding month not exceeding the average pay multiplied by three was removed; the allowance became available on multiple times (up to three), provided it could only be claimed once a month; there was a condition of \u201cmaterial situation having not improved\u201d  for re-claiming the allowance introduced.
