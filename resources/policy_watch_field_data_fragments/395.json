The loan application will be submitted directly to the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which will also grant the funds for up to five years with the possibility of using the grace period of up to one year. This COVID-19 measure for SMEs in the tourism industry is implemented as a temporary measure under the Working Capital Lending Program and applies to requests received at HBOR by 31 December 2020 or until the use of secured funds. There is no right to credit, but HBOR makes a separate decision on each claim.\r\rThe interest rate, thanks to subsidy funds, can be zero percent for the repayment period of up to three years, and in the fourth and fifth repayment years the interest rate can be 1.5 percent (the interest rate depends on state aid regulations). The minimum loan amount that can be applied for is EUR 100 thousand and the highest is limited to EUR 1.25 million in HRK equivalent.
