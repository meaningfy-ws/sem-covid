It provides for three main measures: no recourse to short-time working, maintenance of gross pay for all active employees, and changes to the rules on taking paid leave or leave linked to reduced working hours.\r\rIn particular, the bank plans to require employees to take ten days off work, including five working days of paid leave, before 31 May, on dates set by the bank. The agreement, which implements the measures provided for by Ordinance 2020-323 of 25 March 2020, is rather balanced as it supplements the temporary measures allowed by the ordinance with a number of guarantees for employees.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "** Arrangements for taking paid leaves** \r\rPursuant to Order 2020-323 of 25 March 2020, the agreement allows the employer to impose the taking - or modification of the dates of taking - of 5 days of paid leave. The notice period is 3 days (whereas the ordinance allows this period to be reduced to 1 day). \rThe agreement reduces the number of days that can be imposed for employees whose leaves entitlements are not complete, on a pro rata basis. The agreement gives a priority for taking of leave during the period from 7 April to 9 May 2020, which undoubtedly corresponds to a desire to use up the leave before a full resumption of activity envisaged later in the year. The days of paid leave already validated are deducted from the total number of days that may be imposed.\r\r** Adjustment of working time reduction days**\r\rIn addition, the agreement allows the employer to impose or modify the dates for taking 5 working days of reduced working time (RTT) \u2013 whereas the ordinance allows the employer to impose or postpone up to 10 days of RTT \u2013] again with a notice period of 3 days. This rule applies only to employees with 20 or more days of reduced working time for the year 2020. For other employees, this rule applies on a pro rata basis.\rFinally, for employees on a specific work stoppage during the COVID-19 pandemic (for childcare, for example), the taking of leave and RTT days is imposed after this stoppage, unless it lasts 30 days at most, in which case the employee is exempt.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The agreement applies to about 17,500 employees of the LCL bank in France.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The agreement has been negotiated by all representative trade unions within the bank LCL and signed by the two largest representative trade unions representing over 50% of the votes at the last workplace elections.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/FR-2020-15_1411.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Bipartite collective agreements", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "584", "sources::title": "Ordonnance no 2020-323 du 25 mars 2020 portant mesures d\u2019urgence en mati\u00e8re de cong\u00e9s pay\u00e9s, de dur\u00e9e du travail et de jours de repos", "sources::url": "https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000041755940", "sources::d_date": "03/25/2020", "modId": "4", "downloaded_to": "0534c48ac17554caa1642367a11fbafd982cfe33894acc175a95f38b01faa266"}, {"recordId": "1986", "sources::title": "Accord collectif portant sur des mesures exceptionnelles en matie\u0300re de conge\u0301s pae\u0301s et RTT dans la cadre de la pande\u0301mie COVID-19 au sein de la Bnaque LCL", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "04/07/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "2", "actors::name": "Social partners jointly", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "3", "actors::name": "Trade unions", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}, {"recordId": "33", "targetGroups::name": "Workers in non-standard forms of employment", "modId": "14"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "1", "funding::name": "Companies", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "3", "funding::name": "Employer", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "93", "sectors::code": "K64", "sectors::name": "Financial service activities, except insurance and pension funding", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1321", "modId": "15"}
