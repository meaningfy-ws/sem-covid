The goal of the measure is to sustain companies which saw their business affected and impaired by the provisions adopted to face the pandemic and by their consequential socio-economic effects.\r\r (JMD, OJ  1135/\u0392/02.04.2020)", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure provides companies with a cash advance financed by the Greek State amounting to \u20ac1 billion in total. The funds will be provided via the 'taxis' information system as a tax-free amount, which will not be able to be offset or confiscated. \r\rThis measure is addressed to small and medium enterprises of all economic sectors, that have their seat or permanent establishment in Greece, and employ at least 1 and a maximum of 500 employees, in order to deal with the specific issues that such enterprises face in terms of accessibility to credit. Private companies (general and limited liability companies, limited liability companies and private capital companies) that do not employee personnel, regardless their sector, are also eligible for the return on their advance payments.\r\rThe advance will be refunded to the Greek State within the next five years, either in total or partially, depending on the viability of each enterprise. The first year is a grace period and there is no obligation to any repayment, which will take place in equal monthly installments within the remaining four years by applying an extremely low interest rate", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Not available yet.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/GR-2020-14_676.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "569", "sources::title": "State aid: Commission approves \u20ac1 billion Greek scheme providing repayable advances to support the economy in the coronavirus outbreak", "sources::url": "https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_611", "sources::d_date": "04/07/2020", "modId": "4", "downloaded_to": "0154793974ae8e7baf8fbee803f8a91698c772e13710ebfac46da9b6f061fa06"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "10", "actors::name": "EU (Council, EC, EP)", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "5", "funding::name": "European Funds", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "567", "modId": "81"}
