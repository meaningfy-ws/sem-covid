These dismissals have a severance pay of 20 days per year worked and a maximum of one year salary, when the judge finds these cases appropriate. Although, in the case of finding them inadmissible, the compensation rises to 33 days per year worked and a maximum of two annuities.\r\rThe legal wording indicates: 'Force majeure and the economic, technical, organizational and production causes covered by the measures for suspension of contracts and reduction of working hours provided for in articles 22 and 23 of Royal Decree Law 8/2020, of March 17 cannot be understood as justifications for the termination of the employment contract or dismissal.'\r\rThus, it follows from this text that more than prohibiting these dismissals, it makes them more expensive, because, if they occur, the judge will declare them inadmissible, and therefore the compensation will be greater than if they were due to objective causes.\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No estimates exist.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners were informed and consulted before the implementation of the measure, though not formal negotiations took place", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/ES-2020-13_598.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "489", "sources::title": "Royal Decree 9/2020", "sources::url": "https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4152", "sources::d_date": "03/27/2020", "modId": "3", "downloaded_to": "78c361b88eb30b179ca851e0aadf631efb889a9cc5c7eed4ad60aaa568f6d7cc"}, {"recordId": "2130", "sources::title": "Royal Decree 30/2020", "sources::url": "https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2020/09/30/pdfs/BOE-A-2020-11416.pdf", "sources::d_date": "09/29/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "3dbb7bea9a185a9856fa2f3b2472c529076303f958ef29d0345bf5c35657d1c0"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "489", "modId": "85"}
