In the light of the above, during the COVID-19 epidemic no financial excise duty is required to obtain a security certificate for disinfectant manufacturers importing alcohol from another Member State. \r\rFurthermore, the State Revenue Service may grant a reduction of the general excise duty in the amount of up to 90 % to companies which have a special permit (licence) for the operation of an approved warehouse and which carries out production of alcohol. \r\rIn addition, the Ministry of Economy is elaborating a simplified procedure to admit into the market individual protection means against COVID-19 infection, encompassing disinfectants. The ones produced locally and recognized in the simplified procedure could be used only in Latvia, and they will not need to meet EU standard and EU mark.
