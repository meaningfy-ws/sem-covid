Moreover, it introduces a new support instrument (Cassa Integrazione in Deroga, CID) which benefits all companies with even one employee, and it simplifies the procedures for activating this measure.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Employers who suspend or reduce their activity for events attributable to the COVID-19 epidemic can accede to the Ordinary Wage Guarantee Fund (CIGO) or the Wage Integration Fund (FIS) for a maximum duration of nine weeks starting from 23 February 2020 until the end of August 2020. The periods of utilisation of the CIGO and the FIS for \"COVID-19\" reasons are excluded from the calculation of the maximum duration of ordinary treatments. Moreover, companies making use of the benefit are exempted from the additional contribution that is normally imposed on companies benefiting from wage subsidies. The decree law introduces a special measure (CID) for private employers not covered by the ordinary benefits, i.e. those employing less than 5 employees. However, domestic workers are excluded from the benefit.\rThe amount of the benefit depends on the previous remuneration: for gross monthly wages below \u20ac2,159.48, the benefit amounts to \u20ac939.89; for gross monthly wages above \u20ac2,159.48, the benefit amounts to \u20ac1,129.48.\rThe maximum spending limit is set at \u20ac1,347.2 million (for CIGO and FIS) and \u20ac3,293.2 million (CID), for the year 2020; once reached, INPS will not consider further requests.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The number of hours authorized in August 2020 is declining (279.3 million hours), from the peak reached in May 2020, when the authorizations for the health emergency amounted to 849.2 million hours (in line with what was already authorized in April 2020, i.e. 832.4 million hours).
