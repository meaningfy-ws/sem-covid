Enterprises and employers are free to implement whatever practices they deem fit as long as they remain within relevant legislation.\rAn example of a more concrete practice initiated by the government and social partners is the opportunity for free coaching and advice from the Entrepreneurship Sounding Board Foundation (\u201cstichting Ondernemersklankbord\u201d or OKB). \r\rUsually this organisation charges a fee for advice and guidance to entrepreneurs, but in the context of the COVID-19 crisis this organisation offers its services for free. The support is reserved for entrepreneurs who are especially affected by the COVID-19 crisis though the criteria which an entrepreneur must meet to be allowed to follow the programme is not immediately clear. The government indicates that entrepreneurs should first consult the Chambers of Commerce for help or information and if they are in need of further support, to register with the OKB for further coaching and advice.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The OKB is a national network with some 300 advisors with entrepreneurial experience. The organisation targets SMEs and offers them support and advice on whatever issue or question an entrepreneur may regarding their business. The OKB emphasises a personal approach, where the entrepreneur is guided through the support programme, referred to as a soundboard trajectory (\u201cklankbordtraject\u201d).\r\rAdvisory trajectories involve the personally tailored support from ex-entrepreneurs, individuals with entrepreneurial experience or who are experts in their areas. They offer support to an entrepreneur for a period of up to 6 months.  The OKB also provides extra education and training where relevant, information and knowledge exchange. The OKB has 17 regions and regional organisations in the Netherlands, allowing advisors to offer regionally relevant support to entrepreneurs; these regional advisors and experts are coordinated from a central office in The Hague. The OKB requests a donation of \u20ac200 for each advisory trajectory in principle but is waiving this fee in lieu of the COVID-19 crisis. ", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In terms of effectiveness, the OKB overall indicates that it has been active for some 40 years and hosts around 3,000 advisory trajectories per year. Of the participants, 85% of entrepreneurs indicated they are very satisfied with the OKB and the OKB contributes to preventing approximately 66% bankruptcies a year. Information on the use of this measure during the COVID-19 crisis is not yet known, however.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The overall approach taken throughout the Dutch public response to the COVID-19 measure has been to include peak level social partners throughout the policy making process. \rIn the case of some measures, sectoral, professional or regional social partners may be involved with the implementation as well. This is the case with this measure as the OKB is a non-for profit organisation which agrees to provide free services to entrepreneurs in dire need. The OKB support is an officially recommended step to take for entrepreneurs, promoted by the government. Therefore though the exact nature of the social partner involvement is not fully clear, social partners are involved in the implementation and the provision of the actual support.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NL-2020-40_1545.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Other initiatives or policies", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "2217", "sources::title": "Coaching en advies Stichting Ondernemersklankbord", "sources::url": "https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/ondernemers-en-bedrijven/coaching-en-advies-stichting-ondernemersklankbord", "sources::d_date": "11/27/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "6f3d55cabf5bbb038ad70f518fd23ef51352aeaa34b979da4f8d9f57918f9417"}, {"recordId": "2218", "sources::title": "Ondernemersklankbord", "sources::url": "https://www.ondernemersklankbord.nl/", "sources::d_date": "11/27/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "ab2284e8c62910928f54c14ca0ded8e2cf2c65e051dbd467ca70bee641fb0935"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "6", "actors::name": "Other social actors (e.g. NGOs)", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1455", "modId": "9"}
