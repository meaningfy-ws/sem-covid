The scheme aims to protect workers having particular health issues allowing their absence from work in order to protect themselves and the deterioration of the health condition.

The maximum amount that would be paid as a special sick leave may not exceed \u20ac1,214.  \r\rOn the 23 April 2020, the Cabinet amended the calculation of the payable amount to the beneficiaries in order to support as many employees as possible currently out of work or full-time work. For the purpose of paying the Special Sick Leave Benefit, the insurable earnings of the year 2018 will be taken into account, but in addition, a comparison will be made based on the declared salary of January 2020. The payable amount will be the highest amount that results from this comparison taking into account the 60% for both calculations.  \r\rAdditionally, a minimum payable amount of \u20ac356 has been defined for beneficiaries, which amount is equal to the lowest statutory pension. \r\rAn additional amendment to the Scheme is the inclusion of persons over 65 years of age who do not receive statutory pension and continue to work.
