Some of them have not been eligible for the forms of financial support implemented earlier by the Swedish Government. For instance, some of them have not been able to benefit from the state support for short-time work. \r\rTo support sole traders during the COVID-19 crisis, the Government has introduced turnover support, a new form of direct subsidy that specifically targets sole traders. \r\rTurnover support is implemented through F\u00f6rordning om oms\u00e4ttningsst\u00f6d (2020:893) till enskilda n\u00e4ringsidkare (unofficial translation: Decree on turnover support for sole traders 2020:893). ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Turnover support is available for sole traders whose turnover in March and April 2020 was less than 70% of their turnover in the same time the year before. In order to get support for May 2020, turnover must have been less than 60% in comparison to May 2019. For June and July 2020, this figure is 50%. \r\rThe decreased turnover must have been caused by the COVID-19. \r\rTurnover support covers up to 75% of the loss of turnover. Eligible sole traders can receive up to 120,000 SEK (\u20ac12,000) in support. There is no information available regarding the total budget of this measure. \r\rThe application period is between 9 November 2020 and 31 January 2021. Turnover support is administrated by the County Administrative Boards and paid out by The Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning.
