The length of debt moratorium (three or six month period) depends on the borrower.\r\rHowever, before this act was approved, many banks have introduced their own conditions under which the borrower can ask for the postponement of repayments. Now, the new law unifies these conditions.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Eligible are all borrowers who were negatively affected by coronavirus pandemic. Applicants have to ask for the payment postponement at the bank and declare that their situation is caused by anti-virus measures (unemployment, quarantine, decrease in business activity). Then both interest and principal payments would be interrupted. \r\rThe act applies to loans taken out before 26 March 2020. The debt moratorium does not apply to credit cards, overdrafts, revolving loans, operating leases or loans related to capital market transactions. Repayments cannot be deferred for loans where the debtor has been late in repayment for over 30 days as of 26 March 2020. The postponements also do not involve any fees and will not cause a negative entry in the bank register for the client, leading to a bad credit rating.\r\rDuring the deferment period, individual borrowers will be fully relieved of debt service obligations whereas corporate borrowers will continue to pay interest and fees but enjoy a holiday on scheduled principal instalments for the duration of the deferment. \r\rAlthough borrowers are able to defer their repayments and thus extend the repayment period by the time of deferral without any increase in the amount of repayments, interest continues to be charged during to the deferral period, thus resulting in the borrower paying a higher overall amount of interest.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to [Czech National Bank (\u010cesk\u00e1 n\u00e1rodn\u00ed banka, \u010cNB)] (http://www.cnb.cz), as of 16 October 2020, the number of:\r\r* approved deferred household loans according to Act 177/2020 Coll. was 212,887 with the total amount of CZK 162,690,000,000 (\u20ac5,960,432,313 approx.).
