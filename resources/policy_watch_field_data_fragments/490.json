The requests for a moratorium on loan repayment should be submitted between 1st July and 31st October 2020. The deferral of annuity payment is approved for a period of 3 to 6 months depending on the reason for requesting the moratorium, starting from the due date of outstanding annuity. \r\rThe decision on approving the moratorium is made by the Bank on the basis of submitted documentation. During the moratorium, a client is not required to pay either principal or interest on the loan. Interest on a loan will be calculated but not immediately charged. Upon expiration of the moratorium, the Bank will allocate interest that has not been collected, but is calculated during the moratorium, to the remaining annuities, until the end of loan repayment. This means that the amount of the existing annuity per loan will be increased for the amount of interest that will be calculated during the moratorium. The loan repayment deadline is extended by as many months as the moratorium has been approved, in order to further facilitate client\u2019s future monthly financial obligation Regarding the COVID-19, the reasons for deferral repayment can be job loss and salary reduction.
