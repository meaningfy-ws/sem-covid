For instance, the closure of schools in the spring 2020 increased the costs in many low-income families as they could no longer rely on school lunch or lunch provided at day care facilities.  \r\rIn order to compensate for this, the Government proposed a temporary compensation for families and persons that receive basic social assistance (in Finnish \u2018toimeentulotuki). This measure temporarily amends Act on Social Assistance (1412/1997) (in Finnish Laki toimeentulotuesta 1412/1997). ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Basic social assistance is available for individuals living and residing in Finland whose income and assets do not cover essential daily needs. \r\rThis temporary compensation can be granted to persons who received basic social assistance while the restrictions were force (between March 2020 and July 2020). Only persons who have received basic social assistance in the month preceding the payment of the compensation are eligible. \r\rThe compensation is granted automatically by the Finnish social insurance institution Kela. \r\rThe amount is \u20ac75 per month and per person. The benefit is not subject to tax nor does it affect the social assistance or any other benefits.\r\rThe total budget of this measure is \u20ac60 million.
