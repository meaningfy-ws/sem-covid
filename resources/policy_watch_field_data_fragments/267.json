One of the exceptions to this prohibition is when it is required for professional purposes. Specific preventive measures in such cases are to be taken.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The prohibition to enter public places does not apply (among few other reasons) if it is required for professional purposes. In such a case, it is to be ensured that a distance of at least one meter can be maintained between people at the place of professional activity, unless the risk of infection can be minimized by taking appropriate protective measures. The mandatory wearing of a mechanical protective device that covers the mouth and nose area as a barrier against droplet infection in areas where this is not mandatory due to other legal provisions is only permitted if the employer and employee agree.
