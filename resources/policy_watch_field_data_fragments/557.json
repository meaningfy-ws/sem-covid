The TWSCS scheme tops up the economy-wide TWSS to 100% of the childcare worker's pre-COVID-19 wage levels, up to a limit of \u20ac585 per week. \r\rFor the childcare provider, the scheme also paid 15% of payroll to cover ongoing overheads outside of pay or a minimum payment of \u20ac300 per week per childcare provider.\r\rThe scheme replaced all other state supports for the childcare sector, which are suspended for the duration of the scheme.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of Wednesday, April 22, 3,533 childcare providers had signed up for the TWSCS, out of a total of about 4,600 providers nationally.
