It aims at reorganising the medical service in a way to ensure the medical treatment to COVID-19 patients as well as other patients who need urgent medical aid. The order temporary limits the right of health workers in the public health system, care homes and private health sector.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The ordinance suspended most of preventive health services excluding services for cancer patients, pregnant women and babies, occupational medicine, vaccination and urgent cases. Health institutions can have their health workers work for another employer (in health centres, hospitals or care homes) and assign work with COVID-19 patients without their consent. During the epidemic, they have no longer the right to annual leave holiday, the right to strike, and the right to education in infected areas. The order also obliges concessionaires to work in health care centres when called on duty. Concessionaires and private volunteering contractors get paid for their work. \r\rBy rule, only people negative for COVID-19 can work, but due to the lack of workers in care homes infected persons with no symptoms are allowed to work in red zones. While medical trainees are obliged to take part in health service, many health care students volunteer in hospitals and care homes.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Measures relate to all healthcare workers in the health system, public and private alike.
