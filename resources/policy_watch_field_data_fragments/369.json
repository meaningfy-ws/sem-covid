To ensure that no one loses unemployment benefits during a very difficult period in the labour market and to prevent redundancies, the period the unemployed can receive unemployment benefits is extended until 30 June.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Under the current regulations related to the lay-off pay law, employees can receive unemployment benefits for 26 weeks within the last 18-month period. At the end of 26 weeks, the employer's pay obligation re-enters. From the social partners it has been pointed out that some laid-off workers are approaching the 26-week limit. In today's situation, they will probably be dismissed because the employer is unable to take them back into regular work. The opportunity to get a new job is small, so they will have to reapply for unemployment benefits as ordinary unemployed. To avoid this situation, the period the unemployed can receive unemployment benefits is extended until 30 June.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-13_723.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "647", "sources::title": "Prop 67 S (2019\u20132020) Endringer i statsbudsjettet 2020", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/86cb8515420749e1ae7122bf24827632/no/pdfs/prp201920200067000dddpdfs.pdf", "sources::d_date": "03/20/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "b4f378b68e17b979e34c8b5fb8d57eb7e50a50f3546b4ea54dbb437237bdfbe1"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "8", "actors::name": "Public employment service", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "35", "targetGroups::name": "Unemployed", "modId": "15"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "633", "modId": "69"}
