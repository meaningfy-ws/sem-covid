Article 71 gives public employees the right to crisis bonus during the epidemics (from 13 March to 31 May). The maximum level is 100% of hourly pay.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to the Collective Agreement for Public Sector, public servants have the right to bonus in the amount of 65% of hourly pay for hazardous work. The first COVID-19 law gives them another 35%, up to a maximum of 100 per cent.\r\rThe law says that employees who were exposed to a high health risk during the epidemics or overburdened with work have the right to crisis bonus. Directors of public institutions (health centers, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, police stations, ministries and so on) decide on who receives crisis bonus. The number of recipients was not limited.\r\rThe third COVID-19 law (ZIUOOPE) gives members of Civil Protection and other volunteers, participating in urgent interventions, the right to crisis bonus. Members of Civil Protection receive a daily bonus of \u20ac30, volunteers \u20ac10 (for work up to 4 hours), \u20ac20 (between 4 and 8 hours) or \u20ac30 (for more than 8 hours).

Distribution of crisis bonus has raised concerns about arbitrary decisions of managers as well as its justification. For instance, one hospital refused to accept COVID-19 patients from nursing homes during the epidemic. Its employees nevertheless got \u20ac776,650 in crisis bonuses.\rThe total sum spent on public employees\u2019 crisis bonus is still unknown. Until October 2020, the Ministry of Finance collected all payment requests valued \u20ac193 million in total, \u20ac42.3 million under the first COVID-19 law and more than \u20ac150 million under the Collective Agreement for Public Sector.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Up to 15 May 2020, social partners communicated with the government mostly by the written proposals. Negotiations between social partners were blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, had not appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council. On 20 April, trade unions protested against the exclusion of social partners in the preparation of emergency laws. They demanded the reactivation of the Economic and Social Council.
