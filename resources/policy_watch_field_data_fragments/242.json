To alleviate some of the pressure on companies, the government has temporarily changed the rules for tax allocation reserves, so that sole proprietors severely affected by the outbreak will receive tax cuts. \r\rIn addition, all companies will also be able to defer tax payments. \r\rThese measures are applicable retroactively from January 1 2020, and are regulated in the Tax Procedure Act (2011:1244) (Skattef\u00f6rfarandelag (2011:1244)).", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The new rules on tax allocation reserves mean that 100% of the taxable profits for 2019, up to SEK 1 million, can be set aside in the tax allocation reserve, which can then be set off against possible future losses. This means that many people can get back the preliminary tax they paid in 2019. This proposal concerns sole traders and natural persons who are partners in Swedish partnerships. \r\rAdditionally, all companies are now able to defer payments of employer contributions, preliminary tax on salary and value added tax, reported monthly or quarterly. The companies' deferral includes three months' tax payments and may be submitted for a maximum of 12 months.\r\rThe new rules are proposed to take effect on 7 April 2020 but can be applied retroactively from 1 January 2020, meaning that companies that have paid tax into their tax account in February and March can get the tax refunded from the Swedish Tax Agency.\r\rPostponement will not be granted to companies that mismanage their finances or are otherwise dishonest. Deferral may not be granted to enterprises that have greater tax liabilities.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The Swedish Tax Agency reports it has already received many deferral requests, but there are as of yet no official readily available data on uptake.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Unknown", "socialPartner_role": "Informed", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/SE-2020-1_561.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "445", "sources::title": "Ministry of Finance (2020) Economic measures in response to COVID-19", "sources::url": "https://www.government.se/articles/2020/03/economic-measures-in-response-to-covid-19/", "sources::d_date": "03/16/2020", "modId": "4", "downloaded_to": "20728a3f6c7871a7ba2d536d4ba203efdca68bf874c42c0b29c4656574d9eb24"}, {"recordId": "578", "sources::title": "Likviditetsf\u00f6rst\u00e4rkning via skattekontot", "sources::url": "https://www.regeringen.se/artiklar/2020/03/forslag-om-likviditetforstarkning-via-skattekontot/", "sources::d_date": "03/16/2020", "modId": "4", "downloaded_to": "6a8dd7fdf3b6c86aca58f02ddf76ebbd137bc7be8dffc7543ea68d67c5558a55"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "63", "targetGroups::name": "One person or microenterprises", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "452", "modId": "76"}
