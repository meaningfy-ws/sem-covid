The measure alleviates pressure on the institutions that are tasked with organizing and distributing unemployment benefits, both the National Employment Office (NEO) and the trade unions (that also play an important role in paying out the unemployment benefits). The use of temporary unemployment means that the employers no longer have to pay the wages of their employees (the cost is transferred to the government through the unemployment benefit), thereby enabling them to reduce their costs and enhances their ability to better cope with the period of inactivity of the business.\r\rThe measures makes the procedure shorter and more simplified for employees in order to make sure that they receive their unemployment benefit as fast as possible.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "From 13 March 2020, the notion of temporary unemployment due to force majeure will be flexibly applied by the NEO. All situations of temporary unemployment due to the corona virus can be considered as temporary unemployment due to force majeure, even if, for example, it is still possible to work on certain days.\r\rFor the duration of the restrictive measures, the employer is no longer obliged to send notices of temporary unemployment for reasons of force majeure to the competent unemployment office of the NEO. \r\rThe employee may use a simplified form to submit the application for benefits to the designated payment institution.\r\rThe employee receives a benefit equal to 70% of his average capped salary (capped at \u20ac2,754.76 per month). \r\rThe employee who is made temporarily unemployed due to force majeure (reason \"coronavirus\") will receive a supplement of \u20ac5.63 per day on top of the unemployment benefit, from the NEO. A withholding tax on professional income of 26.75% is deducted from the benefit. \r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "At the peak of the crisis, approximately 1.2 million employees made use of the system
