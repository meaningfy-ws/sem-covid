In order to alleviate their financial burden, a moratorium on loans for consumers and micro enterprises was enacted in the course of the implementation of the 4th COVID-19 Act on 4 April 2020 in Austria.\rThis refers to any loan agreements entered into with banks prior to 15 March 2020. Micro enterprises include entrepreneurs with less than ten employees and whose annual turnover or annual balance does not exceed \u20ac2 million.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Article 37, paragraph 2 of the 4th COVID-19 Act provides for rules on deferring the due date of payments in credit agreements concluded before 15 March 2020:\r\r* The creditor's claims for repayment, interest or amortisation due between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 2020 is to be deferred for a period of three months from the due date, if\r* the consumer suffers a loss of income as a result of the \"exceptional circumstances caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic\" which makes it unreasonable to expect him or her to provide the service owed, i.e. to pay the originally agreed debt payments.\r* In particular, the consumer cannot reasonably be expected to provide the service if his or her own or his/her dependents\u2019 \"reasonable livelihood\" is at risk.\r\rFor the duration of the deferral, the borrower (consumer or micro entrepreneur) is not in default with the payment of these services. This means that during this period, also, no interest on arrears will accrue. The originally planned term of the loan is extended accordingly by the time of the deferral.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Unknown.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No involvement.", "socialPartner_form": "Not applicable", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-14_581.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "462", "sources::title": "Innovations introduced by the 4.
