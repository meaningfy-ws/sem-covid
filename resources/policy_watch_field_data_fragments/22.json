This applies to all employments, regardless of their duration. \r\rNot applicable to the following employers: the State, municipalities, KELA, \u00c5land Government, Evangelical Lutheran Church or Orthodox Church. These employers follow four or six months re-employment obligation. \r\rFurthermore, in accordance with chapter 13 of the Employment Contract Act (2001/55), collective agreements do not have to follow the re-employment obligation set by the Employment Contract Act.

It is up to employer's organisations and trade unions to make temporary changes to regulation on re-employment obligation. \r\rThis measure does not direct involve financial support but it seeks to protect employees who have been dismissed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic from long-term unemployment and facilitate their return to the labour market when the situation normalises.
