It is additional to regular child benefit and other support measures available to low income households.\rIt is part of a broader package of social measures adopted by the government to address the economic consequences of the crisis (Sozialschutz-Paket) and is mainly intended to ease access to benefits and services.\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Provisions for the emergency child supplement (Notfall KiZ) makes the following amendments to existing regulations governing the child supplement available to low income families:\rBetween 1 April 2020 and 30 September 2020, the provision of this means tested benefit will not be assessed on the basis of the parental income over the last 6 months, but instead only over the last month (to take account of families suffering a dramatic, immediate and potentially short-term reduction in income as a result of short-time working or unemployment linked to the crisis).\rNo information has to be provided on savings and other resources available to the family. This provision is aimed to speed up the claims process.\r\rThe benefit remains targeted at low income families, with eligibility thresholds linked to income remaining unchanged.\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available to date (May 2020).", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Unknown", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/DE-2020-14_817.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "800", "sources::title": "Description emergency child supplement", "sources::url": "https://familienportal.de/familienportal/familienleistungen/corona/finanzielle-hilfen#anchor-link-1-154114", "sources::d_date": "05/06/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "5024f565ccf70a210fd9ef0cf8b113cd75c941ec2e492d8ba226ee72f0333138"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "40", "targetGroups::name": "Parents", "modId": "14"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "727", "modId": "57"}
