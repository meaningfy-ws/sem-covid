As a result of this, parts of the Emergency Powers Act were activated. \r\rOne of the parts that were activated was section 14 of the Act which establishes an obligation to work when requested. \r\rAt the time of writing, the obligation to work covers healthcare professionals only. This was done in order to secure functioning of the healthcare system and an adequate level of labour force in the sector. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This measure applies to all health care professionals and students who have come far enough in their studies to be able to work in the sector. All healthcare professionals between the age of 18-67 who live in Finland are within the scope of this measure.  \r\rHowever, individual helth care professionals experience, current job status and other circumstances also weigh in. Health care professionals who are caregivers to a child or other person cannot be obliged to work. \r\rPublic employment and business services (TE-services) are resposible for organising this measure and they create a database of eligible health care professionals. They will consult employers regarding their need for extra labour force. \r\rDuration of work obligation is maximum two weeks long and it can be renewed once. Salaries are paid in accordance with collective agreements. \r\rIt is also important to point out that obliging health care professionals to work is treated as last resort and it shall be used only when other options such as regular recruitment are not enough to secure functioning of the health care system. \r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "This measure has not been used in any parts of the country.
