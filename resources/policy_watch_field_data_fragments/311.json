The goal is to protect people who lose their income because of the pandemic and cannot make debt repayments. Another goal is to keep lending activities afloat despite the crisis.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Every commercial loan, mortgage or other loan contract signed before 2020 March 18 will receive a freeze on loan repayments, capital repayment and any related fees until at least 31 December 2020 (can be extended). The length of the loan will be extended by the period of the freeze. The Banking Association said the deferred loan payments would amount to about HUF 450 billion in the 9-month period, but our estimations based on partner interviews suggest it would be at most half of that amount. Clients must sign a statement (online) to opt out of the payment freeze scheme, so the default is that they do get the suspension.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Hundreds of thousands of people or about 30-50% of credit clients have indicated to their banks until April that they would not avail of the payment freeze option and continue to make payments as before. The prediction of the National Bank of Hungary on the uptake was about 30% of all individual clients at the time. In its inflation report of June 2020, the National Bank of Hungary said that the loan suspension for individuals managed to serve its purpose of replacing lost income so that consumption could stay level or flatten out. Out of a total of about HUF 1,100 billion (\u20ac3.274 million) in household loan repayments eligible for the deferral, HUF 600 billion worth of repayments were requested for deferral under the scheme. The bank estimates that 50-70% of the amount freed in this way was spent towards consumption by households (private individuals).", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "unknown", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/HU-2020-12_650.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "533", "sources::title": "Government decree 47/2020 (EN)", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "03/18/2020", "modId": "4", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "534", "sources::title": "Government Decree 62/2020 (EN", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "03/24/2020", "modId": "3", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "535", "sources::title": "Banking Association on the loan payment moratorium (press release)", "sources::url": "http://www.bankszovetseg.hu/hirek-aktualitasok.cshtml?lang=hun#a", "sources::d_date": "03/19/2020", "modId": "3", "downloaded_to": "9eb0da877f649843fd0eba8a3d779d8562032cfae68b7f622ffd4a9e583529a2"}, {"recordId": "536", "sources::title": "Banks: Hundreds of thousands continue loan payments despite freeze optio", "sources::url": "https://bank360.hu/blog/bankok-torlesztes-folytatas", "sources::d_date": "04/14/2020", "modId": "3", "downloaded_to": "6f29256b05f2269703b851a4b34f1067130941cfb3db597339ebbbfb701aac3c"}, {"recordId": "1182", "sources::title": "MNB Inflation Report June 2020 pg22", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "06/25/2020", "modId": "0", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "1858", "sources::title": "Extension of loan moratorium until 30 June 2021", "sources::url": "https://jogaszvilag.hu/szakma/2021-junius-30-ig-meghosszabbitjak-a-hitelfelmondasi-tilalmat-es-a-hiteltorlesztesi-moratoriumot", "sources::d_date": "10/22/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "fbbeaa0638f8596f04a2c7d283316151c0e83efc2023be3db8520d5f143b1233"}, {"recordId": "1859", "sources::title": "Extended loan moratorium - all you need to know", "sources::url": "https://hvg.hu/gazdasag/20201021_Meghosszabbitott_hitelmoratorium_osszegyujtottuk_amit_eddig_tudni_lehe", "sources::d_date": "10/21/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "d64de2ed902e5a796d4ad74839ae6612986f1a6095628db06417e91ee2321620"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "1", "funding::name": "Companies", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "93", "sectors::code": "K64", "sectors::name": "Financial service activities, except insurance and pension funding", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [{"recordId": "384", "updates::d_date": "10/20/2020", "updates::description": "An extension of the suspension (moratorium) on loan repayments until 30 June 2021:\r\rThe law targets certain special social groups (pensioners, parents and expectant parents, registered job-seekers and people in public works schemes) as well as people undergoing a \"personal bankruptcy procedure\".
