As such, municipalities have also been closely involved in implementing measures to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on people and organisations. \r\rThe second wave of COVID-19 has proven to be heavy on local governments. With the measures in place, the extra costs for the local governments are rising, yet they still have to provide sound, regular services to their inhabitants. In order to make sure that the local governments can continue to serve their inhabitants, the government is introducing a new financial compensation package to support them.

This social dialogue took place at the national level.\r\rThe Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations has requested the social partners\u2019 involvement in designing the measure. This measure has been designed through the existing and regular governmental meetings on financial issues, \u201cBestuurlijk Overleg Financi\u00eble verhoudingen\u201d (a consultation with the local governments about their finances).
