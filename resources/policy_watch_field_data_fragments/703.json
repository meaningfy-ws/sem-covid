This official recognition has some specific support measures in place to try and keep businesses afloat, this new measure being one of them. It allows employers to reduce a part of their labour costs by reducing the amount of working hours performed within the company.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "A company can reduce working hours collectively and therefore respond to reduced production and/or turnover due to the COVID-19 crisis. The workers concerned receive a converted salary supplemented by a lump-sum wage compensation, which covers all or part of the wage loss and is financed by a temporary reduction in the employer's social security contribution.\r\rThe measure is reserved for companies that are formally recognised as being in difficulty or undergoing restructuring with an approval period starting between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020.  This measure allows companies in difficulty or restructuring to reduce their wage costs as long as they suffer from reduced activity. The measure is very similar to one that was implemented during the 2009-2011 crisis.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No data available on uptake of the measure.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "It is unclear to what extent the social partners were involved in the design of the matter, as there is no public documentation about it available.
