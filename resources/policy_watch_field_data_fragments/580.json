Therefore, the consequences of the COVID-19 on Croatian economy should be seen primarily through this economic sector and its spill-over effects on the whole economy. As the share of exports in Croatia's GDP, primarily due to positive trends in tourism, has increased over the last 10 years, so its GDP has become increasingly sensitive to changes in exports. Negative factors, as a sudden decrease in exports, due to an exogenous event like the COVID-19, could have a very fast adverse result in significant GDP decline. Tourism is very sensitive to safety and health because if tourists do not feel safe, they do not travel. Moreover, the tourist sector is experiencing growing recruitment problems. Waiters, chefs, cleaners, and helpers in offices, hotels, and other establishments are needed, but due to the work\u2019s seasonal nature and limited employment possibilities out of season, young people are not willing to enroll in educational programs for these occupations. Further, there is a widespread lack of bakers, pastry-cooks, and confectionery makers. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Representative trade unions, the Tourism and Services Trade Union of Croatia and Trade Union of Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia on workers\u2019 side, and Croatian Employers\u2019 Association , Catering and Tourism Association, on employers\u2019 side, agreed on 25 March 2020 to suspend the Collective Agreement of Hospitality until the decision of the competent government bodies to terminate outstanding COVID-19 pandemic measures. The main goal is to aid and preserve skilled labour force in the sector, which is essential for the satisfaction of guests. The parties concluded on 8 June 2020, a new agreement that temporary postpones the increase in the level of the minimum and other wages. The parties further agreed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the worker who is temporary not working according to the employer\u2019s decision, is entitled to wage compensation in the amount of at least 50% of his or her basic wage. If the mentioned amount will be lower than the amount of minimal wage, stipulated by the Decree on minimal wage, the worker is eligible on the wage equal to the minimal wage. All other stipulations of the Collective agreement stay on force. Trade Unions accepted the Agreement fully aware that this is the case of special circumstances that employers could not expect or prevent and therefore they are not responsible for them.
