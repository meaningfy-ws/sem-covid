Rental leases for these companies cannot be terminated in this period, either, so tenants cannot be evicted, although it is not clear if this means on any grounds at all or whether landlords can exercise some of their rights to terminate.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Under Section 3 of government decree 47/2020, the sectors selected as one most affected by the COVID-19 crisis will receive protection from rent increase or rental contract termination. The measure applies to sectors where businesses typically rent rather than own their premises and where the economic impacts of covid-19 have caused financial strains. Although the measure does not specificy if rental contracts are banned from termination even if no rent is paid by the tenant at all, experts agree that with the eviction ban in place, tenants are likely to get away with not paying at all during the 'state of emergency' period while their business is likely to be closed down.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The measure could affect about 50,000 compaies, mainly SMEs in the COVID-vulnerable sectors. The rule overrides any rent increases stipulated in the rental contract. Legal experts say that if tenants do not pay rent at all, landlords are likely to seek agreement on special terms rather than lose clients on a shrinking property rental market. Analysts argue that the effectiveness of this measure in supporting businesses is very low, since under the current circumstances property owners were not likely to raise rents anyway, if anything, rents are dropping on current market conditions.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/HU-2020-12_706.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "533", "sources::title": "Government decree 47/2020 (EN)", "sources::url": "", "sources::d_date": "03/18/2020", "modId": "4", "failure_reason": "Invalid URL 'http://': No host supplied"}, {"recordId": "592", "sources::title": "Orban lets caterers not pay any rent?", "sources::url": "https://index.hu/gazdasag/2020/03/19/koronavirus_berleti_szerzodes_orban_viktor", "sources::d_date": "03/19/2020", "modId": "3", "downloaded_to": "0309353faf0349ccd509be67de9820712676b9d4e037aa728716f15b491e66f8"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "60", "targetGroups::name": "Sector specific set of companies", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "77", "sectors::code": "H49", "sectors::name": "Land transport and transport via pipelines", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "83", "sectors::code": "I55", "sectors::name": "Accommodation", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "84", "sectors::code": "I56", "sectors::name": "Food and beverage service activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "122", "sectors::code": "R90", "sectors::name": "Creative, arts and entertainment activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "124", "sectors::code": "R92", "sectors::name": "Gambling and betting activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "616", "modId": "78"}
