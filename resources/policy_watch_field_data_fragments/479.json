Measures include various projects: \r\r* Less rigid requirements for construction plans to boost the construction sector.\r* Tourist vouchers to help the tourist and hospitality sector. \r* State loans and grants to compensate the loss of income.\r* Financial incentives (loans and grants) to generate new investments and creation of new jobs. \r* Less rigid requirements for construction plans in agriculture and favorable agricultural rents (discounted or free of charge). \r\rMeasures particularly address these sectors: tourism and hospitality, road transport, agriculture, manufacturing and others.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The second COVID-19 law intends to boost investments in the construction sector by an accelerated procedure in obtaining building permits. The law requires, for example, more rigid criteria from environmental organisations (at least 50 active members, 3 full-time employees holding a diploma in natural sciences, \u20ac10,000 of assets in the last three years) to participate in the procedure.\r\rThe second and third COVID-19 laws help the tourist and hospitality sectors with tourist vouchers. Tourist agencies and organisers of sports events may issue vouchers instead of reimbursement for unrealised travels or events. Payment moratorium expires in 24 months. In order to revitalise the tourist sector, each permanent resident of Slovenia gets tourist vouchers (adults \u20ac200, minors \u20ac50), valid until 31 December 2020, to be spent on accommodation. The government estimates the cost of tourist vouchers at \u20ac345 million, while the multiplier effects are estimated to be \u20ac172 million.\r\rState grants and loans co-finance the loss of income in tourism and hospitality, provide support for manufacturing in the affected border areas, encourage digitalisation of companies and development projects. Micro, small and medium-sized companies as well as large companies affected by the pandemic are eligible. On top of this, the state gives \u20ac35 million to companies in the road transport industry, financial aid for managers of ski lifts, ranging from \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac12,200 per lift.\r\rBusinesses meet less strict requirements for obtaining co-financing of investments until 30 June 2021. The incentives will be granted if the investment creates at least 10 jobs in the manufacturing or service sector, or 3 jobs in research and development within three years after its completion. The minimum threshold for investments is \u20ac12 million in manufacturing, \u20ac3 million in the service sector, and \u20ac2 million in research and development.\rAgricultural businesses may profit from less rigid requirements for building greenhouses, irrigation systems, and plantations until 31 December 2020, subsidies for the exploitation of geothermal energy for farming, or more favorable rents (discounted or free of charge) in agriculture.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "More rigid criteria for environmental organisations raise concern in the public since new rules exclude environmental organisations from the procedure in obtaining the building permit. It is believed that new rules jeopardise the protection of nature. Adoption of this regulation is one of the motives for mass protests held every Friday evening. Ten protests so far gathered from a few thousand to ten thousand people. Other issues of disputes are corruption in the procurement of security and medical equipment, replacement of some top officials, the extension of the powers of the military, police brutality and others.\r\rThe Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development (UMAR) issued a study on the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the tourist sector. It quotes data of the Statistical Office from the year 2017 when the tourist sector had a share of 8.4% in GDP and employed about 55,000 employees. Seventy per cent of income came from foreign tourists, including daily and transit guests. The closure of borders and accommodation facilities during the epidemic brought down the tourist activities. In April 2020 the income was cut by 86% compared to April 2019. Only the food delivery at home was prosperous but limited to urban settlements.\rTourist vouchers were supposed to boost tourism after the epidemic. The Ministry of Economic presupposed that about 70% of vouchers will be redeemed. On 23 August, this plan was far from being realised. The Financial Administration reported that about 20% of all tourist vouchers were redeemed until 23 August 2020. The proprietors of tourist vouchers have time to spend them until 31 December 2020.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Up to 15 May 2020, social partners communicated with the government mostly by the written proposals. Negotiations between social partners were blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, had not appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council. On 20 April, trade unions protested against the exclusion of social partners in the preparation of emergency laws. They demanded the reactivation of the Economic and Social Council. The first meeting of the Economic and Social Council was held not before 15 May 2020. Since 15 May, the Council is involved in negotiations about next emergency laws.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/SI-2020-18_908.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "971", "sources::title": "Zakon o interventnih ukrepih za omilitev in odpravo posledic epidemije COVID-19 (ZIUOOPE) [Act Determining the Intervention Measures to Mitigate and Remedy the Consequences of the COVID-19 Epidemic", "sources::url": "https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2020-01-1195?sop=2020-01-119", "sources::d_date": "05/30/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "e60622860f309f35cfeb6f7c42044d9f1d266b483136a8598246bb0eb2c86078"}, {"recordId": "973", "sources::title": "Zakon o interventnih ukrepih za zajezitev epidemije COVID-19 in omilitev njenih posledic za dr\u017eavljane in gospodarstvo, ZIUZEOP-A [Act Determining the Intervention Measures to Contain the COVID-19 Epidemic and Mitigate its Consequences for Citizens and the Economy", "sources::url": "https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2020-01-0901?sop=2020-01-090", "sources::d_date": "04/30/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "87c687ea95b0eb371f767110d2597180e5a671f7183878425babafc684c78ee7"}, {"recordId": "982", "sources::title": "The Government of the Republic of Slovenia, \u2018Government adopts the third anti-corona package", "sources::url": "https://www.gov.si/en/news/2020-05-20-government-adopts-the-third-anti-corona-package", "sources::d_date": "05/20/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "e42b2f25532e4ed264be1f6c4df7633ff3c3875527bd573942d72e189af10715"}, {"recordId": "983", "sources::title": "Employer organisations, Proposal", "sources::url": "https://www.gzs.si/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=iCqbOyglN00%3D&portalid=12", "sources::d_date": "05/13/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "6cc04516022b71d597e8dbc4c6fc81a7e6173adbb6ebe5de147bf4fa0e03760f"}, {"recordId": "1786", "sources::title": "[The impact of COVID-19 on tourism] Vpliv epidemije COVID-19 na turisti\u010dno dejavnos", "sources::url": "https://www.umar.gov.si/fileadmin/user_upload/publikacije/kratke_analize/Vpliv_epidemije_COVID-19_na_turisticno_dejavnost_MKoprivnikar/Vpliv_epidemije_COVID-19_na_turisticno_dejavnost.pd", "sources::d_date": "07/07/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "c0c504a89cd771c4b705a9602c43e9af226b7781968e8f426e62f60b46b76098"}, {"recordId": "1787", "sources::title": "[Tourist vouchers on 23 August 2020] Turisti\u010dni vav\u010derji.
