Whilst the information is put together for the needs of the crafts sector, information might also be interesting for companies from other sectors. It is available online (for free). The ZDH's FAQ site gives advice on topics, such as public and financial support measures, legal amendments to existing short-time working rules, social security issues and tax deductions or deferrals for self-employed persons and occupational health and safety issues. In addition, the ZDH published FAQs on how to deal with vocational training and trainees' examinations that usually conclude the training but might now be deferred to COVID-19.\r\rThe Confederation of German Employer Organisations (BDA) published FAQs on current short-time working rules. Short-time working rules were eased right at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak to help companies stay afloat during a time of low demand.
