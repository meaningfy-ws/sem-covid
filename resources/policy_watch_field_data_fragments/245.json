This means that individual employers affected by temporary and serious financial difficulties that could not reasonably have been foreseen or avoided will be able to receive support for a limited period of time. The aim of the measure is thus to dampen the effect of the ongoing health crisis and save jobs by easing the financial burden of wage costs for companies experiencing difficulties. \r\rShort-time work (also known as short-time layoffs) is regulated in the Act (2013:948) on short-time work (Lag (2013:948) om st\u00f6d vid korttidsarbete).\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Short-time working means that employers can reduce their employees\u2019 working hours and receive financial support from the central government to compensate for a significant part of the costs for retaining the employee. \r\rThis measure covers only the private sector. This measure is not available for sole traders. \r\rWorking-time can be reduced by up to 80%. The support is intended to correspond to 72% of the employer\u2019s costs after the reduced working hours. The maximum salary for the support is SEK 44,000 a month (\u20ac 4,400) and an employer can receive support for six calendar months, with the possibility of extension for another three months.\rThe support goes to the employer, not to the employee. The application for the employer\u2019s opened in April 2020 and is open throughout 2020.\r\rEmployers wishing introduce short-time work must first ensure that they have the possibility for short-time working in their central and local collective bargaining agreement. Employers whose employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement must instead sign an agreement for short-time work covering at least 70% of the employees at the operating unit.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The use of short-term work is likely to be widespread. One day after the application opened, the administrating authority - The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth - had already received 15,000 applications. \r\rBy 13 July 2020 approximately 73,500 companies had applied for support. The amount of support that has been paid out is SEK 26 billion (approximately \u20ac2.6 billion). The number of employees covered by this measure was approximately 570,000. \r\rAs 6 October 2020, 84,707 applications had been made. The amount of support that has been granted was SEK 28 billion (approximately \u20ac2.6 billion). \r\rAs of 15 January 2021, in total 94,289 applications had been made.
