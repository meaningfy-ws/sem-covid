Users of the fund tend to be small, notably micro-enterprises and are often run by individuals with a poorer socio-economic or migrant background. \rWith the aim of supporting small entrepreneurs who are hit by the COVID-19-related measures, Qredits has relaxed some of the financing conditions. \rSmall entrepreneurs can delay their loan payments for up to six months and the interest rate will be kept at 2%. The national government supports Qredits in this effort with a maximum of \u20ac6 million.
