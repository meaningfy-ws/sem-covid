An employee who wishes to be placed on sick leave simply has to send a certificate to his employer. The latter, then, makes an online declaration on the Health Insurance website so that the benefits can be paid.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "According to this measure, if the job does not allow teleworking, the employer makes a declaration on the health insurance website (ameli.fr). The employee receives the sickness benefit without any seniority condition. In order to ensure equal treatment between insured persons who are ill, those who are placed in isolation and those who are forced to care for their children under 16 years of age, the waiting period for entitlement to compensation for work stoppages is abolished during the period of a state of health emergency. The measure applies to all compulsory schemes: general, agricultural and special schemes, including the civil service scheme. The insured persons concerned will therefore receive their compensation from the first day of the stoppage.\r\rThis measure has been in effect since March 11 and remains in force until the end of the closure of the schools (whose reopening date has not been set). \r\rOnly one parent at a time (or holder of parental authority) may be issued a work stoppage. It is possible to split the stoppage or to share it between the parents for the duration of the closure of the establishment. Periods of absence from work to care for children under the age of 16 do not give entitlement to paid leave.\r\rThe measure applies to employees, seamen, clerks and employees of notaries, artists-authors, self-employed persons and contract civil servants. It is also intended for the liberal professions and health professionals benefiting from the payment of exceptional flat-rate daily allowances.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Potentially all employees of of the private sector with a child under 16 years old or a child with disabilities without age limit.
