The Storting (parliament) asked the government to introduce a temporary scheme for self-employed and freelancers who are now losing all or part of their income base as a result of the corona pandemic. The regulation (FOR-2020-04-08-735) takes effect immediately and the payments will be disbursed as soon as NAV gets a technical solution in place for the scheme.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "A compensation scheme for self-employed persons and freelancers who have lost all, or part of their income was approved by the government on 8 April. The new temporary scheme covers up to 80 per cent of income, limited up to an annual income of 6G (approx. \u20ac50,700) (1G = the basic amount in the national insurance), and applies to income that does not entitle to unemployment benefit. The scheme includes those who have lost income on or after March 16. The compensation is given from day 17 after the loss of income. One must apply in arrears for the loss of income the month before, so that The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration will know about any income for the month in which the application applies. Generally, the basis for compensation for freelancers is calculated on the basis of an average of the income reported to the Tax Administration via the current \u201ca-scheme\u201d in the last 12 months before March 2020. A shorter period can be used for newly established freelancers. Generally, the basis for compensation to self-employed persons is calculated on the basis of business income over the past three income years. The application is due in early May. The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration is already in the process of creating a digital solution that allows payments to be made automatically. The application is due in early May. Those applying for the new scheme will receive detailed guidance along the way in the application process.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The social partners have been consulted regularly during design and implementation of the measure.", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-14_724.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "647", "sources::title": "Prop 67 S (2019\u20132020) Endringer i statsbudsjettet 2020", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/86cb8515420749e1ae7122bf24827632/no/pdfs/prp201920200067000dddpdfs.pdf", "sources::d_date": "03/20/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "b4f378b68e17b979e34c8b5fb8d57eb7e50a50f3546b4ea54dbb437237bdfbe1"}, {"recordId": "648", "sources::title": "Innst. 216 S (2019\u20132020) Innstilling fra finanskomiteen om Endringer i statsbudsjettet 2020", "sources::url": "https://www.stortinget.no/globalassets/pdf/innstillinger/stortinget/2019-2020/inns-201920-216s.pdf", "sources::d_date": "03/31/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "4b63ddd8863dbc8db0cda904f3224816acb2252c72c4a341838a105c154064d6"}, {"recordId": "649", "sources::title": "New compensation scheme for self-employed and freelancers", "sources::url": "https://www.nav.no/no/person/innhold-til-person-forside/nyheter/endringer-i-permitterings-og-dagpengeregelverket/ny-kompensasjonsordning-for-selvstendig-naeringsdrivende-og-frilansere", "sources::d_date": "04/17/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "3d91763d4d9cabfb0d3417c9206a454cefa4394eb1bfeeec4bd1b827541b1752"}, {"recordId": "801", "sources::title": "Frilansere og selvstendig n\u00e6ringsdrivende kan n\u00e5 s\u00f8ke om kompensasjon for tap av inntekt", "sources::url": "https://www.nav.no/no/person/innhold-til-person-forside/nyheter/frilansere-og-selvstendig-naeringsdrivende-kan-na-soke-om-kompensasjon-for-tap-av-inntekt", "sources::d_date": "05/04/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "0265f4557d5842c91ef072bfb13c8fbced5acd7f3ddeb8405194f4fdb5b7456c"}, {"recordId": "2429", "sources::title": "The compensation is extended - but covers less", "sources::url": "https://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/kompensasjonen-blir-forlenget-men-dekker-mindre-1.1782529", "sources::d_date": "10/05/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "bf8fa3d35d2e5cacf5cc19a1f21f4bc23307c012cd712b2eae51eefaad6da448"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "8", "actors::name": "Public employment service", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "31", "targetGroups::name": "Self-employed", "modId": "15"}, {"recordId": "33", "targetGroups::name": "Workers in non-standard forms of employment", "modId": "14"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [{"recordId": "137", "updates::d_date": "06/12/2020", "updates::description": "The 12 June 2020, a temporary law, valid through 1 November 2020, replaced the temporary government regulation.", "modId": "1"}, {"recordId": "515", "updates::d_date": "10/23/2020", "updates::description": "23 October 2020, the parliament decided to extend the compensation scheme for self-employed and freelancers until February 2021, but the compensation benefit will be reduced from 80% to 60% from 1 November 2020.", "modId": "3"}], "regions": []}, "recordId": "634", "modId": "82"}
