It is thus covered by a limited set of labour rights, like the ban on discrimination and harassment, the interdiction of child work, rules on working time, breaks, and rest periods, the prohibition of work for some specific groups. The Agricultural Act explicitly mentions viticulture, fruit growing, hop growing, and vegetable growing as sectors much in need of such unprotected and occasional labour force.\r\rThe 2020 provisions lifting restrictions to the utilization of temporary work in agriculture have been introduced to put a remedy to the shortage of immigrant workers in the agricultural sector, due to the limitations to cross-border movements caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure responds to the concern of some agricultural sectors which, after the ban on border crossing relating to the COVID-19 epidemic, remained without seasonal migrant workers. \rBy rule, \u2018temporary work in agriculture\u2019 is limited to 120 days a year. \rThe emergency regulation suspend this limitation until the end of 2020. It means that such type of work can be carried out without restriction all year. \rThe emergency regulation also stipulates that Public Employment Service may assign temporary work in agriculture to temporary laid-off persons. \rUpon the request of agricultural enterprise, the Public Employment Service sends to work a person who is temporary laid-off due to the epidemic", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Hop growers report on troubles due to labour shortage after the ban on the border crossing.
