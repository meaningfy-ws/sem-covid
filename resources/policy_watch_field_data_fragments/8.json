To cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the Government, via the Prime Minister's Decree of 4 March 2020, simplified the conditions to apply the smart working regime (lavoro agile) to the workforce. The goal is to encourage companies to employ this job scheme to ensure, when possible, business continuity.\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Article 1, lett. n) of the Prime Minister's Decree of 4 March 2020 authorises the adoption of the smart working regime without executing, with the employees, the individual agreement required by the law in normal conditions. This individual agreement contains, in general, significant dispositions steering the performance under the smart working regime, like the rules implementing the right to disconnect. Moreover, Article 1, lett. n) specifies that the informative obligations bearing on the employer according to Law No. 81 of 2017 can be fulfilled, while the measure is into force, through electronic communications.\r\rAll the workers that can realise their performance working remotely are eligible, provided that the employer wants to activate this scheme.\r\rLaw Decree No. 18 of 17 March 2020, converted into law No. 27 of 24 April 2020, further intervened on the issue of smart working: Until the end of the state of emergency, workers with disabilities or who have a person with a disability in their family unit, have the right to smart working, provided it is compatible with the characteristics of their activity. In addition, the Law Decree states that, in accepting requests to smart working, priority has to be given to workers in the private sector with reduced working capacity.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No data are available yet on the use of the measure.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No involvement of the social partners in designing, implementing and monitoring the measure.", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/IT-2020-10_221.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "80", "sources::title": "Prime Minister's Decree of 4 March 2020", "sources::url": "http://www.governo.it/sites/new.governo.it/files/DPCM4MARZO2020.pdf", "sources::d_date": "03/04/2020", "modId": "6", "downloaded_to": "1bd6e7a276b536865931abe4fea23f7645bfece78d691c73fbb7036bd8169d55"}, {"recordId": "81", "sources::title": "Smart working - Ministero del Lavoro", "sources::url": "https://www.lavoro.gov.it/strumenti-e-servizi/smart-working/Pagine/default.aspx", "sources::d_date": "03/04/2020", "modId": "6", "downloaded_to": "482796a95b9f7054a91a9e128c79dffb18f7795f69f0974e55d95bdec24773e4"}, {"recordId": "283", "sources::title": "DECRETO-LEGGE 17 marzo 2020, n. 18", "sources::url": "https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legge:2020-03-17;18", "sources::d_date": "03/17/2020", "modId": "4", "downloaded_to": "87b843afe2a51087e62c5fe1e6dcb70d7865fa44cc85ecd01cd2d48a3d897368"}, {"recordId": "1189", "sources::title": "Law Decree No. 34 of 2020", "sources::url": "https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2020/05/19/20G00052/sg", "sources::d_date": "05/19/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "b573de680c887b514db96dbb90138aa52f71fc946c65e5c05644d81829758342"}, {"recordId": "1190", "sources::title": "CGIL: smart working needs to be bargained", "sources::url": "http://www.cgil.it/lavoro-cgil-smart-working-va-contrattato/", "sources::d_date": "05/18/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "49ea76290d5b61fb5032817d57c231acb8503337e31ec0418e720507f1741941"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [{"recordId": "213", "updates::d_date": "07/17/2020", "updates::description": "Law Decree No. 34 of 19 May 2020 introduced a specific right to smart working for parents employed in the private sector.
