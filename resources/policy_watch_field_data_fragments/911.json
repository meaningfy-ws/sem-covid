The plan recommends continued vigilance and caution throughout the winter period and into 2021 when the roll out of safe and effective vaccines will hopefully occur. The Commission will then provide further guidance on a gradual and coordinated lifting of containment measures.\rThe strategy builds on previous recommendations such as the April European roadmap on the careful phasing out of containment measures, the July Communication on short-term preparedness and the October Communication on additional COVID-19 response measures.\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Commission recommends that Member States take the following actions:\r\r* Physical distancing and limiting social contacts, key for the winter months including the holiday period.\r* Testing and contact tracing, essential for detecting clusters and breaking transmission\r* Safe travel, with a possible increase in travel over the end-of-year holidays requiring a coordinated approach.\r* Healthcare capacity and personnel. Business continuity plans for healthcare settings should be put in place to make sure COVID-19 outbreaks can be managed, and access to other treatments maintained.\r* Pandemic fatigue and mental health are natural responses to the current situation. Member States should follow the World Health Organisation European Region's guidance on reinvigorating public support to address pandemic fatigue.\r* National vaccination strategies. The Commission stands ready to support Member States where necessary in the deployment of vaccines as per their deployment and vaccination plans.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Not applicable.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No involvement", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/EU-2020-49_1594.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Non-binding recommendations or other texts", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "2307", "sources::title": "A European roadmap to lifting\rcoronavirus containment measures", "sources::url": "https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/factsheet-lifting-containment-measures_en.pdf", "sources::d_date": "04/15/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "d9f6e2140efa3574cf6ca103a4c316261cfbf4253bb93b1e0814c150793d8766"}, {"recordId": "2308", "sources::title": "OMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS Short-term EU health preparedness for COVID-19 outbreaks\rCOM/2020/318 final", "sources::url": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0318", "sources::d_date": "07/15/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "030b49e73ace78b6b39203d0b49f7bc95cd8728b6d3215086b893f37ccb7929b"}, {"recordId": "2309", "sources::title": "COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN\rPARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL AND THE COUNCIL\ron additional COVID-19 response measures", "sources::url": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0687&from=EN", "sources::d_date": "10/28/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "56b37854d42541bfb6ce42cd229131000403867d248f2e0e56ac70d98fd6b243"}, {"recordId": "2310", "sources::title": "COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN\rPARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL\rStaying safe from COVID-19 during winter", "sources::url": "https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/preparedness_response/docs/covid-19_stayingsafe_communication_en.pdf", "sources::d_date": "12/02/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "a5df7a5b46d2e29cd376d7d6cdc3c4e6e3fb2f83702fa8d7f46bdcc42cfbd055"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "10", "actors::name": "EU (Council, EC, EP)", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "5", "funding::name": "European Funds", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1504", "modId": "21"}
