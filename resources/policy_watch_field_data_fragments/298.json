The assistance will be offered by way of two specific initiatives aimed at exporters: one, geared to companies with liquidity problems; the second, designed to ensure that the companies can secure insurance for their export orders from private trade credit insurance companies. \r\rIn extension of the many interventions from Denmark's political leaders to support Danish business and industry, EKF's two initiatives primarily target businesses engaged in export and internationalisation, who otherwise risk their export orders being delayed or cancelled outright.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "EKF Denmark\u00b4s Export Credit Agency launches two initiatives to assist Danish exporters under pressure from the Corona Crisis.\r\rThe first initiative, a Liquidity Guarantee, will support the many Danish exporters affected by liquidity problems in that their earnings decrease while they still have to meet supplier and payroll costs. This product offers improved conditions during the crisis.\r\rThe second initiative, which will extend EKF's existing reinsurance scheme to OECD countries, is intended to ensure that the Coronavirus Crisis does not deter private trade credit insurance companies from underwriting Danish exporters' export orders, as was the case during the financial crisis.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Unknown.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "No involvement", "socialPartner_role": "No involvement", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/DK-2020-10_630.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "510", "sources::title": "EKF", "sources::url": "https://www.ekf.dk/en/about-ekf/ekf-s-organisation/news/2020/ekf-to-help-danish-exporters-impacted-by-coronavirus-covid-19", "sources::d_date": "04/15/2020", "modId": "4", "downloaded_to": "54ef6307c019550a9f78b9f449cb6e77a34f782e3b03ebacc8a41fdd7270d3c2"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "12", "actors::name": "Public support service providers", "modId": "1"}], "targetGroups": [], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "521", "modId": "76"}
