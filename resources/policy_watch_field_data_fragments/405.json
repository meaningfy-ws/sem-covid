It is important to take flexible paths - from management to production and working methods to sales and communication internally and externally. The goal of this initivie is to maintain operations, secure jobs - and at the same time protect the health of customers and employees. For this reason, the regional government of Styria (Land Steiermark, with its support service provider SFG) and  the Chamber of Labour in the region of Styria (AK Steiermark) started their  promotion campaign 'Teleworking! Offensive' retrospectively from 1 March 2020.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The campaign supports the set up of temporary teleworking places financially.  These are investments in information and communication technology for workplaces outside the company location. This includes some hardware and software, the initial start-up and licenses. \r\rFor the incurred expenses, 50% from the regional state, and another 30% from AK Steiermark can be received as non repayable grants. Alternatively, the rent or lease of equipment is supported by covering down payments or costs for a maximum of five months. \r\rCosts for the ongoing operation of internet access, telephone, electricity etc., but also office and business equipment, such as furniture etc. are not covered. \r\rThe maximum eligible costs are \u20ac50,000 per company and \u20ac5,000 per teleworker (on average). The grant volume must be between \u20ac1,000 and \u20ac40,000. In total, funds for supporting 2,300 teleworking jobs have been set up. \r\rEligible are employers in Styria which are classified as SMEs. Excluded are one-person microenterprises, tourism and leisure businesses, nonprofit organisations, healthcare companies and people outside the SFG target group.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Between 1 April 2020 and 15 April 2020, 550 applications were received. On 22 April, over 1,000 applications were registered.\r\rOn 23 April, the funds were used and applications for the subsidy no longer possible.
