These measures have had a number of negative consequences for companies and employees, by reducing revenues or losing jobs. Given that the rules on physical distance continue to be maintained, including at work, in a context where teleworking is a desirable solution, it is necessary to support employers in using alternative forms of work.\r\rThe current normative act (Government Emergency Ordinance no. 132/2020) can stop the termination of employment contracts (between March and November 2020, more than 1.5 million employment contracts were terminated) and provides immediate support to stimulate the employment of people who have lost their jobs or were unable to get employed and who are subject to the risk of social exclusion.  Estimated costs of all proposed measures stipulated by the current GEO 132/2020: RON 4,321,260 (\u20ac888,130).", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "GEO no. 132/2020 stipulates a RON 2,500 (around \u20ac514) payment issued once to employers for each employee who has worked in teleworking arrangements for at least 15 days during the state of emergency. The amount is meant to cover expenses with goods and services that enable telework. The employers have to demonstrate the use of telework during the state of emergency. The money is granted through the National Agency for Employment from the unemployment insurance budget, from subsidies from the state budget, until 31 December, 2020. The amount of RON 2500 was established by reference to the average price of an IT equipment (laptop) with medium level technical specifications.\r\rStarting from November 2020, GEO no. 192/2020 provides the obligation of the employer to order remote working, whenever this is objectively possible. The employee can no longer oppose the employer's decision to carry out the activity remotely. In addition, the employer has the obligation to provide the means related to information and communication technology and/or secure work equipment necessary for the performance of work. However, the parties may establish by written agreement to use the employee's own equipment, specifying the conditions of use.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No info available yet.
