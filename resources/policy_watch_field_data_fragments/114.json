The main reason was to enable to transfer employees, material and medical devises between hospitals, if needed\u00a0and to assure the presence at work of healthcare employees. \r\rThis would not be possible without the announcement of the state of emergency. The state of emergency is regulated by the Act No. 227/2002 Coll. on state security in times of war, state of war and state of emergency. According to the Act, the state of emergency can be announced for a limited period of time, maximum of 90 days. Some of the fundamental rights and freedoms can be limited, as well.\r\rBased on the Government Resolution No. 366 from 10 June 2020 the state of emergency ended on 13 June 2020 midnight.\r\u00a0", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "At first, the state of emergency was announced for the state hospitals. On 18 March 2020, it was extended to other institutions (rescue services, public health offices, funeral services). \rOn 28 March 2020 it was also extended to the social service facilities providing healthcare. In order to protect older people as a high risk group, some social services facilities providing non-residential care had to close.\r \rFor the healthcare employees the state of emergency means that they are not allowed to assert some of their rights, for instance, to assert the right to strike. They are also not allowed to refuse to come to work. ", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "There are no data available yet on transferred employees, material and medical devices.
