The employee retains his or her job and has no loss of pay. The employer does need liquidity because labour costs do not decrease in the short term. However, he can release provisions and must grant correspondingly less vacation after the crisis.\rThe variant of using compensation for time off is possible if it is agreed that overtime and overtime work is not paid in money but in free time.\r\r\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Generally, on the use of holidays, there is an obligation to agree: The use of vacation must be agreed between employer and employee, if possible in writing and documented. Time off in lieu must also always be agreed between the employer and employee.\r\rExceptionally, the employer can unilaterally order leave and time off if measures according to a the Second COVID-19 Law lead to restrictions on entering holdings and as a result of such measures, services cannot be provided. In this case, the employer can (but does not have to) order the consumption of leave within the following framework: \r\r* Leave entitlement from previous years in full;\r* Leave entitlements from the current leave year to a maximum of two weeks;\r* In total, a maximum of 8 weeks of leave and time off in lieu can be order unilaterally by the employer.\r\rThe Civil Code of Austria (ABGB) was changed accordingly in order to allow for this crisis measure.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Currently no information available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The social partners were consulted on the COVID-19 laws.", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-12_542.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "433", "sources::title": "WKO Factsheet on the use of holiday and time credits", "sources::url": "https://www.wko.at/service/factsheet-urlaubsverbrauch.pdf", "sources::d_date": "02/25/2020", "modId": "3", "downloaded_to": "41c70a59a93b8752eeff86f561684bd4c57d743405bf764f75968d6ffa746129"}, {"recordId": "1102", "sources::title": "Second COVID-19 Law", "sources::url": "https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblAuth/BGBLA_2020_I_16/BGBLA_2020_I_16.html", "sources::d_date": "03/21/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "d4e0fa3f9d1ac60d07f17455c2e3bac41d42746bb6dde7f749fa5216d534afc9"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "433", "modId": "81"}
