For the time when a worker will not work, their employer will pay an allowance of 80% of the wage and subsequently be compensated by the state. Employers who cannot provide at least 10% of their employees with 90% of normal working time, i.e. 36 hours of work per week, will meet the basic qualifying condition for the subsidy. \rEmployers can apply for this measure every month in the period from 1 June to 31 December 2020", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure aims at the protection and retention of jobs. The measure helps companies to overcome temporary stagnation and prevent layoffs by subsidising up to 50% of full-time wages. \rWorkers covered by short-time subsidies scheme work at least 20 hours a week while, for the remaining working time, they are temporary laid off. \rFor this part of working time (from 5 to 20 hours a week), the state pays monthly wage compensation:\r\r* \u20ac448 for 20\u201324 hours per week.\r* \u20ac336 for 25\u201329 hours.\r* \u20ac224 for 30\u201334 hours. \r* \u20ac112 for 35 hours.\r\rEmployers must meet the following conditions:\r\r*  Be registered in the Slovenian Business Register before 13 March 2020;\r* employ full-time workers.\r* Cannot provide at least 10% of his employees with at least 90% of the work load.\r* Are not direct or indirect budget users.\r* Conduct consultations with trade unions or work councils (or workers directly) about the number of employees working under short-time subsidies scheme, their working hours and duration of the measure.\r* Notify the Employment Service of Slovenia about short-time work. \r\rAn employee who temporarily works short-time retains all rights and obligations as he or she would work full-time. Temporary short-time employees may register at the Employment Service and participate in active labour market policy measures.\rDuring short-time scheme, employers are not allowed to:\r\r* Start dismissal procedure for subsidised short-time worker up to one month after the end of the short-time work scheme.\r* Dismiss a higher number of employees.\r* Demand overtime or uneven distribution of working-time if this work could have been performed by the employees temporarily waiting for work.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Slovenian employers have submitted requests for short-time work subsidies for 20,556 employees just a week after the introduction of the scheme designed to help businesses, show data by the Employment Service.\rThe short-time measure seems to be much less popular than the temporary layoff scheme.
