This \"wave of rehabilitation\" will generate, according to PNIEC estimates, some 48,000 net annual jobs between 2021 and 2030.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The PREE will be coordinated by the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), dependent on MITECO. Based on the regulatory bases approved today by the Council of Ministers, the Autonomous Communities and Cities must make and publish their respective call for aid.\r\rIn the calls published by each region, communities of owners, renewable energy communities and citizen energy communities, individual owners of buildings, whether natural or legal persons, groups of building owners, operating companies, tenants or building concessionaires, may be submitted, companies or energy service providers, and local entities.\r\rThe actions eligible for PREE are the following ones:\r\r* Improvement of the building's thermal envelope \r*Improving the energy efficiency of thermal installations, for example, heating, air conditioning or production of sanitary hot water, with alternatives such as:\r* Substitution of conventional energy for solar thermal energy.\r* Substitution of conventional energy for geothermal energy.\r* Substitution of conventional energy for biomass in thermal installations.\r* Improved energy efficiency of generation subsystems not previously included, such as the heat pump.\r* Improvement of the energy efficiency of distribution, regulation, control and emission subsystems of thermal installations. At this point, home automation systems, monitoring systems and other digital systems are included that allow better management and reduction of the building's energy consumption.\r* Improvement of lighting installations.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No data available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No involvement of social partners.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/ES-2020-32_1301.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1907", "sources::title": "Royal Decree 737/2020", "sources::url": "https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2020/08/06/pdfs/BOE-A-2020-9273.pdf", "sources::d_date": "08/04/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "ef6728978bf7b95676c9a3b9f83b6b8d7d2d7d97ec35091515c9766a534f48c9"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "7", "actors::name": "Local / regional government", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "10", "actors::name": "EU (Council, EC, EP)", "modId": "0"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "32", "targetGroups::name": "Particular professions", "modId": "14"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "5", "funding::name": "European Funds", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "6", "funding::name": "Local funds", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1211", "modId": "15"}
