Improved conditions for receiving loans are based on the European Unions \"Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak\u201c. This measure is part of a broader rescue package for the German economy adpoted by the Federal Government at the end of March 2020. The package also includes changes in tax law, all of them directed at easing tax burdens for companies and also includes easier acces to loans, start-up support or financial help for solo- or micro entrepreneurs, eased up rules for short-time work and eased up rules regards insolvency proceedings.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The companies in need of financial assistance due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak can apply for loans worth up up to \u20ac1 billion.

To improve companies\u2018 chances to receive such a loan, the KfW bank (the German Credit Institute for Reconstruction) takes over the risks borne by the company\u2019s house bank (80% of the risks for large companies and even 90% of the risks for SMEs).
