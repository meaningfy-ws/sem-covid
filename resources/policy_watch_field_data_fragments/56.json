Pursuant to Article 47 of the LC, the employer may declare idle time for an employee or a group of employees, inter alia, if the Government declares quarantine and for this reason the employer is not able provide the employee with the work agreed upon in the employment contract. On 17 March 2020, the Seimas adopted Law No XIII-2822 adding Article 5-1 and amending Articles 24, 25, 35, 37, 41, 42 and 44 of the Law on Employment of the Republic of Lithuania (No XII-2470), which provides for the payment of wage subsidies to employers who retain jobs during idle time established as a result of quarantine. The idea is to help employers retain jobs. On 7 April 2020, the Law No XIII-2845 amending Articles 5-1, 13, 24, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 49 and 50 of Law No. XIII-2470 was adopted and new subsidy amounts were approved.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "When the government declares a state of emergency and quarantine and for this reason the employer is not able to provide employees with the work agreed upon in the employment contract, the employer has the right to establish idle time or partial idle time. According to the amendments to the Law, the amount of the subsidy may reach 90% or 70% of the wage amount subject to the employer's choice. If the employer contributes 10% and chooses a 90% subsidy, the state will contribute max. one minimum monthly wage (MMW) (\u20ac607 gross); if the employer chooses a 70% subsidy, the state will be able to contribute more - 1.5 MMW or \u20ac910.5 gross. Wages accrued during idle time may not exceed those fixed earlier in the employment contract. Payment of the subsidy shall be terminated when the government revokes the emergency or quarantine. Employers shall have to inform the State Labour Inspectorate on the establishment of idle time for employees. Having used the subsidy, the employer is required to retain at least 50% of jobs for at least three months from the end of the payment of the subsidy. ", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, by 7 July 2020, around 23,600 employers received wage subsidies in Lithuania. The support provided to employers constituted \u20ac123.9 million. By 24 September 2020, around 24,159 employers have received wage subsidies in Lithuania; the subsidies were granted for 201,449 employees that were put to downtime. An overall budget for the measure amounts to \u20ac250 million. On 31 July 2020, around 56% (or \u20ac140.7 million) of the budget has been used. According to the data provided by the Ministry of Social Security and Labour (MSSL), a total of 24,362 employers have applied for subsidy to the PES by 9 December 2020, i.e. around 28% of the total number of employers. Until 9 December 2020, the subsidies were requested for 206,432 employees that were put to downtime (or around 23% of total employees in the private sector). The total amount paid down in wage subsidies for employees put to downtime amounted to \u20ac171.5 million on 9 December 2020.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners were informed, the tripartite meeting was not held.
