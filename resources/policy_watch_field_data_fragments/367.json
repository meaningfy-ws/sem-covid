The Regional Labor Market Councils (RAR) and the Danish Agency for Labor Market and Recruitment (START) have therefore implemented this COVID-19 'Job-VET-model' for retaining employees through remote learning. \r\rThe remote learning programs provide companies with more opportunities to retain their own employees in a situation where many companies are experiencing a downturn in business. In addition, companies have the opportunity to compensate for wage losses through \"VEU/SVU-allowance\". In addition, there are opportunities to obtain grants from other sources, such as any competency funds, etc.\r\rThe model was first launched in the service, tourism, hotel and restoration industries, and then the construction and offshore industries were added. At the same time, several other industries are on their way to be included in the model.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The 'Job-VET-model' consists of four stages: \r\r1. The needs of the labor market\r2. Agreement between the social partners and specification of professional content\r3. Preparation of project plan\r4. Selection of education provider and online learning program\r\rThe model assumes that the social partners, educational institutions and The Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment jointly put together a VET-program (online) that targets specific industries. For example, it may be competencies targeted to sales and service within the restaurant industry.\r\rCompanies receive up to 100% of their wage costs, while employees participate in distance education. The salary is covered by the \"VEU-allowance\" and may be supplemented by funds from the collective agreement on \"Competence Fund\".", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Unknown", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "n.a", "socialPartner_form": "Bi-or tripartite social dialogue bodies", "socialPartner_role": "Agreed (outcome)", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/DK-2020-13_721.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Non-binding recommendations or other texts", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "639", "sources::title": "Model med opkvalificering frem for afskedigelse udvides til flere brancher", "sources::url": "https://bm.dk/nyheder-presse/pressemeddelelser/2020/04/model-med-opkvalificering-frem-for-afskedigelse-udvides-til-flere-brancher/", "sources::d_date": "04/17/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "e47dbd3ca8a1484f4ba94afc0d1dba55c7f1da6c9d40b8c092344c62b3b712bd"}, {"recordId": "640", "sources::title": "Vejviser til COVID-19 Job-VEU modellen\rJob-VEU modellen", "sources::url": "https://bm.dk/media/13524/vejviser_covid19_-job_veu-modellen.pdf", "sources::d_date": "04/17/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "5097e7ac5832fa4d6fb6ef7cfb5f4b202c72744c670f1102ad24de06dc748388"}, {"recordId": "641", "sources::title": "Kompetencefondene", "sources::url": "https://www.kompetencefonde.dk/faq", "sources::d_date": "04/17/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "8952130988d30e7474547c8dcd57189dd587005380437ac74f20bbbd769e4d64"}, {"recordId": "642", "sources::title": "VEU-godtg\u00f8relse", "sources::url": "https://www.borger.dk/oekonomi-skat-su/SU-og-oekonomi-under-uddannelse/Stoette-til-voksenuddannelse/VEU-godtgoerelse-til-erhvervsrettet-voksen-og-videreuddannelse", "sources::d_date": "04/17/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "a8af9fbe296d75cb7b056e213f12d838d9e25c9504f5efd82cdd3ebc915d9806"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "2", "actors::name": "Social partners jointly", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "3", "actors::name": "Trade unions", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "4", "actors::name": "Employers' organisations", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "8", "actors::name": "Public employment service", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "12", "actors::name": "Public support service providers", "modId": "1"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}, {"recordId": "35", "targetGroups::name": "Unemployed", "modId": "15"}, {"recordId": "60", "targetGroups::name": "Sector specific set of companies", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "4", "funding::name": "Employers organisation", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "69", "sectors::code": "F41", "sectors::name": "Construction of buildings", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "70", "sectors::code": "F42", "sectors::name": "Civil engineering", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "71", "sectors::code": "F43", "sectors::name": "Specialised construction activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "83", "sectors::code": "I55", "sectors::name": "Accommodation", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "84", "sectors::code": "I56", "sectors::name": "Food and beverage service activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "631", "modId": "90"}
