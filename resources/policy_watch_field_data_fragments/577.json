On 27 March, the Minister for Education, Culture and Science sent a letter to Parliament explaining the need for and content of the planned measures.\r\rFollowing this first letter on plans to initiate a package of measures, a few weeks later, the announcement was made (after lobbying form the cultural and creative sector), that more support was needed. The Minister for Education, Culture and science announced on 15 April  that more financing would be provided to the sector.  In April extra budget (\u20ac300 million) has been made available by the government to raise subsidies to the institutions crucial to the sector at national and regional level.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This particular measure targets enterprises in the cultural and creative sectors who cannot make sufficient use of the generic governmental support measures.

The interest on the loan is 1% and can be paid back early (without any financial consequences attached).  \rThe government has made \u20ac30 million available to finance these loans. An institution may receive a minimum of \u20ac 10,000 to a maximum of \u20ac 500,000 per loan application. One institute can take out a maximum of two loans.
