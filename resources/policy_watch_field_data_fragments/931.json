This was in place until 16 November (and again between 7 and 25 December) and was followed by a \"strict\" lock-down from 17 November to 6 December and 26 December 2020 to 17 January 2021, which regulated additional closures (e.g. retail, personal services such as hairdressing, cosmetic studios, but also museums or libraries).\rIn order to support the Austrian economy and all those business affected by the closures, the federal government provides a lockdown sales compensation as a further aid measure as part of the federal Corona aid fund.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Companies that are directly affected by the imposed restrictions are eligible to the sales compensation. For different sectors (according to the NACE classification) and periods, different replacement ratios apply, so that a so-called \"November sales compensation\" and \"December sales compensation can be differentiated:\r\r* Companies that were directly affected by official closures in the month of November ('light' lockdown from 3 November, 'hard' lockdown from 17 November to 6 December), that is companies whose industry was affected by the ordinance according to specified NACE classes, including gastronomy and hotels, as well as personal (body related) services such as hairdressers receive a flat rate of up to 80% of the turnover of November 2019 (up to a maximum of \u20ac800,000). Any other subsidies received from the hardship fund or the fixed cost subsidy do not reduce the compensation, short-time work is also not affected. Sales which are generated through take-away foods or overnight stays of business travelers are also taken into account, i.e. they do not reduce the subsidy. Retail companies (excluding food and drug stores or pharmacies) which were affected by the measures from 17 November onwards receive a compensation of 20, 40 or 60 percent of their sales from November 2019, depending on the perishability and seasonality of the goods, the sales/earnings ratio and the probability of subsequent purchases. \r* For the month of December, a turnover compensation (up to \u20ac800,000) is granted to companies which were concerned by the imposed restrictions between 7 and 31 December 2020 or between 26 and 31 December 2020. The amount of the subsidy depends on the turnover in December 2019. Directly affected companies (sectors like in November) receive 50 percent of the loss in turnover, retail companies 12.5 percent, 25 percent or 37.5 percent.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Unknown as of now.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partner involvement is unknown.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-45_1637.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "2381", "sources::title": "Turnover compensation", "sources::url": "https://www.umsatzersatz.at/", "sources::d_date": "12/30/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "9535b8528923a426bd3bce8d0daf2f97c5523df48446955930dd321fedaf2d68"}, {"recordId": "2639", "sources::title": "80 percent sales subsidy implemented", "sources::url": "https://news.wko.at/news/oesterreich/80--Umsatzzuschuss-fuer-Gastronomie-und-Hotellerie-im-Loc.html", "sources::d_date": "11/06/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "f6a12c150152d9cbca0868d1702138a608f7281b247ab2dc1f8476e2d8c4f7ea"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "60", "targetGroups::name": "Sector specific set of companies", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "73", "sectors::code": "G45", "sectors::name": "Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "75", "sectors::code": "G47", "sectors::name": "Retail trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "77", "sectors::code": "H49", "sectors::name": "Land transport and transport via pipelines", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "78", "sectors::code": "H50", "sectors::name": "Water transport", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "80", "sectors::code": "H52", "sectors::name": "Warehousing and support activities for transportation", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "83", "sectors::code": "I55", "sectors::name": "Accommodation", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "84", "sectors::code": "I56", "sectors::name": "Food and beverage service activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "87", "sectors::code": "J59", "sectors::name": "Motion picture, video and television programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "107", "sectors::code": "N77", "sectors::name": "Rental and leasing activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "109", "sectors::code": "N79", "sectors::name": "Travel agency, tour operator and other reservation service and related activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "112", "sectors::code": "N82", "sectors::name": "Office administrative, office support and other business support activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "116", "sectors::code": "P85", "sectors::name": "Education", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "118", "sectors::code": "Q86", "sectors::name": "Human health activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "122", "sectors::code": "R90", "sectors::name": "Creative, arts and entertainment activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "123", "sectors::code": "R91", "sectors::name": "Libraries, archives, museums and other cultural activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "124", "sectors::code": "R92", "sectors::name": "Gambling and betting activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "125", "sectors::code": "R93", "sectors::name": "Sports activities and amusement and recreation activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "129", "sectors::code": "S96", "sectors::name": "Other personal service activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [{"recordId": "507", "updates::d_date": "12/27/2020", "updates::description": "At the end of December 2020, it was announced that a turnover compensation for indirectly affected companies (e.g. supplier companies) will be provided for the months of November and December 2020 for those companies which had losses of at least 40%.
