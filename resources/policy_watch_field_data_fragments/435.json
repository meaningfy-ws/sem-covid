The rebates are nationally applied except in Balearic and Canary Islands during the months of February and March 2020, since other mitigation measures were adopted in 2019 to alleviate the effects of the opening of insolvency proceedings of the Thomas Cook business group. \r\rLater in April 2020, the government has adopted a new measure addressing these types of special employment contracts mainly used in the tourism sector. These employees may access unemployment benefits in the context of ERTEs - temporary employment reduction schemes -, as when the COVID-19 crisis broke out, many of these workers had not taken up their posts. With this measure, they may have a 90-day benefit even if they have consumed their unemployment right or have not contributed enough time to be entitled to. \r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Unknown", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/ES-2020-6_835.html", "isOccupation": "Yes", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "835", "sources::title": "Royal Decree Law 7/2020.
