Furthermore, there are many single-person owned companies which are also very vulnerable in the current situation. An appeal to government  and local authorities for urgent assistance was launched on 15 March by the Independent theater producers, authors and performers, and the Association of Concert Promoters and signed by  more that 1,300 persons, most of whom are freelancers or independent authors in the sector.\r\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Ministry of Culture announced on 1 April  an emergency aid payments for freelance artists whose contributions are paid from the budget of the Republic of Croatia and who can prove that due to special circumstances conditioned by the coronavirus they have been prevented or significantly impeded from performing artistic activities. \r\rThe Ministry of Culture allows emergency payments from HRK 1,625 (\u20ac217) to HRK 3,250 (\u20ac433) net a month to independent artists whose contributions are paid from the budget of the Republic of Croatia and who can prove that due to special circumstances they have been prevented or significantly impeded from performing artistic activities. \r\rThe said emergency payment is planned for three months - from 15 March to 15 June 2020 -  and will be subject to review each month, depending on the inflow of funds from the state budget. \r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The Ministry of Culture invites professional associations and representatives of specific sectors in the field of culture, who will be particularly affected by the social and economic consequences of the epidemic, to integrate all analyzes and preliminary estimates and submit them to the Ministry.
