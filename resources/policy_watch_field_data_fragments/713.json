With the goal to continue employing people with a high level of support in sheltered workshops or offering them alternative working opportunities, they have developed guidelines to keep as many affected people at their workplaces as possible. \r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The regional labour office, the regional pension insurances and the municipal associations Rheinland and Westfalen-Lippe are organising a participation process and issued guidelines organising this process. This means that there will be an individual needs assessment to determine whether the affected person with a disability can be granted access to a sheltered workshop or another facility. Furthermore, as part of the participation process there is a qualification process to improve the participants performance ability. People with a high level of support are offered the basic module 'vocational training for people with the need for a high level of support'. After both processes are completed work at a sheltered workshop or at another facility can be resumed/started.
