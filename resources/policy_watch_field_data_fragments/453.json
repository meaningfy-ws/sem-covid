That sector is in high need of additional seasonal workers, yet there is a shortage, because of the closing of borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a reduced inflow of foreign seasonal workers.\r\rThe Special Powers Decree No. 14 of 27 April 2020 provides that during the period from 1 April 2020, employers in critical sectors may conclude successive fixed-term employment contracts.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Workers on temporary unemployment benefits can work in the horticultural and forest sector and maintain 75% of their benefits in combination with that wage.\r\rSeveral short, consecutive temporary contracts would normally automatically be transformed into open-ended contracts. In order to avoid this, there is a relaxation in the rules governing these contracts because of the crisis in critical sectors.\r\rEmployers in critical sectors may conclude successive fixed-term employment contracts for a minimum period of seven days, without being requested to utilize an employment contract of indefinite duration. Normally these successive fixed-term contracts would be changed automatically into a contract of indefinite duration.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "It is unclear (and probably too soon) to estimate the extent of the measures.
