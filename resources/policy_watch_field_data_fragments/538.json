The cultural and creative sector appears especially badly hit by the crisis and this has led to extra measures being taken. On 27 March, the Minister for Education, Culture, and Science sent a letter to Parliament explaining the need for and content of the planned measures. \r\rFollowing this first letter on plans to initiate a package of measures, a few weeks later, the announcement was made (after lobbying form the cultural and creative sector), that more support was needed. The Minister for Education, Culture and science announced on 15 April that more financing would be provided to the sector, in the amount of \u20ac300 million.\rSeveral plans were later published in May 2020 which indicated what the extra financial injection would be used for. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This particular measure aims to provide extra subsidies to some 70 cultural institutions which form the foundation of Dutch cultural infrastructure. These institutions receive standard subsidies for a programming period of 2017 to 2020. With this measure, these institutes receive extra subsidies due to the COVID-19 crisis to help these institutes to survive and to continue to offer their services to the public. The extra subsidy per institute is no more than three times the size of the subsidy received by the institute in 2018. The financing goes through one of the 6 main National cultural funds in the Netherlands.  In total the Ministry of Education, Cultural and Science puts aside \u20ac113 million and the six main funds another \u20ac40 million so that the total budget for this measure is \u20ac153 million.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available yet.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The main peak level social partners have been involved in developing the emergency packages of March 2020 and the second of May 2020.
