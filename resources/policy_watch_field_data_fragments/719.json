This form of support replaced the two forms of business development aid that companies could previously get either from the public provider for innovation funding, Business Finland, or from the Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY Centres). Unlike funding from Business Finland and ELY Centres that could be used to develop companies and find ways to adapt to the new market situation, business cost support is a form of funding that is intended to cover fixed costs that are difficult to adjust. \r\rThe legal basis for this support is Laki yritysten m\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4aikaisesta kustannustuesta (508/2020) (unofficial translation: Act on fixed-term business cost support). The application process is administrated by the State Treasury (in Finnish 'Valtionkonttori'). \r\rThe application period was open between 7 July 2020 and 31 August 2020. The support period is April 2020. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "This form of support is available for businesses whose turnover has decreased at least by 30% as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and that have costs that are difficult to adjust. \r\rThis form of support is available for companies whose total turnover for the reference period (March 2019 to June 2019) is at least \u20ac20,000. It cannot be granted if the amount of support to be paid is less than \u20ac2,000. \r\rEligibility is tied to sectors that have experienced at least 10% decrease in the overall turnover.  Exceptions can be made on serious grounds. \r\rThe minimum amount for the support is \u20ac2,000 per company. The maximum amount is \u20ac500,000. The amount of support is based on the company's turnover, the level of fixed costs as well as payroll costs. The amount is dependent on the company's turnover either in April 2020 or the average turnover of April 2020 and May 2020. \r\rCompanies that have applied or received other type of financing may apply for business cost support but this may affect the amount. \r\rThe total budget for this measure is \u20ac300 million.
