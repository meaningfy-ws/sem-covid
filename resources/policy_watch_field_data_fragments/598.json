In order to provide requesting Member States with financial assistance at favourable terms, the European Commission will raise funds on international capital markets on behalf of the EU. SURE loans will be backed by the EU budget and guarantees provided by Member States. Formally, the financial assistance will be granted by a decision adopted by the Council on a proposal from the Commission.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "SURE is a temporary scheme which can provide up to \u20ac100 billion of loans under favourable terms to all Member States. The instrument enables Member States to request EU financial support to help finance the sudden and severe increases of national public expenditure, as from 1 February 2020, related to national short-time work schemes and similar measures, including for self-employed persons, or to some health-related measures, in particular at the workplace in response to the crisis.\r\rSURE will become available after all Member States have provided their guarantees. Each Member State's contribution to the overall amount of the guarantee corresponds to its relative share in the total gross national income (GNI) of the European Union, based on the 2020 EU budget. The instrument will then be operational until 31 December 2022. On the proposal from the Commission, the Council may decide to extend the period of availability of the instrument, each time for a further six-month period, if the severe economic disturbances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak persist.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "On August 24, the first SURE loans were proposed by the Commission for the following countries:\r\r* Italy - \u20ac27.4 billion;\r* Spain - \u20ac21.3 billion, \r* Poland - \u20ac11.2 billion; \r* Belgium - \u20ac7.8 billion;\r* Portugal - \u20ac5.9 billion; \r* Romania - \u20ac4 billion; \r* Greece - \u20ac2.7 billion; \r* Czechia - \u20ac2 billion; \r* Slovenia - \u20ac1.1 billion.\r* Croatia - \u20ac1 billion;\r* Lithuania- \u20ac602 million; \r* Slovakia - \u20ac631 million;\r* Bulgaria - \u20ac511 million:\r* Cyprus - \u20ac479 million; \r* Malta - \u20ac244 million:\r* Latvia - \u20ac192 million; \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners were not directly involved in the work on this initiative.
