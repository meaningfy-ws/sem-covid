Government policy affecting working life is often made outside the interest-reconciliation forums, and, despite strong protest, consultations have little influence. Social partners are mixed in their opinions on whether their involvement would best qualify as \"informed\" or \"consulted\", many would rather see it as being in between those two categories, with little influence on the final outcome.
