In addition, funding to higher education institutions has been increased to strengthen their capacity and develop work on distance learning. Funding has also been allocated for internet-based education, also known as MOOCs (massive open online courses), which are free of charge and open to the public. Anyone who is given notice of the termination of their contract will be able to use these courses to quickly begin knowledge acquisition. To compensate for increased workload, the Swedish Council for Higher Education and the Swedish Board of Student Finance will also receive increased funding.
