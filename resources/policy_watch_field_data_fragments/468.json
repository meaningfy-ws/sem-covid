They finally agreed on the criteria for the shortening of working hours\u00a0and the government accepted the Decision on a new job retention scheme for companies affected by the coronavirus crisis on its session held on 25 June 2020.\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The scheme envisages the provision of state co-financing for wages according to reduced working hours.The measure is designed to help out employers who are forced to reduce working hours due to operating difficulties and a drop in business activities by more than 20%. The new support measure, to be in force from 1 July to 31 December 2020 will target firms from all sectors that have 10 or more employees having a revenue decline of at least 20% for the comparable month 2020 to 2019.\u00a0For employers in the manufacturing industry a drop of less than 20% is allowed.\r\rDepending on the needs of the employer, the state can co-finance wages for working time reductions between 10% to 50% of working hours per month. That means from 2.5 working days, up to 50% of the fund of monthly hours. Therefore, the co-financing of workers can be between HRK 400 and 2,000 (\u20ac53 to \u20ac264). In other words, the financial aid can be given to companies that would work 36 hours a week and shorter, but not shorter than 20 hours a week. This support will not be available for teleworkers.\r\rThe government intends to reduce the administrative burden for application to a minimum. \r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The estimated value of the investment in the new scheme will reach some HRK 3 billion (\u20ac397 million) by the end of 2020, and will be financed mostly by the European Commission's temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) program.
