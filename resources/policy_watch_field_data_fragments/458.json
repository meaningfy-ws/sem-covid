Among employers, who suffered from the corona crisis were also self-employed, of which facilities were closed or who experienced sales losses. To support these self-employed, the government adopted a special measure in the package of measures called First aid for employees, employers and self-employed.   ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Since 9 April 2020, self-employed, who interrupted their activities as ordered by\u00a0the Public Health Authority or had sales losses due to the pandemic, can ask the employment service UPSVaR for a subsidy. The sales losses should make at least 10% from 13 to the end of March and 20% in April and in the next months in 2020. The amount of the subsidy is fixed and depends on the level of losses. For instance,\u00a0in April and the next months of 2020 following subsidies are available: \r\r* \u20ac180 (20%-39.99% sales losses), \r* \u20ac300\u00a0(40%- 59.99% losses), \r* \u20ac420\u00a0(60% -\u00a079.99%) and \r* \u20ac540\u00a0(80% and more losses).\u00a0\r\rSince 1 October 2020, a modified Measure 2 is available.

The average value of the subsidy\u00a0increased from \u20ac250.6 in March to about \u20ac473.8 in April.\r\rIn the following months, the support has been decreasing.
