The Hardship Fund will\u00a0provide council tax relief to help those affected most by coronavirus. The funding will go to local authorities in England to enable them to reduce the 2020 to 2021 council tax bills of working age people receiving Local Council Tax Support. Councils will also be able to use the funding to provide further discretionary support to vulnerable people through other support arrangements such as Local Welfare Schemes.\r\rGuidance for the GBP 500 million Hardship Fund was\u00a0released on the 24th of March,\u00a0aimed at providing clarity to\u00a0local authorities\u00a0on how to allocate the funding following its announcement at Budget.\r\rThis amends s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992.\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In the Guidance issued, the\u00a0Government states that it\u00a0recognises that COVID-19 is likely to cause fluctuations in household incomes and\u00a0that, as a result, some individuals may struggle to meet council tax payments. It says that councils will already have established their local council tax support schemes for 2020-21 and that\u00a0the Government therefore expects that billing authorities will primarily use their grant allocation to reduce the council tax liability of individuals in their area, using their discretionary powers under s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992. \r\rFurther, it states that councils may also want to use some funding to deliver increased financial assistance through other local support mechanisms, having considered local circumstances.\rThe Government states that councils should expedite provision of support to individuals in their area, using existing policies and schemes to deliver assistance where practical. Where council clearance processes are considered necessary, to avoid delays, they should be kept as light touch as possible within the governance arrangements of each authority.\r\rIt also states that council tax reductions should be applied as soon as possible from the beginning of the 2020-21 financial year and billing authorities should rebill council taxpayers as quickly as practical. Authorities will want to make the local population aware of how the grant support package will be delivered, e.g. through providing information on their websites.\r\rThe Government confirms that it will fund billing authorities in full for the new burdens cost for delivering the support.\u00a0 Local authorities will wish to maintain a record of grant expenditure under this scheme, both through the council tax system and their own local support mechanisms.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "On the 16th of April, the UK Government issued more guidance, in which it stated that all working-age Local Council Tax Support (LCTS) claimants in 2020-21 (who are entitled to working-age LCTS in respect of any part of the 2020-21 council tax liability) will receive a further discount of GBP 150 under the Hardship Fund.
