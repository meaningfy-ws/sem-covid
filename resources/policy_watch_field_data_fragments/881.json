According to the trade union, previously, in the law on the emergency situation, it was determined that illness with COVID-19 is not \u201can accident at work\u201d, thus making it difficult to determine whether illness with COVID-19 can be considered as occupational disease even for those who clearly has high risk of exposure due to nature of work.
