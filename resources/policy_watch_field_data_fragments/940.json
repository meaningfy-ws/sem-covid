The scheme was introduced to ensure continued compensation for businesses that experience a large fall in turnover due to the corona situation for the period September 2020 to February 2021. \r\rThe scheme is largely based on the compensation scheme that applied for the period March - August 2020 [Eurofound COVID-19 EU PolicyWatch datebase](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-10_730).", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The new compensation scheme applies to the same industries as the previous compensation scheme and is open to enterprises with a more than 30% loss in turnover as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The new scheme emphasises a serious assessment and control of the applicant businesses before payment. Applicants must use an authorised accountant or auditor and the auditor or authorised accountant has to confirm the application before it is submitted. \r\rCompanies with a fall in turnover of at least 30% can apply for a subsidy. If the fall in turnover has been 100%, the scheme will cover 70% of the company\u2019s unavoidable fixed costs for the period September and October, 85% of the costs for November and December and 80% for January and February 2021. If the company has had a lower fall in turnover, the subsidy is reduced proportionately. The scheme is applicable to all industries with a few exceptions (finance, oil drilling, electricity production and trade, aviation, kindergartens). The new compensation scheme is administered by the Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund Register Centre, while the first compensation scheme was administered by the Tax Administration.\r\rFunding of the scheme is estimated at approx. NOK 6 billion (\u20ac573 million) for the period from 1 September 2020 to 28 February 2021. The budget proposal is an estimate allocation, which follows from regulations laid down by the Storting.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available at this time.
