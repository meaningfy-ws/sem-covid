The sector also profits from the public recovery programme and public investments in infrastructure and building retrofits. In the 2020 collective bargaining round, the construction workers union IG BAU raised demands for a wage rise, for a reimbursement of transport costs to and from a construction site and, additionally, for a COVID-19 premium. The negotiations with the employer organisation failed and the collective bargaining partners had to involve an arbitrator who decided in favour of several union demands. The social partners accepted the arbitrator decision on 17 September 2020", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "On 3 September 2020, the arbitrator decided in favour of travel-to-and-from work reimbursements, wage increases, and a one-time COVID-19 premium. The COVID-19 premia are \u20ac500 for workers and \u20ac250 for apprentices. No taxes or social security contribution apply to the premia, meaning the workers receive the full amount with no deductions. The wage increase includes a recognition of workers' travel expenses for the journey to and from work. This wage increase alone is equivalent to 0.5% increase of one hourly wage. The total wage increases, from January 2020, vary according to different regions and lie around 2%.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No data at this point.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "(1) The 2020 collective bargaining round took place, but failed. \r(2) All social partners accepted an arbitrator decision on 17 September 2020. \r(3) Employers cover the cost of the premia and wage increases.\r", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/DE-2020-36_1139.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Bipartite collective agreements", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "2043", "sources::title": "One-time premium for construction workers", "sources::url": "https://igbau.de/Binaries/Binary15091/PM-Bautarif-steht.pdf", "sources::d_date": "09/17/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "6c43c420cfcd891641fa4bd1cf358dcb2e899d29d57cd3623b71061f010fc1b7"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "2", "actors::name": "Social partners jointly", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}, {"recordId": "60", "targetGroups::name": "Sector specific set of companies", "modId": "12"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "3", "funding::name": "Employer", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "69", "sectors::code": "F41", "sectors::name": "Construction of buildings", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1049", "modId": "18"}
