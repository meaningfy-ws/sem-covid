Deferred payment must be paid in two years, until 31 March 2022, in one installment with no interest charge. It is an automatically recognized right meaning that there is no need to submit any claim for obtaining this right. Eligible are self-employed persons (including farmers) who do not employ other workers.\rThe  first and second COVID-19 laws (ZIUZEOP and ZIUZEOP-A) have introduced the right of self-employed persons to be fully exempt from paying social security contributions. Eligible persons are self-employed, clerics, associates, and farmers who cannot carry out their work. They have to make a request to Financial Administration in which they prove 10% lower income in 2020 compared to 2019 or, in cases of recently established businesses, 10% lower average monthly income compared to the pre-crisis level. Later on, beneficiaries will have to pay social security contributions if their revenue exceeds 90% of the revenue in the pre-crisis period. Tee Financial administration manages the requests for exemption from paying social security contributions. Postponed and annulled payments of social security contributions are limited to the period between 13 March and 31 May 2020. After 31 May no new claims will be accepted. In addition to these two measures, self-employed may also claim for deferred payment of income tax.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "While the COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP, issued on 10 April 2020) was in parliamentary procedure, non-governmental organizations protested against discriminatory \u201creferential period\u201d for self-employed persons. While referential period for companies was one year, it was one month (February) for self-employed. The argument was that this rule exclude many self-employed persons, as they typically receive their fees irregularly and many may have had no money inflows in February. Their proposal was not integrated into the first COVID-19 law, issued on 10 April 2020.\rTwo cultural organizations (the Association of Slovene Film Directors and the Association of Cultural Workers) organized on-line surveys on how many of their self-employed members do not qualify for the annulled payment of social security contributions. An on-line survey of the first association showed that 84% of film directors and screenwriters are not eligible, while the other association came up with the figure of one-quarter of respondents. It is mainly due to the irregularity of their income and the fact that the government suspended the payment of subsidies to the already done or agreed work (Association of Slovene Film Directors, email, 13 April 2020). Associations stressed that the emergency measure left out the most socio-economically deprived group of self-employed (\u0160u\u010dur, 2020).\r\rThe second COVID-19 law (ZIUZEOP-A from 30 April 2020) finally adopted their proposals: it extended the referential period as well as the group of eligible persons (besides full-time also part-time self-employed).\r", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The law was adopted under an accelerated procedure with no involvement of the Economic and Social Council. Its functioning was blocked because the new government, which came to power on 13 March 2020, had not yet appointed its members in the Economic and Social Council. On 20 April, trade unions protested against the exclusion of social partners in the preparation of the second emergency law (ZIUZEOP-A). They demanded the reactivation of the Economic and Social Council. The first meeting of the Economic and Social Council was held not before 15 May 2020.
