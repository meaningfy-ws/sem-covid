This is part of the package of national measures taken to mitigate effects of COVID-19.\rIt should be noted that as of April 2020, Parliament and First Chamber have agreed to the package of bills, though in this situation the cabinet did not need to formally wait for agreement in order to enact the measures.  \rIt has been introduced as bunch of emergency solutions specifically to combat or cushion the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. The measure is for 3 months, but there is budget available to extend it for other 3 months. More specifically this measure is aimed at providing the enterprise with budget to pay their costs. The ultimate aim is to keep the economy functioning (including the financial flow) till the pandemic is under control.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The subsidy for enterprises in affected sectors, or Tegemoetkoming Ondernemers Getroffen Sectoren (TOGS) is a government allowance for enterprises that are directly negatively affected by the government\u2019s COVID-19 measures. These enterprises are eligible to receive a one-time government subsidy of \u20ac4,000, and in general consist of businesses that are directly, negatively affected by the government\u2019s measures. This includes enterprises that were forced to close doors or could not operate fully because of the government\u2019s corona measures.\r\rThe main selection criteria is SBI codes, the Dutch equivalent of NACE codes. Currently this includes more sectors and sub-sectors than can be noted down here. The sectors included is adapted regularly, by the Ministry since also enterprises that were not obliged to close doors were hit hard such as small fashion shop, so these enterprises were included at a later stage and the ministry announced that the list is not complete yet (13 April 2020). Indeed, this list seems to be evolving and expanding as the crisis continues and future prognoses start to be developed.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Since the outbreak of the Corona crisis, the government has had regular and close consultation with the social partners.
