The proposal provide a legislative framework for the creation of state aid schemes and minimum aid for enterprises in the tourism sector. The schemes are designed to reduce the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures (border closures, compulsory quarantine, closure of facilities). The aid schemes cover the eligible period from the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 to 31 December 2021. The Parliament approved the measure by Act no. 342/2020 Coll. amending the Act no. 91/2010 Coll. on the promotion of tourism effective from 28 November 2020.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In response to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has prepared special assistance for entrepreneurs in tourism. It can be requested, e.g. by restaurants, cafes, bistros, hotels and guesthouses, acquaparks and swimming pools, tourist guides, botanical gardens, zoos, nature reserves, amusement parks, museums, historical monuments and tourist attractions and ski lifts and cable cars. The condition for receiving the aid from 1 April 2020 to 31 December 2021 is more than 40% decrease in revenue due to a pandemic compared to 2019. The amount of the subsidy is determined by the decrease in revenue in respective month in 2020 compared to the same month in 2019. The subsidy is provided in the amount of 4% to 10% depending on the decrease in the revenue. It must be requested monthly by a separate calculation for each month. For example, when the revenue falls by 100% (closed facility), the applicant will receive a subsidy of up to 10% of the revenue in the respective month in 2019\r\rThe government decided to cover implementation of the measure by \u20ac100 million. The estimated financial need is \u20ac10 million for 2020, \u20ac70 million for 2021 and \u20ac20 million for 2022.
