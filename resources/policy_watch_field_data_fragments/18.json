This measure was set in order to meet higher demand in food industry and to avoid unemployment of employees working in the closed hotels and restaurants with limited operation.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Due to the closure of hotels and restaurants and resulted staff redundancy on one side and a high demand for food products on the other side, the Association of Hotels and Restaurants of Slovakia and the Food Chamber of Slovakia started to cooperate. \r\rThe Association and the Chamber help hotel and restaurant employers (posting employers) and food industry employers (user employers) with transfer and with temporary work assignments according to the Labour Law framework. The cooperation is applied through the contract between posting employer and the user employer. Also an agreement between the employee and his/her posting employer is signed. A shared file was created in order to collect information on labour force offer and demand regarding these two sectors.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to AHRS estimates and evaluation, there were about 350 employees from hotels and restaurants ready to work in food industry. There was also a similar number of vacancies at user employers. This initiative had a very positive impact on employment retention. It was created at the beginning of lockdown when there was no information on the length of pandemic closure. Moreover, no detailed information on employers' support was known. It has been considered as a significant and useful help for hotels and restaurants in terms of cost savings and the creation of financial reserves.    \r", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Based on the negotiations the Association of Hotels and Restaurants of Slovakia and Food Chamber of Slovakia agreed on mutual cooperation.
