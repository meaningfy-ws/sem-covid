This is the case for, for example:\r\r1. Companies in the events sector, with many freelancers\r2. Para-medical professions such as physiotherapists, dentists, psychologists or speech therapists who are only permitted to carry out urgent interventions\r3. Specialised food and drink shops, such as chocolate and wine shops, that suffer a heavy loss of turnover due to lack of passage or tourists\r4. Painters, electricians and plumbers who are only allowed to carry out urgent repairs\r5. Farmers targeting catering customers\r\rThe compensation premium amounts to \u20ac3,000.
