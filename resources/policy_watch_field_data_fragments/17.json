This duty is regulated in the Act on Co-operation within Undertakings (334/2007). \r\rThe duration of employer-employee negotiations on temporary lay-offs is shortened from six weeks or 14 days to five days in order to facilitate fast adaptation of businesses to the new circumstances and the decreased potential to offer job for employees. \r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "All undertakings that are covered by Act on Co-operation within Undertakings (334/2007) are in the scope of this measure. In Finland, personal may be laid off when the potential of the employer to offer work to its personal has diminished (either temporarily or permanently) and the employer cannot provide the employee with other suitable work or training. \r\rThis measure is not applicable to the following employers: the State, municipalities, KELA, \u00c5land Government, Evangelical Lutheran Church or Orthodox Church. \r\rThere are no direct monetary aspects involved in this measure. However, considering that during employee-employer negotiations companies must pay employees salary whereas during lay-offs the state and unemployment funds pay out unemployment allowance (or labour market subsidy) for employees, the shortened duration of employer-employee negotiations has significant financial benefits for companies.
