ThyssenKrupp Steel faced reduced demand from Germany's automotive sector, adding to existing pressures for restructuring. The company together with the works council had to use the German short-time work scheme and ensure social distancing at work while preventing social hard ship for employees.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Management agreed in negotiations with the works council to top-up short-time work salaries, initially reaching 80% of former wage levels, and later 89%. To ensure social distancing, the company also introduced a new shift schedule with differential starting times that allowed workers to avoid contact with others. Negotiating the agreement with management was particularly difficult for the company works council because social distancing rules prohibited employee meetings in a normal (off-line) setting. A works council member interviewed in Summer lamented an erosion of solidarity among employees as a result of social distancing (Magazin Mitbestimmung 06/2020, Hans-B\u00f6ckler-Foundation). The agreement not only applies during the current pandemic but also covers future pandemic situations.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No data.
