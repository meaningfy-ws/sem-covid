Any employees or apprentices who were only partially employed during these times, receive the bonus to aliquot parts. \rBesides the bonus, a wage increase of 1.99% was negotiated for the minimum wages and apprenticeship compensation, valid for two years (instead of one year, as is usually customary in Austria) due to the \"volatile\" economic situation. The newly updated collective agreement came into effect on 1 April 2020.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The company has 225 employees, according to information on its website.
