The Scheme addresses the municipal services provided to local businesses that have been compulsorily suspended or still suspend their activities in accordance with the relevant governmental Decrees.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Eligible for the municipal tax reduction scheme are businesses that have been compulsorily suspended or currently suspend their activities due to the coronavirus pandemic. The tax reduction is applied for the following municipal fees: \r\r* the professional establishments fee\r* the entertainment and catering establishments\u2019 fee\r* the waste collection fee\r* the outdoor rent for dining purposes for restaurants/cafeterias\r* the rent for Municipal premises by businesses\r* the revenue from the exploitation of beaches\r\rThe reduction of taxes is calculated based on the type of business, the days of the suspension of the activities and the percentage of the loss of the income of businesses. The tax reduction starts from 14% for the first group (e.g., retail shops, construction businesses, and tourist agencies), to 19% for the second (e.g., hairdressing saloons, museums, restaurants, cafeterias, public and private schools), to 24% for the third group (e.g., malls, sport centers, hotels, thematic parks, nurseries), to 34% for the last group (e.g., night clubs, theaters, cinemas).
