In an extraordinary bill the government has decided to modify the period of validity for payment of the care allowance to support the parents of young schoolchildren who are homeschooling their children.

Due to COVID-19 the Czech government decided\u00a0to raise the age limit for these children from 10 to 13 years of age and parents will be\u00a0entitled to care allowance as\u00a0long as the ban on school attendance remains. Those taking care of the disabled members of the family at home following the closure of day care centres are also to be entitled to the care allowance. \r\rAlso the self-employed are entitled to apply for the money.\u00a0The government has approved a financial contribution for the self-employed who are currently at home to ensure childcare. The state will pay CZK 424 (\u20ac15,41) per day, i.e. just under CZK 14,000 (\u20ac510) per month, to all self-employed persons taking care of children aged 6 to 13, on condition that a second member of the family no longer receives the care allowance.\r\rApplications are collected online.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "**Statistics of applications for care allowance - total**\t\t\t\t\t\r\r* 1 July to 12 July: 46,661\r* 11 June to 30 June: 257,391\r* 1 May to 31 May: 231,765\r* 1 April to 30 April: 151,168\r* 1 March to 31 March: 76,208\r* 1 February to 28 February: 64,185\r\r**Statistics of applications for care allowance due to school closure**\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\r* 12 March to 12 July: 307,014\r* 1 July to 12 July: 6,068\r* 1 June to 30 June: 48,331\r* 1 May to 31 May:\t80,789\r* 1 April to 30 April: 158,689\r* 12 March to 31 March: 13,137\r\rThe payment of care allowance benefits for self-employed is the responsibility of the  [Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic] (http://www.mpo.cz).
