The implemented measures are particularly aimed at companies that have seen shrinking market and revenue as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and companies with investment projects that have experienced significant cost increases as a result of the fall in the Norwegian currency exchange rate. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Many companies selling local food, agriculture-related tourism, and companies in the reindeer industry are now experiencing a shrinking market and loss of income as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. For this group, two new grant schemes are now being introduced. One scheme gives companies opportunity to apply for funding of pre-projects to clarify, for example, new market opportunities. Such pre-projects can be supported with up to 100 per cent of approved costs, limited up to NOK 150,000. The second scheme allows companies to apply for grants to carry out developing projects. Such projects can be supported with up to 75 per cent for development costs and up to 50 per cent for physical investments needed to complete the project.
