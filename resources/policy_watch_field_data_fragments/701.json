These restrictions had a significant impact on the business activity of restaurants, cafes, and bars. Many companies had to either temporarily or permanently lay off employees. \r\rTo compensate for the economic losses and to encourage companies to re-employ workers, the Government proposed in May 2020 a model that consists of two measures: \r\r* support for re-employment and \r* compensation for the imposed restrictions on activities. \r\rThis text focuses on the former measure. The legal basis of this measure is Laki ravitsemisyritysten uudelleenty\u00f6llist\u00e4misen tukemisesta ja toiminnan rajoitusten hyvitt\u00e4misest\u00e4 (403/2020) (unofficial translation: Act on support to restaurants for re-employment and compensation for the imposed restrictions on activities).

This measure covers employees whose salary has been paid by the employer after the expiry of the restriction and for a period of three months and has totaled to at least \u20ac2,500. \r\rSupport for re-employment may be granted to cover at least 2,500 companies that employ up to 800 people.\r\rCompanies that have received other forms of financial support may apply but it may decrease the final amount. \r\rCompanies need to apply for this support measure at Keha Centre. ", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of 31 August 2020, in total 2,242 companies had applied for support.
