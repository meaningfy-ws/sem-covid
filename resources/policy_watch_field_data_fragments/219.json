The measure allows businesses to defer payment of VAT to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) until next year. Generally, businesses are required to submit a VAT return and pay the VAT they owe on a quarterly basis. However, in\u00a0his statement on the 20th of\u00a0March, the Chancellor announced that the next quarter of VAT payments would be deferred. Details are given on the Government\u2019s Business Support site.\r\rThe legislative background is the Coronavirus Act 2020, within section 79 (HMRC functions).\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Value Added Tax (VAT)\rGenerally, businesses are required to submit a VAT return and pay the VAT they owe on a quarterly basis. In his statement on 20 March, the Chancellor announced that the next quarter of VAT payments would be deferred. Details are given on the Government\u2019s Business Support site.\r\rThe deferral will apply from 20 March to 30 June 2020 and will be offered automatically so that businesses will not be required to make an application. All VAT-registered businesses will be eligible. Taxpayers will be given until the end of the 2020-21 tax year to pay any liabilities that have accumulated during the deferral period. VAT refunds and reclaims will be paid by the government as normal. HMRC have advised that customers who normally pay by direct debit should cancel their direct debit with their bank if they are unable to pay. They should do in sufficient time so that HMRC do not attempt to automatically collect on receipt of your VAT return.\r\rOn 26 March, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs\u00a0(HMRC) issued further guidance on this scheme. This underlines that HMRC will not charge interest or penalties on any amount deferred as a result of the Chancellor\u2019s announcement. Businesses will still need to submit their VAT returns on time. VAT payments due following the end of the deferral period will have to be paid as normal, and HMRC have stated that further information about how to repay deferred VAT will be available soon.\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of the 7 April, 342,000\u00a0payments were eligible for deferral, with 140,000 payments deferred by businesses.

In the period to 7th of May, 549,000 payments were eligible for deferral and 243,000 businesses deferred payment, to the sum of GBP 17.2 billion (cumulative amount of VAT deferred = GBP 22.3 billion). In the month to 7th of June, 337,000 payments were eligible for deferral and 113,000 payments had been deferred by businesses, to an amount of GBP 5.2 billion.
