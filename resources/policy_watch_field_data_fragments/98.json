The coupon can be used to pay for a future trip or part of a trip that starts no later than 12 months after the restrictions cease to apply. The terms and conditions of the coupons will be defined in the Law on Tourism. A future coupon tour will be subject to the same conditions ensuring the tour operator's obligations as if the tourist had paid for the future trip at his own expense. If the tourist does not use the coupon within 12 months, the tour operator will be obliged to return the money paid by the tourist within 14 days from the expiry of the coupon.\r\rIf the person does not agree to accept the coupon, the money for the missed tour should be returned to him/her no later than within 14 days from the date of termination of the arranged tour contract.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners were consulted only ad hoc, The tripartite meeting was not held.
