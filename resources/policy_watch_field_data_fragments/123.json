Belong to this category parents who have to look after small children during the closure of schools and kindergartens; persons who cannot come to work due to the suspension of public transport or border crossing; persons with chronic diseases; and healthy persons who have been in contact with infected people.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The measure addresses companies as well as self-employed persons, but not organizations directly or indirectly financed by the state budget. \rThe request to receive the sick-pay compensation from the Health Insurance Institute can be filed within 30 September 2020.
