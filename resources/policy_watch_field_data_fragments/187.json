Fiscal arrangements limiting the days to conduct teleworking have always existed between Luxembourg and its neighbouring countries, but the COVID-19 period required more flexible teleworking arrangements and the governments of Luxembourg, of France, of Germany and of Belgium proceeded to adaptations on existing measures.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The following arrangements were made:\r\rArrangement between France and Luxembourg: \r\rThey agreed that the current situation constitutes a case of force majeure. As of Saturday, 14 March 2020 onwards, the presence of a worker at home to conduct telework will not be taken into account in the calculation of the currently applied 29-day period. This measure is applicable until further notice. The measure has been renewed until the 31 of August 2020. \r\rArrangement between Belgium and Luxembourg: \r\rThey agreed that the current situation constitutes a case of force majeure, for which no work days are to be counted under the currently applicable 24-day rule. As of Saturday, 14 March 2020, the presence of a worker at home to carry out telework, will not be taken into account in the calculation of the 24-day period. This measure is also applicable until further notice. The measure has been renewed until the 31 of August 2020. \r\rArrangement between Germany and Luxembourg: \r\rTeleworking from the main residence can be considered as working days in the country in which the activity is usually carried out. The days of teleworking of cross-border workers during the crisis are therefore not considered for the calculation of the 19-day limit. This time-limited arrangement applies from 11 March 2020 until further notice. \r\rThis measure has been extended for cross-border workers from the three countries until the 31 of August 2020. \r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to STATEC, in 2019, 200.221 cross-border workers worked in Luxembourg.
