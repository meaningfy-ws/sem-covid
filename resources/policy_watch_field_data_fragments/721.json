Prevent and combat unemployment;\r2. Encourage and support net job creation;\r3. Encourage the professional integration of specific groups with higher difficulties in the integration into the labour market;\r4. Promote the improvement and quality of employment, encouraging more stable employment relationships;\r5. Encourage the creation of jobs located in inland areas in order to reduce regional disparities.\r\r'ACTIVAR.PT Incentive' adresses people with disabilities and/or impairments as detailed below. \r\rThis incentive corresponds to a financial support to the employer that concludes an employment contract with an unemployed registered for at least six months at the PES (transitory and until 30 June 2021, this period has been reduced to three months), who matches specific conditions (article 6). This mandatory period of registration at the PES is not required when the unemployed has a disability or impairment.\r\rThe private for profit or not for profit employer must meet the following requirements (article 3):\r\r* Being regularly constituted and registered;\r* Having completed the legal requirements required for the exercise of the activity or present proof of having started the applicable process;\r* Having the tax and contributory situation up-to-date;\r* Not being in non-compliance with regard to financial supports granted by IEFP, I.

Work-related training adjusted to the skills of the job, for a minimum period of 12 months, monitored by a tutor selected by the employer;\r2. Work-related training adjusted to the skills of the job, in a certified training entity, with a minimum workload of 50 hours, carried out, whenever possible, during the normal working hours.\r\rThe employer is entitled to financial support corresponding to (article 11):\r\r1. 12 times the value of the Social Support Index (Indexante dos Apoios Sociais \u2013 IAS), in the case of open-ended contract;\r2. 4 times the value of the IAS, in the case of a fixed-term contract.\rThe amount of the IAS in 2020 is \u20ac438.81.\r\rThis financial support is increased by 10% notably in the case of hiring unemployed persons with disabilities or impairment. The financial support is also increased when the job is located in inland areas; and when the person hired belongs to the under-represented sex in that occupation.\r\rThe employer that converts, under this Ordinance and respecting specific requirements, a fixed-term contract into an open-ended contract is entitled to a \u2018conversion award\u2019. The amount of this award is equal to twice the monthly basic wage defined in the contract, up to the limit of five times the value of the IAS (\u20ac2,194.05) (article 12, paragraph 1); transitory, until 30 June 2021, this amount is equal to three times the monthly basic wage defined in the contract, up to the limit of seven times the value of the IAS (\u20ac3,071.67).\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "This measure was launched very recently.
