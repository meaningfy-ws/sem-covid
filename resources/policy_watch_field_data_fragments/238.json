The measures include making eligibility criteria more generous and raising both minimum and maximum payout levels.\r\rThese changes are regulated in the Ordinance (2020:221) on changes in the ordinance (1997:835) on unemployment insurance (F\u00f6rordning (2020:221) om \u00e4ndring i f\u00f6rordningen (1997:835) om arbetsl\u00f6shetsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The requirements concerning who can receive money from an unemployment insurance fund have been temporarily relaxed in terms of how much people need to have worked and how long people need to have been a member of a fund. Under the previous rules, a person had have been a member of an insurance fund for at least 12 months to be eligible for payouts. Now every month of membership during the months March-December will count as four months, thus making it possible to become eligible in only three months.\r\rUnder the former system, you had to have worked at least 50% during the past 6 months (or differently distributed but equivalent). This minimum limit has now been lowered to allow a larger number of part-time workers to become eligible.\r\rBoth the highest and the lowest amounts paid out by an unemployment insurance fund have been raised temporarily to alleviate the economic impact on people who become unemployed (the highest from SEK 910 to SEK 1200 per day, and lowest from SEK 365 to SEK 510 per day). Additionally, the six initial qualifying days have been removed and the unemployment insurance funds have received funding for administration.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In only a few weeks, the number of members in the unemployment insurance funds have risen sharply.
