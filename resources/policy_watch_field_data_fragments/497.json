The scheme is intermediated via commercial banks in Malta.  \r\rThe loans can be used for a variety of purposes, including, but limited to: employee salaries (including social and health security payments); lease of establishment, including rental costs, energy and water bills; unpaid invoices; acquisition of material and stock; expenses related to postponed or cancelled contracts due to COVID-19; and maintenance costs. \r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "A Guarantee Fund of \u20ac350 million has been made available by the Government in order to guarantee loans by commercial banks in Malta, needed to meet the new financial requirements of organisations facing cashflow disruptions during COVID-19. Applications for loans are assessed by the commercial bank in question, assessment is based on the bank's credit policy criteria, and final approval rests with the commercial bank. \r\rThe loans have the following features: SMEs can avail of a maximum of loan of \u20ac2 million, whereas large enterprises of \u20ac5 million. Loans in excess of these amounts are possible (up to a maximum of \u20ac10 million for SMEs and \u20ac25 million for large enterprises) but require the prior approval of the MDB. The interest rate of the loan is to be determined by the commercial bank, but these are required to provide an interest rate reduction to organisations of at least one percentage point on the average lending rate as compared to similar loans prior to the introduction of this scheme. The term of the loan is a minimum of 18 months to a maximum of 48 months. Subject to additional terms and conditions, the term of the loan can be increased up to 72 months. The loan also has a minimum moratorium of six months, with a possibility to extend to one year. This moratorium applies to both interest and capital repayments and its extension will be considered on a case-by-case basis. \r\r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "An Economic Update issued by the Malta Central Bank in November 2020 announced that as of the end of September 453 facilities had been approved by the COVID-19 Guarantee Scheme, covering a total of \u20ac343.7 million.
