This is a voluntary action coordinated by companies and startups associated with OK!Thess and the broader technological innovation ecosystem of  the city of Thessaloniki in Greece. The  OK!Thess community includes the city of Thessaloniki, universities, the association of industries in the Northern part of Greece, association of exporters, innovation bodies, association of information technology businesses, etc. The 'COVID-19 Response Greece' consists of a team of volunteers with scientific, research background and start-uppers who offer solutions to the problems and needs arising from the pandemic. The aim of the initiative is to provide  through research, design and manufacture  free delivery of products and services such as face shields, masks, ventilators, surgical masks, on-line self-assessment monitoring systems for people suspected of having COVID-19 symptoms,etc.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Within just days of launching,the 'COVID-19 Response Greece' initiative managed to mobilise companies and produce two types of face shields and face masks. The team designed and manufactured the face shields  for free and made the design openly (under the terms of Creative Commons (4.0 International License) Attribution-Non Commercial), accessible to any companies wishing to produce them on the condition that no profits should be sought. It is clearly indicated on the 'COVID-19' Response Greece' website that 'face shields may be made available for free or at a reasonable price to cover the cost of manufacturing. In the latter case, the manufacturer must first acquire a license, the purpose of which is to exclude the possibility of profiteering'. The research and development for the shields has been undertaken by  Thodoris Aleksandros Marioglou (Project:Veltio), Harry Yeremtzes (AidPlex), Dimitris Moustakas (AidPlex), Kostas Paraskevas (AidPlex)  with support by the initiative.\r\r\rAdditionally, the team and members of the community conducted research and development for surgical masks and  non-invasive mechanical ventilation devices for patients as well as online self-assessment & remote monitoring systems for people who have potential COVID-19 symptoms. The goal of the community is to respond and mobilize quickly through research and design of practical solutions to critical problems, free delivery of products and services, open access and open innovation.The team consists of 270 volunteers, 21 organisations and has produced 8 projects.Several companies and startups involved in the OK!Thess initiative participate in the coordination of this voluntary initiative. The main objective of th OK1!Thess group is to ensure an effective innovation ecosystem in the Thessaloniki geographical area", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "At the time of writing the article (June 2020) the number of face shields delivered had reached 50,445.
