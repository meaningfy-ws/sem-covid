On the one hand, they stimulate consumers to buy locally and from sectors that are struck hard by the current crisis. On the other hand, they provide employees some additional purchasing power.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The consumer cheque is a paper cheque that the employees can spend in Belgian sectors that were most affected during the lockdown: in particular the hospitality industry, sports clubs and the culture sector. The check is granted by the employer.\r\rThe granting of the cheque must be governed by a sectoral collective agreement. If there is no sectoral collective agreement, an enterprise collective agreement must be concluded via the local trade union delegation. If there is no trade union delegation within the company, the granting must be regulated in an individual annex to the employment contract. \r\rThe maximum amount that can be granted per employee is \u20ac300. The cheque falls outside the wage standard and may not be granted to replace existing wage benefits.\r\rThe cheque cannot be granted on an individual basis. Employers are obliged to award it to all staff members or to an objectively defined category within the staff.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The measure is not finalised as of today, it is still to be launched formally.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "No data yet available.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/BE-2020-24_941.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1071", "sources::title": "Consumptiecheque", "sources::url": "https://www.unizo.be/consumptiechequ", "sources::d_date": "06/30/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "0a4675ded250fc169f9c2bb01735be7d65d55857cea2142556055eadebc72e1e"}, {"recordId": "1072", "sources::title": "Consumptiecheque: voordelen en voorwaarden", "sources::url": "https://www.acerta.be/nl/blog/werkgevers/krijgen-jouw-medewerkers-een-consumptiechequ", "sources::d_date": "06/26/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "a73a8dfc16300c9ba2c3aa1c4bf3b4a6fa699bb9d2093ea668d9af810b4b9290"}, {"recordId": "1562", "sources::title": "Consumption cheques in small retailer sector + electronic vouchers", "sources::url": "https://legalworld.wolterskluwer.be/nl/nieuws/socialeye/coronavirus-consumptiecheque-ook-in-zwaar-getroffen-kleinhandelszaken-en-voortaan-ook-in-elektronisch-formaat", "sources::d_date": "08/24/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "aa58db1bb1f671ed4f63d1b207f76761945acd8ad8e3ae35ba778ed4138cbbba"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "5", "actors::name": "Company / Companies", "modId": "5"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "1", "funding::name": "Companies", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [{"recordId": "290", "updates::d_date": "08/24/2020", "updates::description": "Consumption vouchers can now also be used for companies that fall under the joint committees for small retailers, if they were compulsorily closed for more than one month during the lockdown.
