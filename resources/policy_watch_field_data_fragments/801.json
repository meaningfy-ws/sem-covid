The legal base of the scheme is the decision of the Cabinet of the 7 October 2020 for the projects that may be co-financed by the European Social Fund and the Republic of Cyprus. The Department of Labour of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurances is the coordinator agency of the Scheme.
