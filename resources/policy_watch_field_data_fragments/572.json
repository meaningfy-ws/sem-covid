The measure is intended to help the music industry, with a special programme to be designed to focus on support for Roma musicians. The move comes after the ban on staging any concerts with an audience of more than 500 people stays in place in Hungary beyond 15 August 2020 due to the precautions on preventing a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "A sum of HUF 5.2 billion (\u20ac15.14m) was put aside for the purpose. The government wants to channel the funding through the Hungarian Tourism Agency (Magyar Turisztikai \u00dcgyn\u00f6ks\u00e9g) and has also appointed an adviser to choose 100 bands (most of which were in big festival line-ups that were cancelled) who would be supported. It is not known how much support each band is getting, but there is a limit of HUF 15 million for each live act. The bands would be performing in empty halls, without an audience. The support fund for Roma music is HUF 800 million (within the HUF 5.2 billion total). There are two additional experts advising the government on support for LIVE LEGENDS and FOLK MUSIC.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The Hungarian Association of Festivals said that according to a survey, 30% of festival organisers had put forward the date of their event to after 15 August, in the hope that the ban on larger audiences would be lifted. Two-thirds of the companies organising such events work without public funding and/or are nonprofits and the Association estimates that the ban affects 37,000 jobs directly and has adverse effects indirectly on up to 370,000 workers. It is not known how many jobs could be saved by the warehouse concert funding.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The Hungarian Association of Festivals (MFSZ) issued a statement with proposals for the government.
