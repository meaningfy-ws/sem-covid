This was especially hard for parents of children with special needs who need constant help and supervision, because of this their possibility to work, even remotely from home, was strongly affected. To mitigate the situation for such parents, the government decided to pay an emergency allowance to such persons. The relevant regulation was established based on the Social Welfare Act.   ", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The allowance is paid for one parent of a child with special needs in case that the parent cannot work due to the need to take care of their child due to the national emergency situation. It can also be paid to the foster parent, husband or wife of the parent, or legal guardian. The person must officially be on unpaid leave to be eligible for the allowance and cannot receive any other COVID-19 related financial support or national replacement income (e.g. parental benefit).\r\rThe child with special needs is defined as a child under the age of 18:\r\r* with severe or profound disability;\r\r* with moderate disability with an accompanying condition (a long list of different conditions); or\r\r* with educational special needs.\r\rThe amount of the allowance per calendar day is 70% of the previous year\u2019s salary per calendar day. The allowance is paid monthly. The minimum rate is \u20ac18 per day (around \u20ac540 which is national minimum wage per month), the maximum rate is \u20ac35 per day (around \u20ac1,050 per month).\r\rThe allowance was paid as of 12 March 2020 and during the entire time of the unpaid leave, but not longer than 31 May 2020.
