In addition, self-employed receiving unemployment insurance cannot work for their company while receiving the insurance. In case they work for the company, they lose their status as unemployed which leads to losing the insurance. \r\rIn order to support self-employed whose possibilities to continue business activities have become limited due to the COVID-19 crisis, temporary changes to the right of self-employed to unemployment insurance have been made. \r\rThe legal basis for these changes is temporary amendments to Decree on Unemployment Insurance (1997:835) (F\u00f6rordning om arbetsl\u00f6shetsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring). \r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "As a result of the temporary amendments, self-employed who receive unemployment allowance may continue with some activities related to the business operations during 2020 as long as the activities support the resumption of the operations when the market situation improves (e.g. some contact with clients or updating the company\u2019s website). This temporary amendment entered in force 13 April 2020. \r\rIn addition, the so-called five-year rule has been temporarily removed. This means that self-employed who pause operations in 2020 in order to receive unemployment insurance may do so again within the next five years and still receive unemployment insurance. This has been possible since 1 July 2020. \r\rThese measures are available for all self-employed. There is no information available regarding the total budget of this measure. \r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "As of 25 August 2020, 3,000 self-employed had been granted unemployment insurance.
