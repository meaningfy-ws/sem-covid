The Coronavirus Act 2020 is the major piece of legislation covering the government response.\r\rAs part of the further measures announced on 17 March, the Bank of England and the Treasury launched a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). This recognises that prior to the crisis, companies often sell short-term debt ('commercial paper') to the market as a quick and effective way of raising working capital/ Thus, under CCFF, the Bank of England will instead buy this short-term debt.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "As part of the further measures announced on 17 March, the Bank of England and the Treasury launched a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF).

The facility will look through temporary impacts on firms\u2019 balance sheets and cash flows by basing eligibility on firms\u2019 credit ratings prior to the Covid-19 shock.\"\r\rSo the scheme will\u00a0support companies which are fundamentally strong, but have been affected by a short-term funding squeeze, enabling them to continue financing their short-term liabilities. It is also designed to\u00a0support corporate finance markets overall and ease the supply of credit to all firms.\r\r\rThe scheme is open to larger firms whether or not they have previously sought credit in this way. It will operate for at least 12 months. The Bank of England has set out overall guidance about eligibility and notes that the scheme is \u201cnormally\u201d intended for:\r\rUK incorporated companies, including those with foreign-incorporated parents and with a genuine business in the UK; companies with significant employment in the UK; firms with their headquarters in the UK.
