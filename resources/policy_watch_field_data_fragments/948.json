As concerns the rules applicable between 1 January 2021 and 31 March 2021, there are four different cases:\r\r* Industrial companies will continue to benefit from the cyclical partial unemployment scheme in order to be able to react to disruptions in international markets. By applying the short-time working period, industrial companies commit to not laying employees off for economic reasons;\r* Companies in the vulnerable hospitality, tourism and events sectors will benefit from an accelerated access to structural partial unemployment, without limits as to the number of entitled employees. In case of proven need, these companies will be allowed to lay off up to 25% of their employees;\r* Companies affected by the health crisis, other than industrial companies and those in vulnerable sectors, may also have recourse to partial unemployment from a structural source by the accelerated route, provided, however, that they do not lay off employees. \r* Finally, if companies benefitting from partial unemployment want to lay off more than 25% of their workforce, they can only do so on condition that they provide a recovery plan in case of small companies with fewer than 15 people or a job retention plan in case of companies employing more than 15 employees.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available for the moment.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "According to the press statement by the Ministry of Employment and the Ministry of Economy, social partners adopted in \"a broad consensus\" the adopted new measures on partial employment, which were adopted in the tripartite Conjoncture Comitee.
