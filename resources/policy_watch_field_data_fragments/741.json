This support is available to self-employed people with a degree of disability of at least 50%.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The subsidy applies to disabled persons who are either self-employed in companies with a maximum of five employees at the time of application or are mainly active themselves (sole proprietors) and who can demonstrate a disability-related additional expenditure, which represents a significant burden for entrepreneurial activity.\r\rIn the face of the COVID-19 crisis, the subsidy was slightly amended: The need to demonstrate the need for the subsidy due to disability-related expenses has been omitted. The bridging subsidy is available to disabled persons whose employment is threatened by the Corona pandemic, even without proof of disability needs. This applies to applications submitted until 30 June 2020 for a period of three months. The amount received per month is at \u20ac267.\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Unknown.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The social partners' involvement is unknown.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/AT-2020-14_1248.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1675", "sources::title": "Bridging allowance for the self-employed", "sources::url": "https://www.sozialministeriumservice.at/Finanzielles/Foerderungen/Foerderungen_DienstgeberInnen/Foerderungen_fuer_behinderte_Unternehmer_und_Unternehmer.de.html#heading_Foerderungen_bei_behinderungsbedingten_Mehraufwaenden", "sources::d_date": "10/05/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "c67b00e431280affd27775c4def54eded8c28cfa68696a8e06e21ca463e08327"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "31", "targetGroups::name": "Self-employed", "modId": "15"}, {"recordId": "55", "targetGroups::name": "Solo-self-employed", "modId": "16"}, {"recordId": "63", "targetGroups::name": "One person or microenterprises", "modId": "12"}, {"recordId": "72", "targetGroups::name": "Disabled workers", "modId": "9"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1158", "modId": "19"}
