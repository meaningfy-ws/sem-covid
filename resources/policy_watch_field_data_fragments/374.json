The largest Norwegian companies largely borrow money in the credit bond market. In the near future, many of these companies will need to secure financing in this market. However, the bond market's ability to provide credit has diminished substantially in recent weeks. Liquidity is low and risk premiums are high. Previous experience has shown that the Government bond fund can contribute to a more efficient market for credit bonds. This will make it easier for the big companies to get the liquidity they need in the difficult situation created by Covid-19.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Government Bond Fund shall be used for the purchase of bonds in the market. It is established with an investment limit of up to NOK 50 billion. The presence of the fund is intended to encourage other investors to participate in the bond market as well. The Government Bond Fund\u2019s Investments in new credit bond loans will be made in cooperation with other investors and on market terms. Within a mandate set by the Ministry of Finance, the National Insurance Scheme Fund (Folketrygdfondet) will decide on which bond loans to invest in. The mandate of the Fund instructs management to seek to achieve the highest possible return on costs over time and at the same time contribute to increased liquidity and capital access to the credit bond market in Norway, within the framework that applies as for the management of the Fund. The return is measured in Norwegian kroner. In its exercise as creditor, the management of the fund shall have as its overriding objective to protect the financial interests of the fund.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Direct consultation", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-13_729.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "654", "sources::title": "Prop. 58 LS (2019\u20132020) Lov om statlig garantiordning for l\u00e5n til sm\u00e5 og mellomstore bedrifter", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/prop.-58-ls-20192020/id2694293/", "sources::d_date": "03/20/2020", "modId": "2", "downloaded_to": "87d664d05d0b4f79fffc7334a60264e610ebd2ca890251c529e4a63dfab6df39"}, {"recordId": "659", "sources::title": "Mandat for forvaltningen av Statens obligasjonsfond", "sources::url": "https://lovdata.no/dokument/INS/forskrift/2020-03-27-488", "sources::d_date": "03/27/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "9544c39c35fd6b58f164392cc60c0eebfb9e662e66afa502996fc566e2f8a553"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "64", "targetGroups::name": "Larger corporations", "modId": "14"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "639", "modId": "66"}
