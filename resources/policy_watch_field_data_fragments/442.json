The reasoning behind this is to provide a financial incentive for the unemployed to find a job faster. Because of the crisis unemployed do not have the possibility to look and apply for jobs. If their unemployment benefit would be reduced, this would punish them for reasons they do not have any control over. It is against this background, that this measure was taken by the government and made binding through royal decree.\r\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The replacement rate and hence unemployment benefit gradually decreases with time according to the duration of unemployment and the career of the wage earner. This is called the degressivity of unemployment benefits. The measure suspends this degressive element of unemployment benefits for all unemployed in Belgium.\r\rMore specifically, the phase or sub-phase of the compensation period in which the person concerned finds himself on 1 April 2020 will be extended by three months.\r\rThis also applies to persons applying for benefits during the months April to June 2020. The phase in which the unemployed person starts will be extended by the period of that phase during the months of April to June 2020.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The exact number is not yet known but the amount of (temporary) unemployed increased drastically because of the Corona crisis.
