With these grants, Innovation Norway shall contribute to the national benefit with instruments that complement the other measures the government has already introduced. The package represents an increase in Innovation Norway\u2019s framework of NOK 4.5 billion. It is distributed as follows: \r\r* NOK 2 billion to innovation grants, i.e. grants towards development activities in small and medium-sized enterprises, which are assumed to have large market potential. \r* NOK 500 million towards established grants, i.e. entrepreneurs and start-up companies with innovative business ideas that have market and growth potential but reduced access to equity. \r* NOK 1.6 billion increase in the loan limit for innovation loans. Innovation loans can be used to commercialise new solutions, strengthen working capital, and to promote companies to expand abroad. \r* NOK 300 million to interest fund support, which gives Innovation Norway the opportunity to grant interest-free periods for our customers. \r* NOK 50 million to a scheme for private innovation environments. This is in order to secure the environments that have been build up over several years, including but not limited to incubators, co-working spaces and accelerators.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information to date.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "Social partners have been consulted regularly during design and implementation of the measure.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/NO-2020-13_1211.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "No", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "New aspects included into existing measure"}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "1579", "sources::title": "New package of measures for the business community", "sources::url": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/ny-tiltakspakke-for-naringslivet--skal-hjelpe-landets-grundere-og-vekstbedrifter-gjennom-krisen/id2695471/", "sources::d_date": "03/27/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "6f8fdc49bc75aade129ccbfc6277fb9052947f1b24d52bef66c4a158fb398fc6"}, {"recordId": "1580", "sources::title": "NOK 4.5 billion extra to help Norwegian businesses", "sources::url": "https://www.innovasjonnorge.no/en/start-page/about/news/nok-4.5-billion-extra-to-help-norwegian-businesses/", "sources::d_date": "03/27/2020", "modId": "0", "downloaded_to": "e4ac4346d527b5825eb646931ff5faec229fce189bc60bb46e08ce2ba74e93f5"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "12", "actors::name": "Public support service providers", "modId": "1"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "31", "targetGroups::name": "Self-employed", "modId": "15"}, {"recordId": "62", "targetGroups::name": "SMEs", "modId": "12"}, {"recordId": "63", "targetGroups::name": "One person or microenterprises", "modId": "12"}, {"recordId": "64", "targetGroups::name": "Larger corporations", "modId": "14"}, {"recordId": "66", "targetGroups::name": "Start-ups", "modId": "11"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1121", "modId": "15"}
