From 1 August 2020, the employer is obliged to satisfy a request for telework when this is requested by an employee who has submitted a medical opinion from a health care institution on his/her illness. Teleworking may be refused only if this is not possible because of the peculiarities of the organisation of work;\r* the LC provides for higher severance pay when an employee who is no longer able to perform his or her duties due to a medical condition is dismissed. Employees who have worked for less than one year will be paid one month\u2019s salary and those who have worked for more than a year will be paid two months\u2019 salary;\r* there is an obligation for the employer to ensure that employees under treatment would be able to take leave as a matter of priority.\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "No information available.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The amendments to the LC were initiated by cancer patients\u2019 organisations and the Ministry of Social Security and Labour of the Republic of Lithuania.
