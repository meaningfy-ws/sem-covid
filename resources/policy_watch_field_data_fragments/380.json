Their members have indeed been accused of 'defeatism\" by the Minister of Labour for having chosen to stop almost all the building sites and ask for the partial unemployment of their employees. As of 1 April, 61,000 companies, including all the major players in the sector, representing 565,000 employees (i.e. 50% of the profession) had applied for this, according to the DARES.\rTo break the deadlock, the profession has therefore drawn up, under the aegis of the OPPBTP, its professional prevention body managed on an equal footing, this guide which is supposed to 'provide the conditions for employees to continue working in safety'.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Having received the approval of all the ministries concerned, the guide defines the protocols to be respected with the approval of clients and within the framework of social dialogue, the conditions of use of individual protection, respect for barrier gestures, and the procedures to be followed in the event of travel, for example.\rThese measures are capable of \"enabling a gradual resumption of activity\", as all the employers' federations have stressed. \"It also responds to the specific characteristics of certain worksites, such as those taking place in private homes\", says Patrick Li\u00e9bus, President of Capeb. In return, companies retain the right to suspend their activity, without running the risk of being refused access to partial activity.\r\"Particular attention is paid to the most vulnerable employees,\" the federations state, urging them \"not to involve apprentices, trainees and work-study students on building sites.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "About 1,300,000 employees work in the construction sector.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "", "socialPartner_form": "Bi-or tripartite social dialogue bodies", "socialPartner_role": "Consulted", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/FR-2020-14_742.html", "isOccupation": "Yes", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Only private sector", "calc_type": "Non-binding recommendations or other texts", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "677", "sources::title": "Guide de pr\u00e9conisations de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sanitaire pour la continuit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s de la construction-Covid-19", "sources::url": "https://www.preventionbtp.fr/Documentation/Explorer-par-produit/Information/Ouvrages/Guide-de-preconisations-de-securite-sanitaire-pour-la-continuite-des-activites-de-la-construction-Covid-19", "sources::d_date": "04/02/2020", "modId": "1", "downloaded_to": "998105cae4385d3d4b69e1ddf0a3e5a3207ce4d297bf87b47c81b56b66f252b0"}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}, {"recordId": "2", "actors::name": "Social partners jointly", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "30", "targetGroups::name": "Employees in standard employment", "modId": "18"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "12", "funding::name": "No special funding required", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [{"recordId": "27", "occupations::name": "Building and related trades workers, excluding electricians", "modId": "0"}], "sectors": [{"recordId": "69", "sectors::code": "F41", "sectors::name": "Construction of buildings", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "70", "sectors::code": "F42", "sectors::name": "Civil engineering", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "71", "sectors::code": "F43", "sectors::name": "Specialised construction activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "652", "modId": "69"}
