It is a government decree established usually for three years on the basis of the Labour Market Services and Benefits Act. It allows to provide services and benefits on more favourable conditions and establish new measures temporarily in addition to the Act. \r\rThe current programme ends with 2020, thus a new programme was established. The general purpose of the programme of 2021-2023 is to:\r\r* shorten the unemployment period\r* help into employment persons who have difficulties in this regard due to long-term unemployment or other obstacles\r* mitigate labour shortage\r* prevent unemployment\r\rThe programme takes into account the hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and aims to mitigate the negative labour market effects. For this reason, compared to the previous programme, it will concentrate more on supporting unemployed, instead of preventing unemployment.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Several new measures were introduced with the new employment programme, while some measures were made more flexible. Some of them were planned to be established anyway, but the COVID-19 accelerated the developments. The main highlights of the programme are:\r\r* A new measure called _continuing support_  will be available. The EUIF specialists provide additional support to those who have difficulties keeping a job by counselling them as well as their employers after finding a job. Another new measure is _coaching_ \u2013 for managers of companies or organisations who have lost their jobs in order to support their development and coping with changes.\r* The business start-up support will increase from \u20ac4,474 to \u20ac6,000.\r* Counselling services (psychological, debt, addiction) will become more flexible so that the client has more options to choose a suitable counsellor. \r* Training support paid to the employers for providing training to their employees is foreseen in case of hiring or in a situation of restructuring and for learning Estonia. With the new programme, the list of eligible training will include the development of the ICT skills of their employees. \r\rThe budget of the programme is up to \u20ac171.3 million between in 2021-2023.
