For this reason this measure was introduced to help SMEs to bridge the crisis by helping them to pay for their fixed costs.\r\rThis measure, the TVL has also been extended within the third package of emergency measures. The aim of this measure is unchanged, namely to help support SMEs with their fixed costs now that their incomes are likely to be lower. This new version of the TVL will also enter into force on 1 October 2020 and will run until 21June 2021.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "Through this measure, SMEs can apply for this subsidy to help them cover their fixed cost when they have had a revenue loss of at least 30%. Furthermore, sectors which currently used to fall under the TOGs are eligible for this measure. Enterprises can receive anywhere from \u20ac1.000 up to \u20ac50.000 for the period of 1 June until 30 September.\r\rIn its updated form, the TVL runs for nine months though (as with the NOW 3.0), the support becomes gradually available for only the especially badly hit SMEs. The first three months of the TVL, October to January 2021, require that SMEs have 30% revenue loss to be eligible. In the second three months, (January to March of 2021), SMEs with a 40% revenue loss are eligible, and from March to June 2021, those with 45% revenue loss are eligible. The amount of support offered does not change; 50% of fixed costs of an enterprise (up to a maximum of \u20ac90,000), is provided by the government. \r\rSectors which fall under the TOG include the recreation sectors, the hotel, restaurant, caf\u00e9 and bar sectors (HORECA), events, carnivals, theatres and stage performance sectors. SMEs and solo self-employed in these sectors may make use of this measure.\r\rIn total the government aims to support 800,000 entrepreneurs in these sectors (some of which have already been helped by the TOG measure). The national government has set aside a budget of \u20ac1.4 billion for this measure.

In this way the measure can better meet the needs of mid-sized and larger SMEs in the Netherlands.
