The dispensing window can be opened daily from 6am till 8pm. \r\rMany restaurants are using these dispensing windows in order to avoid going bankrupt. However, their sales are at the minimum of standard level. The campaign invites people to buy food at dispensing windows and help businesses to survive. It also stressed out that people should pick up the meal directly without using delivery services, which saves restaurants at least of 30% of the profit from sales. \r\rSOCR, AHR CR and AMSP CR also stress out that there has been no specific government support for this kind of businesses, although all of them are badly hit by the anti-COVID-19 measures.\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Although there are no detail statistics on the campaign, according to social partners organising the campaign, there are thousands restaurants which joined the \u2018window day\u2019.
