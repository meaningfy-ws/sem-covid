The use of temporary unemployment means that the employers no longer have to pay the wages of their employees (the cost is transferred to the government through the unemployment benefit), thereby enabling them to reduce their costs and enhances their ability to better cope with the period of inactivity of the business.\r\rThe measures makes the procedure shorter and more simplified for employees in order to make sure that they receive their unemployment benefit as fast as possible", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The system will be extended further as well as adapted (starting September 2020). From that date, two systems will apply (one for companies or sectors that are considered to be very badly hit and one for companies that are less impacted but still require the measure):\r\r1. Companies that are _'particularly badly'_ affected by the corona crisis can continue to use the system of temporary unemployment due to force majeure by Corona until the end of this year. They must demonstrate that in the second quarter (April-June 2020), 20% of the total number of working days declared were days of temporary unemployment (force majeure due to Corona or economic unemployment). \r2. There are also sectors that have been recognised as _'particularly hard hit'_. The employer should do nothing for the taxi sector, the audiovisual sector, the hotel industry, entertainment companies, the socio-cultural sector, the tourist attractions sector. These are automatically recognised. \r3. For a number of sectors, the employer must file a declaration with the national unemployment offices and it only applies to certain activities (i.e. not automatically to all employees of the joint committee).  \r4. All other companies can make use of the classic systems of temporary unemployment that already existed before the corona crisis: _'temporary unemployment for reasons of force majeure'_ and _'temporary unemployment for economic reasons'_. Each system has its own criteria and formalities which may also deviate from the arrangements for the corona crisis. For this group the 'normal' rules become applicable again.\r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Data is not yet available; as the measure (extension) is still very recent.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The social partners are involved in the measure, as the trade unions have a big responsibility in paying out unemployment benefits.
