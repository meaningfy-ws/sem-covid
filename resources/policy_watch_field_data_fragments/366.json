Many businesses are required to shut down, and the ripple effects of measures to limit infection are significant. This has resulted in a very high number of layoffs in a number of industries. The amendment to the lay-off regulation reduce the cost for employers and increase the unemployment benefit for the unemployed. Part time lay-off can be applied if the employee work 40% or less (changed from 50%).", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The lay-off regulations secure unemployment benefits to the individual employee if he or she is laid off. In this way, companies can quickly reduce their costs, while at the same time the working relationship can continue. The period where employers have to pay wages during lay-offs (the employer's period) is reduced from 15 to 2 days. The state carry the cost from day 3. The unemployment benefit starts when the unemployed person has been unemployed and has been registered as a real job seeker for at least three of the last fifteen days. These three days constitute the waiting period in the unemployment benefit scheme. To reduce the burden on workers the waiting time is removed for the laid off. \r\r\rThe temporarily dismissed are guaranteed 100% salary up to 6G (approx. \u20ac50,700) from day 3, when employer is exempted from paying wage, through day 20. Unemployment benefits for laid-off persons and those who become ordinary unemployed are adjusted upwards and shall constitute 80% of the former wage (dagpengegrunnlaget) up to 3G (aprox. \u20ac25,350) and 62.4% of the part of former wage that is between 3G and 6G (aprox. \u20ac50,700). The lower income limit for entitlement to unemployment benefit is lowered to 0.75G (aprox. \u20ac6,340) over the past 12 months or 2.25G over the past 36 months. The requirement for reduced working hours for entitlement to unemployment benefits is changed from a minimum of 50% to a minimum of 40%.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "In the period from 9 March to 15 April, 342 228 people have applied for unemployment benefit. In accommodation and food and beverage services (NACE I) the unemployed constitute 57 per cent of the employed in the industries. In industry (NACE C) and construction and building (NACE F), 12 per cent is registered as laid off.
