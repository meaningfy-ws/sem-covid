The state helped them financially with a one-off solidarity allowance. \r\rThe first solidarity allowances (\u20ac150 - \u20ac300) were granted to pensioners with pensions below \u20ac700, and to certain vulnerable groups (i.e. \u20ac150 for students) through the Act Determining the Intervention Measures to Contain the COVID-19 Epidemic and Mitigate its Consequences for Citizens and the Economy (ZIUZEOP), in force since 11 April 2020. With the ZIUZEOP-A amendment, that came into force on 1 May 2020, the circle of recipients of solidarity allowances was extended also to the recipients of disability insurance compensations (Article 15 of the ZIUZEOP-A, that amends the Article 58 of the ZIUZEOP).", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "In accordance with Article 58 of the ZIUZEOP recipients of one-off solidarity allowance had to meet following four conditions: \r \r1.

Were permanent residence in the Republic of Slovenia, \r4. Did not the receive one-off solidarity allowance on other grounds.\r\rWhen determining the entitlement to the payment of a one-off solidarity allowance, the disability insurance compensation is first recalculated to full-time work, to which other possible cash benefits from the Pensions and Disability Insurance Institute Slovenia (ZPIZ) are added:\r\r* 20% of early retirement or 40% of old-age pension and/or\r* disability insurance compensation.\r\rA one-time solidarity allowance is paid to a recipient of disability insurance compensation if the sum of the recalculated amount of the compensation and any other aforementioned benefits paid by the ZPIZ does not exceed \u20ac700.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "According to the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute of Slovenia (ZPIZ), 1,222 recipients of disability insurance compensation who work part-time and meet other statutory criteria received a one-off solidarity allowance.
