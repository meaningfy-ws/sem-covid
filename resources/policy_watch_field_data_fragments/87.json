[Czech Chamber of Commerce (Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1 komora \u010cesk\u00e9 republiky)](http://www.komora.cz) decided to help overcome difficulties and offers a helping hand in using an 'employee sharing' programme. Employee sharing, as an employment tool may be useful since there are also companies that currently lack employees (e.g. due to quarantine or taking care of their family members) and that would welcome assistance of employees coming from other companies.\r\r", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure is governed by the \u00a743a of the Act 262/2006 Coll., Labour Code, the so called temporary assignment of an employee. The temporarily assigned employee stays employed by the original employer, however, the work tasks are being given by the company to which he/she was assigned. \rWorking and wage conditions of employees temporarily performing activities for another employer must not be worse than the conditions of their main occupation. \r\rThe Czech Chamber of Commerce  cooperates with an electronic platform [www.WorkLinks.com](http://www.worklinks.com) which offers its services for free for this purpose. Also on-line platform Jurent CZ, which has a wealth of experience in employee sharing, has been involved in this measure.
