            <h2>The Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF)</h2>
<p>On March 17, HM Treasury announced a number of measures designed to support businesses. The Chancellor set out a package of temporary, timely and targeted measures to support public services, people and businesses through this period of disruption caused by Covid. This page is designed for businesses who wish to use one of the major measures announced: the joint HM Treasury and Bank of England lending facility, named the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). The facility is designed to support liquidity among larger firms, helping them to bridge coronavirus disruption to their cash flows through the purchase of short-term debt in the form of commercial paper.</p>
<p>At a summary level, to be eligible for the scheme, applicants currently need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make a material UK contribution</li>
    <li>Be investment grade rated (or equivalent) as at 1 March 2020 (as supplemented by the ongoing credit quality review described below)</li>
    <li>Not be PRA- or FCA-regulated</li>
    <li>Not be a public undertaking</li>
    <li>Not be a leveraged investment vehicle</li>
    <li>(NB: there is additional guidance for some specific types of entities – please see below for more details).</li>
    <li>There is no requirement to have previously issued Commercial Paper (CP).</li>
</ul>
<p>
This page sets out in detail the practical steps that your firm needs to take in order to access the CCFF, as well as other frequently asked questions.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about processing time for your application or would like to talk through any stage of the application process please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk">CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>No CCFF transaction windows will be held on 24 and 31 December 2020. If you have any questions regarding the schedule of transaction windows please email <a href="mailto:CCFFtransactions@bankofengland.co.uk">CCFFtransactions@bankofengland.co.uk</a>.</p>

							<p>On 9 October 2020, HM Treasury and the Bank announced an enhanced process to monitor and review CCFF issuers' credit quality in advance of the closure of the CCFF.</p>
<h5>Credit quality review</h5>
<p>To support orderly repayment by issuing companies the credit quality of issuers in the CCFF is reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Any issuer wanting to issue CP (either initial CP issuance or roll-overs of maturing CP) into the CCFF after 9 October will be subject to a review by HM Treasury to consider whether that issuance remains in line with the purpose  of the facility.</p>
<p>Where an issuer wanting to issue CP into the CCFF has a current credit rating/equivalent that remains investment grade (that is, at or above a short-term rating of A3/P3/F3/R3 or equivalent, or a long-term rating of BBB-/Baaa3/BBB-/BBB low or equivalent), it can expect to be able to proceed to issue CP into the CCFF, subject to (i) providing supporting evidence as detailed below and (ii) the issuer’s approved drawing limit. The issuer should follow the process outlined below for notifying the Bank, with sufficient notice, of their intention to issue CP into the CCFF.</p>
<p>In cases where the credit rating/equivalent evidence of credit quality has fallen below levels deemed equivalent to investment grade (as defined in question <strong>B1</strong>), the issuer will have the option to pursue a review on which HM Treasury, as the ultimate risk-owner of the CCFF, will take the final decision. The review will consider whether the issuer’s use of the CCFF remains within the purpose of the facility.  The review should be expected to take at least four weeks to complete, which may mean that issuance cannot take place on the issuer’s requested date. As part of this review, HM Treasury will request supporting information from issuers.</p>
<h5>An update on drawing limits</h5>
<p>In addition to the enhanced credit review process described above, from 9 October 2020, any firm whose long-term credit rating falls to, or below, BBB-/Baa3/BBB (low) or equivalent after 1 March 2020 will have their aggregate drawing limit capped at a maximum of £300 million.</p>
<p>This will not affect outstanding drawings if already in excess of £300 million.</p>
<h5>Process for new issuance into the CCFF</h5>
<p>In order to support the revised credit quality requirements, issuers should notify the Bank at <a href="mailto:CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk">CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk</a> of their intention to sell CP (either initial CP issuance or roll-overs of maturing CP) into the CCFF no later than 11am five Business Days prior to their requested sale date. The Bank will endeavor to confirm within that timeframe whether the transaction can proceed on the requested sale date.</p>
<p>Where a ‘point in time’ rating is obtained from a Credit Rating Agency, evidence of current investment grade status must date from no longer than eight weeks before the proposed date of issuance. </p>
<p>If the credit ratings/equivalent evidence of credit quality submitted with the issuers original application dates from no longer than eight weeks before any proposed date of issuance after the application is completed, no further evidence will be required.</p>
<p>These changes do not affect outstanding drawings which the CCFF will continue to hold until maturity unless, under the existing terms of the scheme, outstanding CP is repurchased early by the issuer.</p>

							<p>If a firm wishes to issue CP (either initial CP issuance or roll-overs of maturing CP)  into the CCFF and believes they have a recent credit rating/equivalent evidence of credit quality at a level deemed equivalent to investment grade (as defined in question <strong>B1</strong>), the issuer should notify the Bank at CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk of their intention to sell CP into the CCFF no later than 11am five Business Days prior to their requested sale date. The Bank will endeavor to confirm within that time frame whether the transaction can proceed on the requested date.</p>
<p>The notification should include a recent credit rating or /equivalent evidence of investment grade status  and the evidence should be of a comparable standard to the evidence submitted to establish initial eligibility for the CCFF. For more information on the requirements for this, please review question <strong>B1</strong> and <strong>B2</strong>.</p>
<p>Where a ‘point in time’ rating is obtained from a Credit Rating Agency, evidence of current investment grade status must date from no longer than eight weeks before the proposed date of issuance.</p>
<p>Where an issuer does not provide sufficient evidence, or where the credit rating/equivalent evidence of credit quality shows an issuer’s credit quality has fallen below levels deemed equivalent to investment grade, the issuer will have the option to pursue a review on which HM Treasury, will take the final decision. This process may take at least four weeks to complete. We would encourage all issuers that are unsure if they have a credit rating/equivalent evidence of credit quality at a level deemed equivalent to investment grade to contact the Bank well in advance of any intended  sale date. For more information, please review question '<strong>X4: I believe I am sub-investment grade rated - what should I do?</strong>'</p>
<p>These changes do not affect outstanding drawings which the CCFF will continue to hold until maturity unless, under the existing terms of the scheme, outstanding CP is repurchased early by the issuer.</p>
<p>If an issuer has no intention to sell CP into the scheme, there is no requirement to provide updated evidence of investment grade status. </p>
<p>If the credit ratings/equivalent evidence of credit quality submitted with the issuers original application dates from no longer than eight weeks before any proposed date of issuance after the application is completed, no further evidence will be required.</p>

							<p>Companies - and their finance subsidiaries - that make a material contribution to the UK economy are able to participate in the facility. Companies must do this via a bank – there is more detail on this in the relevant questions on this page.</p>
<p>In practice, firms that meet this requirement would normally be: UK incorporated companies, including those with foreign-incorporated parents and with a genuine business in the UK; companies with significant employment in the UK; firms with their headquarters in the UK. We will also consider whether the company generates significant revenues in the UK, serves a large number of customers in the UK or has a number of operating sites in the UK. </p>
<p>The facility is open to firms that can demonstrate they were in sound financial health prior to the shock, allowing us to look through temporary impacts on firms’ balance sheets and cash flows from the shock itself. This means companies that had a short or long-term rating of investment grade, as at 1 March 2020, or equivalent. There is more information with regards to what steps you need to take at detailed under the question “B2: What do I do if my company does not have a credit rating?”.</p>

    <li>an increase in an issuer's CCFF limit, over and above that suggested by the issuer’s investment rating, is requested and approved; and/or</li>
    <li>a CCFF transaction is entered which involves CP maturing on or after 19 May 2021.</li>

<p>Where a letter of commitment is required from an LLP, in order to allow for LLP partners to be remunerated in a manner which HMT considers broadly consistent with pay restraint for applicable companies, distributions to partners will be allowed but set at a level which HMT considers appropriate when compared to distributions in the 2019-20 financial year. A template for this letter of commitment for LLPs is available <a href="/-/media/boe/files/markets/covid-corporate-financing-facility/llp-conditions-letter-for-ccff-for-cp-maturing-on-or-after-19-may-2021.docx?la=en&amp;hash=AE55B987681E76E12948DA2F3F2C85561C1D2049">here</a>.</p><p>The conditions outlined in the letter of commitment apply from when the issuer enters into a CCFF transaction which involves CP maturing on or after 19 May 2021, and remain in place whilst this CP is outstanding.<br></p>
<p>The deadline for submitting a letter of commitment to the Bank for HM Treasury’s review is 31 December 2020. </p>
<p>Firms intending to submit a letter are advised to do so well in advance of any intended drawing date, as they can take some time to process.</p>

							<p>The clearest way to demonstrate this test is to have, or acquire, a rating.

							<p>If you do not have a public investment grade rating there are two further options for applicants to consider. Please ensure that you consider these options in the context of the Market Notice that was published on 9 October 2020, which sets out the latest requirements for participation in the CCFF. In particular firms should note the requirements for evidence of credit quality to be “current”. This is explained in Question <strong>B3</strong>. We are happy to discuss these with you ahead of applying – please contact us at <a href="mailto:CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk ">CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk</a> if you wish to do so.</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Bank will accept banks’ internal ratings of corporates to assess credit status. For this purpose, and following a request confirmed by HM Treasury, Credit Benchmark has provided a credit assessment file to the Bank, which consolidates in aggregate form the corporate credit estimates of a number of the largest UK banks.<br />
    <br />
    To be considered as having investment grade status based on banks’ internal ratings, and so deemed eligible for the scheme, firms will ordinarily be required to have at least three investment grade bank ratings and no speculative grade bank ratings as at 1 March 2020. To avoid a single bank’s credit view unduly affecting the overall assessment, we will generally not exclude firms with speculative grade ratings provided the average of bank ratings available is at least BBB/Baa2/BBB/BBB. And we will only accept two bank ratings as sufficient proof of investment grade status where both view the firm as strongly investment grade i.e. BBB+/Baa1/BBB+/BBB(High) or above.<br />
    <br />
    We may additionally ask you to submit confirmations of your banks’ ratings to the Bank directly, in a form that clearly evidences that they derive from the bank rather than the applicant. You would also be asked to attest that you have disclosed all bank ratings related to your principal direct on-balance sheet borrowings, for example across syndicated loans, bilateral loans and revolving credit facilities.</li>
    <br />
    <li>A second route is to seek an assessment of credit quality from one of the major credit rating agencies. This would remain an option if we have not been able to deem you IG-equivalent under option (1) above due to insufficient evidence, so you may wish to pursue option (1) first. The credit assessment should be as at 1 March 2020 in a form that can be shared privately with the Bank of England and HM Treasury, noting that you are doing so because you wish to use the CCFF. The largest credit rating agencies are prepared to do this and the standard rating agency products we are prepared to view as suitable evidence of credit status are listed below. We reserve the right to make use of other products. Following the update as of 9th October, any applicants considering obtaining an assessment of credit quality from one of the major credit agencies in order to evidence investment grade status should contact the Bank first at <a href="mailto:CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk">CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>HM Treasury and the Bank each reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to deem any issuer ineligible after taking into account all available information. </p>
<p>
Standard rating agency products viewed as suitable evidence of credit status:</p>
<p>Moody’s Investor Services</p>
<ul>
    <li>Long and short term public corporate credit ratings</li>

							<p>As of 9 October 2020, in order to issue new CP into the CCFF, issuers will be required to have a current credit rating/equivalent evidence of credit quality at a level deemed equivalent to investment grade (as defined in question <strong>B1</strong>). Issuers will be required to provide supporting evidence of their current investment grade status, to a comparable standard to the evidence submitted to establish initial eligibility for the CCFF (as defined in question B1 and B2). Where a ‘point in time’ rating is obtained from a Credit Rating Agency, evidence of current investment grade status must date from no longer than eight weeks before the proposed date of issuance.</p>
<p>If an issuer has no intention to sell CP into the scheme, there is no requirement to provide updated evidence of investment grade status.</p>
<p>In cases where the credit rating/equivalent evidence of credit quality falls below levels deemed equivalent to investment grade for an issuer, the issuer will have the option to pursue a review on which HM Treasury will take the final decision. The review will consider whether the issuer’s use of the CCFF remains within the purpose of the facility.  The review should be expected to take at least four weeks to complete, which may mean that issuance cannot take place on the issuer’s requested date.</p>
<p>As part of a review, HM Treasury will request supporting information from issuers. The outcome of this review – a decision on whether the issuer can issue CP into the CCFF - will be communicated to the issuer once the review is complete.</p>
<p>Where appropriate HM Treasury may, in its sole discretion, allow an issuer to issue new CP into the CCFF while the review process is undertaken. This will be decided on a case-by-case basis on request by the issuer.</p>
<p>Any such review will not affect existing outstanding drawings which the CCFF will continue to hold until maturity unless, under the existing terms of the scheme, outstanding CP is repurchased early by the issuer.</p>
<p><strong>If an issuer believes they are sub-investment grade rated, or they are unsure if they have a sufficient credit rating/equivalent evidence of investment grade credit quality, the issuer should contact the Bank at <a href="mailto:CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk">CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk</a> if they intend to sell new CP into the CCFF well in advance, and considering the expected 4-week timeframe for HMT to complete a review.</strong></p>

							<p>We will acknowledge receipt of your application shortly after you submit. You should contact us at <a href="mailto:CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk">CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk</a> if you have not heard from us within 24 hours.</p>
<p>We will start assessing your eligibility as soon as you submit an Issuer Eligibility Form. If you are deemed eligible we will contact you as soon as that assessment is completed, even if you are still awaiting your CP programme. Similarly if you are deemed ineligible we will let you know as soon as that assessment is made. </p>
<p>There are several steps in the eligibility assessment process. If you are concerned about the processing time for your application, please get in touch. The following tips will also help to ensure that your application is processed as quickly as possible:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Submit the other required documentation alongside your Issuer Eligibility Form (the Issuer Undertaking and Confidentiality Agreement, and if required a standard form guarantee and associated legal opinion). These documents often require us to contact you for further information in order to process them. By submitting them early, and completing them fully, we can start that process sooner.</li>
    <li>Applications are often slowed down because of insufficient information to prove to the Bank that the person signing the documentation on behalf of your company is authorised to do so. Please read the detailed Guidance for signing the CCFF Issuer Undertaking and Confidentiality Agreement, which explains who is able to sign on behalf of a company, and what evidence is required to confirm their identity and authority. </li>
    <li>A common reason for ineligibility is that we have insufficient evidence to assess a company as IG-equivalent. Please read B2: What do I do if my company does not have a credit rating? and contact us at <a href="mailto:CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk">CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk</a> if you are still uncertain or have further questions.</li>
    <li>Issuing Entities that are (i) public bodies or authorities, (ii) governed by public law or are (iii) public undertakings of the UK, an EU Member State or a foreign state are ineligible for the scheme. All applicants must declare if they are subject to (i)-(iii) in the Issuer Eligibility Form. Please note that if you are quasi-public or government-affiliated we may require further details from you to support your declaration.</li>

<p>Issuers should notify the Bank at CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk of their intention to sell CP into the CCFF no later than 11am five Business Days prior to their requested sale date. The Bank will endeavor to confirm within that timeframe whether the transaction can proceed on that requested date.</p>
<p>The notification should include a recent credit rating/equivalent evidence of investment grade status, the evidence should be of a comparable standard to the evidence submitted to establish initial eligibility for the CCFF. For more information on the requirements for this, please review question <strong>B1</strong> and <strong>B2</strong>.</p>
<p>This is to ensure that the issuer has provided sufficient evidence of an investment grade credit rating, in line with the process outlined in question ‘<strong>B3:What happens if I get downgraded after 1 March 2020, or my financial health deteriorates?</strong>’.</p>

An indicative guide to the maximum limit pre-approved by HM Treasury for issuers at different ratings is set out in the table below, although applicants should note that the limits set will be adjusted down at the Bank/HMT’s discretion in some cases (for example where they exceed 50% of the applicants’ average revenues over recent years). </p>

<p>
These limits will be kept under constant review. The UK Government is the ultimate owner of the CCFF, and HM Treasury and the Bank of England set the eligibility criteria and limits in order to manage risk to the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Any issuer whose long-term credit rating falls to, or below, BBB-/Baa3/BBB (low) or equivalent will have their aggregate drawing limit capped at a maximum of £300 million.  This will not affect outstanding drawings if in excess of £300 million.</p>
<p>Issuers are encouraged to disclose to the Bank the total amount that they wish to borrow. If a company would like to increase its named limit, it should indicate the desired limit in its application.</p>
<p>For a limit extension request to be considered, the company will need to demonstrate that the increased limit will be used to support them through the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the increased risk to the taxpayer, for such an increase to be considered there would be detailed engagement between the company and HM Government to understand, for example, if the company has sought alternative sources of financing, and to discuss repayment strategies.</p>
<p>The cost of borrowing is higher for drawings above your stated limit. Given the ultimate cost of the scheme rests with the taxpayer, as a result of the HM Treasury indemnity, limit extensions also come with conditions, including the suspension of dividends and agreeing voluntary conditions on senior pay. These conditions would apply for all of your CCFF transactions, while for CCFF participants within their original limits these conditions apply only on CCFF transactions that involve CP maturing on or after 19 May 2021. If your limit extension request is granted, you will need to provide a letter of commitment to any agreed conditions.</p>

							<p>Yes. The Bank will provide a standing offer, on request, to sell back CP held by the Fund to the original issuer in advance of its agreed maturity date.</p>
<p>Sales are offered at a price calculated in accordance with the details set out in the Market Notice and subject to such terms and conditions as the Bank may specify in its absolute discretion. Please refer to the <a href="/markets/market-notices/2020/joint-hmt-and-boe-ccff-consolidated-market-notice-may-2020">Market Notice</a> and <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/markets/covid-corporate-financing-facility/operating-procedures.pdf" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">CCFF Operating Procedures<span class="icon-external"></span></a> for more information, including details of how to make a request for early repayment.</p>
<p>The Bank will usually apply a fee to the price offered for early repayment, as published on the <a href="/markets/bank-of-england-market-operations-guide/information-for-participants">Information for participants page</a>. In light of the changes to the CCFF outlined on 19 May, re-sale transactions entered into on or before 30 June 2020 will not be subject to this additional spread.</p>
<p>Issuers do not need to notify the Bank in advance of any intended early repayment.</p>
<p>Where an issuer is subject to a review by HM Treasury, any such review will not affect outstanding drawings which the CCFF will continue to hold until maturity unless, under the existing terms of the scheme, outstanding CP is repurchased early by the issuer.
