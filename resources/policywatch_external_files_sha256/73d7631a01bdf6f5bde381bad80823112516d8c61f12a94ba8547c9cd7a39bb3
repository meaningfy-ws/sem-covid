The ETUC is working closely with its TUC affiliate in the UK. The TUC opposed Brexit, and since the referendum has been active in defending workers&amp;rsquo; rights, calling on the British government to consult trade unions throughout the negotiations. The ETUC has demanded a similar guarantee from EU leaders.

We demand respect for all agreements concluded in the framework of social dialogue at all levels.

Workers across Europe need a pay rise. Negotiations between social partners at the relevant level are the best tool to secure good wages and working conditions. Wage-setting should remain a national matter and take place in line with national practices and industrial relations systems. In 2017-2018 the ETUC coordinated&amp;nbsp;a successful&amp;nbsp;Europe-wide campaign for a pay rise for all working people, but especially for lower-paid workers such as women, young people, and those living in less prosperous EU Member States (upward wage convergence). It is currently working to influence the European Commission&#039;s proposals on fair minimum wages.

In line with the 2015 Paris Congress and Executive Committee decisions, the ETUC has&amp;nbsp;put forward a concept example for a European Optional Legal Framework (OLF) for Transnational Company Agreements (TCAs). This would help clarify the leading role of the European Trade Union Federations (ETUFs) in negotiations as well as the interaction between different levels of collective bargaining and the effectiveness of such agreements. The ETUC proposal is based on the following documents – the so-called ‘OLF package’ – which has&amp;nbsp;been developed over recent years:


	ETUC report Towards a Legal Framework for Transnational Company Agreements;
	ETUC report Building an enabling environment for voluntary and autonomous negotiations at transnational level between trade unions and multinational companies;
	ETUC concept example of a possible&amp;nbsp;OLF for TCAs;

The status of platform workers is often unclear, leaving them without access to social security, training, health and safety protection, or workers’ rights including the right to organise and bargain collectively through a trade union. The COVID-19 crisis has placed this insecurity in sharp focus. The ETUC insists that platforms should recognise their responsibility towards their workers, ensuring fair wages, security and social protection including sick pay and insurance. Dependent self-employed and freelancers should also benefit from social and trade union rights.

The ETUC is not opposed to digitalisation, but it should always improve working conditions and be developed in cooperation with workers and trade unions. The gender perspective must be at the core of all digital initiatives, increasing women’s participation in STEM sectors: (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and avoiding gender bias in algorithms.

The Treaty of Lisbon stresses that “the Union shall aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions”.

Economic, social and territorial cohesion must continue to be at the core of the Europe 2020 strategy. Major differences between EU regions and within Member States still exist, hence the importance of the European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF).&amp;nbsp;EU cohesion policy needs to support regional development, sustainable growth and quality employment. The General Regulation for the European Structural and Investment Funds for 2014-2020 strengthens these priorities, including (notably the European Social Fund) employment, fair mobility, the fight against poverty, social inclusion, education and training.

The European Code of Conduct concerning Partnership, issued by the European Commission in line with the partnership principle, set out in Article 5 of the new Structural Fund Regulation, must be actively implemented.

The ETUC is the only social partner representing workers at European level. The Treaty of Maastricht (1992) guarantees this formal status. Together with the EU-level employers, it is involved in consultation in areas such as employment, social affairs, macroeconomic dialogue, industrial and regional policies.

Dialogue between the European social partners takes place at both cross-sectoral and sectoral levels. The participants in the cross-sectoral dialogue, the ETUC, BusinessEurope (private sector employers), UEAPME (SMEs), and CEEP (public employers), concluded framework agreements on parental leave (1996) and revised in 2009, part-time work (1997) and fixed-term contracts (1999). They were ratified by the Council of Ministers and are now part of European legislation.

The social partners have also concluded autonomous agreements on telework (2002), work-related stress (2004), harassment and violence at work (2007), inclusive labour markets (2010) and on active ageing and an intergenerational approach (2017).

They have also adopted frameworks of action on lifelong development of competencies and qualifications (2002), gender equality (2005) and youth employment (2013).

In July 2015, the EU Social Partners adopted their fifth multiannual work programme (2015-2017). This covers active ageing; reconciliation of work, private and family life and gender equality; mobility and migration; investment and strengthening the industrial base; skills needs in digital economies; active labour market policies; apprenticeships and youth employment; capacity building and better implementation of European social dialogue outcomes.

The ETUC represents workers&amp;rsquo; interests in the Social Dialogue Committee, which meets three times a year.

Schemes are often linked directly to working life (e.g. pensions), and financed through contributions, frequently based on earnings. In an ageing Europe, the ETUC demands universal coverage and full access to pensions and long-term care in all Member States, to ensure that elderly people can live in dignity. Minimum income schemes should be established to protect people from extreme poverty and deprivation, while supporting their active inclusion in society and the labour market.

Social protection is a fundamental part of the European social model, supporting groups suffering exclusion from the labour market or atypical employment and managing just and sustainable transitions in the economy and the labour market.

The extending scope of European and international standards, their role in framing market competition and industrial strategies and the formal devolution of power to standard-setting bodies certainly provide a strong rationale to strengthen trade unions’ engagement and participation in European – and international - standardisation.

The ETUC recognises that many areas subject to standardisation are political by nature, and are therefore better addressed through democratic decision-making procedures rather than in private standardisation committees. The ETUC further&amp;nbsp;insists on the autonomy of social partners and on the respect of collective agreements and social dialogue that could potentially be challenged by standards.

However, working conditions are major societal challenges that standards can help address, on condition that trade unions can effectively participate&amp;nbsp;in their development. In this context, the&amp;nbsp;ETUC standardisation project&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;aims at strengthening the voice of trade unions in standardisation to ensure standards promote high-quality working conditions and do not encroach upon the autonomy of social partners, collective agreements and social dialogue.

The ETUC agrees that trade and investment agreements should be part of a wider political relationship, and has developed cooperation with trade unions in these countries.

The ETUC insists on the strict application of the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty, which lays down that the Union’s external and international trade policies should seek to advance its values in the wider world. These include democracy and peace, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the European Charter of Human Rights, the UN Charter and international law. The EU acquis, collective preferences and regulatory practices must in no way be undermined by external trade and investment relationships.

The ETUC has an International Matters, Trade and International Development Committee which meets at least twice a year and debates policy positions.

The ETUC also collaborates with the Trade Union Development Cooperation Network (TUDCN), an initiative of the ITUC to bring trade unions’ perspective into international development policy debates and improve the coordination and effectiveness of trade union development cooperation activities.

However, the ETUC remains critical of the existing approach by European and national authorities, which so far tackles only the demand side, within a social and economic framework dominated by austerity measures and labour reforms.&amp;nbsp; Also, as stated by the European Council, the trade union movement should be involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of such schemes in order to guarantee their effectiveness. The ETUC calls on European Institutions to implement fully the core principles of the European Youth Guarantee: a guaranteed offer or intervention within four months of leaving the education system and/or unemployment, implemented, in the long term, as a universal guarantee.

More ambitious and long-term funding is needed to guarantee effective outcomes. The ETUC calls for the continuation of the budgetary lines beyond 2016. Our benchmark in terms of appropriate funding of the Youth Guarantee is the ILO&amp;rsquo;s estimate of &amp;euro;21 billion per year.

<p>The ETUC calls on Member States to swiftly put at the disposal of the European Commission the necessary guarantees to make the scheme operational as soon as possible!</p>
<p>The ETUC welcomes the efforts put in place by the European Commission to launch ‘SURE’ and asks that clear guidelines are issued as soon as possible to recommend Member States to establish short-time work or similar schemes in every country, to ensure they cover all workers and companies, and that social partners are involved in their design and implementation.</p>
<p>“A scheme like SURE is urgently needed to prevent mass unemployment and a deep recession” said Luca Visentini, ETUC General Secretary. “Trade unions urge the Eurogroup and the Council to agree SURE and to make it operational immediately. More jobs are being lost every day and ambitious measures to prevent job losses and protect wages cannot wait.”</p>
<p>“The benefit of having the Commission raising money in the markets to finance it is that it will apply to all EU countries and does not come with counter-productive conditions of the kind that did so much damage to Greece and the other countries affected by the Troika after the last crisis.</p>
<p>“It is very important that all Member States establish short-time work or similar schemes with support of SURE, and that they ensure such schemes cover all workers and companies, and that social partners are involved in their design and implementation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Putting SURE in place should not mean that plans for a European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme are abandoned. A permanent scheme is still needed to protect the Euro area from future crises.”</p>
