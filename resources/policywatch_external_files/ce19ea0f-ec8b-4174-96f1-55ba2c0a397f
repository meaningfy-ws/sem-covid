Businesses can make smaller payments up to the end of March 2022 interest free, rather than paying the full amount by 31 March 2021. This is an ‘opt-in’ scheme for those requiring more flexibility, and <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferral-of-vat-payments-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank">businesses will be able to sign up to the scheme in early 2021</a>.</li>

<h4><strong>Loans</strong></h4>

<li>It’s important HMRC has the appropriate documentation to enter firms into a TTP arrangement and they are not intended to be automatic tax deferrals.

                    <ul>
<li>The government has asked all employees to work from home unless it is impossible for them to do so. Businesses should therefore support flexible working as much as reasonably possible when working remotely.</li>
<li>Employers should encourage managers and employees with caring responsibilities to speak about any additional flexibility they may need during the day. This could be allowing employees to work reduced hours or flex their hours to work around their caring arrangements.</li>
<li>Employers should be sympathetic to any distractions that may arise at home, such as children or pets moving around or making noise.</li>
<li>Employees’ performance and productivity should be reasonably appraised while working at home, and businesses should consider relaxing performance management where appropriate.</li>

                    <ul>
<li>Employers should adapt their practices to observe a distance of at least 1-2 metres between individuals wherever possible. </li>
<li>Employers should consider <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working/types-of-flexible-working" target="_blank">staggering shifts and processes</a> to enable staff to continue operating both effectively and at a safe distance wherever possible.</li>
<li>As well as ensuring the health and safety of staff, these practices can increase opportunities for more flexible working. Depending on the nature of the business, employers are considering the following practices:</li>
<ul>
<li>Time-banking to allow workers to ‘accrue hours’ to take as time off at a later date, outside of their usual shift pattern</li>
<li>Introducing condensed shift patterns whereby employees are able to work their total contracted hours over fewer working days</li>
<li>Leveraging annualised hours contracts, by allowing workers to reduce the number of hours they’re working during the pandemic but still work the same number of total hours over the year</li>
<li>Splitting teams so that operations run below full capacity at any given time</li>

                <div class="simple-accordion__content">
                    <ul>
<li>The government has announced amendments to the Working Time Regulations (WTR) that will allow all workers to carry over up to four weeks’ paid holiday over a two-year period.</li>
<li>This will be possible in cases where it has not been reasonably practicable for a worker to take some or all of this leave as a result of the effects of coronavirus (including on the worker, the employer or on the wider economy or society).</li>
<li>These amendments do not impact on the 1.6 weeks of Additional Leave that the WTR provides or on any other leave that a worker may be contractually entitled to. Both can be carried over, subject to agreement between the employer and the individual.</li>
<li>Employers retain the ability under the WTR to require their employees to take or not take leave at specific times, although the government is yet to clarify whether this will be the case for workers furloughed via the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.</li>
<li>Employers should always consider the employee relations of changes to holiday entitlements, and discuss any planned changes as a result of the coronavirus with staff as soon as possible.</li>
<li>To enable these changes, the government will relax employers’ obligation to ensure that their workers take their statutory entitlement in any one year.</li>
<li>It remains good practice for employers to still encourage workers and employees to take their paid holiday, as time off from work is important to people’s wellbeing, especially in these challenging times.</li>

<li><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" target="_blank">National lockdown</a> rules currently apply in England (starting from Monday 4 January 2021). The rules are different in the other UK nations. You should check the rules that apply if you plan to travel to any other part of the UK, such as <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-regulations-guidance-what-restrictions-mean-you" target="_blank">Northern Ireland</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels" target="_blank">Scotland</a>, and <a rel="noopener" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" target="_blank">Wales</a>.</li>
<li>Under national lockdown, you must not leave your home unless you have a reasonable excuse (for example, for work, to attend a medical appointment, or education purposes). If you need to travel, you should stay local – meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live – and look to reduce the number of journeys you make overall.</li>
<li>If you need to travel, walk or cycle where possible, and plan ahead to avoid busy times and routes on public transport. This will allow you to practice social distancing while you travel.</li>
<li>Car sharing is not permitted with anyone from outside your household or support bubble unless your journey is undertaken for an exempt reason. See the guidance on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#car-sharing" target="_blank" data-anchor="#car-sharing">car sharing</a>.</li>

<li>International travel is increasingly restricted. In the UK, different rules apply in <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" target="_blank">England</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/" target="_blank">Scotland</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-regulations-guidance" target="_blank">Wales </a>and <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-regulations-guidance-what-restrictions-mean-you" target="_blank">Northern Ireland</a>. For example, in England you must not leave home including to travel abroad, unless you have a legally permitted reason to do so, such as for essential work purposes.</li>
<li>If you are legally permitted to travel, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/" target="_blank">check our advice</a> for the country you are visiting. Other countries have closed borders, and may further restrict movement or bring in new rules including testing requirements with little warning. Before you return to the UK you must <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" target="_blank">provide your journey and contact details</a>. Also check if you need to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control" target="_blank">self-isolate</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Under the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel" target="_blank">Test to Release for International Travel scheme</a> people returning to England who need to self-isolate will be able to take a COVID test with a private test provider to see if they can end their self-isolation early. From mid-January 2021, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mandatory-covid-19-testing-introduced-to-bolster-border-measures" target="_blank">all international arrivals to England, including UK nationals, will be required to present a negative COVID-19 test taken up to 72 hours prior to departure</a>. Passengers will be subject to an immediate fine of £500 if they fail to comply with the new regulations on pre-departure testing. All passengers arriving from countries not on the government’s travel corridor list will still be required to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of test result. Passengers will also still be required to fill in a passenger locator form and be subject to national lockdown restrictions.</li>

Workplaces need to avoid crowding and minimise opportunities for the virus to spread by maintaining a distance of at least 2 metres (3 steps) between individuals wherever possible. This advice applies both to inside the workplace, and to where staff may need to interact with customers.</li>
<li>Staff should be reminded to wash their hands regularly using soap and water for 20 seconds and particularly after blowing their nose, sneezing or coughing. Where facilities to wash hands are not available, hand sanitiser should be used. Workers should cover any coughs or sneezes with a tissue, then dispose of the tissue in a bin and immediately wash their hands.</li>
