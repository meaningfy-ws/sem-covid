	<!--
	-- Unnnfortunately, Microsoft has added a clever new
	-- "feature" to Internet Explorer. If the text in
	-- an error's message is "too small", specifically
	-- less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns
	-- its own error message. Yes, you can turn that
	-- off, but *surprise* it's pretty tricky to find
	-- buried as a switch called "smart error
	-- messages" That means, of course, that many of
	-- error messages are censored by default.
	-- And, of course, you'll be shocked to learn that
	-- IIS always returns error messages that are long
	-- enough to make Internet Explorer happy. The
	-- workaround is pretty simple: pad the error
	-- message with a big comment to push it over the
	-- five hundred and twelve byte minimum. Of course,
	-- that's exactly what you're reading right now....
