\section*{Abstract}

This document aims at describing how the Euro-COVID-19 dataset was created. It comprises texts and metadata on COVID-19 crisis measures taken by the European Union (EU) and the European Member States (MS). The creation of this dataset belongs to the SemCovid project financed by the Open Data Portal unit from the European Publications Office.

We provide here some of the underlying assumptions, a summary of methodological considerations, a description of the collected data and the technical stack used to perform the data processing.
