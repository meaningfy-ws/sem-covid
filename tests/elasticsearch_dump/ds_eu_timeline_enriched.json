An effective and safe vaccine against the virus is our best bet to achieve a permanent solution to the pandemic. Time is of the essence. Every month gained in finding such a vaccine saves lives, livelihoods and billions of euros. Today's strategy proposes a joint EU approach and builds on the mandate received from EU health ministers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThis is a moment for science and solidarity. Nothing is certain, but I am confident that we can mobilise the resources to find a vaccine to beat this virus once and for all. We must be ready to manufacture and deploy such a vaccine across Europe and the world. This vaccine will be a breakthrough in the fight against the coronavirus, and a testament to what partners can achieve when we put our minds, research and resources together. The European Union will do all in its power to ensure that all peoples of this world have access to a vaccine, irrespective of where they live.\u201d \n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides said: \u201cWorking together will increase our chances of securing access to a safe and effective vaccine at the scale we need and as quickly as possible. It will ensure fair and equitable access for all across the EU and globally, thus offering the best opportunity of finding a permanent exit strategy from the COVID-19 crisis. This is the EU at its best: pooling resources, joining efforts, bringing tangible results to the everyday lives of people. No one is safe until everyone is safe and we will leave no stones unturned in our efforts to protect EU and global citizens.\u201d\n\nVaccine development is a complex and lengthy process. With today's strategy, the Commission will support efforts to accelerate the development and availability of safe and effective vaccines in a timeframe between 12 and 18 months, if not earlier. Delivering on this complex undertaking requires running clinical trials in parallel with investing in production capacity to be able to produce millions, or even billions, of doses of a successful vaccine. The Commission is fully mobilised to support the efforts of vaccine developers in their endeavour.\n\nThis is not a European challenge, but a global one. The European Union will not be safe until the entire world has access to a vaccine, and as such, the EU and its Member States have both a responsibility and an interest to make a vaccine universally available.\n\nAn important step towards joint action between Member States has already been taken in the formation of an inclusive vaccine Alliance by France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The EU Vaccine Strategy will implement a joint approach going forward.\n\nThe strategy has the following objectives:\n\n\tEnsuring the quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines.\n\tSecuring swift access to vaccines for Member States and their populations while leading the global solidarity effort.\n\tEnsuring equitable access to an affordable vaccine as early as possible.\n\n\nThe EU strategy rests on two pillars:\n\n\tSecuring the production of vaccines in the EU and sufficient supplies for its Member States through Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers via the Emergency Support Instrument. Additional financing and other forms of support can be made available on top of such agreements.\n\tAdapting the EU's regulatory framework to the current urgency and making use of existing regulatory flexibility to accelerate the development, authorisation and availability of vaccines while maintaining the standards for vaccine quality, safety and efficacy.\n\n\nAdvance Purchase Agreements\n\nIn order to support companies in the swift development and production of a vaccine, the Commission will enter into agreements with individual vaccine producers on behalf of the Member States. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission will finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers. This will take the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided will be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nThe related funding will come from a significant part of the \u20ac2.7 billion Emergency Support Instrument. Additional support will be available through loans from the European Investment Bank.\n\nFinancing criteria \n\nWhen taking the financing decision on what vaccines to support, the following non-exhaustive criteria will be taken into account, including: soundness of scientific approach and technology used, speed of delivery at scale, cost, risk sharing, liability, coverage of different technologies, early engagement with EU regulators, global solidarity, and capacity to supply through development of production capacity within the EU.\n\nThere is always a risk that supported candidates fail during clinical trials. This Strategy is therefore similar to an insurance policy, by transferring some of the risks from industry to public authorities in return for assuring Member States of equitable and affordable access to a vaccine, should one become available.\n\nA flexible and robust regulatory process\n\nRegulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will make the greatest use of existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. This includes an accelerated procedure for authorisation, flexibility in relation to labelling and packaging, and a proposal to provide temporary derogations from certain provisions of the GMO legislation to speed up clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines containing genetically modified organisms.\n\nCompanies with a promising vaccine candidate, already in or close to starting clinical trials, are invited to contact the Commission at EC-VACCINES@ec.europa.eu.\n\nGlobal solidarity \n\nThe EU is contributing to the global effort for universal testing, treatment and vaccination by mobilising resources through international pledging and by joining forces with countries and global health organisations through the Access To Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator collaborative framework. The Global Coronavirus Response pledging campaign raised \u20ac9.8 billion by the end of May 2020. A second step is underway in partnership with Global Citizen and other governmental and non-governmental partners, culminating in a global pledging summit on 27 June.\n\nThe European Commission is committed to the principle of universal, equitable and affordable access to vaccines, especially for the most vulnerable countries. It is ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world.\n\nMore information\n\nPresident von der Leyen's video message is available in English, French, German, and sign language.\u00a0\n\nCommunication on the EU Strategy for COVID-19 vaccines\n\nCoronavirus Vaccines Strategy Factsheet\n\nWebsite on the Commission's Coronavirus Response\n\nCoronavirus Global Response Website\n\nCoronavirus Global Response Factsheet\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission unveils EU vaccines strategy"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1103\/IP_20_1103_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"15 April","title":"European roadmap shows path towards common lifting of containment measures","abstract":"<p>The Commission, in cooperation with the President of the European Council, put forward a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_652\">European roadmap<\/a> to phase-out the containment measures due to the coronavirus outbreak.

They have slowed down the spread of the virus and saved thousands of lives. However, these measures and the corresponding uncertainty come at a dramatic cost to people, society and the economy, and cannot last indefinitely.\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cSaving lives and protecting Europeans from the coronavirus is our number one priority. At the same time, it is time to look ahead and to focus on protecting livelihoods. Even though conditions in the Member States still vary widely, all Europeans rightly ask themselves when and in what order the confinement measures can be lifted. Responsible planning on the ground, wisely balancing the interests of protection of public health with those of the functioning of our societies, needs a solid foundation. That's why the Commission has drawn up a catalogue of guidelines, criteria and measures that provide a basis for thoughtful action. The strength of Europe lies in its social and economic balance. Together we learn from each other and help our European Union out of this crisis.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food safety Stella Kyriakides said: \u201cReturning to normality after the corona lockdowns will require a carefully coordinated and European approach between Member States, based on science and in the spirit of solidarity. It is crucial that our healthcare systems have the capacity to treat increases in new cases, that essential medicines and equipment are available and that we have large-scale testing and tracing capacity in place. We know that this road will be long and gradual and that the consequences of this unprecedented health crisis will be long lasting. Until effective treatments and a vaccine are found, we will have to learn to live with this virus. But Europe will be back on its feet, together and united. This is the only way.\u201d\n\nWhile recognising the specificities of each country, the European roadmap establishes the following key principles:\n\n\tTiming is essential. Deciding that the time has cometo begin to relax confinement should be based on these criteria:\n\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Epidemiological criteria showing that the spread of the disease has significantly decreased and stabilised for a sustained period.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Sufficient health system capacity, for example taking into account the occupation rate for intensive care units, the availability of health care workers and medical material.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Appropriate monitoring capacity, including large-scale testing capacity to quickly detect and isolate infected individuals, as well as tracking and tracing capacity.\n\n\tWe need a European approach. While timing and modalities for lifting containment measures differ between Member States, we need a common framework that is based on:\n\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Science with public health at its centre, while acknowledging that ending restrictive measures involves balancing public health benefits with social and economic impacts.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Coordination between Member States, to avoid negative effects. This is a matter of common European interest.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Respect and solidarity. This is essentialfor both health and socio-economic aspects. At a minimum, Member States should notify each other and the Commission in due time before they lift measures and take into account their views.\n\n\tPhasing-out confinement requires accompanying measures, including: \n\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Gathering harmonised data and developing a robust system of reporting and contact tracing, including with digital tools that fully respect data privacy;\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Expanding testing capacity and harmonising testing methodologies. The Commission \u2013 in consultation with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control \u2013 has adopted Guidelines today on different coronavirus tests and their performance;\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Increasing the capacity and resilience of national health care systems, in particular to address the predicted rise in infections after lifting restrictive measures;\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Continuing to reinforce medical and personal protective equipment capacities.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Developing safe and effective treatments and medicines, as well as developing and fast-tracking the introduction of a vaccine to put an end to the coronavirus.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Commission's roadmap lists concrete recommendations Member States should consider when planning to lift containment measures:\n\n\tActionshould be gradual: measures should be lifted in different steps, with sufficient time left between them to measure the impact.\n\n\n\tGeneral measures should progressively be replaced by targeted ones. For example, protecting the most vulnerable groups for longer; facilitating the gradual return of necessary economic activities; intensifying regular cleaning and disinfection of transport hubs, shops and workplaces; replacing general states of emergencies with targeted government interventions to ensure transparency and democratic accountability.\n\n\n\tInternal border controls should be lifted in a coordinated manner. Travel restrictions and border controls should be removed once the border regions' epidemiological situation converges sufficiently. External border should be reopened in a second stage and take account of the spread of the virus outside the EU.\n\n\n\tThe re-start of economic activity should be phased-in: there are several models that can be implemented, e.g. jobs suitable for teleworking, economic importance, shifts of workers, etc. The entire population should not return to the workplace at the same time.\n\n\n\tGatherings of people should be progressively permitted, taking into account the specificities of different categories of activity, such as:\n\n\n\tSchools and universities;\n\tCommercial activity (retail) with possible gradation;\n\tSocial activity measures (restaurants, cafes) with possible gradation;\n\tMass gatherings\n\n\n\tEfforts to prevent the spread of the virus should be sustained, with awareness campaigns to encourage the population to keep up the strong hygiene practices and social distancing.\n\tAction should be continuously monitored and preparedness developed for returning to stricter containment measures as necessary.\n\n\nWhile confinement measures are gradually lifted, there is a need to strategically plan the recovery, revitalising the economy and getting back on a path of sustainable growth. This includes enabling the twin transition towards a greener and digital society, and drawing all lessons from the current crisis for the EU's preparedness and resilience. The Commission will develop a Recovery plan, based on a revamped proposal for the next long-term EU budget (Multiannual Financial Framework) and the updated Commission Work Programme for 2020.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Commission, in cooperation with the President of the European Council, has developed the present roadmap responding to the call of the European Council of 26 Marchfor a coordinated exit strategy. It takes into account the expertise of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the panel of scientific experts advising the Commission on the coronavirus. Evidently, any such reflection is based on the scientific knowledge available today, and should be revised as further evidence appears and measuring methods are harmonised.\n\nIn parallel, the Commission continues to mobilise funding to foster research on the development of vaccine, treatments and medicines. The Commission is also working with the European Medicines Agency to streamline regulatory steps, from clinical trials to marketing authorisations. It will also foster international cooperation as a priority.\n\nFurthermore, to help Member States acquire the necessary equipment as rapidly as possible, including tests, the Commission has set up a \u2018Clearing house for medical equipment', launched joint procurement actions and emergency stockpiling via RescEU and proposed to support national health systems with the Emergency Support Instrument.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nLink to the Joint Roadmap\n\nFactsheet: A Joint European Roadmap towards lifting coronavirus containment measures\n\nWebsite on the Commission's coronavirus response\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: European roadmap shows path towards common lifting of containment measures"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_652\/IP_20_652_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Eric MAMER","phone":"+32 2 299 40 73","email":"eric.mamer@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Dana SPINANT","phone":"+32 2 299 01 50","email":"dana.spinant@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":[],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"December 2020","date":"18 December","title":"Commission puts forward rules on rapid antigen tests and secures 20 million tests for Member States","abstract":"<p>The Commission adopted a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/health\/sites\/health\/files\/preparedness_response\/docs\/covid-19_rat_recommendation_en.pdf\">proposal<\/a> on a common framework for the use, validation and mutual recognition of rapid antigen tests.

The European Commission finances 100% of the assets including storage and transport.\n\nThe Emergency Response Coordination Centre coordinates the distribution of the supplies, ensuring it goes where it is needed most, based on the needs expressed by countries requesting EU assistance under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nBackground\n\nThe strategic medical capacity is part of the wider rescEU reserve, including other capacities such as aerial firefighting means and medical evacuation capacities. The rescEU reserve constitutes the \u201clast resort\u201d layer of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which can be activated for all types of natural and man-made hazards.

With the AstraZeneca vaccine now authorized, 400 million additional doses will be available in Europe. I expect the company to deliver these doses as agreed, so that Europeans can be vaccinated as soon as possible. We will continue doing all we can to secure more vaccines for Europeans, our neighbours and our partners worldwide.\u201d \n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cWith this newly authorised vaccine, our portfolio continues to take shape. Our EU Vaccines Strategy has always aimed to have a vaccine portfolio that is broad and diverse, with different technologies used, to maximise our chances of providing safe and effective vaccines to citizens as soon as possible. The European Medicines Agency's authorisation today is another step towards delivering on this promise. The Commission continues to work around the clock to secure more vaccines for Europe and our international partners. We are leaving no stone unturned in our fight against this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine will be given to adults aged 18 years and older for preventing COVID-19. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. People vaccinated will receive two injections of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nAccording to EMA, most of the participants in the studies were between 18 and 55 years old. There are not yet enough results in older participants (over 55 years old) to provide a figure for how well the vaccine will work in this group. However, protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines; as there is reliable information on safety in this population, EMA's scientific experts considered that the vaccine can be used in older adults. More information is expected from ongoing studies, which include a higher proportion of elderly participants.\n\nOn the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional marketing authorisation.\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is based on an adenovirus, a harmless virus which delivers the \u2018instructions' from the virus that causes COVID-19.This allows the body's own cells to make the protein unique to the COVID-19 virus. The person's immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by COVID-19.\n\nNext steps\n\nAccording to the contract signed with the European Commission on 27 August 2020, AstraZeneca will deliver the total amount of 400 million doses throughout 2021. These will add to the 600 million doses of the vaccine by BioNTech-Pfizer and the 160 million doses of the vaccine by Moderna.\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nA conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However it also ensures that this COVID-19 vaccine meets the EU standards, as for all other vaccines and medicines.\n\nOnce a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. CMAs are foreseen in the EU legislation specifically for public health emergencies and is considered the most appropriate regulatory mechanism in this pandemic for granting access to all EU citizens and for underpinning mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nAstraZeneca submitted an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA on 11 January 2021. However, assessment already started beforehand. EMA had started assessing non-clinical data from laboratory studies in October 2020 and updated its rolling review end of December 2020 on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.\n\nThe European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional marketing authorisation.\n\nFor More Information\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nQuestions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nEU's legislation on medicinal products\n\nEMA and COVID-19 vaccines\n\nFactsheet: How vaccines work\n\nFactsheet: Health benefits of vaccines\n\nFactsheet: Authorisation process\n\nFactsheet: Long-term safety\n\nEU's current portfolio\n\n","detail_title":["European Commission authorises third safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_306\/IP_21_306_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/coronavirus-response\/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?qid=1597339415327&uri=CELEX:52020DC0245","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_2390","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/coronavirus-response\/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/health\/human-use_en","https:\/\/www.ema.europa.eu\/en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2363","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2364","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2245","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2365","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2244"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"30 March","title":"EU\u00a0solidarity with Western Balkans and Eastern Neighbourhood","abstract":"<p>The Commission has <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_562\">reallocated EUR 140 million<\/a> for the most immediate needs in the Eastern Neighbourhood countries, and will redirect the use of existing instruments worth up to EUR 700 million to help mitigate the socio-economic impact of the coronavirus crisis.

In addition, the Commission will also redirect the use of existing instruments worth up to \u20ac700 million to help mitigate the socio-economic impact of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nCommissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi said: \u201cThese are very difficult times not only for the EU, but for our partner countries as well. We are doing all we can to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on human lives and livelihoods. We are responding both to the immediate needs of the health systems, as well as longer term needs to the most vulnerable groups in society and small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the economies in the six countries.\u201d \n\nResponding to immediate needs\n\nAt the request of the partner countries, the Commission will respond to immediate needs by supporting the supply of medical devices and personal equipment, such as ventilators, laboratory kits, masks, goggles, gowns, and safety suits. The European Commission is working with the World Health Organisation (WHO), and is deploying \u20ac30 million to ensure these necessary supplies are jointly purchased and effectively distributed to the health systems of the six countries in the coming weeks. In addition, the funds will support national health administrations to train medical and laboratory staff and carry out awareness raising measures to the wider population.\n\nThe Commission has also made available more than \u20ac11.3 million in small grants to civil society organisations. These funds are already responding to immediate needs, through the ongoing regional \u201cRapid Response Mechanism\u201d, such as supporting local schools with distance learning. By the summer, and as part of this package, the Commission will launch the \u201cEastern Partnership Solidarity Programme\u201d which will target the most affected parts of the populations through civil society support and notably sub-grants to smaller, local organisations.\n\nMitigating the socio-economic impact of the outbreak\n\nThe Commission is working closely with International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and relevant financing institutions from EU Member States as TEAM EUROPE providing a coordinated European response for the real economy, including SMEs, in particular through:\n\n- Launching of a new support programme of \u20ac100 million to help SMEs, including self-employed and others to easily access credit and boost their businesses after the crisis;\n\n- Facilitating, simplifying, accelerating, and reinforcing \u20ac200 million worth of existing credit lines and grants to SMEs in local currency including through its EU4Business Initiative;\n\n- In addition, in the current crisis the EU has mobilised its major de-risking instrument the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), worth a total of \u20ac1.55 billion, with \u20ac500 million being made available for the EU's neighbourhood. This will rapidly provide liquidity in the EU's neighbourhood, including through working capital, trade finance, or moratoria on debt service. This support is in addition to the ongoing macro financial assistance support to partners, including Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.\n\nThe Commission also stands ready to provide assistance through TAIEX, its peer to peer instrument, by using EU Member States expertise, experience and examples of good practices on assessing emergency preparedness response scheme and health systems.\n\nThe outbreak of coronavirus has accelerated the spread of myths and disinformation around it, coming from various sources both within and outside of the European Union.

Efforts include increasing production by existing manufacturers, facilitating imports and activating alternative ways of producing equipment.\n\nUpon the urgent request of the Commission, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), in collaboration with all their members, have agreed to immediately make available a number of European standards for certain medical devices and personal protective equipment. This action will help both EU and third-country companies willing to manufacture these items to swiftly start production and place products on the internal market more easily while ensuring a high degree of safety.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton said: \u201cWe need to act collectively with urgency, solidarity, and audacity. I am encouraging manufacturers to increase and diversify production, building on positive examples such as textile and shoe manufacturers starting to produce masks and gowns. I will do everything possible to support their efforts. I am pleased to announce that following contacts with the Commission, CEN\/CENELEC has agreed to make freely available the standards needed for such companies to be able to produce masks and other protective equipment.\u201d\n\nToday's agreement has immediate effect. The 11 standards developed by CEN and potentially 3 additional ones developed jointly with ISO that are made available cover common filtering masks, medical gloves and protective clothing.\n\nThis initiative complements the Commission\u00a0Recommendation on the conformity assessment and market surveillance procedures, which provides guidance to national bodies on allowing non CE-marked personal protection equipment\u00a0that comply with the necessary health and safety standards to enter the EU market within the context of the Coronavirus.\n\nHow the free access to these standards helps increasing production\n\nProviding free access to the national adoptions of these European standards helps both EU and third-country companies which are reconverting their production lines to manufacture quickly these critical items for preventing the coronavirus pandemic. The use of the standards will enable companies that use them to access the market for such fundamental medical and protection equipment quicker and to provide those in need with such medical equipment.\n\nNormally, standards must be purchased and used in line with the intellectual property right rules, as the copyright of the standards lies with the organisations, which have developed the standards. The derogation from this business model is a strong European response, based on a sense of social responsibility and solidarity, to address the shortage problem of protective equipment deriving from the Covid-19 epidemics.\n\nThe standards are available for free download from the websites of CEN national members.\n\nBackground \n\nEuropean standards are an essential pillar of a fully functioning internal market. They reduce costs, promote innovation, ensure interoperability between different devices and services, and help companies to access markets.\n\nTo support EU product legislation, the Commission can request the development of European harmonised standards to facilitate compliance by manufacturers of the relevant requirements. Once agreed and referenced in the Official Journal of the European Union, these harmonised standards become part of EU law and allow companies an easy and direct access to the internal market for their products, while ensuring a high degree of safety for consumer.\n\nEuropean legislation for medical devices and personal protection equipment does also rely on harmonised standards. In our common effort to face the corona virus outbreak, the Commission and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) have agreed to make a number of harmonised standards for important protective equipment like face masks and single-use gloves freely available to those companies that are willing to start producing these items.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information \n\nList of available standards:\n\n\tEN 149:2009 Respiratory protective devices \u2013 Filtering half masks to protect against particles - Requirements, testing, marking (commonly referred to as \u2018FFP masks'\n\tEN 14683:2019 EN Medical face masks - Requirements and test method\n\tEN 166:2001 Personal eye-protection \u2013 Specifications\n\tEN 14126:2003 Protective clothing - Performance requirements and tests methods for protective clothing against infective agents\n\tEN 14605:2009 Protective clothing against liquid chemicals - performance requirements for clothing with liquid-tight (Type 3) or spray-tight (Type 4) connections, including items providing protection to parts of the body only\n\tEN 13795-1:2019 Surgical clothing and drapes - Requirements and test methods - Part 1: Surgical drapes and gowns\n\tEN 13795-2:2019 Surgical drapes, gowns and clean air suits, used as medical devices for patients, clinical staff and equipment - Part 2: Test methods\n\tEN 455-1:2000 Medical gloves for single use - Part 1: Requirements and testing for freedom from holes (MDD)\n\tEN 455-2:2015 Medical gloves for single use - Part 2: Requirements and testing for physical properties (MMD)\n\tEN 455-3:2015 Medical gloves for single use - Part 3: Requirements and testing for biological evaluation (MDD)\n\tEN 455-4:2009 EN Medical gloves for single use - Part 4: Requirements and testing for shelf life determination (MDD)\n\n\nIn addition, possibly:\n\n\tEN ISO 374-5:2017 Protective gloves against dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms - Part 5: Terminology and performance requirements for micro-organisms risks\n\tEN ISO 13688:2013 Protective clothing - General requirements\n\tEN ISO 10993-1:2009 Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process\n\n\nEuropean Standards\n\nEuropean Committee for Standardisation\n\nEuropean Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: European standards for medical supplies made freely available to facilitate increase of production"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_502\/IP_20_502_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Sonya GOSPODINOVA","phone":"+32 2 296 69 53","email":"sonya.gospodinova@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Federica MICCOLI","phone":"+32 2 295 83 00","email":"federica.miccoli@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["Internal Market, defence industry and space","education, youth, sport and culture","internal market and industry","defence industry and space"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/growth\/single-market\/european-standards_en","https:\/\/www.cen.eu\/Pages\/default.aspx","https:\/\/www.cenelec.eu\/"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Working time and working time flexibility","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"July 2020","date":"20 July","title":"Support for most vulnerable in Southern Africa","abstract":"<p>The Commission is providing EUR 64.7 million in humanitarian aid for <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1374\">countries in the southern Africa region<\/a> to help support people in need dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, extreme weather conditions such as persistent drought in the region and other crises.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1374"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1374"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1374","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"20 July 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission is providing \u20ac64.7 million in humanitarian aid for countries in the southern Africa region to help support people in need dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, extreme weather conditions such as persistent drought in the region and other crises.\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d,\u00a0Commissioner for Crisis Management, said: \u201cThe EU is helping to provide life-saving assistance to impoverished households suffering from crop and livestock losses due to drought.

This includes but is not limited to those working in the health care and food sectors, and other essential services like childcare, elderly care, and critical staff for utilities. Together with the Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU also issued today, this responds to requests made by EU leaders\u00a0on 26 March and seeks to address practical concerns of citizens and companies affected by the measures taken to limit the spread of the coronavirus, as well as of national authorities implementing the measures.\n\nWhile it is understandable that Member States have introduced internal border controls to limit the spread of the coronavirus, it is imperative that critical workers are able to reach their destination without delay.\n\nNicolas Schmit, the Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: \u201cThousands of women and men working hard to keep us safe, healthy and with food on the table need to cross EU borders to go to work. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that they are not hindered in their movement, while taking every precaution to avoid further spread of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines published today identify a range of workers that exercise critical occupations, and for which continued free movement in the EU is deemed essential. The list provided in these guidelines is not exhaustive. Examples include health associate professionals, child and elderly care workers, scientists in health-related industries, those needed to install critical medical devices, firefighters and police officers, transport workers, as well as persons working in the food sector. The Commission urges Member States to establish specific burden free and fast procedures to ensure a smooth passage for such frontier workers, including proportionate health screening.\n\nBeyond these specific categories of workers, the guidelines also clarify that Member States should allow frontier workers in general to continue crossing borders if work in the sector concerned is still allowed in the host Member State.Member States should treat cross border workers and national workers in the same manner.\n\nAs regards seasonal workers, particularly in the agricultural sector, Member States are asked to exchange information on their different needs at technical level and to establish specific procedures to ensure a smooth passage for such workers, in order to respond to labour shortages as a result of the crisis. Seasonal workers in agriculture perform in certain circumstances critical harvesting, planting and tending functions. In such a situation, Member States should treat those persons as critical workers and communicate to the employers the necessity to provide for adequate health and safety protection.\n\nThese guidelines complement the recently adopted Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services as well as the Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU which were also presented today.\n\nThe Commission will continue to identify the best practices with Member States which can be extended to all Member States for allowing workers to exercise their crucial occupations without undue hindrance.\n\nBackground\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to the introduction of unprecedented measures across EU Member States, including reintroduced checks at the internal borders.\n\nFrontier workers, posted workers as well as seasonal workers live in one EU country but work in another. Many of them are crucial for their host Member States, for instance for the health care system, the provision of other essential services including the setting up and maintenance of medical equipment and infrastructure, or ensuring the supply of necessity goods. A coordinated approach at EU level is therefore key.\n\nOn 26 March, the Heads of State or government stated: \u201cWe will urgently address, with the assistance of the Commission, the remaining problems concerning EU citizens blocked at internal EU borders and prevented from returning to their home countries and cross-border and seasonal workers who have to be able to continue essential activities while avoiding further spread of the virus.\u201d These guidelines presented today are the Commission's immediate response to this call, alongside the Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU which include the repatriation of EU citizens.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommunication of 27 March presenting \u201cGuidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers\u201d\n\nCoronavirus website\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission presents practical guidance to ensure the free movement of critical workers"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_545\/IP_20_545_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Siobh\u00e1n MILLBRIGHT","phone":"+32 2 295 73 61","email":"siobhan.millbright@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":["http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/social\/BlobServlet?docId=22473&langId=en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Ensuring business continuity and support for essential services","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"15 March","title":"Ensuring supply of personal protective equipment in the EU","abstract":"<p>The Commission took steps to <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_469\">protect the availability of supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE)<\/a>, by requiring that exports of such equipment outside of the European Union are subject to an export authorisation by Member States.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_469"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_469"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_469","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"15 March 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its continuing efforts to protect citizens and to coordinate the response to COVID-19, the Commission has taken immediate steps to protect the availability of supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), by requiring that exports of such equipment outside of the European Union are subject to an export authorisation by Member States.\n\nCommissioner for Trade Phil Hogan, said: \u201cThe challenges presented by the spread of COVID-19 justify the urgency of this action.

This latest EU mask delivery is part of a new Commission funded purchase of 10 million masks via the Emergency Support Instrument\u00a0to provide direct support to Member States to mitigate the immediate consequences of the pandemic and anticipate the needs related to the exit and recovery.\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said: \u201cWe are doing everything we can to support Member States in getting protective equipment to health workers on the frontline. They are Europe's modern day heroes. This is EU solidarity in action to help respond to the needs of European health systems and \u20ac3 billion has been mobilised from the EU budget to directly support national efforts. We remain steadfast in our commitment: together we can win this fight.\u201d\n\nThe masks will be delivered to Member States and regions in need in weekly instalments of 1.5 million masks over the coming six weeks.\n\nThese deliveries take place on top of the hundreds of thousands of masks already provided from the rescEU reserve of medical equipment in the past weeks, as well as assistance mobilised via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, on 24 April, the Commission decided to mobilise, under the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI), \u20ac320 million for Emergency Support actions, of which \u20ac100 million are for essential health-related products that will be procured in the coming months.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Commission is mobilising \u20ac3 billion from the EU budget to directly support Member States' health care systems, of which \u20ac2.7 billion will be channelled through the Emergency Support Instrument and \u20ac300 million through the rescEU medical equipment capacity. Additional contributions are possible, including from Member States.\n\nThe Emergency Support Instrument allows direct support to EU Member States in their efforts to address the pandemic through measures that can deliver greater impact if taken at EU level. It does not replace existing instruments (joint procurement, rescEU, etc.) but complements them.\n\nThis will allow the Commission to support a wide range of initiatives, including:\n\n\tpurchasing medical equipment such as ventilators and masks;\n\tcoordinating and financially supporting the transport of patients to EU Member States with spare hospital capacity;\n\tcontributing to increase the rollout and testing across the EU;\n\tsupporting the deployment of vaccines, some of which might be the result of significant support under other EU initiatives.\n\n\nThanks to this tool, the EU can deploy targeted actions preventing and mitigating the immediate acute consequences in one or more Member States and to support in a coordinated manner the needs related to the exit and recovery from the corona crisis in the medium to long term.\n\nThe Commission will thus be providing a holistic EU response throughout the corona crisis.\n\nTo implement the support, the Commission continues to work closely with national health authorities, international organisations and with the non-governmental sector.\n\nFor more information\n\nFactsheet: EU Medical and Health Support\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission delivers first batch of 1.5 million masks from 10 million purchased to support EU healthcare workers"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_819\/IP_20_819_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Regional funds"},{"month_name":"July 2020","date":"2 July","title":"New assistance package to support vulnerable groups and address COVID-19 in North Africa","abstract":"<p>As part of the EU's global response to the coronavirus outbreak, the EU - through its Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) - has adopted a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1244\">new assistance package<\/a>\u00a0to protect migrants, stabilise local communities and respond to COVID-19 in North Africa.

This package includes \u20ac80 million in new funds as well as \u20ac30 million reallocated from non-contracted actions under the EUTF.\n\nIn line with the Joint Communication on the global EU response to COVID-19, this new funding will also strengthen the immediate response capacity, reinforce the health systems and services in the North African partner countries, mitigate the socio-economic impact of the crisis, as well as allow for the continuation of actions to protect refugees and migrants and stabilise local communities.\n\nCommissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, said: \u201cWith today's substantial and targeted assistance package we are responding to the urgent needs to fight the COVID-19 crisis and address the needs of some of the most vulnerable groups in North Africa, in particular refugees, migrants and displaced persons. In Libya, while the armed conflict continues, the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa has already supported over 200,000 beneficiaries with hygiene kits and medical assistance and over 1.7 million people have now better access to basic services in local communities, thanks to the renovation of health centres.\u201d\n\nSupport to Libya\n\nLibya remains the biggest beneficiary under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, with \u20ac455 million in programmes, with the majority going to protection of migrants and refugees and community stabilisation, alongside actions for border management.\n\nAs part of the EU's comprehensive approach and support on migration in Libya, three new programmes adopted today will improve the resilience of both Libyans and migrants for the health challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic:\n\n\tA \u20ac30.2 million protection programme will provide protection services to migrants and vulnerable groups, such as health assistance to treat tuberculosis, non-food items, emergency cash assistance and emergency evacuations outside of Libya (when travel restrictions are lifted);\n\tA specific \u20ac20 million COVID-19 programme will strengthen immediate response to the virus, including personal protective equipment and training for health staff; the strengthening of laboratory capacities and intensive care response. It will also reinforce the health system and services in the country in the medium term;\n\tA \u20ac25 million community stabilisation programme to continue to improve the living conditions in the Libyan municipalities, in particular in the South, by enhancing access to basic and social services.\n\n\nIn order to fund these essential new actions, \u20ac30 million has been re-allocated from existing Border Management programmes in Libya, which will now amount to \u20ac57.2 million. While Border Management in Libya remains a priority in order to continue to save lives at sea, the reallocation of funding reflects the need to adapt existing actions to the changing security situation on the ground. The revised Border Management programme will strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and Port Security's capacity for search and rescue activities and prevention of migrant smuggling, support the maintenance of boats, provide further training as well as support the establishment of the Libyan Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre.\n\nSupport to Tunisia\n\nIn Tunisia, two new programmes will strengthen support to migrants and the most vulnerable groups, who may be particularly hard hit by the current crisis:\n\n\tA \u20ac9.3 million governance and protection programme to provide protection services to vulnerable migrants, improve access to health services as well as to continue to support migration governance and to the Tunisian-led service for the reintegration of returnees hosted by the \u2018Office des Tunisiens \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger' (OTE);\n\tA \u20ac5 million skills mobility programme built on two bilateral mobility agreements in place between France and Tunisia for young professionals and seasonal workers, based on the principle of circular mobility and for workers to gain needed skills in the country of origin.\n\n\nRegional COVID-19 response\n\nA new \u20ac10 million COVID-19 fast track emergency response programme has also been adopted to support the most vulnerable populations in North Africa tackling their emergency needs as well as the social and economic consequences of the crisis in order to contribute to the national efforts already in place.\n\nOther regional initiatives\n\nA \u20ac3.7 million regional child protection programme, with a focus on Libya and Egypt, has been adopted to improve the protection and expand access to sustainable solutions for unaccompanied and separated children and youth along the Central Mediterranean Route.\n\n\u20ac6.5 million was also adopted to fund a Technical Cooperation Facility to ensure effective monitoring and evaluations of all the actions implemented under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund of Africa.\n\nBackground\n\nThe EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa was established in 2015 to address the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration and to contribute to better migration management. The Trust Fund covers three windows: the Sahel and Lake Chad, the Horn of Africa, and the North of Africa.\n\nToday's assistance package brings the total funding mobilised through the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa to nearly \u20ac888 million since its launch in 2015. The new funding was approved by the Operational Committee of the Trust Fund, which brings together the European Commission, the EU Member States, the United Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland. Observers of the Operational Committee include partner countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia as well as Members of the European Parliament.\n\nThe Trust Fund is also reorienting ongoing interventions in key sectors in Libya to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Reallocation of existing actions in Libya allowed implementing partners to provide personal protective equipment, hygiene kits, training to medical staff as well as awareness campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus among vulnerable groups.\n\nEU Institutions, EU Member States and other donors have so far allocated resources amounting to \u20ac5 billion to the EUTF.\n\nWith today's adoption, the EUTF now funds 246 programmes totalling close to \u20ac4.8 billion. The funding is divided between three regions as follows: Sahel\/Lake Chad, \u20ac2 billion (104 programmes); Horn of Africa, \u20ac1.79 billion (99 programmes); North of Africa, \u20ac888 million (39 programmes).\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa website\n\nFactsheet the EU support on migration in North Africa\n\nFactsheet the EU support on migration in Libya\n\nFactsheet the EU support on migration in Tunisia\n\n","detail_title":["EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa: New assistance package to support vulnerable groups and address COVID-19 in North Africa"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1244\/IP_20_1244_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Zo\u00ef MULETIER","phone":"+32 2 299 43 06","email":"Zoi.MULETIER@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","Neighbourhood and Enlargement"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/trustfundforafrica\/index_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/trustfundforafrica\/sites\/euetfa\/files\/facsheet_north_africa_dec_2019.pdf","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/trustfundforafrica\/sites\/euetfa\/files\/eutf-factsheet_libya_dec_2019_1.pdf","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/trustfundforafrica\/sites\/euetfa\/files\/eutf-factsheet_tunisia_dec_2019.pdf"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"16 April","title":"Guidance to ensure full data protection standards of apps fighting the pandemic","abstract":"<p>The Commission published <a href=\"\/info\/files\/guidance-apps-supporting-fight-against-covid-19-pandemic-relation-data-protection_en\">guidance<\/a> on developing new apps that support the fight against coronavirus in relation to data protection.

This is part of a common coordinated approach to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures, as set out in a Commission Recommendation last week.\n\nSince the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Member States, backed by the Commission, have been assessing the effectiveness, security, privacy, and data protection aspects of digital solutions to address the crisis. Contact tracing apps, if fully compliant with EU rules and well coordinated, can play a key role in all phases of crisis management, especially when time will be ripe to gradually lift social distancing measures. They can complement existing manual contact tracing and help interrupt the transmission chain of the virus.The toolbox is accompanied by guidance on data protection for such mobile apps, which is also published today.\n\nWelcoming the toolbox, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton said: \u201cContact tracing apps to limit the spread of coronavirus can be useful, especially as part of Member States' exit strategies. However, strong privacy safeguards are a pre-requisite for the uptake of these apps, and therefore their usefulness. While we should be innovative and make the best use of technology in fighting the pandemic, we will not compromise on our values and privacy requirements.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides added: \u201cDigital tools will be crucial to protect our citizens as we gradually lift confinement measures. Mobile apps can warn us of infection risks and support health authorities with contact tracing, which is essential to break transmission chains. We need to be diligent, creative, and flexible in our approaches to opening up our societies again. We need to continue to flatten the curve \u2013 and keep it down. Without safe and compliant digital technologies, our approach will not be efficient.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nA common approach for voluntary and privacy-compliant tracing apps\n\nToday's announcement is the first iteration of a common EU toolbox, developed urgently and collaboratively by the e-Health Network with the support of the European Commission. It provides a practical guide for Member States in the implementation of contact tracing and warning apps. The toolbox sets out the essential requirements for these apps:\n\n\tThey should be fully compliant with the EU data protection and privacy rules, as put forward by the guidance presented today following consultation with the European Data Protection Board.\n\tThey should be implemented in close coordination with, and approved by, public health authorities.\n\tThey should be installed voluntarily, and dismantled as soon as no longer needed.\n\tThey should aim to exploit the latest privacy-enhancing technological solutions. Likely to be based on Bluetooth proximity technology, they do not enable tracking of people's locations.\n\tThey should be based on anonymised data: They can alert people who have been in proximity for a certain duration to an infected person to get tested or self-isolate, without revealing the identity of the people infected.\n\tThey should be interoperable across the EU so that citizens are protected even when they cross borders.\n\tThey should be anchored in accepted epidemiological guidance, and reflect best practice on cybersecurity, and accessibility.\n\tThey should be secure and effective.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile allowing for easier, quicker and more efficient tracing than traditional systems based on interviews with infected patients, manual tracing will continue to cover citizens who could be more vulnerable to infection but are less likely to have a smartphone, such as elderly or disabled persons.\n\nA common approach to other functionalities, in particular on information and symptom tracking, may be developed in future iterations of the toolbox.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe toolbox reflects the latest best practices in the use of mobile contact tracing and warning apps to tackling the crisis. It is part of an ongoing process where Member States work together to devise and refine in the coming weeks and months the use of this and other practical tools. This first version will be further enriched in light of the experiences of Member States.\n\nMember States should report on their actions by 31 May 2020 and make the measures accessible to other Member States and the Commission for peer review. The Commission will assess the progress made and publish periodic reports starting in June 2020 and throughout the crisis, recommending action or the phasing out of measures that seem no longer necessary.\n\nFor more information\n\nEU toolbox on mobile applications to support contact tracing in the EU's fight against COVID-19\n\nCommission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis\n\nGuidance to ensure full data protection standards of apps fighting the pandemic\n\nCommission coronavirus response page\n\nDigital technologies in response to coronavirus\n\n\u00a0\n\n* Update on 30\/04\/2020 12:45\n\n\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: An EU approach for efficient contact tracing apps to support gradual lifting of confinement measures*"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_670\/IP_20_670_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Johannes BAHRKE","phone":"+32 2 295 86 15","email":"johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Charles MANOURY","phone":"+32 2 291 33 91","email":"charles.manoury@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health and food safety","digital economy","public health","transport","research and innovation"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"November 2020","date":"12 November","title":"EU increases its contribution to COVAX Facility","abstract":"<p>The EU has announced it will contribute an <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2075\">additional EUR 100 million in grant funding<\/a> to support the COVAX Facility to secure access to the future COVID-19 vaccine in low and middle-income countries.

With this new contribution, the EU is further stepping up investment in support of the global recovery.\n\nAt the virtual Paris Peace Forum, where world leaders and international organizations are discussing the global response and the recovery from the pandemic, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cIn the midst of the wrecking COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that a global recovery will only be possible if safe and effective vaccines are available to all who need it. The EU is increasing its support to the COVAX Facility to this end and I am proud that Team Europe is a leading contributor to COVAX.

With this additional \u20ac100 million in grant funding, the EU join forces with international partners, in a spirit of solidarity and multilateralism, and will help secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for those who need it the most in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific countries.\u201d \n\nStella\u00a0Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said:\u00a0\u201cOf all the lessons we have learned this year, the clearest is that there is strength in solidarity. COVAX is an example of this. With this additional contribution we are one step closer to the objective of funding the purchase of 2 billion vaccines for the most vulnerable populations in 92 low and middle-income countries. But more support will be required next year to produce and distribute a safe and efficacious vaccine across the world as soon as it becomes available. We will not relent in this effort.\u201d\n\nThe proposed allocation of \u20ac100 million from the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) general reserve will adopt the form of a grant contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as administrator of COVAX Facility, the world's facility for universal and fair access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nTo date, a total of 184 countries participate in the COVAX Facility, being 92 of them low and middle-income economies eligible to get access to COVID-19 vaccines through Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). Through this grant, the Commission and its partners will secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for all the participants in the Facility, including African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.\n\nThis grant support will strategically complement the \u20ac400 million of bank guarantees the EU will make available to Gavi through the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the framework of the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), raising the total EU contribution for COVAX to \u20ac500 million.*\n\nSeveral EU Member States are contributing as well to COVAX and its underlying objectives, highlighting another example of the power of Team Europe, that is mobilising more than \u20ac870 million for COVAX, including the \u20ac100 million in EU grant and \u20ac400 million in guarantees. The figure also includes new contributions announced today by France (\u20ac100 million), Spain (\u20ac50 million) and Finland (\u20ac2 million).\n\nVaccines will be procured and delivered to countries by UNICEF Supply Division and the PAHO's Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines.\n\nBackground\n\nCOVAX is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.\n\nThe COVAX Facility aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. It will help to develop a diversified portfolio of vaccines, negotiated with different suppliers, and covering different scientific technologies, delivery times and prices. The COVAX Facility is a risk-sharing mechanism: it reduces the risk for manufacturers who invest without being sure about future demand, and it reduces the risk that countries would fail to secure access to a viable vaccine.\n\nThe European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home, and to promote global health. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the\u00a0Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0Team Europe's contribution was as follows: EU Member States (\u20ac3.1 billion), European Commission (over \u20ac1.4 billion) and EIB (almost \u20ac2 billion pledged in May and \u20ac4.9 billion pledged in June).\n\nThe EU's participation in COVAX will be complementary with the ongoing EU negotiations with vaccine companies launched under the EU Vaccines Strategy. The EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need. Through its Advanced Purchase Agreements, it requires manufacturers to make their production capacity available to supply all countries and calls for the free flow of vaccines and materials with no export restrictions. For instance, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-GSK, with whom the Commission concluded an Advanced Purchase Agreement in September,\u00a0will endeavour to provide a significant portion of their vaccine supply through the COVAX facility.\n\nWorld leaders and international organizations are participating in this virtual third edition of The Paris Peace Forum, initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron to revive collective governance, international cooperation and multilateralism at a time of growing challenges and when international norms and institutions are being challenged. Discussions this year, under the overarching theme \u2018Bouncing back to a better planet', will focus on improving the global governance of health and promoting green financing.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU global response to coronavirus\n\n*Updated on 16\/11\/2020 at 10:20\n\n","detail_title":["EU increases its contribution to COVAX to \u20ac500 million to secure COVID-19 vaccines for low and middle-income countries"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2075\/IP_20_2075_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Gesine KNOLLE","phone":"+32 2 295 43 23","email":"gesine.knolle@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","public health and food safety","public health","international cooperation and development","transport"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/international-partnerships\/topics\/eu-global-response-covid-19_fr"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"November 2020","date":"11 November","title":"Fourth contract with pharmaceutical companies to ensure access to a potential vaccine","abstract":"<p>The Commission approved <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2081\">a fourth contract with pharmaceutical companies<\/a> BioNTech and Pfizer, which provides for the initial purchase of 200 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to request up to a further 100 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2081"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2081"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2081","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"11 November 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission approved a fourth contract with pharmaceutical companies BioNTech and Pfizer, which provides for the initial purchase of 200 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to request up to a further 100 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19. Member States can decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nToday's contract with the BioNTech-Pfizer alliance builds upon the broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the already signed a contracts with AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, and the concluded successful exploratory talks with CureVac and Moderna. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u00a0\u201cIn the wake of Monday's promising announcement by BioNTech and Pfizer on the prospects for their vaccine, I'm very happy to announce today's agreement with the European company BioNTech and Pfizer to purchase 300 million doses of the vaccine. With this fourth contract we are now consolidating an extremely solid vaccine candidate portfolio, most of them in advanced trials phase. Once authorised, they will be quickly deployed and bring us closer to a sustainable solution of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cA safe and effective vaccine is the only lasting exit strategy from the pandemic, and is at the centre of our European Vaccine Strategy. Today's agreement follows the encouraging first indications from the clinical trial results and is further evidence of our commitment to putting more Europe in the area of health. It is a very telling example of what the EU can achieve when working together, as a Union, and a case in point of what a future European Health Union will be able to deliver.\u201d\n\nBioNTech is a German company working with US-based Pfizer to develop a new vaccine based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in\u00a0 biology, transferring instructions from DNA to cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions make harmless fragments of the virus which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease.\n\nThe Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the companies' experience in vaccine development and their production capacity to supply the whole of the EU.\n\nBackground\n\nIn June, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and BioNTech concluded a \u20ac100 million debt financing agreement to allow the company to expand its manufacturing capacity in order to supply their vaccine quickly worldwide. The financing is backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments and also benefits from InnovFin Risk Sharing for Corporate Research backed by Horizon 2020.*\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.\n\nOnce vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nOverview of the Commission's Response\n\n*Updated on 12 November 2020 at 17:05.\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission approves contract with BioNTech-Pfizer alliance to ensure access to a potential vaccine"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2081\/IP_20_2081_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Working time and working time flexibility","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"August 2020","date":"7 August","title":"EU dispatches additional rescEU masks to Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia\u00a0","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_1464\">More batches of FFP2 and FFP3 protective masks<\/a> have been distributed to Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia from rescEU - the common European reserve of medical equipment set up this year to help countries affected by the coronavirus pandemic.<em> <\/em>At the same time, the EU continues to build up reserves of medical equipment.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_1464"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_1464"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_1464","detail_metadata":{"type":"Daily news","date":"7 August 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus response: EU dispatches additional rescEU masks to Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia\u00a0\n\nThis week, more batches of FFP2 and FFP3 protective masks are being distributed to Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia from rescEU - the common European reserve of medical equipment set up this year to help countries affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\u201dWe are delivering more masks from the\u00a0rescEU reserve of medical equipment\u00a0to\u00a0help the national authorities\u00a0in their response to COVID-19.

This will allow \u20ac197 million of new investments by the concession operator to go ahead, while limiting distortions of competition. The Istrian Y motorway is a 145 km long motorway linking the Istrian region with the rest of Croatia. The motorway is operated under a concession agreement from 1995, which was awarded to the company Bina-Istra until 2034. In June 2020, Croatia notified to the Commission a prolongation of the concession agreement until 2039. The prolongation will allow Bina-Istra to finance the construction of a second carriageway (one more lane in each direction) between Vranja Interchange and the U\u010dka tunnel\/Kvarner portal - an 8km stretch on the north-eastern side of the motorway. The aid takes the form of a prolongation of the concession. This will allow the \u20ac197 million investment, which will mainly be used to construct a new 5.63 km-long second tube to the U\u010dka tunnel, which is necessary to meet the minimum safety requirements, as well as several new viaducts, underpasses and overpasses. Bina-Istra will also renew the Kvarner rest area. \u00a0The Commission examined the measure under EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest (SGEI) and EU public procurement rules, notably the EU Directive on the award of concession contracts (Directive 2014\/23\/EU), according to which companies can be compensated for the extra cost of providing a public service on certain conditions. The Commission found that, under the Croatian plan to extend the Istrian Y motorway concession agreement, all compatibility conditions are fulfilled. The prolongation of the concession is proportionate to the amount needed to finance the required works and Bina-Istra is not overcompensated. The Commission concluded that the measure will promote growth and unlock investment, without unduly distorting competition and trade between Member States in line with EU State aid and public procurement rules. On this basis, the Commission approved under EU State aid rules the Croatian support through the prolongation of the Istrian Y motorway concession. The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.56832 in the State aid register on the Commission's competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. \u00a0(For more information: Arianna Podesta\u00a0\u2013 Tel.: +32 229 87024; Giulia Astuti \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 55344)\n\n\u00a0\n\nMergers: Commission clears acquisition of joint control over One Tap Buy by the Softbank Group and the Mizuho Financial Group\n\nThe European Commission has approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the acquisition of joint control over One Tap BUY Co., Ltd. (\u201cOTB\u201d) by SoftBank Corp. and Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. (\u201cMizuho\u201d), all three of Japan. OTB, which is currently solely controlled by SoftBank, provides a mobile trading brokerage application that allows investors residing in Japan to trade securities on the go. SoftBank is involved in advanced telecommunications, internet services, Internet of Things, robotics and clean energy technology providers. Mizuho offers financial and strategic services, including banking, securities, trust and asset management, credit card, private banking and venture capital. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns given that the JV has noactual or foreseen activities within the European Economic Area.

This authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States.\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cWe are providing more COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans. With the Moderna vaccine, the second one now authorised in the EU, we will have a further 160 million doses. And more vaccines will come. Europe has secured up to two billion doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines. We'll have more than enough safe and effective vaccines for protecting all Europeans.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cWe are all in this together and united. This is why we have negotiated the broadest vaccine portfolio in the world for all our Member States. Today we are authorising a second safe and effective vaccine from Moderna, which together with BioNTech-Pfizer, will ensure that 460 million doses will be rolled out with increasing speed in the EU, and more will come. Member States have to ensure that the pace of vaccinations follows suit. Our efforts will not stop until vaccines are available for everyone in the EU.\u201d\n\nModerna submitted on 30 November 2020 an application for marketing authorisation to EMA, which had already started a rolling review of the data in November. Thanks to this rolling review, EMA has been assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine as data has become available. EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has thoroughly assessed the data and recommended by consensus that a formal conditional marketing authorisation is granted. A conditional marketing authorisation is one of EU's regulatory mechanisms for facilitating early access to medicines that fulfil an unmet medical need, including in emergency situations such as the current pandemic.\n\nOn the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional market authorisation.\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in\u00a0biology, transferring instructions from DNA to the cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions produce harmless fragments of the virus, which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce a spike protein, a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences \u2014 antibodies and T cells \u2014 against it.\n\nNext steps*\n\nModerna, with whom the Commission signed a contract on 25 November, will deliver the total amount of 160 million doses between the first and the fourth quarters of 2021. It will add to the 300 million doses of the vaccine distributed by BioNTech\/Pfizer, the first vaccine to have been authorised in the EU on 21 December 2020. \n\nBackground\n\nA conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However, once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks.\n\nModerna submitted on 30 November 2020 an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA. EMA has already been assessing data on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality and results from laboratory studies and clinical trials in the context of a rolling review. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.\n\nThe European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries.

It will make provisions in the relevant EU legislation to allow companies to focus on gathering the necessary evidence in time and enable the authorisation of adapted vaccines with a smaller set of additional data submitted to the European Medicines Agency.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cThe HERA Incubator is to strengthen and accelerate the EU response to variants. We are enabling EMA to fast-track regulatory approval of updated vaccines to tackle new variants. Faster approval means more vaccines in circulation and more Europeans protected from the virus.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella\u00a0Kyriakides\u00a0said:\u00a0\u201cWe need to be prepared to adapt vaccines as quickly as possible to respond to new and potentially vaccine-resistant variants. Today we propose fast and flexible solutions to fast-track approvals, without compromising on safety and efficacy. With the HERA Incubator, our goal is to anticipate and be one step ahead.\u201d\n\nAdaptations to active substances of an authorised COVID-19 vaccine may be required to ensure the vaccine's effectiveness against mutations or variants of a virus. Building on the approach for adaptations of human influenza \u2013 flu \u2013 vaccines, the changes to the Variation Regulation specify which provisions apply to adaptations of the active substance of authorised COVID-19 vaccines. These changes will ensure the streamlined handling of any variation to an authorised vaccine and extend the coverage of the new provisions to all coronaviruses.\n\nThe amendment provides a regulatory framework for the handling of changes to the marketing authorisation after the initial marketing authorisation.\n\nNext Steps\n\nAs for any delegated regulation, the measure will now go to the European Parliament and Council for scrutiny before entering into force.\n\nBackground\n\nThe new European bio-defence preparedness plan against COVID-19 variants called \u201cHERA Incubator\u201d is working with researchers, biotech companies, manufacturers and public authorities in the EU and globally to detect new variants, provide incentives to develop new and adapted vaccines, speed up the approval process for these vaccines, and ensure scaling up of manufacturing capacities.\n\nSpeeding up the regulatory approval of adapted vaccines is one of the key actions of the HERA Incubator to boost preparedness, develop vaccines for the variants and increase industrial production.\n\nTaking action now is important as new variants continue to emerge and challenges with scaling up vaccine production are arising. The HERA Incubator will also serve as a blueprint for the EU's long-term preparedness for health emergencies.\n\nFor More Information \n\nCommission delegated regulation on the examination of variations to the terms of marketing authorisation for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products\n\nEuropean Medicines Agency guidance on regulatory requirements for vaccines intended to provide protection against variant strain(s) of SARS-CoV-2\n\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council: HERA Incubator: Anticipating together the threat of COVID-19 variants\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Coronavirus response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: new procedure to facilitate and speed up approval of adapted vaccines against COVID-19 variants"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_1088\/IP_21_1088_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/commission-delegated-regulation-examination-variations-terms-marketing-authorisation-medicinal-products-human-use-and-veterinary-medicinal-products_en","https:\/\/www.ema.europa.eu\/en\/regulatory-requirements-vaccines-intended-provide-protection-against-variant-strains-sars-cov-2","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/sites\/info\/files\/communication-hera-incubator-anticipating-threat-covid-19-variants_en.pdf","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/coronavirus-response\/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Working time and working time flexibility","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"October 2020","date":"27 October","title":"Commission disburses EUR 17 billion under SURE to Italy, Spain and Poland","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1990\">disbursed<\/a> a total of EUR 17 billion to Italy, Spain and Poland in the first instalment of financial support to Member States under the SURE instrument.

As part of today's operations, Italy has received \u20ac10 billion, Spain \u20ac6 billion, and Poland \u20ac1 billion. Once all SURE disbursements have been completed, Italy will receive a total of \u20ac27.4 billion, Spain \u20ac21.3 billion and Poland \u20ac11.2 billion.\n\nThis support, in the form of loans granted on favourable terms, will assist these Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, in particular for the self-employed.\n\nThe SURE instrument can provide up to \u20ac100 billion in financial support to all Member States. The Council has so far approved \u20ac87.9 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States, based on the Commission's proposals. The next disbursements will take place over the course of the months ahead, following the respective bond issuances.\n\nThe disbursements follow last week's inaugural social bond issuance by the Commission, marked by very strong investor interest, to finance the instrument.\n\nMembers of the College said: \n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThe first disbursements under the SURE instrument are important milestones in our push to preserve jobs and livelihoods. They clearly demonstrate Europe's solidarity with citizens in Spain, Italy and Poland affected by this unprecedented crisis. We remain committed to protecting people and jobs across Europe. SURE will play an important role in achieving this objective.\u201d\n\nJohannes Hahn, Commissioner in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cWith the Sure instrument we have managed to live up to our citizens' expectation regarding quick delivery of support in times of crisis.\u00a0 I am glad to see that citizens and enterprises in Spain, Italy, Poland will be the first to benefit. 17 Member States have already declared their interest in receiving support from SURE and we will follow-up on this still this year. This is solidarity in action.\u201d\n\nPaolo\u00a0Gentiloni,\u00a0Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cToday marks an important milestone for European solidarity as the first financing flows to our Member States: 17 billion euros to support workers in Italy, Spain and Poland. This is only the beginning. As Europe prepares to face a difficult winter, let's remember that last week's SURE Social Bonds issuance was more than a successful market operation - it was a huge vote of confidence in the European Union's recovery plan and in our common economic future.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nOn 21 October, the European Commission issued a \u20ac17 billion inaugural social bond under the SURE instrument. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac10 billion due for repayment in October 2030 and \u20ac7 billion due for repayment in 2040. There was very strong investor interest in this highly rated instrument, and the bonds were more than 13 times oversubscribed, resulting in favourable pricing terms. The terms on which the Commission borrows are passed on directly to the Member States receiving the loans.\n\nThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.\n\nFor more information\n\nSURE Regulation\n\nFactsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes SURE\n\nCoronavirus response\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\n","detail_title":["Commission disburses \u20ac17 billion under SURE to Italy, Spain and Poland "],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1990\/IP_20_1990_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Enda MCNAMARA","phone":"+32 2 296 49 76","email":"Enda.Mcnamara@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Flora MATTHAES","phone":"+32 2 298 39 51","email":"flora.matthaes@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Claire JOAWN","phone":"+32 2 295 68 59","email":"claire.joawn@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se LEREBOURS","phone":"+32 2 296 33 03","email":"therese.lerebours@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources","employment, social affairs, skills and labour mobility","economic affairs","budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"19 March","title":"Temporary framework to further support the economy","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_20_496\">adopted<\/a> a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/competition\/state_aid\/what_is_new\/sa_covid19_temporary-framework.pdf\">Temporary Framework<\/a> to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.<\/p> <p>By 31 March, the Commission already approved several schemes based on the Temporary Framework worth several hundred billions of euros to support Member States\u2019 economies face the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

Together with many other support measures that can be used by Member States under the existing State aid rules, the Temporary Framework enables Member States to ensure that sufficient liquidity remains available to businesses of all types and to preserve the continuity of economic activity during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nExecutive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is severe. We need to act fast to manage the impact as much as we can. And we need to act in a coordinated manner. This new Temporary Framework enables Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nThe State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, based on Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, recognises that the entire EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. To remedy that, the Temporary Framework provides for five types of aid:\n\n(i)\u00a0 Direct grants, selective tax advantages and advance payments: Member States will be able to set up schemes to grant up to \u20ac800,000 to a company to address its urgent liquidity needs.\n\n(ii)\u00a0 State guarantees for loans taken by companies from banks: Member States will be able to provide State guarantees to ensure banks keep providing loans to the customers who need them.\n\n(iii) Subsidised public loans to companies: Member States will be able to grant loans with favourable interest rates to companies. These loans can help businesses cover immediate working capital and investment needs.\n\n(iv) Safeguards for banks that channel State aid to the real economy: Some Member States plan to build on banks' existing lending capacities, and use them as a channel for support to businesses \u2013 in particular to small and medium-sized companies. The Framework makes clear that such aid is considered as direct aid to the banks' customers, not to the banks themselves, and gives guidance on how to ensure minimal distortion of competition between banks.\n\n(v) Short-term export credit insurance: The Framework introduces additional flexibility on how to demonstrate that certain countries are not-marketable risks, thereby enabling short-term export credit insurance to be provided by the State where needed.\n\nGiven the limited size of the EU budget, the main response will come from Member States' national budgets. The Temporary Framework will help target support to the economy, while limiting negative consequences to the level playing field in the Single Market.\n\nThe Temporary Framework therefore includes a number of safeguards. For example, It links the subsidised loans or guarantees to businesses to the scale of their economic activity, by reference to their wage bill, turnover, or liquidity needs, and to the use of the public support for working or investment capital. The aid should therefore help businesses to weather the downturn and to prepare a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe Temporary Framework complements the many other possibilities already available to Member States to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, in line with EU State aid rules. On 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak setting out these possibilities. For example, Member States can make generally applicable changes in favour of businesses (e.g. deferring taxes, or subsidising short-time work across all sectors), which fall outside State Aid rules. They can also grant compensation to companies for damage suffered due to and directly caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. This can be useful to support particularly impacted sectors, such as transport, tourism, hospitality and retail.\n\nThe Framework will be in place until the end of December 2020. With a view to ensuring legal certainty, the Commission will assess before that date if it needs to be extended.\n\nBackground\n\nState aid rules enable Member States to take swift and effective action to support citizens and companies, in particular SMEs, facing economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe Temporary Framework adopted today complements the ample possibilities for Member States to design measures in line with existing EU State aid rules, as set out in the Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak of 13 March 2020. In particular, they can adopt measures that fall outside the scope of State aid control, such as national funds granted to health services or other public services to tackle the Covid-19. Member States can also immediately act through public support measures that are available to all companies such as wage subsidies, suspension of payments of corporate and value added taxes or social contributions. In addition, Member States can grant financial support directly to consumers, for example for cancelled services or tickets that are not reimbursed by the operators concerned.\n\nIn addition, EU State aid rules enable Member States to help companies cope with liquidity shortages and needing urgent rescue aid. Article 107(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enables Member States to compensate companies for the damage directly caused by exceptional occurrences, such as those caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, including measures in sectors such as aviation and tourism.\n\nThe Commission had adopted a Temporary Framework in 2008, in response to the global financial crisis.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommunication from the Commission - Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n","detail_title":["State aid: Commission adopts Temporary Framework to enable Member States to further support the economy in the COVID-19 outbreak"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_496\/IP_20_496_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Arianna PODESTA","phone":"+32 2 298 70 24","email":"arianna.podesta@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Giulia ASTUTI","phone":"+32 2 295 53 44","email":"giulia.astuti@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["responsible for questions regarding Eurostat","competition","European statistics (ESTAT)"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/competition\/state_aid\/what_is_new\/sa_covid19_temporary-framework.pdf"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Regional funds"},{"month_name":"June 2020","date":"29 June","title":"Expanding Temporary Framework to further support micro, small and start-up companies and incentivise private investments","abstract":"<p>The Commission has <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1221\">adopted a\u00a0third amendment<\/a> to extend the scope of the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_496\">State aid Temporary Framework<\/a> adopted on 19 March 2020 that would<em> <\/em>enable Member States to further support micro, small and start-up companies<em>. <\/em>The main purpose of the Temporary Framework is to provide targeted support to otherwise viable companies that have entered into financial difficulty as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1221","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_496"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1221","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_496"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1221","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"29 June 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has adopted a\u00a0third amendment to extend the scope of the State aid Temporary Framework adopted on 19 March 2020 to support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. The Temporary Framework was first amended on 3 April 2020 to increase possibilities for public support to research, testing and production of products relevant to fight the coronavirus outbreak, to protect jobs and to further support the economy. On 8 May 2020, the Commission adopted a second amendment extending the scope of the Temporary Framework to recapitalisation and subordinated debt measures.\n\nExecutive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said \u201cMicro, small and start-up companies are crucial for the economic recovery of the Union. They have been particularly affected by the liquidity shortage caused by the coronavirus outbreak, and face greater difficulties to access financing. Today, we have extended the Temporary Framework to enable Member States to support these companies further. We have also introduced conditions that provide incentives for private investors to participate alongside the State in recapitalisations, thus reducing the need for State aid and the risk of distortions to competition. Finally, we recall that State aid shall not be granted on the condition of the relocation of production or of another activity of the beneficiary from elsewhere in our Union \u2013 because the Single Market is our greatest asset. We continue to work closely with Member States to help European businesses weather this crisis and bounce back strongly, whilst maintaining a level playing field to the benefit of all European consumers and businesses.\u201d\n\nSupport to support micro and small companies including start-ups\n\nThe main purpose of the Temporary Framework is to provide targeted support to otherwise viable companies that have entered into financial difficulty as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Therefore, companies that were already in difficulty before 31 December 2019 are not eligible for aid under the Temporary Framework, but may benefit from aid under existing State aid rules, in particular the Rescue and Restructuring Guidelines. These Guidelines set clear conditions according to which such companies must define sound restructuring plans that will allow them to achieve long-term viability.\n\nAt the same time, micro and small companies (i.e. undertakings with less than 50 employees and less than EUR 10 million of annual turnover and\/or annual balance sheet total)have been particularly affected by the liquidity shortage caused by the economic impact of the current coronavirus outbreak, exacerbating their existing difficulties to access financing compared to larger enterprises. If left unaddressed, these difficulties could lead to a large number of bankruptcies of micro and small companies, causing serious disturbances for the entire EU economy.\n\nToday's amendment extends the Temporary Framework to enable Member States to provide public support under the Temporary Framework to all micro and small companies, even if they were already in financial difficulty on 31 December 2019.\n\nThis will apply, unless such companies are in insolvency proceedings, have received rescue aid that has not been repaid, or are subject to a restructuring plan under State aid rules. Given their limited size and involvement in cross-border transactions, temporary State aid to micro and small companies is less likely to distort competition in the Internal Market than State aid to larger companies.\n\nThis amendment also effectively increases the possibilities to support start-up companies, the vast majority of which fall within the micro and small companies cluster, especially innovative ones which may be loss-making in their high-growth phase, which are crucial for the economic recovery of the Union.\n\nThe Commission recalls further that all small and medium-sized enterprises that were in existence for less than three years on 31\u00a0December 2019 could already benefit from the aid measures laid down in the Temporary Framework provided they are not in insolvency proceedings or have received rescue aid that has not been repaid or are subject to a restructuring plan under State aid rules.\n\nIncentives for private investors to participate in coronavirus-related recapitalisation aid measures\n\nThe Commission has also adapted the conditions for recapitalisation measures under the Temporary Framework for those cases where private investors contribute to the capital increase of companies together with the State.\n\nThese changes will encourage capital injections with significant private participation in companies, limiting the need for State aid and the risk of competition distortions. In particular, if the State decides to grant recapitalisation aid, but private investors contribute to the capital increase in a significant manner (in principle at least 30% of the new equity injected) at the same conditions as the State, the acquisition ban and the cap on the remuneration of the management are limited to three years. Furthermore, the dividend ban is lifted for the holders of the new shares as well as for existing shares, provided that the holders of those existing shares are altogether diluted to below 10% in the company.\n\nThis will increase the incentives for companies to seek market as well as State contributions to their capital needs, whilst maintaining safeguards to preserve effective competition in the Single Market.\n\nFurthermore, in line with the principle of neutrality towards public or private ownership of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, today's amendment will also enable companies with an existing State shareholding to raise capital from their shareholders similar to private companies. Where the conditions above as regards the participation of private investors in the capital increase are met and the State is an existing shareholder (i.e. was a shareholder already before the granting of recapitalisation aid) investing pro rata to its existing shareholding, the Commission does not consider it necessary to impose specific conditions as regards the State's exit.\n\nProtection of the Single Market and ensuring a level playing field \n\nWith the amendment, the Commission has clarified that aid should not be conditioned on the relocation of the production activity or of another activity of the beneficiary from another country within the European Economic Area (EEA) to the territory of the Member State granting the aid, since such a condition would be particularly harmful for the internal market.\n\nBackground\n\nOn 19 March 2020, the Commission adopted a new State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, based on Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Temporary Framework was amended on 3 April and 8 May 2020. The Temporary Framework recognises that the entire EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. It enables Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy, while limiting negative consequences to the level playing field in the Single Market.\n\nOn 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak setting out these possibilities. For example, Member States can make generally applicable changes in favour of businesses (e.g. deferring taxes, or subsidising short-time work across all sectors), which fall outside State Aid rules. They can also grant compensation to companies for damage suffered due to and directly caused by the coronavirus outbreak. This can be useful to support particularly impacted sectors, such as transport, tourism, hospitality and retail.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["State aid: Commission expands Temporary Framework to further support micro, small and start-up companies and incentivise private investments"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1221\/IP_20_1221_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Arianna PODESTA","phone":"+32 2 298 70 24","email":"arianna.podesta@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Giulia ASTUTI","phone":"+32 2 295 53 44","email":"giulia.astuti@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Maria TSONI","phone":"+32 2 299 05 26","email":"maria.tsoni@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["responsible for questions regarding Eurostat","competition","European statistics (ESTAT)"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"February 2021","date":"17 February","title":"Second contract with Moderna to ensure additional vaccine doses","abstract":"<p>The Commission approved a second contract with the pharmaceutical company <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_655\">Moderna<\/a>, which provides for an additional purchase of 300 million doses (150 million in 2021 and an option to purchase an additional 150 million in 2022) on behalf of all EU Member States.

The new contract also provides for the possibility to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nToday's contract with Moderna builds upon the broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the already signed contracts with BioNTech\/Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Curevac and Moderna. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe has access to 2.6 billion doses, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective.\n\nThe Commission has granted conditional marketing authorisation for the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer on 21 December 2020, Moderna on 6 January 2021 and AstraZeneca on 29 January 2021.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said:  \u201cToday, we are securing 300 million additional doses of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Moderna, which is already used for vaccination in the European Union. This brings us closer to our major objective: ensure that all Europeans have access to safe and effective vaccines as quickly as possible. With a portfolio of up to 2.6 billion doses, we will be able to provide vaccines not just to our citizens, but to our neighbours and partners as well.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cWith this new contract with Moderna, we are adding another 300 million doses of an authorised safe and effective vaccine. It marks another step towards our objective of providing swift access to safe and effective vaccinations to citizens in Europe and beyond over the course of this year. The contract is important not only for the short term needs of the EU, but also for our future work to limit the rapid spread of new variants.\u201d\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in\u00a0biology, transferring instructions from DNA to the cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions produce harmless fragments of the virus, which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce a spike protein, a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences \u2014 antibodies and T cells \u2014 against it.\n\nThe Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the companies' experience in vaccine development and their production capacity to supply the whole of the EU, as well as their capacity to potentially develop a vaccine against coronavirus variants.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.\n\nOnce vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission has adopted further actions to reinforce preparedness and response measures across the EU, a strategy on staying safe from COVID-19 during winter offering further support to Member States in the deployment of vaccines and a new Communication on a united front the beat COVID-19. The Commission has also adopted a plan to prepare Europe for the increased threat of variants and the possibility of them being resistant to existing vaccines.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\nMore Information\n\nSafe COVID-19 Vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nOverview of the Commission's Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission approves second contract with Moderna to ensure up to additional 300 million doses"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_655\/IP_21_655_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Vivian LOONELA","phone":"+32 2 296 67 12","email":"vivian.loonela@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["coordinating spokesperson for the European Green Deal","public health","regional policy","environment","structural reforms","maritime affairs and fisheries"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"8 April","title":"Commission calls on Member States to optimise supply and availability of medicines","abstract":"<p>The Commission's <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_622\">guidelines to Member States<\/a> focus on the rational supply, allocation and use of vital medicines to treat coronavirus patients as well as medicines which may be at risk of shortage.

The pandemic has highlighted significant challenges in ensuring the supply of the critical medicines needed and the impact such an outbreak can have on the supply chain of medicines in the EU. The Commission guidelines focus on the rational supply, allocation and use of vital medicines to treat coronavirus patients as well as medicines which may be at risk of shortage due to the pandemic. The proposed actions should allow for a more coordinated approach across the EU, preserving the integrity of the Single Market whilst protecting public health.\n\nCommissioner Stella Kyriakides, in charge of Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cThis unprecedented health crisis is putting our health care systems under enormous strain \u2013 with stocks of essential medicines in many European hospitals at risk of running low. We cannot afford to have shortages of life-saving medicines at such a critical moment. Today, we are presenting concrete actions to Member States to proactively prevent shortages and ensure that our hospitals have the essential medicines needed to save lives. I call on the solidarity and responsibility of the EU pharmaceutical industry to increase the production of medicines needed to treat seriously ill coronavirus patients.\u201d\n\nThe Commission guidelines on the optimal and rational use of medicines stress the need for national authorities to:\n\n\tShow solidarity through the lifting of export bans and restrictions, ensuring that essential medicines are available in hospitals and pharmacies and that national stockpiling is avoided. National authorities should also fight misinformation that could lead to unnecessary stockpiling due to panic buying.\n\tEnsure supply by increasing and reorganising production through the monitoring of stocks and production capacities, the coordination of joint efforts by industry and implementing demand support and procurement initiatives to encourage supply. Where Member States need to support industry increasing their manufacturing capacity through fiscal incentives and state aid and implement regulatory flexibility, the Commission stands ready to provide guidance and legal certainty.\n\tPromote the optimal use of medicines in hospitals, in particular by adapting existing hospital protocols or establishing new validated protocols to prevent the overuse of medicines, as well as providing the possibility to extend the expiry dates of medicines.\n\tOptimise sales in community pharmacies to avoid hoarding through the introduction of restrictions on sales for medicines at risk of shortages and temporarily considering the limitation of online sales of essential medicines.\n\n\nOver the past weeks, the Commission, with the support of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has been gathering data on current challenges with a view to monitor, assess and identify medicines at risk of shortages. This includes monitoring overall demand from Member States, as well as the impact of third country export bans.\n\nThe risk of shortages is due primarily to the increase in demand for medicines to treat coronavirus patients in hospitals. Stockpiling by citizens, an increased demand for experimental medicines for coronavirus, the introduction of protectionist measures within and outside the EU such as export bans and national stockpiling, as well as transportation barriers between countries, also play a role.\n\nAdditionally, Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager in charge of competition policy, is putting forward a temporary framework explaining when and how firms can obtain guidance or written comfort that cooperation to avoid shortages of essential scarce products and services is in line with competition rules.\n\nUseful links\n\nDedicated Commission webpage on the EU's response to the COVID-19 outbreak\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission calls on Member States to optimise supply and availability of medicines"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_622\/IP_20_622_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"May 2020","date":"8 May","title":"Commission invites Member States to extend restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 June","abstract":"<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_823\">Commission invited<\/a> Schengen Member States and Schengen Associated States to extend the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for another 30 days, until 15 June.

While some EU and Schengen Associated States are taking preliminary steps towards easing the measures for fighting the spread of the pandemic, the situation remains fragile both in Europe and worldwide. This calls for continued measures at the external borders to reduce the risk of the disease spreading through travel to the EU. The lifting of travel restrictions should be phased: as underlined in the Joint European Roadmap on lifting containment measures, internal border controls will need to start being lifted gradually and in a coordinated manner before restrictions at the external borders can be relaxed in a second stage.\n\nVice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \u201cThe overall objective of limiting the spread of coronavirus via reduced social interaction remains. Despite progress in many European countries, the situation worldwide is very fragile. It is imperative that any action taken is gradual, with different measures being lifted in different phases.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson underlined: \u201cWe need a phased and coordinated approach. Restoring the normal functioning of the Schengen area of free movement is our first objective as soon as the health situation allows it. Restrictions on free movement and internal border controls will need to be lifted gradually before we can remove restrictions at the external borders and guarantee access to the EU for non-EU residents for non-essential travel.\u201d\n\nThe travel restriction, as well as the invitation to extend it, applies to the \u2018EU+ area', which includes all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) \u2013 30 countries in total. The Commission calls for a continued coordinated approach to the prolongation, as action at the external borders can only be effective if implemented by all EU and Schengen States at all borders, with the same end date and in a uniform manner.\n\nThe Commission will continue to assist Member States in implementing the restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, including through regular videoconference meetings with Home Affairs Ministers. Any further prolongation of the travel restriction beyond 15 June 2020 would need to be assessed again, based on the evolution of the epidemiological situation.\n\nBackground \n\nThe Commission invited Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days. On 8 April, the Commission called for prolonging the travel restriction until 15 May. All EU Member States (except Ireland) and non-EU Schengen countries have since taken national decisions to implement and prolong this travel restriction.\n\nTo assist Member States, the Commission presented on 30 March 2020 guidance on how to implement the temporary travel restriction, facilitate repatriations from across the world, and deal with those compelled to stay in the EU longer than they are authorised to as a result of travel restrictions.\n\nThe travel restriction does not apply to EU citizens, citizens of non-EU Schengen countries and their family members, and non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in the EU for the purpose of returning home. In addition, to limit to the minimum the impact of the restriction on the functioning of our societies, Member States should not apply the restrictions to specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need. Essential staff, such as doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, researchers and experts helping to cope with the coronavirus, as well as persons carrying goods, frontier workers and seasonal agricultural workers, should also continue to be allowed to enter the EU.\n\nFor More Information \n\nCommunication on the second assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 8 May 2020\n\nQ&A for people travelling to and from the EU during the pandemic\n\nCommunication on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 16 March 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission invites Member States to prolong restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 May, 8 April 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission presents practical guidance on implementing the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 30 March 2020\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission invites Member States to extend restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 June"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_823\/IP_20_823_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Adalbert JAHNZ","phone":"+ 32 2 295 31 56","email":"adalbert.jahnz@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Laura BERARD","phone":"+32 2 295 57 21","email":"laura.berard@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Ciara BOTTOMLEY","phone":"+32 2 296 99 71 ","email":"ciara.bottomley@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["security union","migration, home affairs and citizenship"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/communication-restriction-non-essential-travel-eu_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response\/travel-and-transportation-during-coronavirus-pandemic\/travel-and-eu-during-pandemic_en","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=COM:2020:115:FIN","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_20_616","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_543"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"June 2020","date":"10 June","title":"EUR 55 million for Syrian refugees and local communities in Jordan and Lebanon","abstract":"<p>As part of the EU's global response to the coronavirus outbreak, the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis has mobilised an <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1013\">additional EUR 55 million<\/a> for refugees from Syria and vulnerable persons in Jordan and Lebanon to fight the pandemic.

The newly adopted package brings the total assistance mobilised through the EU Trust Fund to over \u20ac2.2 billion since 2015, doubling the target originally set.\n\nHigh Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\/Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell, said: \u201cJordan and Lebanon are showing huge resilience and solidarity in hosting Syrian refugees. It is our duty to continue supporting them, especially in the current coronavirus pandemic situation. The EU will host the fourth Brussels Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region on 30 June in direct support of the UN efforts for a comprehensive political solution to the Syrian conflict and to mobilise necessary financial support for Syria and neighbouring countries. The Conference will also continue to provide a unique platform for dialogue with civil society organisations from the region.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, commented: \u201cOur continued commitment to support Syrian refugees and partner countries like Jordan and Lebanon hosting them remains unwavering. We are responding today to the urgent needs in fighting the COVID-19 crisis with a substantial and targeted assistance package. Despite the European Union's continued strong solidarity with partner countries, the needs of the Syrian refugees continue to be important and cannot be neglected. In this regard, the 2020 Brussels IV Conference will provide an opportunity for the international community to mobilise the necessary financial assistance.\u201d\n\nJordan and Lebanon are the countries hosting the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. Today's additional support package focuses on health and water, sanitation and hygiene services:\n\nJordan - \u20ac20.1 million in total:\n\n\t\u20ac11 million to contribute to the coronavirus national response plan, in particular for procurement of medical equipment\n\t\u20ac4 million to support essential water and sanitation services and hygiene kits in refugee camps and for vulnerable host communities\n\t\u20ac3.6 million to strengthen ongoing health and social protection to Palestine Refugees from Syria and hosting communities\n\t\u20ac1.5 million to support further equipping three emergency departments in hospitals to face the pandemic\n\n\nLebanon - \u20ac34.6 million in total:\n\n\t\u20ac10 million to ensure safe municipal water distribution for Syrian refugees and host population\n\t\u20ac10 million to cover the medical management of mild cases in light of the pandemic\n\t\u20ac6 million to provide critical hygiene kits, as well as infection prevention and control kits in informal settlements and for vulnerable Lebanese\n\t\u20ac5 million to the Lebanese Red Cross as the front line responder to the coronavirus\n\t\u20ac3.6 million to strengthen ongoing health and social protection support for Palestine Refugees from Syria and hosting communities\n\n\nThe assistance package was adopted by the Operational Board of the Trust Fund, which brings together the European Commission, the EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. Observers of the Operational Board include Members of the European Parliament, representatives from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the World Bank, and the Syria Recovery Trust Fund.\n\nThe Trust Fund is also reorienting ongoing interventions in key sectors in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Since the beginning of the outbreak and thanks to the Trust Fund's flexibility, the EU and contributing countries have been able to provide personal protective equipment, hygiene kits, infection prevention trainings, health education and awareness campaigns, and essential protection services to women facing gender based violence.\n\nBackground\n\nSince its establishment in December 2014, a significant share of the EU's support to help Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis. The Trust Fund reinforces an integrated EU response to the crisis and primarily addresses longer-term resilience and needs to enhance the self-reliance of Syrian refugees. At the same time, it contributes to ease the pressure on host communities and the administrations in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The Trust Fund has also underpinned the EU Compacts agreed with Jordan and Lebanon to better assist them in coping with the protracted refugee crisis. With the newly adopted package, it has mobilised over \u20ac900 million for Lebanon, over \u20ac500 million for both Jordan and Turkey and more than \u20ac160 million for Iraq. Overall, more than \u20ac2.2 billion have been mobilised from the EU budget and contributions from 21 EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.\n\nThe Trust Fund's programmes support basic education and child protection services for refugees, training and higher education, better access to healthcare, improved access to water and wastewater infrastructure, support to resilience, women empowerment and fighting gender based violence, as well as economic opportunities and social stability. The Fund can also support internally displaced persons in Iraq and actions in the Western Balkans.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis\n\nFactsheet: EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis\n\n","detail_title":["EU adopts \u20ac55 million support package for Syrian refugees and local communities in Jordan and Lebanon to mitigate coronavirus pandemic"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1013\/IP_20_1013_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Peter STANO","phone":"+32 2 295 45 53","email":"peter.stano@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Zo\u00ef MULETIER","phone":"+32 2 299 43 06","email":"Zoi.MULETIER@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Lauranne DEVILLE","phone":"+32 2 298 08 33","email":"lauranne.deville@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","Neighbourhood and Enlargement"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/trustfund-syria-region\/content\/home_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/trustfund-syria-region\/sites\/tfsr\/files\/eutf-syria-factsheet-eng.pdf"],"businesses":1,"citizens":1,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"December 2020","date":"17 December","title":"Exploratory talks concluded with Novavax to secure a new potential vaccine","abstract":"<p>The Commission concluded <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2305\">exploratory talks<\/a> with the pharmaceutical company Novavax with a view to purchasing its potential vaccine against COVID-19.

The envisaged contract with Valneva would provide for the possibility for all EU Member States to purchase together 30 million doses, and they could further purchase up to 30 million more doses.\n\nToday's finalisation of exploratory talks with Valneva come in addition to an already secured broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the contracts already signed with AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, BioNtech-Pfizer, CureVac, and Moderna and exploratory talks concluded with Novavax. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective, as is already the case for BioNTech\/Pfizer and Moderna, recently authorised in the EU. Member States are able to donate vaccines to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \"The continuing COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and around the globe makes it more important than ever that all Member States have access to the broadest possible portfolio of vaccines to help protect people in Europe and beyond. Today's step toward reaching an agreement with Valneva further complements the EU's vaccines portfolio and demonstrates the Commission's commitment to find a lasting solution to the pandemic.\"\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"With this eighth vaccine, we are adding to our already broad and diversified range of vaccines in our portfolio. By doing this, we can maximise our chances of making sure that all citizens can have access to safe and effective of vaccinations by the end of 2021. All Member States have now started their vaccination campaigns and will start receiving an increasing number of doses in order to cover all their needs during this year.\"\n\nValneva is a European biotechnology company developing an inactivated virus vaccine. This is a traditional vaccine technology, used for 60-70 years, with established methods and a high level of safety. Most of the influenza vaccines and many childhood vaccines use this technology. This is currently the only inactivated vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe.\n\nThe Commission, with the support of EU Member States, has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply all EU Member States.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.\n\nOnce vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe.

Today, the Council gave its fast approval, so that the \u20ac2.7 billion instrumentcan immediately begin providing direct support where most needed. The instrument will be used together with other EU tools, for example the rescEU medical stockpile, which is in parallel being increased by \u20ac300 million in addition to the initially proposed allocation of \u20ac80 million. Commissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of the budget, said: \u201cThe EU budget has always been the EU's main solidarity tool to address crisis situations and swiftly assist those in need in Europe and beyond. Today, we are mobilising it again to the full support of those at the frontline\u2013 doctors, nurses, the sick and their families. This contribution will also be instrumental in tracking the disease in solidarity, making more testing available and supporting relevant medical research.\u201d\u00a0At a first stage, the Emergency Support Instrument for the healthcare sector will help fund urgent medical supply needs, such as masks and respirators, the transportation of medical equipment and patients in cross-border regions, the recruitment of additional healthcare workforce that can be deployed to hotspots across the Union, as well as the construction of mobile field hospitals. The Emergency Support Instrument enables the Commission to directly procure on behalf of Member States and focus the help where it is needed most; prioritisation and mobilisation will be done in close co-ordination with Member States. An internal Task Force has been set up to manage this initiative. In the medium- to long-term, ESI will enable the EU to support Member State mass testing efforts and any relevant medical research. In this way, the Commission will be providing a coordinated EU response throughout the crisis, from the current stage until the moment of exit and recovery.\u00a0For all the budgetary means to be available, the Commission would also need the green light of the European Parliament.

The amendment schemes were approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as\u00a0amended on 3 April 2020. Germany notified to the Commission amendments regarding the scheme to support companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak \u201cBundesregelung Kleinbeihilfen 2020\u201d, approved by the Commission on 24 March 2020, and the scheme for subsidies loans \u201cBundesregelung Darlehen 2020\u201d, approved by the Commission on 2 April 2020. The amendments concern modifications of the schemes in light of the amendments to the Temporary Frameworkapproved by the Commission on 3 April 2020. The \u201cBundesregelung Kleinbeihilfen 2020\u201d scheme to support companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak provided for aid to be granted via direct grants, repayable advances and tax or payment advantages. The amendment approved allows also for aid in the form of loans, guarantees and equity. In particular, under the amended Temporary Framework, guarantees can cover 100% of the risk of loans with a nominal amount of up to \u20ac800,000. Loans can be granted directly to the companies or via credit institutions and other financial institutions acting as financial intermediaries. The scheme enabling granting of loans at favourable terms \u201cBundesregelung Darlehen 2020\u201d is now amended in order to allow for subsidised interest rates for loans provided to beneficiaries either directly by a granting authority together with private banks in a consortium, or indirectly in the form of risk-sub-participations for investment and working capital needs of the beneficiaries. The Commission found that the amendments notified by Germany are in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework, as amended on 3 April 2020. The Commission concluded that the measures are necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of Germany, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. The support, which will take the form of State guarantees on loans, will be accessible to all airlines which hold a Swedish commercial aviation licence at least as of 1 January 2020, except those operating non-scheduled passenger air transport services as their main activity. The Swedish authorities estimate that approximately 20 airlines will be eligible for loan guarantees under the scheme. This includes carriers operating scheduled passenger air transport services, as well as smaller airlines operating ambulance flights and helicopter companies performing inspection services. The scheme aims at limiting the risks associated with issuing loans to those airlines which are most severely affected by the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. This will ensure that those airlines have sufficient liquidity, hence ensuring the continuation of\u00a0 their activities during and after the current crisis.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. The scheme is open to small, medium-sized and large enterprises of all sectors. Aid will be granted in the form of direct grants to enhance and accelerate research and the production of products directly relevant to coronavirus. These include medicinal products including vaccines, hospital and medical equipment including ventilators, protective clothing and equipment as well as diagnostic tools. In particular (i) the R&D part of the scheme covers fundamental research, industrial research and experimental development projects; (ii) the investment part of the scheme will cover 80% of the eligible costs that companies have to bear to create production capacities to manufacture coronavirus relevant products. The Commission found that the Luxembourg scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. To support quick action, companies may also benefit from a bonus when their investment is concluded within two months after the granting of the aid. The Commission therefore concluded that the aid scheme will contribute to the achievement of a common objective of crucial importance, is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to fight the health crisis in line with Article 107(3)(c) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules.

The Temporary Framework was first amended on 3 April 2020, which increased possibilities for public support to research, testing and production of products relevant to fight the coronavirus outbreak, to protect jobs and to further support the economy. In total, the Commission has adopted 43 decisions approving 53 national measures in relation to the coronavirus outbreak. The Commission is now proposing to extend further the scope of the Temporary Framework by enabling Member States to provide recapitalisations to companies in need. The Commission is consulting Member States on the possibility of providing public support in the form of equity or hybrid capital instruments to these severely affected companies, provided that it is the most appropriate means of support and subject to clear conditions. The proposed broadening of the scope of the Temporary Framework to aid in the form of recapitalisations complements the possibility of Member States to purchase existing shares of companies at market price or pari passu with private shareholders, which in principle falls outside the scope of EU State aid control. This can in particular be important for interventions by Member States to prevent hostile takeovers of strategic companies by foreign purchasers. It therefore complements the tools available to Member States as set out in the Commission's guidelines to ensure a strong EU-wide approach to foreign investment screening in a time of public health crisis and related economic vulnerability. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cOur shared priority faced with the coronavirus crisis is protecting the health of all European citizens. At the same time, the emergency measures are putting a strain on many companies that face a reduction in equity, with negative consequences on their ability to finance their activities. Following the amendment of last week, we will further extend the State aid Temporary Framework to enable Member States to recapitalise companies when necessary and appropriate. We will make sure that taxpayers are sufficiently remunerated for their investment, and companies that receive capital support are subject to controls and governance provisions that limit possible distortions to competition in the Single Market. We continue working with Member States to make sure that the European economy can weather this storm, and bounce back even stronger.\u201d The full Statement is available online.

The measure allows aid to be granted by COFAG (COVID-19 Finanzierungsagentur des Bundes GmbH).COFAG is a special purpose vehicle to grant liquidity assistance measures. The measure is targeted at all undertakings and applies to the whole territory of Austria.

Trade credit insurance protects companies supplying goods and services against the risk of non-payment by their clients. Given the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the risk of insurers not being willing to maintain their insurance coverage has become higher. The German scheme ensures that trade credit insurance continues to be available to all companies, avoiding the need for buyers of goods or services to pay in advance, therefore reducing their immediate liquidity needs. The Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, and in particular Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which enables the Commission to approve State aid measures implemented by Member States to remedy a serious disturbance in their economy. The Commission found that the scheme notified by Germany is compatible with the principles set out in the EU Treaty and is well targeted to remedy a serious disturbance of the German economy. The Commission therefore concluded that the measure will contribute to managing the economic impact of the coronavirus in Germany and beyond. It is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the general principles set out in the Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. The total budget of the measure communicated by the Italian authorities is of up to \u20ac200 billion. Italy notified to the Commission under the Temporary Framework a guarantee scheme for new working capital and investment loans granted by banks, to support companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The aid will be granted by State-owned SACE, through financial institutions, to companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The aim of the scheme is to limit the risks associated with issuing loans to companies that are severely affected by the economic impact of the coronavirus, helping businesses to cover their immediate working capital or investment needs, in order to ensure the continuation of their activities. The Commission found that the measure is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission concluded that the measure is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u00a0\u201cThe Italian guarantee scheme\u00a0with a budget of up to 200 billion euro\u00a0will enable public guarantees on new loans and on refinancing of existing loansfor all businesses, including large companies. Together with the other Italian scheme to support self-employed workers, SMEs and mid-caps affected in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, the scheme will help companies cover their immediate working capital and investment needs in these difficult times. We continue working closely with Member States to ensure that national support measures can help mitigate the effects of the coronavirus outbreak\u201d The full press release is available online.

Under the scheme, support will be granted by the State-owned \"Guarantee Fund for SMEs\", through financial institutions, in the form of State guarantees on investment and working capital loans, and in the form of direct grants waiving the applicable fee on the guarantees awarded. The scheme will be open to self-employed workers and companies with up to 499 employees affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The aim of the scheme is to help businesses to cover their immediate working capital and investment needs, thus ensuring the continuation of their activities. The Commission found that the measure is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission concluded that the measure is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the Italian economy, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThis scheme will enable Italy to support self-employed workers, SMEs and mid-caps affected by the coronavirus outbreak through the provision of State guarantees. Together with the other Italian scheme to support the Italian economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, which is tailored to larger companies, this scheme will help smaller businesses to cover their immediate investment and working capital needs, thus ensuring that they can continue their activities during and after the outbreak. Putting in place the necessary national support measures in a timely, coordinated and effective way, in line with EU rules, is of paramount importance in these challenging times.\u201d The full press release is available online.

After a successful pilot phase, the system goes live today with the first wave of national apps now linked through this service: Germany's Corona-Warn-App, Ireland's COVID tracker, and Italy's immuni. Together, these apps have been downloaded by around 30 million people, which corresponds to two-thirds of all app downloads in the EU.\n\nThierry Breton, Commissioner for Single Market, said: \u201cMany Member States have launched voluntary contact tracing and warning apps, and the Commission has supported them in make these apps safely interact with each other. Free movement is an integral part of the Single Market \u2013 the gateway is facilitating this while helping save lives.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, added: \u201cCoronavirus tracing and warning apps can effectively complement other measures like increased testing and manual contact tracing. With cases on the rise again, they can play an important role to help us break the transmission chains. When working across borders these apps are even more powerful tools. Our gateway system going live today is an important step in our work, and I would call on citizens to make use of such apps, to help protecting each other.\u201d\n\nJens Spahn, Germany's Federal Minister of Health, said: \u201cEverywhere in Europe, infections are on the rise again. Right now, national warning apps are making a real difference. Because every infection chain that, thanks to an app, is broken more quickly helps to contain the pandemic. With the new gateway service, we are connecting apps across Europe. Like this, contacts can also be warned during or following a trip abroad.\u201d\n\nIn the fight against coronavirus, most Member States have decided to launch a contact tracing and warning app. In total, 20 apps which are based on decentralised systems can be interoperable through the gateway service. They can be linked to the gateway after following a protocol that foresees several tests and checks, and an update has to be issued for each app. The second group of apps will be linked next week. Then, Czechia's eRou\u0161ka, Denmark's smitte stop, Latvia's Apturi COVID and Spain's Radar Covid are expected to join, while further apps will be linked to the system in November. The overview of participating Member States is available on a dedicated webpage.\n\nThe gateway ensures that apps work seamlessly cross-borders. Thus, users will only need to install one app and when they travel to another participating European country they will still benefit from contact tracing and receiving alerts, be it in their home country or abroad. The gateway server keeps the amount of data exchanged to a minimum. It will efficiently receive and pass on arbitrary identifiers between national apps. No other information than arbitrary keys, generated by the apps, will be handled by the gateway: the information is pseudonymised, encrypted, kept to the minimium, and only stored as long as necessary to trace back infections. It does not allow the identification of individual persons, nor to track location or movement of devices.\n\nThe setup of the gateway follows the agreement by Member States on technical specifications to ensure a safe exchange of information between the backend servers of national contact tracing and warning apps based on a decentralised architecture. The system was developed and set up in less than two months by T-Systems and SAP, and will be operated from the Commission's data centre in Luxembourg.\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nContact tracing apps, if fully compliant with EU rules and well-coordinated, can play a key role in all phases of crisis management. They can complement existing manual contact tracing and help interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Thereby, they can contribute to saving lives.\n\nSince the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Member States, backed by the Commission, have been assessing the effectiveness, security, privacy, and data protection aspects of digital solutions to address the crisis. They have developed an\u00a0EU toolbox\u00a0for contact tracing and warning apps, which was accompanied by guidance on data protection. This was part of a common coordinated approach to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures, as\u00a0set out in a Commission Recommendation. To ensure tracing and warning apps work cross-border, Member States, with the support of the Commission agreed on interoperability guidelines in May, on a set of technical specifications in June, and the Commission adopted an Implementing Decision to provide a legal basis for the gateway service. In September, the system was tested in a pilot phase.\n\nFor more information\n\nCoronavirus: EU interoperability gateway for contact tracing and warning apps \u2013 Questions and Answers\n\nDedicated webpage on the EU interoperability gateway service\n\nVideo clip\n\nFactsheet\n\nInfographic\n\neHealth Network documents\n\nGuidance to ensure full data protection standards of apps fighting the pandemic\n\nECDC guidance on mobile applications in support of contact tracing for COVID-19\n\nCommission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: EU interoperability gateway goes live, first contact tracing and warning apps linked to the system"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1904\/IP_20_1904_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Johannes BAHRKE","phone":"+32 2 295 86 15","email":"johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Charles MANOURY","phone":"+32 2 291 33 91","email":"charles.manoury@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["digital economy","research and innovation"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"January 2020","date":"28 January","title":"EU\u00a0civil protection mechanism activated for the repatriation of EU\u00a0citizens","abstract":"<p>As the outbreak of the novel coronavirus intensifies, the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_20_142\">EU Civil Protection Mechanism has been activated<\/a> following a request for assistance from France to provide consular support to EU citizens in Wuhan, China.<\/p> <p>The first European case was reported from France on <strong>24 January 2020<\/strong>.<\/p> <p><strong>17 January:<\/strong> The Health Security Committee held their <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/health\/coronavirus\/hsc_en\">first meeting<\/a> on the novel coronavirus.<\/p> <p><strong>9 January:<\/strong>\u00a0Directorate General for Health and Safety (DG SANTE) opened an alert notification on the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) where most Member States have since been sharing information on response and communication measures.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_20_142"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_20_142","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/health\/coronavirus\/hsc_en"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_20_142","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"28 January 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus intensifies, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has been activated following a request for assistance from France to provide consular support to EU citizens in Wuhan, China.\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management, said: \u201cThe EU does not forget its citizens in need, wherever they are in the world.

The first aircraft is scheduled to depart from France tomorrow morning, while the second one will leave later in the week. EU citizens present in the region and who wish to be repatriated can still request it, no matter their nationality.\n\nInitial numbers indicate that around 250 French citizens will be transported in the first aircraft and over 100 EU citizens from other countries will join the second aircraft. This is a first request for assistance and others may follow in the coming days.\n\nAt this stage, only healthy or asymptomatic citizens will be authorised to travel. The EU Emergency Response Centre is in constant contact with Member States' governments in order to coordinate the arrivals and subsequent possible quarantine periods.\u00a0\n\nThe European Commission is in regular contact with Member States, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organisation on all aspects of the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBackground \n\nThe EU Civil Protection Mechanism strengthens cooperation between Member States\/Participating States in the field of civil protection, with a view to improving prevention, preparedness and response to disasters. Through the Mechanism, the European Commission plays a key role in coordinating the response to disasters in Europe and beyond.\n\nWhen the scale of an emergency overwhelms the response capabilities of a country, it can request assistance via the Mechanism. Once activated, the Mechanism coordinates assistance made available by its Member States\/Participating States through spontaneous offers. In addition, the EU has created the European Civil Protection Pool to have a critical number of readily available civil protection capacities allowing for a stronger and coherent collective response.\n\nTo date, all EU Member States participate in the Mechanism, as well as Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Turkey. Since its inception in 2001, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has responded to more than 300 requests for assistance inside and outside the EU.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU Civil Protection Mechanism\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: EU Civil Protection Mechanism activated for the repatriation of EU citizens"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_142\/IP_20_142_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","transport","public health","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/echo\/what\/civil-protection\/mechanism_en"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"March 2021","date":"17 March","title":"Commission proposes a Digital Green Certificate","abstract":"<p>The Commission proposed to create a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/coronavirus-response\/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans\/covid-19-digital-green-certificates_en\">Digital Green Certificate<\/a> to facilitate safe free movement inside the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic.

And I want to thank the medical staff who is treating them and doing an outstanding job not only in Europe but all over the world.\n\nAs you know, the Coronavirus has brought governments and health systems throughout Europe to work at all different levels to contain this virus. And so does the Commission, with the support from our agency, the ECDC, and in very close cooperation with the WHO.\n\nYou have witnessed that from the very beginning of the outbreak of the Coronavirus, the European Union has acted. We have for example activated our alert system immediately. We have an ongoing risk assessment that is being carried out in close coordination with all the Member States.\n\nI think very important is our European Health Security Committee that is coordinating all these different national measures, so that we have a very comprehensive approach to contain the virus.\n\nWe have informed you on a regular basis over the last weeks about the support that the Commission provides to the national authorities, in very close cooperation with the agencies.\n\nECDC has announced today that the risk level has risen to moderate to high for people in the European Union. In other words, the virus continues to spread.\n\nWe all know that there are many, many different actions that are needed to address the Coronavirus. They are very multifaceted, they are very manifold. And since eight weeks, we are working intensively on these different work strands. The Commission has been addressing all these work strands.\n\nWe have a situation that is very complex and it requires on the one side, very swift action and on the other side, a strong coordination at all the levels and all the different sectors \u2013 not only on the European level but of course on the national level. And then, a very comprehensive and coherent approach towards the topic from all 27 Member States and the European Union.\n\nThis is why today we are launching the corona response team. This corona response team brings together all the different strands of action that have been in place since many, many weeks \u2013 you have witnessed their outstanding work \u2013, but also brings in place in the corona response team the new work streams, the emerging work streams.\n\nThe corona response team has basically three main pillars. The first pillar is the medical field. It includes topics from prevention and procurement. There are relief measures, information and foresight. It is always in close cooperation with ECDC and our European Medicines Agency. The second big and important column is the pillar that covers mobility, from transport to travel advice and also to the Schengen-related questions. The third pillar covers the economy. It is looking in-depth at various business sectors \u2013 such as tourism or transport, trade, but of course, it is also looking at the value chains and at the broader macro-economic picture we have.\n\nTo bundle this, we also have in parallel launched today a website on the corona response team where all the information we have gathered over all the weeks \u2013 and that comes on a daily basis \u2013 is collected and bundled so that there is a direct access to the very complex, wide-reaching work the corona response team is doing. There are other topics that are presented on the website and worked on in the corona response team, as for example news, press releases, calendars, social media, statistics, which are important on a daily basis from all the different questions that occur in this scenario, [as well as] the general information, like access to studies or links to others, the role and responsibilities, again, if you have different questions that have to be addressed.\n\nAllow me now to introduce the five Commissioners, who will be working together on all these different topics. It is Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, who is in charge of crisis management. It is Stella Kyriakides, who is charge of all the health issues. It is Ylva Johansson, who in charge of border-related issues.

The deal will also allow the company to expand its manufacturing capacity\u00a0in order to supply the vaccine fast worldwide in response to the pandemic. This will be done at the company's own risk while the clinical studies are ongoing. BioNTech became the first European company to enter clinical testing, having started a clinical trial in Germany in April and a further clinical trial in the United States at the beginning of May. BioNTech's development programme for BNT162 is one of the broadest development programmes globally, with four vaccine candidates being tested in parallel.\n\nmRNA vaccines consist of genetic material, called messenger RNA, that provides instructions for a human cell to make a target protein, or immunogen, which activates the body's immune response against the respective virus. The goal of a vaccine is to stimulate the immune system to generate protective, long-lasting antibody and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and prevent subsequent infection upon exposure to the virus. mRNA vaccines are a potent new developmental class of vaccines with potential for high versatility and favourable safety properties. BioNTech was able to bring the first vaccine candidates from concept into clinical testing in less than three months. Safety, speed and flexibility are of the utmost importance in reacting to the current pandemic.\n\nThe EIB debt investment will be disbursed in two tranches of \u20ac50\u00a0million each, following completion of pre-defined milestones. It is backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments, the financial heart of the Investment Plan for Europe, in which the EIB and the European Commission partner to kick-off investment for EU priority projects. It also benefits from InnovFin Risk Sharing for Corporate Research backed by Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cAs part of our efforts to counter the spread of the coronavirus, we have embarked decisively on the worldwide race to find an effective and safe vaccine as quickly as possible. For this purpose we recently launched the Coronavirus Global Response initiative, while at the same time we mobilised significant funding through Horizon 2020 for research projects aimed at developing a prophylactic and a therapeutic vaccine. I am very pleased that today, together with the European Investment Bank, we are extending our support to BioNTech, which is yet another concrete step towards our goal of getting a vaccine and ensuring access to it for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only way to end the dramatic situation the world has been facing since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic is to come up with a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d said Ambroise Fayolle, EIB Vice-President in charge of innovation. \u201cIn recent years the EIB has become a unique player in supporting highly innovative venture-stage biotech and medtech companies in their research and development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics solutions, and we are doing everything we can to step up our support in the current crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe investments we have made to develop our vaccine platform over the past 12 years have been instrumental in enabling us to develop our COVID-19 vaccine programme rapidly in response to the global health crisis,\u201d said Sierk Poetting, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer of BioNTech. \u201cThis funding commitment by the EIB will further support the next stage of our COVID-19 scale-up activities as we expand our production capacity to enable global supply.\u201d\n\nBioNTech already entered into a \u20ac50 million venture debt agreement under the European Growth Finance Facility for its personalised cancer immunotherapy programme in December 2019. The financing was part of broader EIB activities in the life sciences sector. Some 50 European companies in the life sciences industry have received a total of \u20ac1.3\u00a0billion, backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments, over the last four years.\n\nBackground information\n\nAbout the European Investment Bank\n\nThe European Investment Bank is the long-term lending institution of the European Union owned by its Member States. It makes long-term finance available for sound investments in order to contribute towards EU policy goals. The EIB also supports investments outside the EU.\n\nAbout BioNTech \n\nBiopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) is a next generation immunotherapy company pioneering novel therapies for cancer and other serious diseases. The company exploits a wide array of computational discovery and therapeutic drug platforms for the rapid development of novel biopharmaceuticals. Based on its deep expertise in mRNA vaccine development and in-house manufacturing capabilities, BioNTech and its collaborators are developing multiple mRNA vaccine candidates for a range of infectious diseases alongside its diverse oncology pipeline.\n\nAbout the Investment Plan for Europe\n\nThe Investment Plan for Europeis one of the EU's key actions to boost investment in Europe, thereby creating jobs and fostering growth. To this end, smarter use is made of new and existing financial resources. The EIB Group is playing a vital role in this investment plan. With guarantees from the European Fund for Strategic Investments, the EIB and the European Investment Fund are able to take on a higher share of project risk, encouraging private investors to participate in the projects. To date, the projects and agreements approved under EFSI are expected to mobilise around \u20ac486 billion of investments and to benefit around 1.2 million small and medium-sized companies throughout the EU.\n\nInnovFin - EU Finance for Innovators\n\nUnder Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation programme for 2014-2020, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank Group (EIB and EIF) launched a new generation of financial instruments and advisory services in 2014 to help innovative firms access finance more easily. Until 2020, \u201cInnovFin \u2013 EU Finance for Innovators\u201d is offering a range of tailored products which provides financing in support of research and innovation by small, medium-sized and large companies and the promoters of research infrastructure.\n\n","detail_title":["Investment Plan for Europe: European Investment Bank to provide BioNTech with up to \u20ac100 million in debt financing for COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacturing"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1034\/IP_20_1034_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Siobh\u00e1n MILLBRIGHT","phone":"+32 2 295 73 61","email":"siobhan.millbright@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"November 2020","date":"13 November","title":"First meeting of EU COVID-19 national scientific advice platform","abstract":"<p>President of the European Commission Ursula <strong>von der Leyen<\/strong> welcomed COVID-19 scientific advisors from EU Member States to the first meeting of the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/health\/adviceplatform_covid19_en\">EU scientific advice platform<\/a> on COVID-19.

Furthermore, a large-scale infestation of locusts threatens food security and livelihoods of many vulnerable people in the region.\n\nCommissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d said: \u201cThe EU remains committed to help address humanitarian needs in countries in the Horn of Africa, all the more so in these challenging times. EU aid will support communities at risk of hunger and strengthen measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

It will help:\n\n\tsupport the health facilities in the provision of basic services, epidemics control and prepare them to face the coronavirus pandemic.\n\tprovide food assistance to people in need, such as by supporting farmers to get seeds and fodder for their livestock; provide treatment for acute malnutrition, especially for young children\n\taddress the basic needs of refugees and internally displaced people, such as protection, shelter, food, access to health and nutrition care and clean water, and education for children.\n\n\nThe EU's humanitarian aid forms part of the broader EU support in the region, which includes longer-term development cooperation.\n\nBackground:\n\nWith some 25 million people already at risk of food shortages in the region, the looming desert locust upsurge is an additional threat to food security and livelihoods, especially for the most vulnerable communities. Their food access is at risk of being further cut down by rising food prices. The situation is further aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic, as prevention and control measures can also, as an indirect consequence, place additional challenges to the delivery of humanitarian aid and to reaching people in need.\n\nEU humanitarian projects in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia addressing food shortages and loss of livelihoods caused by locust swarms are being allocated \u20ac22 million from this aid package. Furthermore, earlier in 2020, the EU already mobilised \u20ac11 million in humanitarian and development funding to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to help it address the locust outbreak in the region and provide support to affected pastoralists and farmers.\n\nA share of the funding announced today will also contribute to the Team Europe's response to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, EU humanitarian aid will be provided to the World Health Organization's global coronavirus response in partnership with health authorities in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia to scale up operational readiness for early detection and response to the pandemic.\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: EU provides support in Horn of Africa region"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_880\/IP_20_880_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Measures to prevent social hardship","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"August 2020","date":"18 August","title":"Commission proposes to extend 2020 European Capitals of Culture into 2021","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_1492\">proposed the extension of the 2020 European Capitals of Culture<\/a> year until 30 April 2021 for Rijeka (Croatia) and Galway (Ireland).

The EIF's guarantee to RBBH is provided under the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility, as part of its coronavirus economic support package.

The measure was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework. The recapitalisation measure is part of a larger recapitalisation package, which also foresees a significant participation of private investors, including the conversion of outstanding privately-held debt instruments into equity. SAS is a major network airline operating in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. In the second quarter of 2020, SAS suffered substantial losses due to the coronavirus outbreak and the travel restrictions that Denmark, Sweden and other countries had to impose to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The Commission found that measure notified by Denmark and Sweden is in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission concluded that the recapitalisation measure will contribute to manage the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in Denmark and Sweden: the measure aims at restoring the balance sheet position and liquidity of SAS in the exceptional situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic, while maintaining the necessary safeguards to limit competition distortions. It is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the two Member States, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the general principles as set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measure under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cSAS plays a key role for the connectivity and economy of Scandinavian countries. As many other companies active in the aviation sector, SAS has been severely hit by the current crisis. With this measure, Denmark and Sweden will contribute up to \u20ac1 billion to SAS's recapitalisation and help the airline weather the current crisis. At the same time, the Member States will be sufficiently remunerated for the risk taxpayers assume, and the support will come with strings attached to limit distortions of competition. I welcome the participation by private investors to the plan, as it limits the need for State aid, while contributing to the recovery of companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d A full press release is available online.

The Commission found that the transaction, as originally notified, would have raised competition concerns in the EEA market for account-to-account core infrastructure services (\u201cA2A CIS\u201d) in relation to managed solutions. The Commission was concerned that the proposed acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices and less choice in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services. To address the Commission's concerns, Mastercard and Nets offered to transfer to a suitable purchaser a global license to distribute, supply, sell, develop, modify, upgrade or otherwise use Nets' Realtime 24\/7 technology, with which the target business currently competes in A2A CIS tenders. The transfer also includes all necessary personnel and services, such as consultancy services and transitional support services, including access to all necessary components and capabilities to provide managed services based on Nets' Realtime 24\/7 technology. The proposed commitments fully address the Commission's competition concerns, as they will increase competition in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services in the EEA, by allowing a new player to effectively and credibly compete in this space. The Commission therefore concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, no longer raises competition concerns in the EEA. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, responsible for competition policy, said: \u201cCompanies and citizens seek competitive and innovative payment solutions for their banking transactions. This merger, as originally notified, would have significantly reduced competition in the market for account-to-account core infrastructure services and undermined the development of new real-time payment solutions, which are becoming increasingly important. Today's decision ensures that effective competition is preserved and facilitates the emergence of a new provider of real-time payment infrastructure services in the European Economic Area.\u201d\u00a0 A full press release is available online.

Both Gehe and Alliance Healthcare are mainly active in pharmaceutical wholesaling in Germany and supply retail pharmacies in Germany. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns, either at national level or at\u00a0 regional level in the catchment areas around distribution warehouses across Germany. This is because there will be a sufficient number of credible competitors available at national level and in each catchment area and the companies will face additional competitive pressure from direct sales of manufacturers after the transaction.

We must avoid further disruption of already fragile economies and additional uncertainty for citizens who have made huge sacrifices. They expect this from us after so many months living with COVID-19.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, said: \u201cOur right to move freely in the EU has been heavily impacted by the pandemic. For the many citizens who rely on frictionless travel every day, the cacophony of national rules in the EU is overwhelming. We want to simplify things. We are proposing straightforward criteria, applicable without discrimination, which are easy to follow by Member States and allow to inform Europeans properly.\u201d \n\nCommissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said: \u201cSince March, the Commission has developed and delivered a solid foundation of internal and external border control recommendations for Member States to follow. Today's measures builds on this track record so that we can fully benefit from our Schengen area. That is why we want a clear \u2018green, orange, red' system and not a kaleidoscope of individual measures\u201d. \n\nCommon criteria \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThere is currently a wide discrepancy between national criteria for introducing measures that restrict free movement in the European Union. The Commission is proposing that each Member State takes into account the following criteria when putting in place any restrictive measures:\n\n\tThe total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases per 100 000 people in a given area in a 14-day period;\n\tThe percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests carried out in given area during a seven-day period;\n\tThe number of COVID-19 tests carried out per 100 000 people in a given area during a seven-day period.\n\n\nMember States should provide this data on a weekly basis to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Member States should also provide this data at the regional level to ensure that any measures can be targeted to those regions where they are strictly necessary.\n\nOn the basis that the Member State of departure has a weekly testing rate of more than 250 per 100 000 people, the Commission is proposing that Member States should not restrict free movement of people travelling from another Member State where:\n\n\tThe total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases in a given area is equal to less than 50 per 100 000 people during a 14-day period, OR,\n\tThe percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests in a given area is less than 3%.\n\n\nA common colour code\n\nBased on the data provided by Member States, the Commission proposes that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publishes a map of EU and EEA countries, updated weekly, with a common colour code to support Member States and travellers. The Commission proposes the following:\n\n\tGreen for an area where the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is less than 25 during a 14-day period AND the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is less than 3%;\n\tOrange for an area where the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is less than 50 during a 14-day period BUT the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is 3% or more OR the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is between 25 and 150 BUT the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is less than 3%;\n\tRed for an area where the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is more than 50 during a 14-day period AND the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is 3% or more OR the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is more than 150 per 100 000 people during a 14-day period;\n\tGrey if there is insufficient information available to assess the criteria proposed by the Commission OR the number of COVID-19 tests carried out per 100 000 people is less than 250.\n\n\nA common approach for travellers from high-risk areas\n\nThe Commission proposes a common approach amongst Member States when dealing with travellers coming from \u2018high-risk' zones. Member States should not refuse the entry of persons travelling from other Member States. Member States that introduce restrictions to free movement based on their own decision-making processes, could require:\n\n\tpersons travelling from an area classified as \u2018red' or \u2018grey' to either undergo quarantine OR undergo a COVID-19 test after arrival \u2013 COVID-19 testing being the preferred option;*\n\n\nWhere justified, Member States could consider recommending that persons travelling from an area classified as \u2018orange' undergo at least a COVID-19 test prior to departure or upon arrival. Member States could require persons arriving from an area classified as \u2018red', \u2018orange' or \u2018grey' to submit passenger locator forms, notably those arriving by airplane, in accordance with data protection requirements. Travellers with an essential function or need \u2013 such as workers exercising critical occupations, frontier and posted workers, students or journalists performing their duties - should not be required to undergo quarantine.\n\nClear and timely information to the public \n\nThe Commission proposes that Member States provide details of upcoming restrictions to free movement or the lifting of travel restrictions to Member States and the Commission on a weekly basis. Changes should be notified a week before entering into force.\n\nInformation should also be made available on the \u2018Re-open EU' web platform, with a link to the weekly-published map by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nCitizens and businesses need predictability. Member States must make all efforts to minimise the social and economic impact of travel restrictions. This should include the provision of information to the public in in a clear, comprehensive and timely manner.\n\nBackground\n\nThe right of European citizens to move and reside freely within the European Union is one of the most cherished achievements of the European Union, as well as an important driver of our economy. Any restrictions to the fundamental right of free movement within the EU should only be put in place where strictly necessary and be coordinated, proportionate and non-discriminatory to address public health risks. \u00a0To limit the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on free movement. A well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, safeguard the health of citizens as well as maintain free movement within the Union, under safe conditions. This is important for the millions of citizens who rely on frictionless cross-border travel every day, and crucial for our efforts to start safely re-building the economy.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Commission's proposal for a Recommendation will be discussed by the Council with the aim of an adoption in the coming weeks.\n\nMore information\n\nProposal for a Council Recommendation on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nRe-open EU\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission proposes more clarity and predictability of any measures restricting free movement in the European Union"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1555\/IP_20_1555_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Christian WIGAND","phone":"+32 2 296 22 53","email":"christian.wigand@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Alice HOBBS","phone":"+32 2 298 08 29","email":"Alice.HOBBS1@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["justice, equality and rule of law"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"28 April","title":"Banking package to facilitate lending to households and businesses in the EU","abstract":"<p>The Commission adopted a banking package to help facilitate bank lending to households and businesses throughout the EU.

The aim of this package is to ensure that banks can continue to lend money to support the economy and help mitigate the significant economic impact of the Coronavirus. It includes an Interpretative Communication on the EU's accounting and prudential frameworks, as well as targeted \u201cquick fix\u201d amendments to EU banking rules.\n\nThe rules put in place following the financial crisis have ensured that banks in the EU are now more resilient and better prepared to deal with shocks to the economy. Today's Communication recalls that EU rules allow banks and their supervisors to act in a flexible, but responsible, manner during economic crises to support citizens and firms, particularly small and medium-sized companies. Today's Regulation also implements some targeted changes to maximise the capacity of credit institutions to lend and to absorb losses related to the Coronavirus pandemic, while still ensuring their continued resilience.\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People said: \u201cWe are supporting households and businesses as much as we can to deal with the economic fallout of the Coronavirus. The banking sector can do a lot to help here. We are using the full flexibility of the EU's banking rules and proposing targeted legislative changes to enable banks to keep the liquidity taps turned on, so that households and companies can get the financing they need. I will soon also be launching roundtable discussions bringing together consumer and business groups with the financial sector so that we can address the most urgent needs of our citizens and companies.\u201d\n\nThe Commission will engage with the European financial sector to explore how it can develop best practices that could further support citizens and businesses. The EU's response to this crisis must be coordinated in order to avoid national fragmentation and to ensure a level playing field.\n\nTargeted amendments to banking rules\n\nThe Commission proposed today a few targeted \u201cquick fix\u201d amendments to the EU's banking prudential rules (the Capital Requirements Regulation) in order to maximise the ability of banks to lend and absorb losses related to Coronavirus. The Commission proposes exceptional temporary measures to alleviate the immediate impact of Coronavirus-related developments, by adapting the timeline of the application of international accounting standards on banks' capital, by treating more favourably public guarantees granted during this crisis, by postponing the date of application of the leverage ratio buffer and by modifying the way of excluding certain exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio. The Commission also proposes to advance the date of application of several agreed measures that incentivise banks to finance employees, SMEs and infrastructure projects.\n\nInterpretative Communication\n\nToday's Communication confirms the recent statements on using flexibility within accounting and prudential rules, such as those made by the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank, amongst others. The Commission encourages banks and supervisory authorities to make use of the flexibility in the EU's accounting and prudential frameworks. For example, the Communication confirms \u2013 and welcomes \u2013 the flexibility available in EU rules when it comes to public and private moratoria on loan repayments (EBA guidelines of 2 April). The Communication also highlights areas where banks are invited to act responsibly, for example by refraining from making dividend distributions to shareholders or adopting a conservative approach to the payment of variable remuneration. Today's Communication also recalls how banks can help businesses and citizens through digital services, including contactless and digital payments. \n\n\nFor more information\n\nCommission Interpretative Communication on the application of the accounting and prudential frameworks to facilitate EU bank lending (Supporting businesses and households amid COVID-19)\n\nProposal to amend Regulation (EU) No\u00a0575\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms\n\nRegulation (EU) No\u00a0575\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No\u00a0648\/2012 Text with EEA relevance\n\nQuestions and Answers: Coronavirus response: Banking Package to facilitate bank lending- Supporting households and businesses in the EU\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus Response: Commission adopts banking package to facilitate lending to households and businesses in the EU"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_740\/IP_20_740_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Daniel FERRIE","phone":"+32 2 298 65 00","email":"daniel.ferrie@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Aikaterini APOSTOLA","phone":"+32 2 298 76 24","email":"aikaterini.apostola@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["Democracy and Demography","financial stability, financial services and capital markets union"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"June 2020","date":"3 June","title":"Commission takes steps to make \u20ac11.5 billion available for crisis repair and recovery in 2020","abstract":"<p>The Commission proposed <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_997\">modifications to its budget for 2020<\/a> to make \u20ac11.5 billion for crisis repair and recovery available already in 2020.

As part of the plan, the Commission has proposed to raise \u20ac750 billion on the markets and channel them to the EU recovery. To make this possible, the Commission proposed to temporarily lift the Own Resources Ceiling of its long-term budget (the maximum amount of funds that the Union can request from Member States to cover its financial obligations) and the ceiling on the actual spending (MFF payment ceiling). To achieve that, the Commission proposed to amend the Own Resources Decision \u2013 the legal text which sets the conditions to fund the EU budget.

This is the first disbursement in 2021. As part of today's operations, Belgium has received \u20ac2 billion, Cyprus \u20ac229 million, Hungary \u20ac304 million, Latvia \u20ac72 million, Poland \u20ac4.28 billion, Slovenia \u20ac913 million, Spain \u20ac1.03 billion, Greece \u20ac728 million and Italy \u20ac4.45 billion. All nine Member States had already received financial support under SURE in 2020, under one of the first three issuances and disbursement operations that took place in 2020.\n\nThese loans will assist Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help Member States cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures that they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, including for the self-employed. Today's disbursements follow the issuance of the fourth social bond under the EU SURE instrument, which attracted a considerable interest by investors. The notable oversubscription was translated into favourable pricing terms, which the Commission is directly passing on to the benefitting Member States.\n\nFollowing today's disbursements, 15 Member States have received a total of \u20ac53.5 billion under the SURE instrument. Once all SURE disbursements have been completed, Belgium will have received \u20ac7.8 billion, Cyprus \u20ac479 million, Hungary \u20ac504 million, Latvia \u20ac192 million, Poland \u20ac11.2 billion, Slovenia \u20ac1.1 billion, Spain \u20ac21.3 billion, Greece \u20ac2.7 billion and Italy \u20ac27.4 billion.\n\nAn overview of the amounts disbursed so far and the different maturities of the bonds are available online here. A breakdown of the \u20ac90.3 billion that have been authorised for 18 Member States so far is here. Member States can still submit requests to receive financial support under SURE which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion.\n\nMembers of the College said: \n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cUnder the SURE programme, the EU has mobilised up to \u20ac100 billion in loans for EU Member States to save jobs and keep people in work. The funds are regularly making their way to our Member States, helping them financially to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201dFollowing the fourth successful bond issuance under SURE, we have now disbursed more than half of the funds foreseen under this instrument. The 15 Member States benefitting from the initial four disbursements are now better equipped to alleviate the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic. We will proceed with a speedy implementation of the rest of the programme in order to provide all authorised funds for the 18 Member States that have so far requested financial support under this instrument\u201d.\n\nPaolo\u00a0Gentiloni,\u00a0Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cToday, the European Commission pays out a further \u20ac14 billion to support workers in nine hard-hit EU countries. The pandemic continues to weigh on our economies and while we know there is light at the end of this tunnel, we don't yet know how much longer until we reach it. That's why SURE and the European solidarity it represents are so important.\u201d\n\nBackground \n\nOn 26 January, the European Commission issued the fourth social bond under the EU SURE instrument and the first one for 2021, for a total value of \u20ac14 billion. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac10 billion due for repayment in June 2028 and \u20ac4 billion due for repayment in November 2050.\n\nThere was high demand among investors \u2013 the bonds were over 8 and 12 times oversubscribed, respectively, which once again enabled the Commission to obtain very good pricing conditions. More concretely, the 7-year bond was priced at a negative yield of -0.497%. This means that for every \u20ac105 that Member States get, they pay back \u20ac100 when the bond matures. The 30-year bond was priced on the slightly positive territory, at 0.134%, which is an excellent result for this maturity. These are being passed on directly to the EU Member States.\n\nThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.\n\nFor More Information\n\nPress release on the fourth bond issuance\n\nSURE Regulation\n\nFactsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes SURE\n\nCoronavirus response\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\n","detail_title":["Commission disburses \u20ac14 billion under SURE to nine Member States\n"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_309\/IP_21_309_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Claire JOAWN","phone":"+32 2 295 68 59","email":"claire.joawn@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","budget and human resources"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_209","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=CELEX:32020R0672","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/sites\/info\/files\/economy-finance\/sure_factsheet.pdf","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_572","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/eu-borrower\/eu-borrowing-activities\/eu-sure-social-bond-framework_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/business-economy-euro\/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination\/financial-assistance-eu\/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities\/sure_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/eu-borrower_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"7 April","title":"EU medical teams deployed to Italy","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_613\">A team of European doctors and nurses from Romania and Norway<\/a>, deployed through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, was dispatched to Milan and Bergamo to help Italian medical staff working to battle the coronavirus.

The platform, part of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan, marks another milestone in the EU's efforts to support researchers in Europe and around the world in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. \n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cLaunching the European COVID-19 Data Platform is an important concrete measure for stronger cooperation in fighting the coronavirus. Building on our dedicated support for open science and open access over the years, now is the time to step up our efforts and stand united with our researchers. Through our joint efforts, we will better understand, diagnose and eventually overpower the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe new platform will provide an open, trusted, and scalable European and global environment where researchers can store and share datasets, such as DNA sequences, protein structures, data from pre-clinical research and clinical trials, as well as epidemiological data. It is the result of a joint effort by the European Commission, the European Bioinformatics Institute of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI), the Elixir infrastructure and the\u00a0COMPARE project, as well as the EU Member States and other partners.\n\nRapid open sharing of data greatly accelerates research and discovery, allowing for an effective response to the coronavirus emergency. The European COVID-19 Data Platform is in line with the principles established in the Statement on Data Sharing in Public Health Emergency and accentuates the Commission's commitment to open research data and Open Science, which aims at making science more ef\ufb01cient, reliable, and responsive to societal challenges. In this context, the platform is also a priority pilot, aimed at realising the objectives of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and builds upon established networks between EMBL-EBI and national public health data infrastructures.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nERAvsCorona Action Plan \n\nOn 7 April 2020, research and innovation Ministers from all 27 EU Member States supported 10 priority actions of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan. Building on the overall objectives and the tools of the European Research Area (ERA), the Action Plan covers short-term actions based on close coordination, cooperation, data sharing and joint funding efforts between the Commission and the Member States. It is centred around the key principles of the European Research Area, which will now be used to achieve towards their maximum effect to help researchers and EU Member States succeed in their fight against the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nIn addition to the European COVID-19 Data Platform launched today, the other actions focus on coordinating of funding, extending large EU-wide clinical trials, increasing support to innovative companies and supporting a pan-European Hackathon in the end of April to mobilise European innovators and the civil society. The joint plan listing priority actions will be regularly updated in a co-creative manner between the Commission services and national governments in the coming months.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThe EU is taking strong action to fight the pandemic. The Commission is also committing hundreds of millions of euros in research and innovation measures to develop vaccines, new treatments, diagnostic tests and medical systems to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nBuilding on long-term investments made before the coronavirus outbreak (through FP7 & Horizon 2020), including on surveillance and preparedness, the EU has rapidly mobilised \u20ac48.2 million for 18 shortlisted research projects that are now working on rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, new treatments, new vaccines as well as on epidemiology and modelling to improve preparedness and response to outbreaks. The projects involve 151 research teams from around the world. \n\nIn addition, the EU has mobilised public and private funding of up to \u20ac90 million through the Innovative Medicines Initiative, and offered up to \u20ac80 million of financial support to the innovative company CureVac to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the coronavirus.\n\nMoreover, a recent European Innovation Council Accelerator call of \u20ac164 million has attracted a significant number of start-ups and SMEs with innovations that could also help tackle the pandemic. At the same time over 50 ongoing or completed European Research Council projects are contributing to the response to the coronavirus pandemic by providing insights from several different scientific fields (virology, epidemiology, immunology, public health, medical devices, social behaviour, crisis management). \n\nTo strengthen global cooperation, the EU is coordinating international initiatives under the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Diseases Preparedness (GloPID-R), which brings together 29 funding bodies from 5 continents and the WHO. It is also contributing \u20ac20 million to the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI). Finally, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) is funding three calls of up to \u20ac28 million from Horizon 2020 to support research on the coronavirus and strengthen research capacities in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nMore Information*\n\nEuropean COVID-19 Data Platform\n\nERAvsCorona Action Plan\n\nEUvsVirus Hackathon website\n\nCoronavirus Research and Innovation initiatives\n\nPress release: Coronavirus: EU global response to fight the pandemic\n\nCOVID response Seal of Excellence\n\n\n\n<p class=\"media-copyright\">@ add copyrigth here 2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n* Updated on 21\/04\/2020 15:45\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission launches data sharing platform for researchers"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_680\/IP_20_680_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Johannes BAHRKE","phone":"+32 2 295 86 15","email":"johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marietta GRAMMENOU","phone":"+32 2 298 35 83","email":"marietta.grammenou@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["digital economy","research and innovation"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"June 2020","date":"15 June","title":"\u2018Re-open EU\u2019: New web platform to help safely resume free movement and tourism in the EU","abstract":"<p>The Commission launched \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/reopen.europa.eu\/\">Re-open EU<\/a>\u2019, a web platform that contains essential information allowing a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1045\">safe relaunch of free movement and tourism<\/a> across Europe.

It will provide real-time information on borders and available means of transport and tourism services in Member States. Re-open EU will also include practical information provided by Member States on travel restrictions, public health and safety measures such as on physical distancing or wearing of facemasks, as well as other useful information on EU and national tourism offers. This will allow Europeans to take responsible and well-informed decisions on how to manage continuing risks related to Coronavirus while planning their holidays and travels during this summer and beyond.\n\nThierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, said: \u201cAfter weeks of confinement, EU internal borders are reopening. The Re-open EU website we are launching today will provide travellers with easy access to information to help them confidently make their travel plans and stay safe during their trip. It will also help small restaurant and hotel owners, as well as towns across Europe, draw inspiration from innovative solutions developed by others.\u201d\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, and responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: \u201cEurope's vast and rich cultural heritage is one of our major assets. But with no possibility to travel and with most venues closed these past months, culture and tourism have been hit hard. The Re-open EU platform provides up to date, essential information so that we can start exploring Europe safely again\u201d. \n\nThe Re-open EU platform is part of the Commission's Tourism and Transport package of 13 May 2020, launched to rebuild confidence among travellers in the EU and help European tourism resume safely, in line the necessary health precautions. The new platform, which also comes with a mobile friendly version (a web-based app), acts as a key point of reference for anyone travelling in the EU as it centralises up-to-date information from the Commission and the Member States in one place. It will allow people to browse country-specific information, updates and advice for each EU Member State through an interactive map. It will be easily accessible via app or website, and be available in the 24 official EU languages.\n\nFurthermore, the platform includes information on patronage voucher schemes that allow consumers to show support for their favourite hotels or restaurants by buying vouchers for a future stay or meal once they reopen, to help the European hospitality industry as restrictions are lifted and borders reopen. Patronage vouchers help businesses to overcome cash-flow bottlenecks, with services provided later. The amount paid by the customer goes directly to the service provider. By setting up the dedicated page, the Commission intends to help better link participating businesses and interested customers, especially when travelling abroad.\n\nFinally, Europe's digital cultural platform, Europeana, is launching Discovering Europe, a collection of art works and photographs of some of Europe's most iconic landmarks. Furthermore, a dedicated tourism hub will be created on Europeana Pro to help cultural heritage professionals discover initiatives supporting tourism throughout the EU.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Commission package on tourism and transport in 2020 and beyond, adopted on 13 May 2020, announced the publication of a dedicated website to provide travellers with all relevant information to travel safely in the EU.\u00a0The Commission also announced its intention to build on the momentum of patronage voucher schemes and work with national authorities, local tourism organisations and businesses to multiply and scale up such initiatives.\n\nMinisters responsible for tourism first discussed the launch of a dedicated Re-open EU platform during their 20 May video conference and broadly welcomed the initiative. Developed by the Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), Re-open EU offers real-time information covering some 30 indicators on transport, public health and tourism, provided by Member States and supplemented by data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).\n\nOn 11 June 2020, the Commission presented its recommendations for a partial and gradual lifting of travel restrictions to the EU after 30 June and called on Member States to remove restrictions to free movement and lift internal border controls by 15 June, considering the improving health situation in the EU and the implementation of physical distancing and other health-related measures by Member States.\n\nThrough Re-open EU, the Commission also provides relevant information on tourism offers in different Member States, including EU actions such as European Capitals of Smart Tourism, European Destinations of Excellence (EDEN) and the European Capitals of Culture.\n\nFor more information\n\nRe-Open EU website\n\nEuropeana \n\nDiscovering Europe\n\nEuropeana Pro\n\nTourism and Transport package\n\nCommunication on the third assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU\n\nEuropean Consumer Centres - help and advice for consumers in Europe\n\nEuropean Commission Corona Response website\n\n","detail_title":["Re-open EU: Commission launches a website to safely resume travelling and tourism in the EU"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1045\/IP_20_1045_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Sonya GOSPODINOVA","phone":"+32 2 296 69 53","email":"sonya.gospodinova@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Federica MICCOLI","phone":"+32 2 295 83 00","email":"federica.miccoli@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["Internal Market, defence industry and space","education, youth, sport and culture","internal market and industry","defence industry and space"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"November 2020","date":"10 November","title":"Agreement on EUR 1.8 trillion package to help build greener, more digital and more resilient Europe","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2073\">welcomed the agreement<\/a> between the European Parliament and EU Member States in the Council on Europe's next long-term budget and NextGenerationEU.

Once adopted, the package of a total of \u20ac1.8 trillion will be the largest package ever financed through the EU budget. It will help rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe, which will be greener, more digital, more resilient and better fit for the current and forthcoming challenges.\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cI welcome today's agreement on our Recovery Plan and the next Multiannual Financial Framework. We now need to move forward with finalising the agreement on the next long-term budget and NextGenerationEU by the end of the year. Help is needed for citizens and business badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Our recovery plan will help us turn the challenge of the pandemic into an opportunity for a recovery led by the green and digital transition\u201d.\n\nEuropean Commissioner Johannes Hahn in charge of the budget, who worked to facilitate the deal since the beginning of the mandate, said: \u201cToday's agreement will allow to reinforce specific programmes under the long-term budget for 2021-2027 (including Horizon Europe, Erasmus+, EU4Health). All in all, the EU long-term budget together with NextGenerationEU will amount to more than \u20ac1.8 trillion. It will play an essential role to support the recovery and make sure traditional beneficiaries of EU funds receive the sufficient means to continue their work during these very challenging times for all\u201d.\n\nMain elements of today's compromise include: \n\n\tMore than 50% of the amount will support modernisation through policies that include research and innovation, via Horizon Europe; fair climate and digital transitions, via the Just Transition Fund and the Digital Europe Programme; preparedness, recovery and resilience, via the Recovery and Resilience Facility, rescEU and a new health programme, EU4Health.\n\tTraditional policies such as cohesion and common agricultural policy also continue to receive significant financial support, so much necessary to ensure stability in times of crisis and their modernisation that should contribute to the recovery and the green and digital transitions.\n\t30% of the EU funds will be spent to fight climate change, the highest share ever of the largest European budget ever. The package also pays a specific attention to biodiversity protection and gender equality.\n\tThe budget will have strengthened flexibility mechanisms to guarantee it has the capacity to address unforeseen needs. This is making it a budget fit not only for today's realities but also for tomorrow's uncertainties. \n\tAs proposed in May 2020 and agreed by EU leaders on 21 July 2020, to finance the recovery, the EU will borrow on the markets at more favourable costs than many Member States and redistribute the amounts.\n\tA clear roadmap towards new own resources to help repay the borrowing. The Commission has committed to put forward proposals on a carbon border adjustment mechanism and on a digital levy by June 2021, with a view to their introduction at the latest by 1 January 2023. The Commission will also review the EU Emissions Trading System in spring 2021, including its possible extension to aviation and maritime. It will propose an own resource based on the Emissions Trading System by June 2021. In addition, the Commission will propose additional new own resources, which could include a Financial Transaction Tax and a financial contribution linked to the corporate sector or a new common corporate tax base. The Commission will work to make a proposal by June 2024.\n\tIn terms of EU budget protection, now, for the first time, the EU will have a specific mechanism to protect its budget against breaches of the rule of law as agreed on 5 November. At the same time, final beneficiaries of EU funding in the Member State concerned will not be negatively affected by this mechanism.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNext steps \n\nThe MFF Regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement endorsed today must now be formally adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, in line with their respective roles and procedures.\n\nIn parallel, work must continue towards a final adoption of all other elements of the package, including the sectoral legislation and the Own Resources Decision.\n\nIn the case of the Own Resources Decision, which will enable the Commission to borrow, ratification by all Member States in line with their constitutional requirements is also needed. The European Parliament, at the September plenary, has already provided its positive opinion on this piece of legislation. The adoption by the Council is the next step.\n\nIn parallel, negotiations on the annual budget for 2021 have to take place. The 21-day conciliation period, during which the European Parliament and the Council should reach an agreement, runs between 17 November and 7 December this year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Commission remains fully committed to accompany the process.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground \n\nThe Commission put forward its proposal for the EU's next long-term budget on 2 May 2018. The framework proposal was immediately followed by legislative proposals for the 37 sectoral programmes (e.g. cohesion, agriculture, Erasmus, Horizon Europe, etc). Between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the Commission worked hand in hand with the rotating Presidencies of the Council, and in close collaboration with the European Parliament, to take the negotiations forward.\n\nOn 27 May 2020, in response to the unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus, the European Commission proposed the temporary recovery instrument NextGenerationEU of \u20ac750 billion, as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027.\n\nOn 21 July 2020, EU heads of state or government reached a political agreement on the package. Since then, the European Parliament and the Council, and with the participation of the European Commission, held 11 trilateral political trilogues on the deal with the aim of fine-tuning the final parameters of the deal.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information\n\nFactsheet\u00a0\n\nMFF website\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\n","detail_title":["EU budget: European Commission welcomes agreement on \u20ac1.8 trillion package to help build greener, more digital and more resilient Europe"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2073\/IP_20_2073_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Claire JOAWN","phone":"+32 2 295 68 59","email":"claire.joawn@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","budget and human resources"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/eus-next-long-term-budget-nextgenerationeu-key-facts-and-figures_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/long-term-eu-budget\/eu-budget-2021-2027_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_2088"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"21 April","title":"EU mobilises help for Italy, Croatia and neighbouring countries","abstract":"<p>Following requests for assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the EU is coordinating and co-financing the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_709\">delivery of aid shipments<\/a> in the EU and in neighbouring countries.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_709"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_709"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_709","detail_metadata":{"type":"Daily news","date":"21 April 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus: EU mobilises help for Italy, Croatia and neighbouring countries\n\nFollowing requests for assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the EU is coordinating and co-financing the delivery of aid shipments in the EU and in neighbouring countries.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. The scheme will be managed and implemented by the State-owned Specialised Financing Company, Finnvera Plc. Under the scheme, the public support will take the form of: (i) \u00a0State guarantees on new investment and working capital loans; or (ii) subsidised investment and working capital loans with favourable interest rates. The scheme aims at providing liquidity to companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak, thus enabling them to continue their activities, start investments and maintain employment. The Commission concluded that the measures are necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThe \u20ac2 billion scheme will enable Finland to grant loans at favourable terms and to provide public guarantees on loans to companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak. It will help businesses cover their immediate investment and working capital needs, and support them to continue their activities and maintain employment during and after the crisis. We continue to work closely with all Member States to ensure that national support measures can be put in place in a timely, coordinated and effective way, in line with EU rules.\u201d The full press release is available online.

As part of the Team Europe global package, these funds contribute to the recovery from the pandemic and also support the transition towards democracy and medium-term development objectives.\n\nCommissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen, said: \"With this budget support, the EU is contributing to mitigate the most urgent budgetary needs of The Gambian Government in the context of the pandemic. As The Gambia's key partner, the European Union encourages the Government to strengthen democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and to take the lead in building the necessary national consensus around the future direction of the democratic transition, with a new Constitution at its core.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic constitutes an unprecedented global health and economic crisis with detrimental and long-lasting socio-economic impacts. This budget support serves to support The Gambia in tackling its economic and fiscal impact, including loss of government revenue, unforeseen additional expenses and the consequences of global disruptions to supply chains. This will contribute to The Gambia's ongoing efforts to strengthen the democratic transition initiated in 2017.\n\nChannelled to the National Treasury of The Gambia, the EU funds will be used in accordance with The Gambia's own Public Financial Management systems and policy priorities. By providing fiscal space to address the pandemic and to continue financing basic public services such as healthcare and education, these funds will support The Gambia's resilience to the crisis.\n\nThis funding also directly supports the long-term efforts to achieve debt sustainability. In addition, the EU will provide technical assistance and capacity building in areas such as public financial management and statistical development.\n\nBackground\n\nSince the democratic transition, the EU has provided to The Gambia \u20ac365 million in development funds during the period 2016-2020 and \u20ac38.95 million from the EU Emergency Trust Fund from 2015 to 2019.\n\nThe EU is committed to assist in strengthening the democratic and economic governance in The Gambia as well as its resilience capacity. The EU supports the priorities of The Gambian Government in view of encouraging inclusive and sustainable growth, achieving the necessary reforms related to human rights, to democracy, and on the rule of law.\n\nThe EU Delegation implements a broad project portfolio focusing on governance, energy and economic growth, providing budget support under a series of sequential state and resilience building contracts and accompanying the democratic reform and transitional justice trajectories.\n\nFor More Information\n\nDevelopment cooperation in The Gambia\n\nEU global response to COVID-19\n\n","detail_title":["Team Europe: The European Union disburses \u20ac25 million to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus crisis in The Gambia"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1937\/IP_20_1937_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Gesine KNOLLE","phone":"+32 2 295 43 23","email":"gesine.knolle@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","international cooperation and development"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/international-partnerships\/where-we-work\/gambia_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/international-partnerships\/topics\/eu-global-response-covid-19_en#header-2789"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"February 2020","date":"1 February","title":"First aid delivered to China","abstract":"<p>As an immediate <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/statement_20_178\">first response<\/a>, EU Member States mobilised and delivered a total of 12 tons of protective equipment to China.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/statement_20_178"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/statement_20_178"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/statement_20_178","detail_metadata":{"type":"Statement","date":"1 February 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing information from China about the need for protective equipment, the EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre is in contact with all EU Member States to facilitate the delivery of needed personal protective equipment.\u00a0\n\nAs President von der Leyen said last week following her call with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, the EU stands ready to provide any assistance necessary to assist China in its efforts to contain the spread of the Coronavirus.\u00a0\n\nAs an immediate first response, Member States have so far mobilised a total of 12 tons of protective equipment, already en route to China.\u00a0\n\nThe Commission will continue providing its support to China.\n\n","detail_title":["Statement by Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d on EU support to China for the Coronavirus outbreak"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/statement_20_178\/STATEMENT_20_178_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Working time and working time flexibility","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"November 2020","date":"17 November","title":"EUR 14 billion under SURE disbursed to nine Member States","abstract":"<p>The Commission has <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2137\">disbursed EUR 14 billion to nine EU countries<\/a> in the second instalment of financial support to Member States under the SURE instrument.

Specifically, they will help cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, including for the self-employed.\n\nAt the end of October, Italy, Spain and Poland already received a total of \u20ac17 billion under the EU SURE instrument. Once all SURE disbursements have been completed to the 9 countries receiving financial support today, Croatia will receive \u20ac1 billion, Cyprus \u20ac479 million, Greece \u20ac2.7 billion, Italy \u20ac27.4 billion, Latvia \u20ac192 million, Lithuania \u20ac602 million, Malta \u20ac244 million, Slovenia \u20ac1.1 billion and Spain \u20ac21.3 billion.\n\nToday's disbursement follow the second issuance of social bonds under the EU SURE instrument, marked by very strong investor interest.\n\nThe SURE instrument can provide up to \u20ac100 billion in financial support to all Member States. The Commission has so far proposed to make \u20ac90.3 billion in financial support available to 18 Member States. The next disbursements will take place over the course of the months ahead, following the respective bond issuances.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMembers of the College said: \n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThe second wave is hitting Europe hard. The EU is here to support. We want to protect people from this virus and we also want to protect their jobs, as this crisis affects businesses too. Many jobs are on the line. With SURE, we mobilise up to \u20ac100 billion in loans to EU countries to help finance short-time work schemes. This second disbursement of \u20ac14 billion will help workers receive an income. More will come.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cThe second SURE issuance has once again been an overwhelming success and I am glad that as a result of it citizens in more of our Member States are getting the much needed support at times of crisis.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni said: \u201cAfter last week's second issuance of SURE social bonds, again massively oversubscribed, today we deliver the \u20ac14 billion raised to nine EU countries. In these sombre times for so many European workers and companies, I am proud that the Commission is helping to bring hope and support.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground \n\nOn 10 November, the European Commission issued social bonds for the second time under the EU SURE instrument, for a total value of \u20ac14 billion. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac8 billion due for repayment in November 2025 and \u20ac6 billion due for repayment in November 2050.

The number of coronavirus cases is rising rapidly. And it needs medical equipment to treat patients in hospitals. We do not leave our European friends alone in these hard times. The European Commission is mobilising medical material through our Civil Protection Mechanism. I just called the Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 to tell him that we are dispatching rapidly to Czechia a set of 30 ventilators from our RescEU reserve. We created this reserve in record time in spring, to stockpile essential medical material that we can send to European countries in need. And we are in touch with other EU countries, to mobilise more ventilators for the Czech Republic. We are in this together.\u201d\n\n\u201dWe have been working around the clock to avoid a repetition of the situation experienced at the end of February, when whole EU was overwhelmed in the fight against the pandemic. We created the rescEU medical reserve so no Member State is left alone when dealing with the same challenge. After already delivering protective face masks across Europe, this will be the first time the European Commission is dispatching ventilators from the EU level reserve,\u201d said Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d.\n\nThe EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre is in constant contact with authorities in Czech and more EU assistance can be channelled in the coming days via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, coming from Member States. In order to give Member States time to assess their response capacity and taking into account the gravity of the situation in the Czech Republic, the EU has proactively initiated the rescEU deployment of medical reserve.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThe rescEU capacity can include different types of medical equipment, such as protective masks or medical ventilators used in intensive care, and is constantly replenished. The reserve is hosted by several Member States who are responsible for procuring the equipment. The European Commission finances 100% of the assets, including storage and transport. Currently 6 EU countries host rescEU: Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Sweden and Romania.\n\nThe strategic medical capacity is part of the wider rescEU reserve, including other capacities such as aerial firefighting means and medical evacuation capacities. The rescEU reserve constitutes the last resort layer of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which can be activated for all type of natural and man-made hazards. EU Member States, the UK (during the transition period), Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey participate in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nThe Emergency Response Coordination Centre then manages the distribution of the equipment to ensure it goes where it is needed most, based on the needs expressed by countries requesting EU assistance under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nEarlier on in the outbreak, via the Civil Protection Mechanism, the Commission mobilised European Medical Teams for Italy composed of nurses and doctors, helped dispatch disinfectants, masks and ventilators across Europe, as well as repatriating more than 80,000 EU citizens on EU funded flights.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor more information\n\nRescEU\n\nEuropean Civil Protection Mechanism\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: first rescEU ventilators dispatched to Czechia "],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1971\/IP_20_1971_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"June 2020","date":"7 June","title":"EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights to the Democratic Republic of Congo","abstract":"<p>The EU Humanitarian Air Bridge is operating <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1009\">three flights to the Democratic Republic of Congo<\/a>, carrying on board humanitarian workers and essential supplies to help the country tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

In Kinshasa, they will meet the President of the DRC, H.E. F\u00e9lix Tshisekedias well as humanitarian organisations and civil society in the capital and in Goma.\n\nCommissioner Lenar\u010di\u010d said: \u201cThese new EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights to the DRC bring emergency aid to help those most in need. Defeating coronavirus in the long term means working together, in particular with African nations who are our key partners. We are delivering 40 tons of humanitarian cargo in total on board the three flights to the DRC. It is in our common interest to work in solidarity.\u201d \n\nCommissioner Lenar\u010di\u010d also stated that, in 2020, the EU is supporting the most vulnerable in the DRC with a total of \u20ac40.83 million in humanitarian funding.\n\nThe cargo of the three EU humanitarian air bridge flights to the DRC includes:\n\n\twater purifiers, nutrition support, and general medical supplies;\n\tother supplies, such as laboratory equipment, masks, gloves and personal protective equipment are also intended to support the coronavirus response in the DRC, complementing efforts by the DRC Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO), and in line with the country's COVID-19 Response Plan.\n\n\nThe flights are fully EU funded, and are part of a joint effort between the European Union, Belgium, France, and humanitarian aid organisations, and in cooperation with the DRC authorities.\n\nSince the beginning of May, the EU has organised four other Humanitarian Air Bridge flights - three to the Central African Republic and one to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe. Other flights are in the pipeline, including further flights to Africa, but also to other regions with high humanitarian needs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nTeam Europe support \n\nThe EU Humanitarian Air Bridge operations form part of the EU's global response to the coronavirus pandemic within the Team Europe approach. Team Europe's support to the whole African continent in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic amounts to \u20ac3.25 billion, reaffirming the EU's leading partner to African countries. This funding is helping countries strengthen their health system, support their economies in these challenging times, train health staff and reinforce social support systems.\n\nEU humanitarian and development aid support in the DRC\n\nHumanitarian needs in the DRC are among the highest in the world. While battling the coronavirus pandemic, the country continues to grapple with Ebola (the 11th Ebola virus disease outbreak declared on 01 June 2020, just as the 10th one was dwindling), a measles outbreak, and cholera. The EU's 2020 humanitarian funding in the DRC includes recently announced EU humanitarian assistance in reaction to the coronavirus pandemic: \u20ac4.5 million is allocated to coronavirus infection prevention and control measures, and access to quality health care, water, sanitation and hygiene. An additional \u20ac2.78 million has been channeled to the World Health Organization (WHO) to support early detection and response, and expertise on the ground.\n\nThrough its development aid, the EU is also, among other sectors, supporting the health care system in the DRC through a multi-year programme (2014-2020) with an overall budget of \u20ac222 million. It aims at improving both the accessibility and quality of health services through support to health centres and hospitals, to local health supervision authorities, and the medicines supply system.\n\nFor more information \n\nFactsheets:\n\nEU Humanitarian Air Bridge\n\nEU humanitarian aid in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nEU response to the Ebola epidemic in the DRC\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus global response: EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights to the Democratic Republic of Congo"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1009\/IP_20_1009_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Ensuring business continuity and support for essential services","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"August 2020","date":"22 August","title":"EU Humanitarian Air Bridge supports Venezuela","abstract":"<p>As part of the EU's global coronavirus response, an EU Humanitarian Air Bridge operation consisting of <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1509\">two flights to Venezuela<\/a> has concluded after delivering a total of 82.5 tonnes of life-saving material to supply humanitarian partners in the field.

Tackling the pandemic globally is in the interest of all. The EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights deliver medical equipment and other essential supplies to protect healthcare and frontline humanitarian aid workers. To ensure aid continues to reach those most in need, it is imperative that humanitarian workers have full and safe access to do their essential job of saving lives,\u201d said Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management.\u00a0\n\nIn a \u00b4Team Europe\u00b4 effort, the EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to Venezuela has been operated jointly by the EU, Spain and Portugal and coordinated with the competent Venezuelan authorities. The flights are entirely funded by the EU, whereas the cargo is made available by the humanitarian organisations using the flight, coordinated by the R\u00e9seau Logistique Humanitaire \u2013 a European humanitarian organisations' network.\n\nThe 82.5 tonnes of cargo consist mostly of life-saving medical equipment such as personal protection gear, medicines, as well as water purification equipment and family hygiene kits. The equipment will be used in health facilities and some items will also be directly distributed to the most affected families. More than 500.000 Venezuelans will benefit from this aid, including children, women, and health professionals.\n\nBackground\n\nBefore the Coronavirus pandemic reached Venezuela in March 2020, the country was already suffering the humanitarian impact of the ongoing political, economic and social crisis. In 2018, inflation in Venezuela exceeded one million percent. This multifaceted crisis has affected the country's healthcare system and caused a lack of basic medication as well as the migration of around one third of its professional medical staff. The result is a growing number of people lacking regular health services and treatment for chronic illnesses and emergency medical care. More than five million Venezuelans (about 10 percent of the population) have left the country since 2015.\n\nEU humanitarian aid in Venezuela\n\nSince 2018, the European Union has allocated EUR 154 million in emergency humanitarian aid, to assist Venezuelans in need inside the country, and those hosted in neighbouring countries.\n\nThe aid focuses on addressing the most pressing needs of the affected population, targeting the most vulnerable groups such as, children under five years of age, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, the elderly, school children and indigenous groups.\n\nProjects focus on delivering vital healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene, education in emergencies, protection of the most vulnerable population groups, and nutritional and food support. Assistance is also provided to support humanitarian coordination and to improve local capacities for emergency response.\n\nFor More Information\n\nFactsheet: EU Humanitarian Air Bridge\n\nFactsheet: Venezuela\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus Global Response: EU Humanitarian Air Bridge supports Venezuela "],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1509\/IP_20_1509_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Gesine KNOLLE","phone":"+32 2 295 43 23","email":"gesine.knolle@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","international cooperation and development"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/echo\/what\/humanitarian-aid\/humanitarian-air-bridge_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/echo\/where\/latin-america-caribbean\/venezuela_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":1,"category":"Ensuring business continuity and support for essential services","subcategory":"Wage flexibility ","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"3 April","title":"Facilitating cross-border treatment of patients and deployment of medical staff","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_590\">To support cross-border healthcare cooperation<\/a>, the Commission issued practical guidance to Member States.

To support and encourage cross-border healthcare cooperation between national, regional and local authorities, the Commission has today issued\u00a0practical guidance to Member States. Cooperation across borders can help ease the pressure on overburdened hospitals by transferring patients suffering from coronavirus for treatment in Member States where hospital places are available. The Commission will also support Member States or non-governmental organisations to send qualified teams of medical personnel to offer assistance across borders.\n\nVice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \u201cEU unity and solidarity are vital in the fight against Coronavirus. Cooperating across borders can make the difference in saving lives by alleviating overstretched health care capacities in Member States. Faced with the greatest crisis in generations, we will leave no stone unturned in our collective response.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Stella Kyriakides, responsible for Health and Food Safety said: \u201cWe can only overcome the coronavirus crisis together. Life-saving cooperation between Member States is key. EU solidarity has been tangible over the past weeks with Member States treating patients from their neighbours, even when stretched themselves. This is the EU at its best, and with our guidance today, we want to encourage more cross-border treatment of patients, more deployment of healthcare staff from EU countries with extra capacity, to where it is needed most. Solidarity saves lives.\u201d\n\nToday's guidelines set out a more coordinated approach to cross-border cooperation on emergency healthcare. The guidelines also outline additional support and assistance to be provided by the Commission to Member States health authorities, in particular by:\n\n\tCoordinating requests for cross-border healthcare assistance through the Health Security Committee, chaired by the Commission, and the EU Early Warning and Response System. Such requests could cover for instance intensive care places, treatment and transfer of patients or qualified teams of medical personnel. The Commission will closely monitor these requests and the assistance available in the Member States.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tSupporting health authorities requesting assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The Mechanism allows the Commission to coordinate and co-fund the emergency cross border transport of patients and qualified teams of medical personnel.\n\tSetting out arrangements for patient mobility across borders and clarifying the steps to be taken for the reimbursement of healthcare costs of cross-border treatment in compliance with the Social Security Coordination Regulations.\n\tEncouraging the deployment of qualified teams of medical personnel across borders. The Commission also encourages local, regional and national health authorities to use existing bi-lateral and regional agreements and clarify the mutual recognition of professional medical qualifications.\n\tOperating a Clinical Management Support System to support healthcare professionals to share knowledge and expertise. The system provides a Web conferencing platform that allow clinicians to exchange knowledge, discuss, and share clinical cases across the EU.*\n\n\nIn addition, regarding financial assistance for cross-border healthcare cooperation, the Commission has also extended the Solidarity Fund to cover public health emergencies. Moreover, health expenditure is eligible under the Structural Funds and further flexibility to shift funds was already provided as part of the co-ordinated economic response to the coronavirus outbreak. Finally, additional support will be available through the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) presented yesterday.\n\nMore Information\n\nDedicated Commission webpage on the EU's response to the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\u00a0* Clinicians and healthcare professionals interested in receiving more information and for joining the system can contact\u00a0SANTE-COVID-CLINICIANS-NETWORK@ec.europa.eu\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission encourages and facilitates cross-border treatment of patients and deployment of medical staff"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_590\/IP_20_590_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":1,"category":"Ensuring business continuity and support for essential services","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"27 March","title":"Boosting budget for repatriation flights and RescEU\u00a0stockpile","abstract":"<p>EUR 75 million from the EU budget <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_535\">should be made available<\/a> to help Member States repatriate EU nationals and to increase the budget of the RescEU medical stockpile.

The contract will allow the purchase of a vaccine against COVID-19 for all the Member States of the EU as well as the donation to lower and middle income countries or the re-direction to other European countries.\n\nThrough the contract, all Member States will be able to purchase 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option for further 100 million doses, to be distributed on a population-based pro-rata basis.\n\nThe Commission continues discussing similar agreements with other vaccine manufacturers and has concluded successful exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK on 31 July, Johnson & Johnson on 13 August, CureVac on 18 August and Moderna on 24 August.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \u201cThe Commission is working non-stop to provide EU citizens with a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 as quickly as possible. The entry into force of the contract with AstraZeneca is an important step forward in this respect. I am looking forward to enriching our portfolio of potential vaccines thanks to contracts with other pharmaceutical companies and engaging with international partners for universal and equitable access to vaccination.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cOur negotiations have now delivered clear results: a first contract signed delivering on our commitment to ensure a diversified vaccine portfolio to protect the public health of our citizens. Today's signature - made possible by the important groundwork\u00a0 undertaken by France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands - will ensure that doses of a vaccine which, if proven effective and safe, will be delivered across Member States. We expect to announce additional agreements with other vaccine manufacturers very swiftly. \u201c\n\nAstraZeneca and the University of Oxford joined forces to develop and distribute the University's potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection.\n\nAstraZeneca's vaccine candidate is already in large-scale Phase II\/III Clinical Trials after promising results in Phase I\/II concerning safety and immunogenicity.\n\nToday's contract is based on the Advanced Purchase Agreement approved on 14 August with AstraZeneca, which will be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument. The \u201cInclusive Vaccine Alliance\u201d countries (Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands) who started negotiations with AstraZeneca asked the Commission to take over through an agreement signed on behalf of all Member States.\n\nThe decision to support the vaccine proposed by AstraZeneca is based on a sound scientific approach and the technology used (a non-replicative recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccine ChAdOx1), speed at delivery at scale, cost, risk sharing, liability and the production capacity able to supply the whole of the EU, among others.\n\nThe regulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will use existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19, while maintaining the standards for vaccine quality, safety and efficacy.\n\nThe necessary safety requirements and specific assessment by the European Medicines Agency as part of the EU market authorisation procedure guarantee that citizens' rights will remain fully protected.\n\nIn order to compensate for such high risks taken by manufacturers, the Advanced Purchase Agreements provide for Member States to indemnify the manufacturer for liabilities incurred under certain conditions. Liability still remains with the companies.\n\nBackground\n\nToday's contract with AstraZeneca is an important step in the implementation of the European Vaccines Strategy, adopted by the Commission on 17 June 2020.\u00a0 This strategy aims to secure for all European citizens high-quality, safe, effective and affordable vaccines within 12 to 18 months.\n\nTo do so, and together with the Member States, the Commission is agreeing Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers reserving or giving the Member States the right to buy a given number of vaccine doses for a certain price, as and when a vaccine becomes available.\n\nAdvanced Purchase Agreements are financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\n\nMore Information:\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nCommissioner Kyriakides signs the agreement\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: the Commission signs first contract with AstraZeneca"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1524\/IP_20_1524_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"May 2020","date":"28 May","title":"Coronavirus Global Response: launching a new campaign with support of Global Citizen","abstract":"<p>The pledging marathon that <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_797\">started on 4 May<\/a> will now see the launch of a new campaign with the international advocacy organisation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalcitizen.org\/en\/\">Global Citizen<\/a>, \u201cGlobal Goal: Unite For Our Future\u201d, that will culminate in a Global Pledging Summit on 27 June.

This includes a pledge of \u20ac1.4 billion by the Commission. This almost reaches the initial target of \u20ac7.5 billion and is a solid starting point for the worldwide pledging marathon, which begins today. The aim is to gather significant funding to ensure the collaborative development and universal deployment of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cToday the world showed extraordinary unity for the common good. Governments and global health organisations joined forces against coronavirus. With such commitment, we are on track for developing, producing and deploying a vaccine for all. However, this is only the beginning. We need to sustain the effort and to stand ready to contribute more. The pledging marathon will continue. After governments, civil society and people worldwide need to join in, in a global mobilisation of hope and resolve.\u201d\n\nThe pledging event was co-convened by the European Union, Canada, France, Germany, Italy (also incoming G20 presidency), Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (also holding the G20 presidency), Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. The initiative is a response to the call from the World Health Organization (WHO) and a group of health actors for a global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global access to new coronavirus essential health technologies. The Coronavirus Global Response Initiative is comprised of three partnerships for testing, treating and preventing underpinned by health systems strengthening.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAn ongoing pledging marathon\n\nToday is an extraordinary achievement but also the start of a process to mobilise more resources. The initial target of \u20ac7.5 billion will not be enough to ensure the distribution of coronavirus health technologies worldwide, as this involves significant costs in terms of production, procurement and distribution.\n\nTo help reach the objectives of the Coronavirus Global Response, the European Commission is committing \u20ac1 billion in grants and \u20ac400 million in guarantees on loans through reprioritisation of Horizon 2020 (\u20ac1 billion), RescEU (\u20ac80 million), the Emergency Support Instrument (\u20ac150 million) and\u00a0external instruments (\u20ac170 million).\n\n\u20ac100 million will be donated to CEPI and \u20ac158 million to the World Health Organization. EU-funded calls for proposals and subsequent projects under Horizon 2020 will be aligned with the objectives of the three partnerships and subject to open access to data. Funding under RescEU will go towards the procurement, stockpiling and distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\n\nDonors are invited to continue pledging to the Coronavirus Global Response. They can choose which priority to donate to \u2013 Test, Treat or Prevent. They can also donate to the horizontal work stream of the Coronavirus Global Response, aiming to help health systems in the world cope with the pandemic.\n\nThe Commission will soon announce the breakdown of the amount raised today and how much will go to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and health systems strengthening related to COVID-19.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA cooperation framework to align global efforts\n\nA universal and affordable Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT-Accelerator) was the main objective of the 24 April call to action from global health partners. For this, significant funding is needed, as well as a solid collaborative structure, with a clarity of purpose to ensure that the donated money is put to good use and to avoid fragmentation of efforts.\n\nBased on discussions with public and private sector partners as well as non-profit organisations, the European Commission proposes a collaborative framework for the ACT-accelerator global response. This framework is designed as a coordination structure to steer and oversee progress made globally in accelerating work on developing vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics with universal access as well as strengthening health systems as required for meeting these three priorities.\n\nThis collaboration framework is intended to be time-bound (2 years, renewable) and build on existing organisations without creating any new structures. In the European Commission's view, it would bring together partners like the WHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and some of the initial convenor countries\u00a0 as well as many recognised global health actors such as CEPI, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund or UNITAID.\n\nThe core of the framework would be three partnerships based on the three priorities of the Coronavirus Global Response. They gather industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations, with a \u201cwhole-value-chain\u201d approach: from research to manufacturing and deployment. The three partnerships would work as autonomously as possible, with a transversal work stream on enhancing the capacity of health systems and knowledge and data sharing.\n\nThe Commission registers and keeps track of pledges up until end of May but will not receive any payments into its accounts. Funds go directly to the recipients. Recipients will, however, not decide alone on the use of the donation, but deploy it in concertation with the partnership.The commitment is for all new vaccines, diagnostics and treatments against coronavirus to be made available globally for an affordable price, regardless of where they were developed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNext steps\n\nThe global response must also include civil society, and the global community of citizens. For that reason, the European Commission is joining forces with NGOs such as Global Citizen and other partners.\n\nThe Global Vaccines Summit that Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will organise on 4 June will mobilise additional funding to protect the next generation with vaccines. As the world relies on Gavi's work for making vaccination available everywhere, the success of Gavi's replenishment will be crucial to the success of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThe Coronavirus Global Response builds on the commitment made by G20 leaders on 26 March.\n\nGrounded in a vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of the coronavirus, an initial group of global health actors launched a call to action for global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global access to new coronavirus essential health technologies.\n\nOn 24 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) and an initial group of health actors launched a collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global Access to COVID-19 Tools \u2013 the ACT Accelerator. Together, they issued a call to action.\n\nThe European Commission responded to this call by joining forces with global partners to host a pledging event \u2013 the Coronavirus Global Response Initiative \u2013 as of 4 May 2020.\n\nFunding, including the EU contribution, pledged since 30 January 2020 \u2013 the date when the WHO declared coronavirus a global health emergency \u2013 will be counted as part of the Coronavirus Global Response funding target with the commitment that these will contribute to and align with the ACT-Accelerator framework.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information\n\nCoronavirus Global Response website\n\nQuestions and Answers: the Coronavirus Global Response\n\nFactsheet \u2013 The Coronavirus Global Response\n\nThe Commission's Coronavirus Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus Global Response: \u20ac7.4 billion raised for universal access to vaccines"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_797\/IP_20_797_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Dana SPINANT","phone":"+32 2 299 01 50","email":"dana.spinant@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":[],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/europa.eu\/global-response\/","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_731","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/coronavirus-global-response-factsheet_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2021","date":"10 March","title":"Four million additional doses of BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine to be delivered in March","abstract":"<p>The Commission reached an agreement with BioNTech-Pfizer for the supply of <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_1101\">4 million more doses of COVID-19 vaccines<\/a> for EU countries to be delivered in March, in order to tackle coronavirus hotspots and to facilitate free border movement.

I'm happy to announce today an agreement with BioNTech-Pfizer, who will offer to Member States to make available a total of four million doses of vaccines before the end of March which will be supplied in addition to the planned dose deliveries. This will help Member States in their efforts to keep the spread of new variants under control. Through their targeted use where they are most needed, in particular in border regions, these doses will also help ensure or restore free movement of goods and people. These are key for the functioning of health systems and the Single Market.\u201d \n\nThe Commission is following closely the evolution of the epidemiological situation in Member States. Despite the current reduction in the number of deaths across the EU, due to vaccination of the elderly and most vulnerable people, the Commission is concerned by the development of a series of COVID-19 hotspots across the EU. This is caused, in particular, by the spread of new variants, which are more contagious. The BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine has proven highly effective against all currently known variants of the COVID-19 virus. Regions like Tyrol in Austria, Nice and Moselle in France, Bolzano in Italy and some parts of Bavaria and Saxony in Germany but also in many other Member States have seen numbers of infections and hospitalisations rise steeply over the past weeks, leading Member States to adopt stringent measures and even in certain cases to impose new border controls.\n\nIn order to support Member States in their efforts to respond to these developments, the Commission has negotiated with BioNTech-Pfizer the possibility for Member States to order supplementary vaccines doses. The increase of dose deliveries in March is a result of the successful expansion of manufacturing capacities in Europe which was completed by mid-February.\n\nFour million doses in total will be made available for purchase to Member States, pro-rata to their population. All of these doses will be delivered before the end of March. These doses come on top of the schedule of deliveries currently agreed between Member States and BioNTech-Pfizer.\n\n","detail_title":["Commission supports Member States in tackling coronavirus hotspots with offer of four million additional doses of BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine to be delivered this month"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_1101\/IP_21_1101_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2021","date":"11 March","title":"Commission extends transparency and authorisation mechanism for exports of COVID-19 vaccines","abstract":"<p>The Commission extended until the end of June the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_1121\">transparency and authorisation mechanism for COVID-19 vaccine exports<\/a>.

This follows persistent delays in some of the deliveries of vaccines to the EU.\n\nExecutive Vice-President and Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said: \u201cThe first weeks of the application of this instrument have shown that the trade disruption feared by many did not take place. Since the measure was introduced, shipments were authorised to more than 30 countries. This confirms that even during a very critical health situation, the EU has made a considerable effort to be a reliable and responsible trading partner.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides said: \u201cWe expect companies with which we have signed a contract to fulfil their obligations towards EU citizens. The EU exports very significant volumes of COVID-19 vaccines, true to our commitment to global solidarity. Yet, not all companies are honouring their agreements with the EU despite having received a down payment to enable sufficient production. We will insist that compliance is ensured and we will continue to work with companies to ramp up production in Europe as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nEU number one supplier of COVID-19 vaccines to the world\n\nThe EU continues to be the leading provider of vaccines around the world. Six weeks into the existence of this mechanism, 249 export requests to 31 different countries* have been granted for a total of 34,090,267 doses, as they did not threaten the contractual engagements between the EU and the vaccine producers. Only one export request was not granted. The main export destinations include the United Kingdom (with approximately 9.1 million doses), Canada (3.9 million), Mexico (3.1 million), Japan (2.7 million), Saudi Arabia (1.4 million), Hong Kong (1.3 million), Singapore (1 million), United States (1 million), Chile (0.9 million) and Malaysia (0.8 million).\n\nThe export authorisation mechanism\n\nThis export authorisation mechanism only applies to exports from companies with which the EU has concluded Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs). These APAs commit the vaccine producers to deliver to EU Member States a pre-agreed number of vaccines. The mechanism provides for authorisations of exports of COVID-19 vaccines outside the EU.\n\nInitially put in place on 30 January 2021, and with a timeframe lasting until the 12 of March 2021, the new regulation extends the duration of this mechanism until the end of June 2021. The new regulation also simplifies the procedure by allowing the grouping of exports to different final recipients in the same country in one single request. It also provides clarity by identifying the customs codes for the active substances covered by the measure.\n\nThis measure is targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary. It is fully consistent with the EU's international commitments under the World Trade Organization and the G20, and is in line with what the EU has proposed in the context of the WTO Trade and Health Initiative. Committed to international solidarity, the EU excluded from this mechanism vaccine supplies for humanitarian aid or those supplies destined to countries under the COVAX Facility, as well as shipments to our neighbourhood.**\n\nAbout the EU's vaccine strategy\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs). Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that are actually purchased by Member States. The APA is therefore a de-risk investment upfront against a binding commitment from the company to pre-produce, even before it gets marketing authorisation. This should allow for a quick and steady delivery as soon as the authorisation has been granted.\n\nThe Commission has so far signed APAs with six companies (AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, BioNtech-Pfizer, CureVac, and Moderna), securing access to up to 2.6 billion doses. Negotiations are advanced with two additional companies. The four contracts with the companies whose vaccines have been granted conditional marketing authorisation amount to more than 1.6 billion doses.\n\nFor More Information\n\nFactsheet\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nCommission Implementing Regulation and Annex\n\nPress release for the initial adoption of the mechanism\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, Macao, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States and Uruguay.\n\n**Countries excluded from the measure: countries and economies close to the EU, such as the EFTA countries or the Western Balkans, which are engaged in a process of deep integration with the Union, but also countries and territories that depend on the EU for supplies: Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Faeroe Islands, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Norway, North Macedonia, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Vatican City, the overseas countries, territories listed in Annex II of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, and exports to B\u00fcsingen, Heligoland, Livigno, Ceuta and Melilla, and the 92 low and middle income countries in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment list: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Egypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Kiribati, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Micronesia, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar\/Burma, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Vietnam, West Bank and Gaza, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.***\n\n*** List updated on 12 March 2021 at 13:00.\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Commission extends transparency and authorisation mechanism for exports of COVID-19 vaccines"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_1121\/IP_21_1121_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Miriam GARCIA FERRER","phone":"+32 2 299 90 75","email":"miriam.garcia-ferrer@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Sophie DIRVEN","phone":"+32 2 296 72 28","email":"sophie.dirven@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["trade, agriculture"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/trade.ec.europa.eu\/doclib\/html\/159437.htm","https:\/\/trade.ec.europa.eu\/doclib\/html\/159414.htm","https:\/\/trade.ec.europa.eu\/doclib\/html\/159478.htm","https:\/\/trade.ec.europa.eu\/doclib\/html\/159479.htm","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_307"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"October 2020","date":"21 October","title":"Commission issues first emission of EU SURE social bonds","abstract":"<p>The European Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1954\">issued a EUR 17 billion inaugural social bond<\/a> under the EU SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work.

I'm glad that countries hit badly by the crisis will receive support under SURE rapidly.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commissioner Johannes Hahn in charge of Budget and Administration said: \u201cWith this operation, the European Commission has made a first step towards entering the major league in global debt capital markets. The strong investor interest and the favourable conditions under which the bond was placed are further proof of the great interest in EU bonds. The \u201csocial bond\u201d character of the issuance has helped to attract investors who wish to help EU Member States in supporting employment through these difficult times.\u201d\n\nBoth bonds were issued on attractive terms, reflecting the high level of interest. The 10-year bond was priced at 3 basis points above mid-swaps. The 20-year bond was priced at 14 basis points over mid-swaps. The final new issue premiums have been estimated at 1 bps and 2 bps for the 10-year and 20-year tranches respectively, both values being extremely limited given the amounts printed.\n\nThese represent attractive pricing conditions for the Commission's largest ever bond issuance and a favourable debut for the SURE programme. The terms on which the Commission borrows are passed on directly to the Member States receiving the loans. (See here for more details on the pricing of the transaction).\n\nThe banks that supported the European Commission with this transaction (\u201cjoint bookrunners\u201d) were Barclays (IRL), BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Nomura and UniCredit.\n\nThe funds raised will be transferred to the beneficiary Member States in the form of loans to help them cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes and similar measures as a response to the pandemic.\n\nIn that context, the Commission announced earlier this month that it would issue the entire EU SURE bond of up to \u20ac100 billion as social bonds, and adopted an independently evaluated Social Bond Framework.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground on SURE\n\nSo far, 17 Member States will receive financial support under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. Financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States.\n\nThese loans will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the pandemic, in particular for the self-employed. SURE could also finance some health-related measures, in particular at the work place, used to ensure a safe return to normal economic activity.\n\nMember States can still submit formal requests for support under SURE, which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion to help protect jobs and workers affected by the pandemic. The Commission has already proposed a total of \u20ac87.8 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States.\n\nBackground on the EU borrowing\n\n\tThe EU was established by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and is 0% risk weighed as an issuer (Basel III). The EU's borrowings are direct and unconditional obligations of the EU, guaranteed by the EU Member States through the EU budget. The European Commission is empowered by the EU Treaty to borrow on the international capital markets, on behalf of the European Union.\n\tThe EU borrows exclusively in Euros for on-lending in Euros to sovereign borrowers. The EU currently operates four loan programmes: The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (\"EFSM\"), the Balance of Payments facility (\"BoP\"), the Macro-Financial Assistance (\"MFA\") and the Support to mitigate Unemployment Risk in an Emergency (SURE), recently adopted by the Council on 19 May 2020.\n\tThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE will benefit from a social bond label.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFurther details on the issuance:\n\n\tAhead of the transaction, the EU sent a Request for Proposal (RfP) to 20 banks on 9 October 2020 informing them of its intention to raise significant amounts in the market.\n\tThe formal mandate for a dual tranche issue was announced on Monday, 19 October at 13:25 CET.\n\tBooks were opened on Tuesday, 20 October 2020 in the morning at 08:55 CET and closed at 10:00 CET.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor more information\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nTechnical press release\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["European Commission issues first emission of EU SURE social bonds "],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1954\/IP_20_1954_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Claire JOAWN","phone":"+32 2 295 68 59","email":"claire.joawn@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Enda MCNAMARA","phone":"+32 2 296 49 76","email":"Enda.Mcnamara@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","economic affairs","budget and human resources","economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"10 March","title":"Easing impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the aviation industry and the environment","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/statement_20_431\">Targeted legislation<\/a> was announced to temporarily alleviate airlines from their airport slot usage obligations under EU law.

The restriction should be lifted for countries selected together by Member States, based on a set of principles and objective criteria including the health situation, the ability to apply containment measures during travel, and reciprocity considerations, taking into account data from relevant sources such as ECDC and WHO.\n\nFor countries towards which the restriction remains in place, the Commission proposes to enlarge the categories of permitted travellers to include, for instance, international students. The Commission is also issuing guidance to Member States to ensure that the resumption of visa operations abroad is well coordinated with the gradual lifting of the travel restrictions.\n\nCommissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson,said: \u201cFollowing the lifting of all internal border checks inside the Union, we are proposing a clear and flexible approach towards removing restrictions on travel to the EU starting on 1 July. International travel is key for tourism and business, and for family and friends reconnecting. While we will all have to remain careful, the time has come to make concrete preparations for lifting restrictions with countries whose health situation is similar to the EU's and for resuming visa operations.\u201d \n\nGradually removing restrictions on travel to the EU\n\nActions at the EU's external borders must be coordinated and uniform to be effective. As travellers entering the EU can move freely from one country to another, it is crucial that Member States coordinate their decisions on lifting travel restrictions. This is why Member States should agree on a common list of non-EU countries for which travel restrictions can be lifted as of 1 July, to be reviewed on a regular basis. To this end, the Commission proposes:\n\n\tObjective criteria: The decision to lift restrictions for a specific country should be based on the epidemiological situation and coronavirus response in that country, the ability to apply containment measures during travel, and whether or not that country has lifted travel restrictions towards the EU. Restrictions should be lifted first with countries whose epidemiological situation is similar to the EU average and where sufficient capabilities to deal with the virus are in place. Restrictions should remain in place for countries whose situation is worse than in the EU. The Commission proposes a detailed checklist to help Member States reach a common assessment. Decisions on lifting travel restrictions would concern non-EU nationals residing in a specific country (not its nationals).\n\tCommon and coordinated approach: The Commission proposes a coordination mechanism whereby it would support Member States and Schengen Associated States at technical level and facilitate the preparation of a list of countries for which travel restrictions could be lifted. Decisions on lifting restrictions should then be prepared with Member States under the EU's integrated political crisis response mechanism. Member States should adopt such decisions in a coordinated manner and ensure uniform application across the EU. This will be a dynamic process and the integrated political crisis response mechanism would need to coordinate further updates.\n\tFlexibility: It will be possible to reintroduce travel restrictions for a specific country if the criteria are no longer met. In addition, Member States can still refuse entry to a non-EU traveller presenting a threat to public health, even coming from a country for which restrictions were lifted.\n\n\nIn line with the proposed checklist, the Commission also recommends to lift travel restrictions for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia as of 1 July, given that their epidemiological situation is similar or better than that of the EU. This also follows on the Commission's readiness to closely associate the Western Balkans region with the implementation of the roadmap towards lifting containment measures.\n\nWhere the travel restrictions continue to apply, Member States should ensure that those travelling to study are exempted, together with highly skilled non-EU workers if their employment is necessary from an economic perspective and the work cannot be postponed or performed abroad. EU citizens and citizens of Schengen Associated States and non-EU nationals legally residing in the EU, as well as their family members, should also be exempt from the travel restriction regardless of whether or not they are returning home, as was the case until now.\n\nIn the roadmap on lifting containment measures presented on 15 April, the Commission indicated that travel restrictions within the EU would need to start being lifted gradually before restrictions at the external borders can be relaxed in a second stage. This is now well under way, with several Member States having already lifted restrictions within the EU and others planning to do so as of 15 June 2020. The Commission strongly encourages the remaining Member States to finalise the process of removing restrictions to free movement and lifting internal border controls within the EU by 15 June 2020.\n\nResuming visa operations\n\nMost Member States decided to suspend or reduce the processing of visa applications as part of pandemic-related measures. Travellers will need to be able to access visa services again and Member States should synchronise the resumption of visa operations with the lifting of travel restrictions. This is why today the Commission presents guidance for a phased and coordinated return of visa operations to normal.\n\nA harmonised approach is best achieved through consulates simultaneously resuming operations in each location and through full implementation of EU visa rules, together with good communication towards the public. The guidance also covers hygiene measures and precautions for receiving visa applicants.\n\nFinally, if a Member State requires health checks, these should take place at the time of travel or shortly before, rather than when applying for a visa; and should apply to all travellers from a given location irrespective of their nationality or visa status.\u00a0\n\nBackground \n\nThe Commission invited Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days, subsequently extending it twiceuntil 15 June.\n\nThe travel restriction, as well as today's invitation to prolong it until 30 June, applies to all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) \u2013 30 countries in total. All these countries implement it through national law.\n\nNationals of 105 countries are required to obtain a visa before travelling to the EU. Visa applications can usually be submitted at Member States' consulates in almost all non-EU countries around the world. The EU's visa policy for short stays is applied fully by 26 Schengen Member States and, in normal times, results in 15 million visas being issued each year.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommunication on the third assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 11 June 2020\n\nChecklist to be used for the possible lifting of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 11 June 2020\n\nGuidance for a phased and coordinated resumption of visa operations, 11 June 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission invites Member States to extend restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 June, 8 May 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission invites Member States to prolong restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 May, 8 April 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission presents practical guidance on implementing the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 30 March 2020\n\nCommunication on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 16 March 2020\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission recommends partial and gradual lifting of travel restrictions to the EU after 30 June, based on common coordinated approach"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1035\/IP_20_1035_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Adalbert JAHNZ","phone":"+ 32 2 295 31 56","email":"adalbert.jahnz@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Ciara BOTTOMLEY","phone":"+32 2 296 99 71 ","email":"ciara.bottomley@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Laura BERARD","phone":"+32 2 295 57 21","email":"laura.berard@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["security union","migration, home affairs and citizenship"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/communication-third-assessment-application-temporary-restriction-non-essential-travel-eu_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/annex-communication-third-assessment-application-temporary-restriction-non-essential-travel-eu_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/guidance-phased-and-coordinated-resumption-visa-operations_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_823","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_20_616","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_543","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=COM:2020:115:FIN"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2021","date":"30 March","title":"Further \u20ac13 billion under SURE to six EU countries","abstract":"<p>The Commission disbursed <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_1467\">\u20ac13 billion to six EU countries<\/a> in the sixth instalment of financial support under the SURE instrument.

This is the first time that Ireland has received funding under the instrument. The other five EU countries have already benefitted from loans under SURE.\n\nThese loans will assist Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help Member States cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures that they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, including for the self-employed. Today's disbursements follow the issuance of the sixth social bond under the EU SURE instrument, which attracted a considerable interest by investors.\n\nSo far, 17 EU Member States have received a total of \u20ac75.5 billion under the SURE instrument in back-to-back loans. An overview of the amounts disbursed up to date and the different maturities of the bonds are available online here.\n\nOverall, the Commission has proposed that 19 EU countries will receive \u20ac94.3 billion in financial support under SURE. This figure includes the additional \u20ac3.7 billion proposed by the Commission today for six Member States. The full amounts per Member State are online here. Member States can still submit requests to receive financial support under SURE which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion.\n\nTo address Member States' pending requests for 2021, the Commission will seek from the market further \u20ac13-\u20ac15 billion in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nLater this year, the Commission is due to also launch the borrowing under NextGenerationEU, the recovery instrument of \u20ac750 billion to help build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe.\n\nMembers of the College said\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThe crisis is tough on many workers, who fear for their jobs. This is why we have created SURE, to mobilise \u20ac100 billion in loans to finance short-time work schemes across the EU. Today we are disbursing a new tranche of \u20ac13 billion under SURE, supporting workers and companies in six Member States. This helps protect jobs and enables economies to recover faster from the crisis.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cWe are well in track to help business and people coping with these hard times. We have already delivered three fourths of the money committed for the SURE programme. Additional money will follow soon the second quarter.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Paolo\u00a0Gentiloni,\u00a0Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cAs the effects of the pandemic continue to weigh on our economies, today the Commission is disbursing further significant financial support to six countries, including Ireland for the first time. This is a crucial contribution to national efforts to support workers through these difficult times. I'm proud of the European success story that is SURE.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nOn 23 March 2021, the European Commission issued the sixth social bond under the EU SURE.\n\nThe issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac8 billion due for repayment in March 2026 and \u20ac5 billion due for repayment in May 2046.\n\nThe bonds attracted a strong demand from a wide range of investors, which ensured good pricing conditions that the Commission is directly passing on to the beneficiary Member States.\n\nThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label.

As Member States manage to reduce the circulation of the virus, blanket restrictions to free movement should be replaced by more targeted measures. If a generalised lifting of restrictions is not justified by the health situation, the Commission proposes a phased and coordinated approach that starts by lifting restrictions between areas or Member States with sufficiently similar epidemiological situations. The approach must also be flexible, including the possibility to reintroduce certain measures if the epidemiological situation requires. Member States should act on the basis of the following 3 criteria:\n\n\tepidemiological, notably focusing on areas where situation is improving, based on guidance by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and using the regional map developed by the ECDC;\n\tthe ability to apply containment measures throughout the whole journey including at border crossings, including additional safeguards and measures where physical distancing may be difficult to ensure and\n\teconomic and social considerations, initially prioritising cross-border movement in key areas of activity and including personal reasons.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe principle of non-discrimination is of particular importance: when a Member State decides to allow travel into its territory or to specific regions and areas within its territory, it should do so in a non-discriminatory manner \u2013 allowing travel from all areas, regions or countries in the EU with similar epidemiological conditions. In the same vein, any restrictions must be lifted without discrimination, to all EU citizens and to all residents of that Member State regardless of their nationality, and should be applied to all parts of the Union in a similar epidemiological situation.\n\n\tRestoring transport services across the EU while protecting the health of transport workers and passengers: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe guidelines present general principles for the safe and gradual restoration of passenger transport by air, rail, road and waterways. The guidelines put forth a series of recommendations, such as the need to limit contact between passengers and transport workers, and passengers themselves, reducing, where feasible, the density of passengers.\n\nThe guidelines also include indications on the use of personal protective equipment such as face masks and on adequate protocols in case passengers present coronavirus symptoms. The guidelines also make recommendations for each mode of transport and call for coordination among Member States in light of re-establishment of gradual connections between them.\n\n\tSafely resuming tourism services: \n\n\nThe Commission sets out a common framework providing criteria to safely and gradually restore tourism activities and developing health protocols for hotels and other forms of accommodation, to protect the health of both guests and employees. These criteria include epidemiological evidence; sufficient health system capacity being in place for local people and tourists; robust surveillance and monitoring and testing capacity and contact tracing. These guidelines will allow people to safely stay at hotels, camping sites, Bed&Breakfasts or other holiday accommodation establishments, eat and drink at restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9s and go to beaches and other leisure outdoor areas.\n\n\tEnsuring cross-border interoperability of tracing apps: \n\n\nMember States, with the support of the Commission, agreed on\u00a0guidelines to ensure cross-border interoperability between tracing apps so that citizens can be warned of a potential infection with coronavirus also when they travel in the EU. This will guide developers working with national health authorities. Such tracing apps must be voluntary, transparent, temporary, cybersecure, using anonymised data, should rely on Bluetooth technology and be inter-operable across borders as well as across operating systems. Interoperability is crucial: EU citizens must be able to receive alerts of a possible infection in a secure and protected way, wherever they are in the EU, and whatever app they are using. The Commission is supporting Member States in finding the right solution, in line with the principles set out in the EU toolboxand the Commission guidance on data protection.\n\n\tMaking vouchers a more attractive option for consumers:\n\n\nUnder EU rules, travellers have the right to choose between vouchers or cash reimbursement for cancelled transport tickets (plane, train, bus\/coach, and ferries) or package travel. While reaffirming this right, the Commission's recommendation aims to ensure that vouchers become a viable and more attractive alternative to reimbursement for cancelled trips in the context of the current pandemic, which has also put heavy financial strains on travel operators. The voluntary vouchers should be protected against insolvency of the issuer, with a minimum validity period of 12 months, and be refundable after at most one year, if not redeemed. They should also provide passengers sufficient flexibility, should allow the passengers to travel on the same route under the same service conditions or the travellers to book a package travel contract with the same type of services or of equivalent quality. They should also be transferable to another traveller.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor tourism businesses\n\nThe Commission aims to support Europe's tourism sector by:\n\n\tEnsuring liquidity for tourism businesses, in particular SMEs, through:\n\n\no\u00a0\u00a0Flexibility\u00a0under State aid rules allowing Member States to introduce schemes, such as guarantee schemes for vouchers and further liquidity schemes, to support companies in the transport and travel sectors and to ensure that reimbursement claims caused by the coronavirus pandemic are satisfied. The schemes for vouchers can be approved by the Commission very rapidly, upon notification by the Member State concerned.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 EU funding: EU\u00a0continues providing immediate liquidity to businesses affected by the crisis through the Coronavirus Response Instrument Initiative, under shared management with Member States. In addition, the Commission has made available up to \u20ac8 billion in financing for 100,000 small businesses hit by the crisis, with the European Investment\u00a0\u00a0Fund.\n\n\tSaving jobs with up to \u20ac100 billion in financial relief from the SURE programme: \n\n\nThe SURE programme helps Member States cover the costs of national short-time work schemes and similar measures allowing companies to safeguard jobs. The Commission also supports partnerships between employment services, social partners and companies to facilitate reskilling, especially for seasonal workers.\n\n\tConnecting citizens to local tourism offer, promoting local attractions and tourism and Europe as a safe tourist destination:\n\n\nThe Commission will work with Member States to promote a patronage voucher system under which customers can support their favourite hotels or restaurants. The Commission will also promote pan-European communication campaigns featuring Europe as a number one tourist destination.\u00a0 \n\nTo complement short-term measures, the Commission will continue to work with Member States to promote sustainable tourism in line with the European Green Deal and encourage a digital transformation of tourism services to offer more choice, better allocation of resources and new ways of managing travel and tourist flows.\n\nThe Commission will organise a European tourism convention with EU institutions, the industry, regions, cities and other stakeholders to jointly build the future of a sustainable, innovative and resilient European tourism ecosystem \u2013 the \u2018European Agenda for Tourism 2050'.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nVice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \"Tourism is vital to the Single Market and its four freedoms and a key contributor to the EU's economic, social and cultural way of life. It has also been deeply impacted by the measures needed to contain COVID-19. As our Member States gradually lift restrictive measures, we are putting in place the foundations for rebooting the tourism eco-system and Single Market in a safe, proportionate way that will prevent the resurgence of the virus within the EU, whilst safeguarding our way of life.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, said: \u201cMillions of SMEs and family -run businesses working in accommodation, restaurants, passenger transport and travel agencies risk bankruptcies and job losses \u2013 they urgently need to go back to work. We are helping European tourism get back on track while staying healthy and safe. Today we propose a common European approach to managing what will remain a difficult 2020 summer season, while preparing for a more sustainable and digital tourism ecosystem in the future.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said: \u201cWe know how much European citizens are looking forward to summer and to travel. Their huge sacrifices over the past months will make a cautious and gradual reopening possible - for now. But deconfinement and tourism will not be risk free as long as the virus circulates among us. We need to maintain vigilance, physical distancing and rigorous health precautions across the whole tourism and transport ecosystem to prevent further outbreaks as much as possible. We will not allow our efforts to be lost.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Justice and Consumers, Didier Reynders, said: \u201cEuropean consumers can be reassured: The Commission will not downgrade their EU rights for reimbursement for cancelled travel. We recommend, however, making vouchers more attractive for those who chose this option. In the meantime, freedom of movement is the right European citizens cherish most. It is important to restore this right as soon as the circumstances allow it.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Transport, Adina V\u0103lean, said: \u201cWe aim to create safe conditions in every mode of transport, to the extent possible, both for people traveling and transport workers. As we re-establish connectivity, these guidelines will provide authorities and\u00a0 stakeholders a standard framework. Our priority is to restore mobility as soon as possible, but only with clear provisions for safety and health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nEurope is home to a vibrant tourism ecosystem. Travel, transport, accommodation, food, recreation or culture, contribute to almost 10% of EU GDP and provide a key source of employment and income in numerous European regions. 267 million Europeans (62% of the population) make at least one private leisure trip per year and 78% of Europeans spend their holidays in their home country or another EU country.\n\nThe tourism ecosystem has also been one of the most affected by the heavy restrictions on movement and travel imposed in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak. The World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) foresees a 60% to 80% reduction in international arrivals, amounting to losses of between \u20ac840 and \u20ac1.100 billion in export revenues worldwide. In Europe, the summer is a crucial season for tourism:during an average summer season (June-August) residents of the EU make 385 million tourism trips and spend \u20ac190 billion.\u00a0\n\nToday's package follows the pathway set by the Joint European Roadmap published by the Commission on 14 April in cooperation with the European Council. The Roadmap provided a gradual approach to phasing-out containment measures introduced due to the coronavirus outbreak. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION :\n\nQuestions & Answers on Tourism and Travel Package\n\nQuestions & Answers on Tracing Apps\n\nFactsheet: The EU helps reboot Europe's Tourism \n\nFactsheet: Travel and tourism in Europe: A practical guidance for travelers and companies\n\nCommunication on tourism and transport in 2020 and beyond \n\nCommunication on a phased and coordinated approach to free movement\n\nCommunication: Guidelines on transport and connectivity\n\nCommunication: Guidelines on tourism services and hospitality establishments\n\nRecommendation on vouchers\n\n*Updated on 13\/05\/2020 at 15:25 \u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Tourism and transport: Commission's guidance on how to safely resume travel and reboot Europe's tourism  in 2020 and beyond*"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_854\/IP_20_854_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Sonya GOSPODINOVA","phone":"+32 2 296 69 53","email":"sonya.gospodinova@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Federica MICCOLI","phone":"+32 2 295 83 00","email":"federica.miccoli@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"C\u00e9lia DEJOND","phone":"+32 2 298 81 99","email":"celia.dejond@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["Internal Market, defence industry and space","education, youth, sport and culture","internal market and industry","defence industry and space"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"May 2020","date":"8 May","title":"EU sets up a Humanitarian Air Bridge","abstract":"<p>The European Commission has set up an <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_813\">EU Humanitarian Air Bridge<\/a> to transport humanitarian workers and emergency supplies for the coronavirus response to some of most critical areas around the world.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_813"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_813"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_813","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"8 May 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has set up an EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to transport humanitarian workers and emergency supplies for the coronavirus response to some of most critical areas around the world.\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management, is travelling today to Bangui on the first flight and will meet H.E. Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra, President of the Central African Republic, as well as humanitarian organisations.\n\nCommissioner Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d said: \u201cLeaving any area of the world unprotected today leaves us all unprotected tomorrow. As part of our global response, the EU will open a dedicated Humanitarian Air Bridge to get aid into areas which lack supplies due to the difficulties of global transit. This can be a lifeline for some of the most vulnerable communities worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe first EU flight, operated in cooperation with France,is departing from Lyon and will transport around 60 humanitarian workers from various NGOs and 13 tonnes of humanitarian cargo. Two subsequent humanitarian cargo flights will follow in the coming days to transport a further 27 tonnes of humanitarian supplies in total. On their return leg, the Air Bridge flights will also bring back EU citizens and other passengers from the Central African Republic in a repatriation effort.\n\nMore EU humanitarian flights are being scheduled for the coming weeks, prioritising African countries where the pandemic has the potential to worsen many existing humanitarian crises.\n\nHow the Humanitarian Air Bridge works\n\n\tIn a joint effort between the Commission and Member States, the Commission funds air transport of Member States' flights to and from the proposed destinations, where possible combined with ongoing repatriation flights, also including humanitarian workers on rotation.\n\tHumanitarian staff from national administrations, NGOs or UN Agencies can benefit from the facility.\n\tThe Commission finances 100% of the transport costs, whereas the EU partners remain responsible for the procurement of the humanitarian material.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe Global EU response to Coronavirus follows a Team Europe approach. It draws on contributions from all EU institutions and combines the resources mobilised by EU Member States and financial institutions, to address the humanitarian, health, and other consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAs part of its long-standing solidarity with the people in need in the Central African Republic, through its humanitarian aid, the EU is also supporting 15 new projects in 2020 with a total funding of \u20ac15.2 million. This funding is going towards providing life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people. Since 2014, the Central African Republic received more than \u20ac770 million in humanitarianassistance from the EU and its Member States.\n\nIn addition to humanitarian aid, the EU has mobilised over \u20ac30 million for the coronavirus response via its different instruments, including the B\u00eakou Trust Fund. This funding will help in addressing immediate needs in the Central African Republic in the health, water and sanitation sectors as well as supporting the State budget with an early budget support payment.\n\nFor More Information \n\nEU Coronavirus response: crisis management and solidarity\n\nFactsheet: EU Humanitarian Aid in the Central African Republic\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus Global Response: EU sets up a Humanitarian Air Bridge"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_813\/IP_20_813_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response\/crisis-management-and-solidarity_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/echo\/where\/africa\/central-african-republic_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Ensuring business continuity and support for essential services","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"September 2020","date":"10 September","title":"WHO and Commission launch the Facilitation Council to strengthen global collaboration","abstract":"<p>The President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen<\/strong>, and the Director General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, co-hosted the first meeting of the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1581\">High Level Facilitation Council<\/a>, leading the work of the global collaborative framework <em>Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator<\/em> (the ACT-A) to speed up the development and deployment of vaccines, tests and treatments against COVID-19, as well as to improve health systems.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1581"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1581"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1581","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"10 September 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Director General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, launched and co-hosted the first meeting of the High Level Facilitation Council, leading the work of the global collaborative framework Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (the ACT-A) to speed up the development and deployment of vaccines, tests and treatments against COVID-19, as well as to improve health systems.\n\nThe objectives of the first Council meeting was to align the plan for ACT-Accelerator as a key global solution to end the crisis and restore health systems and global growth, concur on the economic rationale and investment case for fully financing the ACT-Accelerator, and mobilise political leadership and international support for global equitable allocation.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \u201cToday's launch of the Facilitation Council brings us closer to our global goal: access to coronavirus vaccines, tests and treatments for everyone who needs them, anywhere. The EU will use all its convening power to help keep the world united against coronavirus. With the chairmanship of Norway and South Africa representing the global North and South, and the expertise of the WHO and our international partners, no country or region will be left behind in this fight.\u201d \n\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said: \u201cNearly 5,000 lives are lost each day due to COVID-19 and the global economy is expected to contract by trillions of dollars this year. The case for investing to end the pandemic has never been stronger. The ACT Accelerator is the best way to ensure equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, but at present is facing financing gap of US$35 billion. Fully financing the ACT Accelerator would shorten the pandemic and pay back this investment rapidly as the global economy recovers.\u201d \u00a0\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cThe only way to defeat COVID-19 is together, globally. The only way forward is solidarity, responsibility and global cooperation. Today, we step up our global leadership to accelerate the development and equitable distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. The Facilitation Council will play an instrumental role in delivering on this goal.\u201d\n\nDuring its first meeting, the Council has adopted a political statement highlighting global collaboration as key to defeat the virus. It stresses the importance of testing, treatment, vaccination and improved health systems to overcome the pandemic. The statement also mentions the progress made and call for additional resources to deliver on the mission.\n\nThe Facilitation Council is composed by governments and non-governmental partners (BMGF, Wellcome Trust). It is co-chaired by Norway and South Africa, achieving geographical balance. The Council build on what the ACT-A has achieved in only four month, such as more than 200 vaccine candidates, 1700 clinical trials, and 80 diagnostics being followed, as well as 100 countries surveyed to identify capacity gaps.\n\nNext steps\n\nFinal comments on investment case and ACT-A Plan will be forthcoming on 17 September and then the ACT-A high-level event at UNGA will take place on 30 September.\n\nBetween 15-30 September, there will be UNGA and G20 meetings and this will act to amplify the call to world leaders. Between 12-18 October, World Bank \/ IMF Annual meetings will take place to explore the scale of economic challenge and initial commitments. From November to March 2021, the G20 Summit and other related meetings will react upon the series of commitments.\n\nUltimately, the ACT-A Advocacy Campaign aims to address major political challenges and secure the more than \u20ac29 billion (US$35 billion) financing needs.\n\nBackground\n\nLaunched at the end of April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator brings together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, and philanthropists and global health organizations (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI, FIND, Gavi, The Global Fund, Unitaid, Wellcome, the WHO,\u00a0the World Bank\u00a0and Global Financing Facility). It intends to accelerate the development of universally accessible vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and the improvement of the necessary health systems. Knowledge and data sharing are key. The ACT will be in place for 2 years (renewable). No new physical structure will be established, but use will be made of the expertise of existing institutions and partners.\n\nThree partnerships on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics define the strategy, identify the resources needed and set the accountability rules. They bring together industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations, following a value chain approach, from research to manufacturing and deployment. These partnerships work as autonomously as possible and are supported by a group of governmental and private non-profit partners.\n\nACT-A's goal is to protect health systems and restore societies and economies by accelerating development, equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of 2 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2021, 245 million courses of therapeutics by mid-2021, and 500 million tests by mid-2021.\n\nThe European Commission is committed in a global solution to the pandemic. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus Global Response: WHO and Commission launch the Facilitation Council to strengthen global collaboration"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1581\/IP_20_1581_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"January 2020","date":"31 January","title":"First funds mobilised for research on the new coronavirus outbreak","abstract":"<p>EUR 10 million are granted from the EU\u2019s research and innovation programme, Horizon 2020, to support research into the new coronavirus disease.

It has launched an emergency request for expressions of interest for research projects that will advance our understanding of the novel Coronavirus epidemic and contribute to more efficient clinical management of patients infected with the virus, as well as improve public health preparedness and response. Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"We are working to mitigate the consequences of a potential larger spread of the Coronavirus outbreak in the EU. Thanks to emergency research funding from Horizon 2020, we will know more about the disease. I am proud that following the progress made during the last years, our supercomputer centres stand ready to help researchers in their work to develop new treatment and vaccines. We will be able to protect the public better, and to deal more effectively with the current and any future outbreaks.\u201d Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, added: \u201cWe need to see a multifaceted, whole-of-government response to the Coronavirus and research is an essential part of this. We need to know more about the virus to better target our prevention measures and to ensure better care for our citizens \u2013 this is precisely the aim of the Horizon 2020 emergency research funding announced today\u201d. The funding is expected to support 2 to 4 research projects. Applicants have until 12 February to respond and grant agreements should be signed very quickly, in view of enabling research work to start as soon as possible.\u00a0 The Commission is also working closely with the World Health Organization and other international actors to ensure an efficient and coordinated response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

This sweep was carried out by consumer protection authorities of 27 countries under the coordination of the Commission. The findings reveal that two-thirds of the screened websites do not comply with basic EU consumer rights. Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice, said: \"It is not acceptable that European consumers are not being properly informed of their rights relating to online deliveries in 2 out of 3 web shops. The EU rights, such as the right to return goods within 14 days, boost consumers' online trust.

Today's report also provides an overview of recent tax reforms at EU and Member State level. It shows that there is evidence that multinational enterprises continue to engage in aggressive tax planning in order to decrease their tax burden. Each year, billions of euros in tax revenue are also lost in the EU because of international tax evasion by individuals. The report finds that taxation is more than just about raising revenue but also plays a central role in shaping a fairer society. While the EU is faring relatively well compared to other parts of the world, there is significant income and wealth inequality in our societies. The overall structure of the tax system plays a role in addressing this, as well as boosting employment. The right tax policies can also play a role in supporting the green transition. For example, in 2019, in all but two Member States, the nominal marginal tax rates on diesel for private road usage are lower than those for unleaded petrol, even though diesel has a higher carbon content and greater negative impact on ambient air quality. New elements of this year's edition include discussions on tax competition, the sustainability of tax systems in a changing world, and the design and distribution of the overall tax mix. The report also presents the main indicators used by the European Commission to analyse tax policies in the context of the European Semester and substantiates the tax policy priorities of the Commission's Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy in this field.Download the report here.

The wine sector is among the hardest hit agri-food sectors, due to rapid changes in demand and the closure of restaurants and bars across the EU, which was not compensated by home consumption.\n\nThese new measures include the temporary authorisation for operators to self-organise market measures, the increase of the European Union's contribution for wine national support programmes, and the introduction of advance payments for crisis distillation and storage.\n\nAgriculture and Rural Development Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski said: \u201cThe wine sector has been among the sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus crisis and the related lockdown measures taken across the EU. The first package of market-specific measures adopted by the Commission has already provided significant support. Nonetheless, the uncertainties surrounding the scale of the crisis at EU and global level, and a close monitoring of the market has led us to propose a new package of measures for the wine sector. I am confident that these measures will provide rapidly concrete results for the EU wine sector and soon provide stability.\u201d\n\nThe exceptional measures include:\n\n\tTemporary derogation from the European Union's competition rules: Article 222 of the\u00a0Common Markets Organisation Regulation\u00a0(CMO) allows the Commission to adopt temporary derogations from certain EU competition rules in situations of severe market imbalances. The Commission has now adopted such a derogation for the wine sector, allowing operators to self-organise and implement market measures at their level to stabilise their sector and in the respect of the functioning of the internal market for a maximum period of 6 months. For example, they will be allowed to plan joint promotion activities, to organise storage by private operators and to commonly plan production.\n\tIncrease of the European Union's contribution: the European Union's contribution for all measures of the national support programmes will increase by 10% and reach 70%. A previous exceptional measure had already increased it from 50% to 60%. This will provide financial relief to beneficiaries.\n\tAdvanced payments for crisis distillation and storage: the Commission will allow Member States to provide advanced payments to operators for on-going distillation and crisis storage operations. These advances can cover up to 100% of costs and will allow Member States to fully utilise their national support programme funds for this year.\n\n\nIn addition to these support measures for the wine sector, the fruit and vegetable sector will also benefit from an increase of the EU's contribution (from 50% to 70%) for programmes managed by producer organisations. This will provide further flexibility to producer organisations in the implementation of their programmes.\n\nThese measures complement the recently adopted package, which benefited the wine sector through the flexibility provided under market support programmes. This included for instance an increased flexibility of tools to control production potential, the so-called green harvesting tool, and the possibility to include temporary new measures such as the opening of distillation of wine in case of crisis or an aid to crisis storage of wine.\n\nIn addition, the Commission has recently launched two calls for proposals for promotion programmes that aim to support the sectors most affected by the crisis, including the wine sector. The two calls will be opened until 27 August 2020.\u00a0\n\nFor more information\n\nSupporting the agriculture and food sectors amid coronavirus\n\nEU response amid coronavirus\n\nCommon Agricultural Policy's market measures\n\nWine in the EU\n\nFruits and vegetables\n\nCommission Implementing Regulation\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission adopts new exceptional support measures for the wine sector"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1267\/IP_20_1267_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Daniel ROSARIO","phone":"+ 32 2 295 61 85","email":"daniel.rosario@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se LEREBOURS","phone":"+32 2 296 33 03","email":"therese.lerebours@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":[],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"July 2020","date":"24 July","title":"Making capital markets work for Europe's recovery","abstract":"<p>The Commission adopted a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1382\">Capital Markets Recovery Package<\/a>, as part of the Commission's overall coronavirus recovery strategy.

On 28 April, the Commission had already proposed a Banking Package to facilitate bank lending to households and businesses throughout the EU. Today's measures aim to make it easier for capital markets to support European businesses to recover from the crisis. \u00a0The package proposes targeted changes to capital market rules, which will encourage greater investments in the economy, allow for the rapid re-capitalisation of companies and increase banks' capacity to finance the recovery.\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that works for the people said: \u201cWe are continuing with our efforts to help EU citizens and businesses during the coronavirus crisis and the subsequent recovery. One way of doing so is to help businesses raise capital on public markets. Today's targeted amendments will make it easier for our businesses to get the funding they need and to invest in our economy. Capital markets are vital to the recovery, because public financing alone will not be enough to get our economies back on track. We will present a wider Capital Markets Union Action Plan in September.\u201d\n\nThe package contains targeted adjustments to the Prospectus Regulation, MiFID II and securitisation rules. All of the amendments are at the heart of the Capital Markets Union project aimed at better integrating national capital markets and ensuring equal access to investments and funding opportunities across the EU.\n\nTargeted amendments to the prospectus regime - EU Recovery Prospectus: Easy to produce \u2013 Easy to read \u2013 Easy to scrutinise\n\nA prospectus is a document that companies need to disclose to their investors when they issue shares and bonds. The Commission is today proposing to create an \u201cEU Recovery Prospectus\u201d \u2013 a type of short-form prospectus \u2013 for companies that have a track record in the public market. This temporary prospectus would be easy to produce for companies, easy to read for investors, and easy to scrutinise for national competent authorities. It would cut down the length of prospectuses from hundreds of pages to just 30 pages. This will help companies to raise capital \u2013 such as shares - instead of going deeper into debt. A second set of targeted amendments to the Prospectus Regulation aims at facilitating fundraising by banks that play an essential role in financing the recovery of the real economy.\n\nTargeted amendments to the MiFID II requirements for European firms\n\nThe Commission is today proposing to make some targeted amendments to MiFID II requirements, in order to reduce some of the administrative burdens that experienced investors face in their business-to-business relationships. Lesser-experienced investors (such as households investing their savings for retirement) will remain just as protected as before. These amendments refer to a number of requirements that were already identified (during the MiFID\/MiFIR public consultation) as being overly burdensome or hindering the development of European markets. The current crisis makes it even more important to alleviate unnecessary burdens and provide opportunities to nascent markets. The Commission therefore proposes to recalibrate requirements to ensure that there is a high level of transparency towards the client, while also ensuring the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for European firms.\u00a0In parallel, the Commission has today opened a public consultation on amendments to the MiFID II delegated directive to increase the research coverage regime for small and mid-cap issuers and for bonds. In particular, SMEs need a good level of investment research to give them enough visibility to attract new investors. \u00a0We are today also proposing to amend the MiFID rules affecting energy derivatives markets. This is intended to help the development of euro-denominated energy markets \u2013 important for the international role of the euro \u2013 as well as allow European companies to cover their risks, while safeguarding the integrity of commodity markets, especially for agricultural products.\n\nTargeted amendments to securitisation rules\n\nThe Commission is today proposing a package of measures amending the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation. Securitisation is a tool through which banks can bundle loans, turn them into securities, and sell them onto capital markets. The aim of these changes is to facilitate the use of securitisation in Europe's recovery by enabling banks to expand their lending and to free their balance sheets of non-performing exposures. It is helpful to let banks transfer some of the risk of SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) loans to the markets so that they can keep lending to SMEs. In particular, the Commission proposes creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised on-balance-sheet securitisation that would benefit from a prudential treatment reflecting the actual riskiness of these instruments. In addition, the Commission proposes to remove existing regulatory obstacles to the securitisation of non-performing exposures.

It only requires a single dose, which takes us another step closer to achieving our collective goal of vaccinating 70% of the adult population by the end of summer.\"\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"Our portfolio now contains four safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines that we are working tirelessly to deliver to citizens in Europe and beyond as soon as possible. A single dose vaccine can make a difference in the speed of rollout. The entry on the market of the Janssen vaccine ensures that we have access to a total of up to 1.8 billion doses of approved vaccines from different technology platforms \u2013 this is key to ensuring access to vaccinations for Europe and our international partners. We will continue to work tirelessly to support vaccine producers and ensure they deliver doses, as agreed in our contracts.\"\n\nThe Janssen vaccine will be given in one dose to adults aged 18 years and older for preventing COVID-19. The vaccine is based on an adenovirus, a harmless virus which delivers the \u2018instructions' from the virus that causes COVID-19. This allows the body's own cells to make the protein unique to the COVID-19 virus. The person's immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by COVID-19. The adenovirus in the vaccine cannot reproduce and does not cause disease.\n\nOn the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional marketing authorisation.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Commission approved the contract with Janssen on 8 October 2020. With the conditional market authorisation, Janssen will be able to deliver 200 million of their single dose COVID-19 vaccine to the EU starting in the second quarter of 2021. The contract allows Member States to purchase an additional 200 million doses. This will add to the total amount of 600 of the vaccine by BioNTech\/Pfizer and the 460 million doses of the vaccine by Moderna, as well as the 400 million by AstraZeneca. \n\nBackground\n\nA conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However, it also ensures that this COVID-19 vaccine meets the EU standards, as for all other vaccines and medicines.\n\nOnce a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. CMAs are foreseen in the EU legislation specifically for public health emergencies and is considered the most appropriate regulatory mechanism in this pandemic for granting access to all EU citizens and for underpinning mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nJanssen submitted an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA on 16 February 2021. Such a short time for evaluation is only possible because EMA has already reviewed some data during a rolling review. During this phase, EMA assessed quality data and data from laboratory studies which looked at how well the vaccine triggers the production of antibodies and immune cells that target SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). The Agency also looked at clinical safety data on the viral vector used in the vaccine. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.\n\nThe European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional marketing authorisation.\n\nFor More Information\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nQuestions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nEU's legislation on medicinal products\n\nEMA and COVID-19 vaccines\n\nFactsheet: How vaccines work\n\nFactsheet: Health benefits of vaccines\n\nFactsheet: Authorisation process\n\nFactsheet: Long-term safety\n\nEU's current portfolio\n\n","detail_title":["European Commission authorises fourth safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_1085\/IP_21_1085_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/coronavirus-response\/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?qid=1597339415327&uri=CELEX:52020DC0245","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_2390","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/coronavirus-response\/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/health\/human-use_en","https:\/\/www.ema.europa.eu\/en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2363","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2364","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2245","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2365","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2244"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"October 2020","date":"8 October","title":"The Commission approves third contract to ensure access to a potential vaccine","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1829\">approved a third contract<\/a> with a pharmaceutical company, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

They will also have the possibility to purchase vaccines for an additional 200 million people.\n\nMember States may also decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nThe Commission has already signed a contract with AstraZeneca and with Sanofi-GSK and it concluded successful exploratory talks with CureVac, BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cAs the coronavirus continues to spread worryingly across Europe, it is crucial to find a vaccine, and fast. I'm glad that we have been able to find an agreement with Johnson & Johnson to purchase vaccines for 200 million people. This will be our third contract with a pharmaceutical company. Our aim is to provide EU citizens with safe and effective vaccines as soon as they are found.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cEnsuring a safe and effective vaccine is at the core of our European Vaccine Strategy. Today we have secured our third vaccine agreement, expanding our portfolio of vaccine candidates and therefore our chances to find an efficient remedy against the virus. More agreements will follow, and we remain determined in our search for a successful and safe vaccine to combat this deadly pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the AdVac\u00ae technology platform, which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen's recently approved Ebola vaccine and the Zika, RSV, and HIV vaccine candidates. The vaccine candidate is already in phase III of clinical trials.\n\nThe Commission's decision to support this vaccine is based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply the whole of the EU.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreement will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: the Commission approves third contract to ensure access to a potential vaccine"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1829\/IP_20_1829_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"May 2020","date":"27 May","title":"Commission presents a Recovery plan for Europe","abstract":"<p>To ensure the recovery is sustainable, even, inclusive and fair for all Member States, the European Commission has proposed to create a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_940\">new recovery instrument, Next Generation EU<\/a>, embedded within a powerful, modern and revamped long-term EU budget.

To ensure the recovery is sustainable, even, inclusive and fair for all Member States, the European Commission is proposing to create a new recovery instrument, Next Generation EU, embedded within a powerful, modern and revamped long-term EU budget. The Commission has also unveiled its adjusted Work Programme for 2020, which will prioritise the actions needed to propel Europe's recovery and resilience.\n\nThe coronavirus has shaken Europe and the world to its core, testing healthcare and welfare systems, our societies and economies and our way of living and working together. To protect lives and livelihoods, repair the Single Market, as well as to build a lasting and prosperous recovery, the European Commission is proposing to harness the full potential of the EU budget. Next Generation EU of \u20ac750 billion as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027 will bring the total financial firepower of the EU budget to \u20ac1.85 trillion.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThe recovery plan turns the immense challenge we face into an opportunity, not only by supporting the recovery but also by investing in our future: the European Green Deal and digitalization will boost jobs and growth, the resilience of our societies and the health of our environment. This is Europe's moment. Our willingness to act must live up to the challenges we are all facing. With Next Generation EU we are providing an ambitious answer.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of the EU budget, said: \u201cOur common budget is at the heart of Europe's recovery plan. The additional firepower of Next Generation EU and the reinforced multiannual financial framework will give us the power of solidarity to support Member States and the economy. Together, Europe will arise more competitive, resilient and sovereign.\u201d\n\nVice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, in charge of interinstitutional relations and foresight, said: \u201cThe recovery will need strong policy direction. The adapted Work Programme, reflecting the new reality, shows that we will focus all our actions on overcoming the crisis, jumpstarting our economy and putting the European Union firmly on a resilient, sustainable and fair recovery path. It will help us rebound stronger.\u201d\n\nINVESTING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION \n\nComplementing national efforts, the EU budget is uniquely placed to power a fair socio-economic recovery, repair and revitalise the Single Market, to guarantee a level playing field, and support the urgent investments, in particular in the green and digital transitions, which hold the key to Europe's future prosperity and resilience.\n\nNext Generation EU will raise money by temporarily lifting the own resources ceiling to 2.00% of EU Gross National Income, allowing the Commission to use its strong credit rating to borrow \u20ac750 billion on the financial markets. This additional funding will be channelled through EU programmes and repaid over a long period of time throughout future EU budgets \u2013 not before 2028 and not after 2058. To help do this in a fair and shared way, the Commission proposes a number of new own resources. In addition, in order to make funds available as soon as possible to respond to the most pressing needs, the Commission proposes to amend the current multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 to make an additional \u20ac11.5 billion in funding available already in 2020.\n\nThe money raised for Next Generation EU will be invested across three pillars:\n\n1. Support to Member States with investments and reforms:\n\n\tA\u00a0new Recovery and Resilience Facility of \u20ac560 billion will offer financial support for investments and reforms, including in relation to the green and digital transitions and the resilience of national economies, linking these to the EU priorities. This facility will be embedded in the European Semester. It will be equipped with a grant facility of up to \u20ac310 billion and will be able to make up to \u20ac250 billion available in loans. Support will be available to all Member States but concentrated on the most affected and where resilience needs are the greatest.\n\tA\u00a0\u20ac55 billion top-up of the current cohesion policy programmes between now and 2022 under the new REACT-EU initiative to be allocated based on the severity of the socio-economic impacts of the crisis, including the level of youth unemployment and the relative prosperity of Member States.\u00a0\n\tA proposal to strenghten the Just Transition Fund up to \u20ac40 billion, toassist Member States in accelerating the transition towards climate neutrality.\n\tA \u20ac15 billion reinforcement for theEuropean Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to support rural areas in making the structural changes necessary in line with the European Green Deal and achieving the ambitious targets in line with the new biodiversity and Farm to Fork\u00a0strategies.\n\n\n2. Kick-starting the EU economy by incentivising private investments:\n\n\tA new Solvency Support Instrument will mobilise private resources to urgently support viable European companies in the sectors, regions and countries most affected. It can be operational from 2020 and will have a budget of \u20ac31 billion, aiming to unlock \u20ac300 billion in solvency support for companies from all economic sectors and prepare them for a cleaner, digital and resilient future.\n\tUpgrade InvestEU, Europe's flagship investment programme, to a level of \u20ac15.3 billion to mobilise private investment in projects across the Union.\n\tA new Strategic Investment Facility built into InvestEU\u2013 to generate investments of up to \u20ac150 billion in boosting the resilience of strategic sectors, notably those linked to the green and digital transition, and key value chains in the internal market, thanks to a contribution of \u20ac15 billion from Next Generation EU.\n\n\n3. Addressing the lessons of the crisis:\n\n\tA new Health Programme, EU4Health, to strengthen health security and prepare for future health crises with a budget of \u20ac9.4 billion.\n\tA \u20ac2 billion reinforcement of rescEU, the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism, which will be expanded and strenghetend to equip the Union to prepare for and respond to future crises.\n\tAn\u00a0amount of EUR\u20ac94.4 billion forHorizon Europe, which will be reinforced to fund vital research in health, resilience and the green and digital transitions.\n\tSupporting Europe's global partners through an additional \u20ac16.5 billion for external action, including humanitarian aid.\n\tOther EU programmes will be strengthened to align the future financial framework fully with recovery needs and strategic priorities. Other instruments will be reinforced to make the EU budget more flexible and responsive.\n\n\nReaching a rapid political agreement on Next Generation EUand the overall EU budget for 2021-2027 at the level of the European Council by July is necessary to give new dynamism to the recovery and equip the EU with a powerful tool to get the economy back on its feet and build for the future.\n\nTHE POLICY FUNDAMENTALS OF THE RECOVERY\n\nRelaunching the economy does not mean going back to the status quo before the crisis, but bouncing forward. We must repair the short-term damage from the crisis in a way that also invests in our long-term future. All of the money raised through Next Generation EU will be channelled through EU programmes in the revamped long-term EU budget:\n\nThe European Green Deal as the EU's recovery strategy:\n\n\tA massive renovation wave of our buildings and infrastructure and a more circular economy, bringing local jobs;\n\tRolling out renewable energy projects, especially wind, solar and kick-starting a clean hydrogen economy in Europe;\n\tCleaner transport and logistics,\u00a0including the installation of one million charging points for electric vehicles and a boost for rail travel and clean mobility in our cities and regions;\n\tStrengthening the Just Transition Fund to support re-skilling, helping businesses create new economic opportunities.\n\n\nStrengthening the Single Market and adapting it to the digital age:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\tInvesting in more and better connectivity, especially in the rapid deployment of 5G networks;\n\tA stronger industrial and technological presence in strategic sectors, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, supercomputing and cloud;\n\tBuilding a real data economy as a motor for innovation and job creation;\n\tIncreased cyber resilience.\n\n\nA fair and inclusive recovery for all:\n\n\tThe short-term European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme (SURE) will provide \u20ac100 billion to support workers and businesses;\n\tA Skills Agenda for Europe and a Digital Education Action Plan will ensure digital skills for all EU citizens;\n\tFair minimum wages and binding pay transparency measures will help vulnerable workers, particularly women;\n\tThe European Commission is stepping up the fight against tax evasion and this will help Member States generate revenue.\n\n\nBUILDING A MORE RESILIENT EU\n\nEurope must enhance its strategic autonomy in a number of specific areas, including in strategic value chains and reinforced screening of foreign direct investment. To increase crisis preparedness and crisis management, the Commission will reinforce the European Medicines Agency and give a stronger role to the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) in coordinating medical responses in crises.\n\nThe recovery must unequivocally be based on fundamental rights and full respect of the rule of law. Any emergency measures must be limited in time and be strictly proportionate. The Commission's assessment will be included in the first report under the rule of law mechanism.\n\nWe can and must learn the lessons from this crisis, but this can only be done by involving our citizens, communities and cities. The Conference on the Future of Europe will play an important role in further strengthening Europe's democratic foundations in the post-coronavirus crisis world.\n\nRESPONSIBLE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP\n\nThe EU is committed in leading international efforts towards a truly global recovery, notably though joint coordination with the United Nations, the G20 and G7, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or the International Labour Organisation. The EU will continue working particularly closely with its immediate neighbourhood in the East and South and its partners in Africa.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Joint Statement of the Members of the European Council adopted on 26 March 2020 called on the European Commission to develop a coordinated exit strategy, a comprehensive recovery plan and unprecedented investment to allow a normal functioning of our societies and economies and get to sustainable growth, integrating inter alia the green transition and the digital transformation. On the basis of this mandate, on 15 April the Presidents of the Commission and the Council presented, as a first step, a Joint European Roadmap towards lifting Covid-19 containment measures. The package presented today, based on a revamped proposal for the next long-term EU budget and the updated Commission Work Programme for 2020, addresses the second part of the mandate, namely the need for a comprehensive recovery plan.\n\nThe EU has already delivered a coordinated and powerful collective response to cushion the economic blow of the coronavirus crisis. We have relaxed our fiscal and state aid frameworks to give Member States room to act.

The aim is to provide quality health care to the populations and reduce the economic and social impact of the pandemic.\n \nHigh Representative\/Vice-President Josep Borrell said: \u00ab Today we reiterate our commitment to step up our mobilisation of support for the Sahel in its fight against the pandemic. Beyond a short-term response to the urgent needs of the populations, our aim is also to reduce as of now the economic and social impact of the pandemic, which threatens to disproportionately affect Africa in general and the Sahel in particular.'\n \nJutta Urpilainen, Commissioner for International Partnerships, said: The European Union is continuing to mobilise as \u2018Team Europe' to reinforce the efforts made by the authorities of the G5 Sahel countries to address the coronavirus crisis. The implementation of these funds in a transparent and inclusive manner will help to improve health care and the socio-economic situation, which the pandemic has made still more fragile.'\n \nThese \u20ac92 million are part of our overall response and consist of \u20ac26 million for Burkina Faso, \u20ac12 million for Mauritania, \u20ac38 million for Niger and \u20ac16.92 million for Chad. Against a backdrop of fiscal pressures compounded by multiple crises \u2013 security, food, socio-economic and health \u2013 this EU budgetary support will assist these countries in implementing their pandemic response plans, while leaving the necessary fiscal space to continue key reforms in other sectors, without pushing up their debt levels.\n \nThese funds will also contribute more broadly to limiting the impact of the crisis on the economies of these countries and on the most vulnerable households. The European Union will continue to monitor closely the implementation of national development policies and the reforms adopted to ensure macroeconomic stability, sound public financial management and transparency.\n \nBackground\n \nThe Sahel is a priority country for the European Union. Since 2014, the G5 Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad) have benefited from \u20ac4.6 billion of European development funds. The European Union deploys a wide range of instruments (in particular, political, development, humanitarian and security) in line with its global and integrated approach, with a view to contributing to long-term stability and development.\n \nThe EU's global response to the coronavirus takes a \u2018Team Europe' approach based on contributions from all the EU institutions, and combines resources mobilised by the Member States and financial institutions to address the humanitarian, health and other consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. \u2018Team Europe's global response amounts to \u20ac36.8 billion. In this context, the EU has mobilised \u20ac449 million for the five Sahel countries.\n \nFor more information \n\n \nEU global response to COVID-19\n\n","detail_title":["Team Europe: The European Union supports the Sahel's response to the coronavirus pandemic with \u20ac92 million"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2067\/IP_20_2067_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Nabila MASSRALI","phone":"+32 2 298 80 93","email":"nabila.massrali@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"September 2020","date":"9 September","title":"Commission completes vaccines portfolio following talks with a sixth manufacturer","abstract":"<p>The Commission concluded exploratory talks with <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1556\">BioNTech-Pfizer<\/a> to purchase a potential vaccine against COVID-19.

BioNTech-Pfizer is the sixth company with which the Commission has concluded talks, following Sanofi-GSK on 31 July, Johnson & Johnson on 13 August, CureVac on 18 August and Moderna on 24 August. The first contract, signed with AstraZeneca, entered into force on 27 August.\n\nThe envisaged contract with BioNTech-Pfizer would provide for the possibility for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine, as well as to donate to lower and middle income countries or re-direct to European countries. It is anticipated that the Commission will have a contractual framework in place for the initial purchase of 200 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to purchase up to a further 100 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \u201cI am happy to announce that we have concluded talks with BioNTech-Pfizer for an initial purchase of 200 million doses of future coronavirus vaccines. This is the 6th pharma company with which we have concluded talks or signed an agreement for potential vaccines, in record time. Our chances to develop and deploy a safe and effective vaccine have never been higher, both for Europeans here at home, or for the rest of the world. To defeat coronavirus anywhere, we need to defeat it everywhere.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cToday's final talks with BioNTech-Pfizer is yet another important step in our efforts to build a sound and diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates. This was the objective of our EU Vaccine Strategy, and we are delivering on it. We are optimistic that among these candidates there will be a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 to help us defeat this pandemic.\u201d\n\nBioNTech is a German company working with US-based Pfizer to develop a new vaccine based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in human biology, transferring the instructions which direct cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease.\n\nThe exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nToday's conclusion of the exploratory talks with BioNTech and Pfizer is an important step towards the conclusion of an Advance Purchase Agreement, and therefore towards the implementation of the European Vaccines Strategy, adopted by the Commission on 17 June 2020.\u00a0 This strategy aims to secure for all European citizens high-quality, safe, effective and affordable vaccines within 12 to 18 months. To do so, and together with the Member States, the Commission is agreeing Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers reserving or giving the Member States the right to buy a given number of vaccine doses for a certain price, as and when a vaccine becomes available.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.\n\nThis is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission completes vaccines portfolio following talks with a sixth manufacturer"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1556\/IP_20_1556_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"16 March","title":"Protecting health and keeping goods and essential services available","abstract":"<p>The Commission presented <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_468\">guidelines to Member States<\/a> on health-related border management measures.

The aim is to protect citizens' health, ensure the right treatment of people who do have to travel, and make sure essential goods and services remain available. Commissioners Kyriakides and Johansson have presented the guidelines to EU ministers of Health and of Home Affairs at their first joint video meeting starting at 11am this morning. \u00a0\n\nPresident von der Leyen said: \u201cOur measures to contain the\u00a0Coronavirus outbreak will be effective only if we coordinate on the European level. We have to take exceptional measures to protect the health of our citizens. But let's make sure goods and essential services continue to flow in our internal market. This is the only way to prevent shortages of medical equipment or food. It's not only an economic issue: our single market is a key instrument of European solidarity. I am in discussion with all Member States so that we confront this challenge together, as a Union.\u201d\n\nThe\u00a0guidelines set out principles for an integrated approach to an effective border management to protect health while preserving the integrity of the internal market.\n\nProtecting people's health\n\nPeople identified as at risk of spreading\u00a0COVID-19 should have access to appropriate health care, either in the country of arrival or in the country of departure, and this should be coordinated between the two.\n\nIt is possible to submit everyone entering the national territory to health checks without formal introduction of internal border controls. The difference between normal health checks and border controls is the possibility to deny entry to individual persons. People who are sick should not be denied entry but given access to healthcare.\n\nMember States may reintroduce internal border controls for reasons of public policy, which, in extremely critical situations, may include public health. Such border controls should be organised to prevent the emergence of large gatherings (e.g. queues), which risk increasing the spread of the virus. Member States should coordinate to carry out health screening on one side of the border only.\n\nAll border controls should be applied in a proportionate manner and with due regard to people's health. Member States must always admit their own citizens and residents, and should facilitate transit of other EU citizens and residents that are returning home. However, they can take measures such as requiring a period of self-isolation, if they impose the same requirements on their own nationals.\n\nMember States should facilitate the crossing of frontier workers, in particular but not only those working in the health care and food sector, and other essential services (e.g. child care, elderly care, critical staff for utilities).\n\nEnsuring the flow of essential goods and services\n\nFree circulation of goods is crucial to maintain availability of goods. This is particularly crucial for essential goods such as food supplies including livestock, vital medical and protective equipment and supplies. More generally, control measures should not cause serious disruption of supply chains, essential services of general interest and of national economies and the EU economy as a whole. Member States should designate priority lanes for freight transport (e.g. via \u2018green lanes').\n\nIn the same vein, safe movement for transport workers, including truck and train drivers, pilots and aircrew is a key factor to ensure adequate movement of goods and essential staff.\n\nNo additional certifications should be imposed on goods legally circulating within the EU single market. According to the European Food Safety Authority, there is no evidence that food is a source or a transmission source of COVID-19.\n\nFor More Information \n\nGuidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n\n\n","detail_title":["COVID-19: Commission presents guidelines for border measures to protect health and keep goods and essential services available"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_468\/IP_20_468_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Adalbert JAHNZ","phone":"+ 32 2 295 31 56","email":"adalbert.jahnz@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Laura BERARD","phone":"+32 2 295 57 21","email":"laura.berard@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Ciara BOTTOMLEY","phone":"+32 2 296 99 71 ","email":"ciara.bottomley@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["migration, home affairs and citizenship","public health and food safety","public health","transport","security union"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/home-affairs\/sites\/homeaffairs\/files\/what-we-do\/policies\/european-agenda-migration\/20200316_covid-19-guidelines-for-border-management.pdf"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Working time and working time flexibility","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"3 April","title":"Waiving customs duties and VAT on the import of medical equipment","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_575\">approved requests from Member States and the UK<\/a> to temporarily waive customs duties and VAT on the import of medical devices, and protective equipment, from third countries in order to help in the fight against coronavirus.

The aim is to preserve EU companies and critical assets, notably in areas such as health, medical research, biotechnology and infrastructures that are essential for our security and public order, without undermining the EU's general openness to foreign investment.\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cIf we want Europe to emerge from this crisis as strong as we entered it, then we must take precautionary measures now. As in any crisis, when our industrial and corporate assets can be under stress, we need to protect our security and economic sovereignty. We have the tools to deal with this situation under European and national law and I want to urge Member States to make full use of them. The EU is and will remain an open market for foreign direct investment. But this openness is not unconditional.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCommissioner for Trade Phil Hogan said: \u201cWe are facing an unprecedented public health crisis with deep consequences for the European economy. In the EU, we are and wish to remain open to foreign investment. In the current circumstances, we need to temper this openness with appropriate controls. We need to know who invests and for what purpose. The EU and its Member States have the right legal tools for that. Today's guidelines call upon Member States to use these tools to the fullest extent and will bring additional clarity on how to use our investment screening framework to prevent a sell-off of strategic EU assets in the current crisis.\u201d\u00a0\n\nUnder existing EU rules, Member States are empowered to screen foreign direct investments (FDI) from non-EU countries on grounds of security or public order. Protection of public health is recognised as an overriding reason in the general interest. As a result, Member States can impose mitigating measures (such as supply commitments to meet national and EU vital needs) or prevent a foreign investor from acquiring or taking control over a company. National FDI screening mechanisms are currently in place in 14 Member States. With the EU foreign investment screening regulation in force since last year, the EU is well equipped to coordinate control of foreign acquisitions done at the Member States' level.\n\nIssuing its guidelines, the Commission calls upon Member States that already have an existing screening mechanism in place to make full use of tools available to them under EU and national law to prevent capital flows from non-EU countries that could undermine Europe's security or public order.\n\nThe Commission also calls on the remaining Member States to set up a fully-fledged screening mechanism and in the meantime to consider all options, in compliance with EU law and international obligations, to address potential cases where the acquisition or control by a foreign investor of a particular business, infrastructure or technology would create a risk to security or public order in the EU.\n\nThe Commission also encourages cooperation between Member States, as it comes to FDI screening cases where foreign investment could have an effect on the EU single market.\u00a0 Foreign acquisitions taking place now already fall under the EU FDI screening regulation, and could be reviewed under the cooperation mechanism established by the regulation, which will be fully operational as from October 2020.\n\nOn capital movements, the guidelines also recall under which specific circumstances free movement of capital, notably from third countries, linked to acquisitions of stakes may be restricted.\n\nThe Commission will also continue to follow closely developments on the ground and stands ready to discuss and ensure coordination on any foreign investment case with a larger European impact. Protection of the EU strategic assets will also be the subject of discussions between President\u00a0von der Leyen and EU leaders in tomorrow's European Council videoconference.\n\nBackground\n\nThe EU FDI Screening Regulation was adopted in March 2019. It puts in place for the first time an EU-level mechanism to coordinate the screening of foreign investments likely to affect the security and public order of the Union and its Member States.

To that end, the Commission has adopted an independently evaluated Social Bond Framework. This Framework is meant to provide investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.\n\nThis announcement follows the Council's approval to grant financial support to 16 Member States under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and people in work.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cWe are not only investing billions of euros to save jobs in Europe and reduce the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but we are also doing it by issuing social bonds. This will give investors the chance to contribute to our efforts and up to \u20ac100 billion will help keep people in jobs in our Member States.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cThe decision to issue the EU SURE bonds as social bonds will be a game changer for the global social bonds market. At the same time, it is a clear demonstration of the EU's long-term commitment to sustainable financing. I am very excited about today's announcement and looking forward to the forthcoming EU SURE issuance in the very near future.\u201d\n\nThe funds raised will be transferred to the beneficiary Member States in the form of loans to help them cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes and similar measures as a response to the pandemic.\n\nToday's Framework demonstrates to the investor community how the funds raised by SURE bond issuance will be used for a clearly identified objective: alleviating the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences across the EU. Investors can therefore be confident that their investments in these bonds will be used to finance targeted social policy measures. At the same time, the Commission's Social Bond Framework will contribute to the further development of the social bond market which is one pillar of the European \u2018Sustainable Finance' market.\n\nIn order to guarantee that the funds will be used for social purposes, the Social Bond Framework, underpinned by the SURE Regulation, requires Member States to report on how the borrowed funds have been spent. Under the Framework, Member States are also required to report on the social impact of the EU SURE bonds. Based on the information in these reports, the European Commission will be able to demonstrate to investors that the EU SURE bonds have been used to finance programmes with a positive social impact.\n\nBy preparing and presenting a Social Bond Framework, the Commission seeks to appeal to investors who want to put their funds to work for Environmental, Social and Corporate governance (ESG) purposes. The Commission's Social Bond Framework has been established in full compliance with the Social Bond Principles (SBP) published by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). It has been independently evaluated by an external evaluator, Sustainalytics.\n\nFollowing today's announcement, the Commission is moving one step closer towards the issuance of the first SURE bonds. The first transaction will follow in the second half of October.\n\nBackground\n\nSo far, 16 Member States will receive financial support under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. Financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States. The Commission has today presented a proposal to the Council for a decision to grant \u20ac504 million in financial support to Hungary under the SURE instrument. Including Hungary, the Commission has now proposed a total of \u20ac87.8 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States.\n\nThese loans will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the pandemic, in particular for the self-employed. SURE could also finance some health-related measures, in particular at the work place, used to ensure a safe return to normal economic activity.\n\nMember States can still submit formal requests for support under SURE, which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion to help protect jobs and workers affected by the pandemic.\n\nFor more information\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\nProposal for a Council Implementing Decision for Hungary\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["European Commission to issue EU SURE bonds of up to \u20ac100 billion as social bonds"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1808\/IP_20_1808_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Claire JOAWN","phone":"+32 2 295 68 59","email":"claire.joawn@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Enda MCNAMARA","phone":"+32 2 296 49 76","email":"Enda.Mcnamara@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","economic affairs","budget and human resources","economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"September 2020","date":"11 September","title":"EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to Peru and EUR 30.5 million for Latin America and the Caribbean","abstract":"<p>As part of the EU's global coronavirus response, an EU humanitarian air bridge operation with three flights to Lima, Peru delivered more than 4 tonnes of life-saving materials to humanitarian organisations active in the country.

At the same time, the EU has announced \u20ac30.5 million in humanitarian assistance to support the most vulnerable in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2020.\n\n\"At this critical time, the EU continues to support those in need in Peru and in the whole of Latin America. The coronavirus pandemic places huge logistical pressure on the humanitarian community, while the needs remain high in critical areas. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of the EU, Spain and the Peruvian authorities, vital assistance was delivered to help the people of Peru tackle this pandemic\u201d said Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d.\n\nOf the funding announced today, \u20ac15.5 million are for disaster preparedness of vulnerable communities across Latin America and the Caribbean and to ensure they are ready to face the multiple natural hazards hitting the region. The remaining \u20ac15 million will continue supporting humanitarian projects in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.\n\nEU funding will boost local capacities to respond to emergencies, implement Early Warning Systems and increase the overall access to safe water sanitation and hygiene. In addition, these funds will also be used to guarantee food assistance to populations stricken by natural disasters and severe droughts, and provide protection to communities in Central America where at least 487,000 people are internally displaced as a consequence of organised violence.\n\nSince 1994, the European Union has allocated over \u20ac1.4 billion in humanitarian assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on the populations most affected by natural disasters, violence and on preparing communities for future hazards. Of this funding, \u20ac605 million have been directed to humanitarian support towards South America, including \u20ac265 for Colombia and \u20ac109 for Venezuela.\n\nBackground \n\nSouth America is exposed to multiple, often combined, natural hazards. Climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of these weather-related disasters and has been hampering the resilience of the most vulnerable communities. Moreover, the region is confronted with one of the largest population displacement movements of its history: more than 5.2 million Venezuelans have sought refuge in neighbouring South American countries.\n\nThe coronavirus hit large parts of the continent with pre-existing vulnerabilities such as lack of access to basic services, vulnerable livelihoods and poor sanitary conditions. Health facilities and funerary services have become quickly overwhelmed, particularly in Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil and the Pacific coast of Colombia. The pandemic has particularly impacted the tri-border area of the Amazon between Brazil, Colombia and Peru and threatens to infect remote indigenous communities in the rainforest.\n\nFor More Information \n\nFactsheet: EU Humanitarian Air Bridge\n\nFactsheet: EU Humanitarian in South America\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus global response: EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to Peru and \u20ac30.5 million for Latin America and the Caribbean"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1590\/IP_20_1590_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/echo\/what\/humanitarian-aid\/humanitarian-air-bridge_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/echo\/where\/latin-america-caribbean\/south-america_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Measures to prevent social hardship","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"November 2020","date":"17 November","title":"Commission approves contract with CureVac to ensure access to a potential vaccine","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2136\">approved a fifth contract with the European pharmaceutical company CureVac<\/a>, which provides for the initial purchase of 225 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to request up to a further 180 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2136"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2136"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2136","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"17 November 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission approved a fifth contract with the European pharmaceutical company CureVac, which provides for the initial purchase of 225 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to request up to a further 180 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19.\n\nToday's contract with CureVac enlarges the already broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the contracts signed with AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and BioNtech-Pfizer, and the successful exploratory talks with Moderna. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective. Member States can also decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u00a0\u201cA few days after our contract with BioNTech and Pfizer, I am delighted to announce a new agreement with a promising European company. The Commission has secured to date at least 1.2 billion doses and fulfils its commitment to ensuring equitable access to safe, effective and affordable vaccines not only for EU citizens but also for the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. Most of these vaccine candidates are in an advanced phase of clinical trials, hopefully authorisation will confirm these positive results, after which they will be quickly deployed and help us in overcoming the pandemic.\u201d\n\nStella\u00a0Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said:\u00a0\u201cWith growing numbers of COVID patients across the EU, a safe and effective vaccine is more crucial than ever in putting behind us the pandemic. With this fifth vaccine advance purchase agreement, we are further expanding the possibilities that EU citizens and our economies can soon safely return to normality. It is yet another milestone in our EU Vaccines Strategy, and evidence of the benefits of working together in a genuine European Health Union.\u201d\n\nCureVac, a European company based in Germany, signed a \u20ac75 million loan agreement with the European Investment Bank on 6 July for the development and large-scale production of vaccines, including CureVac's vaccine candidate against COVID-19. CureVac is pioneering the development of a completely new class of vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA), transported into cells by lipid nanoparticles. The vaccine platform has been developed over the last decade. The basic principle is the use of this molecule as a data carrier for information, with the help of which the body itself can produce its own active substances to combat various diseases.\n\nThe Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply the whole of the EU.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.\n\nOnce vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response. On 12 November, the European Union announced the contribution of an additional \u20ac100 million in grant funding to support the COVAX Facility.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nOverview of the Commission's Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission approves contract with CureVac to ensure access to a potential vaccine"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2136\/IP_20_2136_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"8 April","title":"Supporting exit strategies through mobile data apps","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_626\">recommended steps and measures<\/a> to develop a common EU approach for the use of mobile applications in response to the pandemic.

Digital tools can play an important role in the gradual lifting of containment measure, when the time will be ripe for that, if they are compliant with EU rules and well coordinated. The Recommendation sets out a process towards the adoption with the Member States of a toolbox, focusing on two dimensions: \n\n\ta pan-European coordinated approach for the use of mobile applications for empowering citizens to take effective and more targeted social distancing measures and for warning, preventing and contact tracing; and\n\ta common approach for modelling and predicting the evolution of the virus through anonymised and aggregated mobile location data. \n\n\nThe Recommendation sets out key principles for the use of these apps and data as regards data security and the respect of EU fundamental rights such as privacy and data protection.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton said: \u201cDigital technologies, mobile applications and mobility data have enormous potential to help understand how the virus spreads and to respond effectively. With this Recommendation, we put in motion a European coordinated approach for the use of such apps and data, without compromising on our EU privacy and data protection rules, and avoiding the fragmentation of the internal market. Europe is stronger when it acts united.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, added: \u201cWe all must work together now to get through this unprecedented crisis. The Commission is supporting the Member States in their efforts to fight the virus and we will continue to do so when it comes to an exit strategy and to recovery. In all this, we will continue to ensure full respect of Europeans' fundamental rights. Europe's data protection rules are the strongest in the world and they are fit also for this crisis, providing for exceptions and flexibility. We work closely with data protection authorities and will come forward with guidance on the privacy implications soon.\u201d\n\nA common coordinated approach for the use of tracing apps\n\nSince the outbreak of the pandemic, the Commission has strongly supported Member States in their efforts to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. Commission services have been looking into the effectiveness of apps solutions to address the crisis as well as their impact on data protection. Centrepiece of today's Recommendation is the proposal for a joint toolbox towards a common coordinated approach for the use of smartphone apps that fully respect EU data protection standards.It will consist of:\n\n\tspecifications to ensure the effectiveness of mobile information, warning and tracing applications from a medical and technical point of view;\n\tmeasures to avoid proliferation of incompatible applications, support requirements for interoperability and promotion of common solutions;\n\tgovernance mechanisms to be applied by public health authorities and in cooperation with the European Centre for Disease Control;\n\tthe identification of good practices and mechanisms for exchange of information on the functioning of the applications; and\n\tsharing data with relevant epidemiological public bodies, including aggregated data to ECDC.\n\n\nTo support Member States, the Commission will provide guidance including on data protection and privacy implications. The Commission is in close contact with the European Data Protection Board for an overview of the processing of personal data at national level in the context of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nA common approach for predicting and modelling the spread\n\nThe toolbox will also focus on developing a common approach for modelling and predicting the evolution of the virus through anonymous and aggregated mobile location data. The aim is to analyse mobility patterns including the impact of confinement measures on the intensity of contacts, and hence the risks of contamination. This will be an important and proportionate input for tools modelling the spread of the virus, and provide insights for the development of strategies for opening up societies again.\n\nThe Commission already started the discussion with mobile phone operators on 23 March 2020 with the aim to cover all Member States. The data will be fully anonymised and transmitted to the Joint Research Centre (JRC) for processing and modelling. It will not be shared with third parties and only be stored as long as the crisis is ongoing.\n\nNext steps\n\nMember States, together with the Commission, shall develop a toolbox towards a pan-European approach for mobile applications in association with the European Data Protection Board by 15 April 2020. To support Member States, the Commission will provide guidance including on data protection and privacy implications.Member States should report on the actions they have taken by 31 May 2020, and make the measures accessible to other Member States and the Commission for peer review. The Commission will assess the progress made and publish periodic reports starting in June 2020 and throughout the crisis, recommending action and\/or the phasing out of measures that are no longer necessary.\n\nFor more information\n\nCommission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis\n\nCommission Coronavirus response page\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission adopts Recommendation to support exit strategies through mobile data and apps"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_626\/IP_20_626_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Johannes BAHRKE","phone":"+32 2 295 86 15","email":"johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Charles MANOURY","phone":"+32 2 291 33 91","email":"charles.manoury@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marietta GRAMMENOU","phone":"+32 2 298 35 83","email":"marietta.grammenou@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["digital economy","research and innovation"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"22 April","title":"Exceptional measures to support the agri-food sector","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_722\">Additional exceptional measures<\/a> were proposed to further support agricultural and food markets most affected.\u00a0 Among others, these are measures for private storage aid in the dairy and meat sectors, the authorisation of self-organisation market measures by operators in hard hit sectors and flexibility in fruits and vegetables, wine and some other market support programmes.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_722"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_722"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_722","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"22 April 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission is taking swift action and proposes additional exceptional measures to further support agricultural and food markets most affected. The EU agri-food sector is showing resilience in these unprecedented times, following the outbreak of the coronavirus. Still, some markets have been hit hard by the consequences of this public health crisis.\n\nToday's package includes measures for private storage aid (PSA) in the dairy and meat sectors, the authorisation of self-organisation market measures by operators in hard hit sectors and flexibility in fruits and vegetables, wine and some other market support programmes.\n\nAgriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski said: \u201dThe consequences of the coronavirus crisis are increasingly being felt in the agri-food sector and this is why we have decided to take swift action, in addition to the measures already taken since the outbreak of the crisis. The measures proposed are, in the present state of market developments, intended to send a signal aimed at stabilising markets and are considered to be the most appropriate for providing stability to future prices and production and thus stable food supplies and food security. Today we are announcing a new and exceptional package of measures to support the most affected agri-food sectors by addressing already observed disturbances as well as future risks. I am confident that these measures will relieve markets, and show concrete results rapidly.\u201d\n\nExceptional measures announced as a further response to the Coronavirus crisis include:\n\n\tPrivate storage aid: the Commission proposes to grant private storage aid for dairy (skimmed milk powder, butter, cheese) and meat (beef, sheep and goat meat) products. This scheme will allow the temporary withdrawal of products from the market for a minimum of 2 to 3 months, and a maximum period of 5 to 6 months. This measure will lead to a decrease of available supply on the market and rebalance the market on the long-term.\n\tFlexibility for market support programmes: the Commission will introduce flexibility in the implementation of market support programmes for wine, fruits and vegetables, olive oil, apiculture and the EU's school scheme (milk, fruits and vegetables). This will allow the reorientation of funding priorities towards crisis management measures for all the sectors.\n\tExceptional derogation from EU competition rules: applicable to the milk, flowers and potatoes sectors, the Commission will authorise the derogation from certain competition rules under Article 222 of the Common Markets Organisation Regulation, that allows operators to adopt self-organisation market measures. Concretely, these sectors will be allowed to collectively take measures to stabilise the market. For example, the milk sector will be allowed to collectively plan milk production and the flower and potatoes sector will be allowed to withdraw products from the market. Storage by private operators will also be allowed. Such agreements and decisions would only be valid for a period of maximum six months. Consumer price movements will be monitored closely to avoid adverse effects.\n\n\nThe Commission aims to have these measures adopted by the end of April. Beforehand Member States will need to be consulted, and vote on these measures. They are therefore subject to change. The full detail of these proposals will be unveiled at the time of their final adoption.\n\nThe package announced today follows a comprehensive package of other measures adopted early on by the Commission to support the agri-food sector in the current crisis, such as increased amounts for state aid, higher advanced payments, and extended deadlines to submit payment requests.

The Netherlands and Austria thus become the first EU countries to make use of REACT-EU.\n\nCommissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira said: \u201cThe resources under REACT-EU are of crucial importance for the recovery of the economy. I call on Member States to complete their internal procedures for the approval of the Own Resources Decision so that we can start borrowing. Meanwhile, we are working fast forward to approve the programming decisions for this funding. I encourage all Member States to move as quickly as possible with their submissions so that additional funding can start flowing for a green, digital and cohesive recovery.\u201d\n\nIn the Netherlands, the three amendments increase the EU co-financing rate and facilitate investments in the green and digital transition contributing to the resilience of the regional economy in North, East and South Netherlands. This is in accordance with the REACT-EU objectives and with the 2020 country specific recommendations.\n\n\tIn North Netherlands, the programme will support future-oriented investments in innovation, making companies more resilient and innovative. The investments will contribute to the societal transitions related to a circular economy, renewable energy, digitalisation and health.\n\tIn East Netherlands, the programme will support further development and the market introduction of innovative technologies and processes, as well as investments that reinforce the innovation eco-system. Areas for investment for the green transition will include, for example, sustainable energy, the circular economy and the sustainable use of materials. The programme will also support digitalisation in innovation projects, including in the health sector.\n\tIn South Netherlands, the programme will support innovation projects that contribute to a green, digital and robust recovery of the regional economy. The investments aim at bringing innovations to the market within five societal transitions: energy, raw materials, climate, agriculture and food, and health transition.\n\n\nIn Austria, the amendment of the ERDF Operational Programme for Growth and Jobs supports research and innovation capacities, provides investment support for enterprises (in which innovative, green and digital projects will have a high share), and sustains increasing the energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThese resources \u2013 part of NextGenerationEU \u2013 continue and extend the crisis response and repair measures delivered through the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative packages, acting as a bridge to the long-term recovery plan.

Veklury was the first medicine authorised at EU level for treatment of COVID-19. As from early August onwards, and in order to meet immediate needs, batches of Veklury will be made available to Member States and the UK, with the coordination and support of the Commission.\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cIn recent weeks, the Commission has been working tirelessly with Gilead to reach an agreement to ensure that stocks of the first treatment authorised against COVID-19 are delivered to the EU. A contract has been signed yesterday, less than a month after the authorisation of Remdesivir, which will allow the delivery of treatments from early August for thousands of patients. The Commission is leaving no stone unturned in its efforts to secure access to safe and efficient treatments, and is supporting the development of vaccines against coronavirus. Yesterday's agreement is another important step forward in our fight to overcome this disease\u201d.\n\nThe Commission's Emergency Support Instrument will finance the contract, worth a total of \u20ac63 million. This will ensure the treatment of approximately 30,000 patients presenting severe COVID-19 symptoms. This will help to cover the current needs over the next few months, while ensuring a fair distribution at EU level, based on an allocation key, taking into account the advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nThe Commission is now also preparing a joint procurement for further supplies of the medicine, expected to cover additional needs and supplies as from October onwards.\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nOn 3 July, Remdesivir became the first treatment to be authorised for a conditional marketing authorisation. This authorisation facilitates early access to medicines in public health emergency situations, such as the current pandemic.\n\nRemdesivir is a treatment against COVID-19 for adults and adolescents as from age 12 with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen. The application for the marketing authorisation was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 8 June. EMA's recommendation was endorsed by the Member States through the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use.\n\nWhile authorised in the EU, the medicine continues to be monitored to ensure safety. Gilead has also been requested to submit the final reports of the Remdesivir studies to the EMA by December 2020 as part of the conditions to be fulfilled to move from a conditional marketing authorisation to a full marketing authorisation. Further data on the effectiveness and safety of the medicine is expected to be submitted by August 2020 in order to finalise this process.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU legislation on medicinal products\n\nEMA and COVID-19 treatments\n\n","detail_title":["European Commission secures EU access to Remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1416\/IP_20_1416_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"29 April","title":"Western Balkans: EU reinforces support to address COVID-19 crisis","abstract":"<p>The European Commission announced over EUR 3.3 billion of EU financial support mobilised jointly with the European Investment Bank to the benefit of the Western Balkans' citizens. <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_777\">This package<\/a> aims to address the immediate health and resulting humanitarian needs of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as help with the social and economic recovery.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_777"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_777"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_777","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"29 April 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission is announcing over \u20ac3.3 billion of EU financial support mobilised jointly with the European Investment Bank to the benefit of the Western Balkans' citizens. This package aims to address the immediate health and resulting humanitarian needs of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as help with the social and economic recovery.\n\nIn addition to the reinforced support, the Commission is in its contribution ahead of the EU-Western Balkans' leaders meeting of 6 May 2020 also outlining the broad parameters of longer-term support to be presented later this year in the form of an Economic and Investment Plan for the region.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cWe have a special responsibility to assist in this pandemic our partners in the Western Balkans, as their future clearly lies in European Union. The EU is mobilising a substantial financial package, confirming the strong solidarity. Together we will overcome this crisis and recover. And beyond that, we will continue to support the region, including with the reforms needed on their EU path, as the recovery will only work effectively if the countries keep delivering on their commitments.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, commented: \u201cThe European Union acted quickly and comprehensively to support the Western Balkans in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, with unparalleled financial assistance as well as access to many of the EU's initiatives. And our work will continue as we prepare an Economic and Investment Plan for the region, to tackle the hard socio-economic impact of the crisis, to modernise the economies in the region, support the reforms and start closing the development gap, thus bringing concrete benefits to the people faster.\u201d \n\nEU support to the Western Balkans in tackling the coronavirus \n\nThe EU financial support package of more than \u20ac3.3 billion includes reallocations from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance of \u20ac38 million of immediate support for the health sector, in particular through delivering essential supplies to save lives, such as personal protective equipment, masks and ventilators; \u20ac389 million to address social and economic recovery needs and a \u20ac455 million economic reactivation package, in close cooperation with the International Financial Institutions. It also includes a proposal for \u20ac750 million of Macro-Financial Assistance and a \u20ac1.7 billion package of assistance from the European Investment Bank.\n\nThe EU is also providing immediate humanitarian assistance to vulnerable refugees and migrants amounting to \u20ac4.5 million and \u20ac8 million to address pressing needs in migrant camps across the region.\n\nAs a result of the coronavirus outbreak, the Western Balkans have also activated the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) and have already started to receive assistance through delivery of equipment and repatriation of citizens from the UCPM Member States and Participating States. Furthermore, given their European perspective, the EU is treating the Western Balkans as privileged partners by granting them access to many initiatives and instruments reserved for EU Member States. This includes for instance joint procurement of medical equipment, exempting the region from the EU's export authorisation scheme for personal protective equipment, ensuring the fast flow of essential goods across land borders through \u201cgreen lanes\u201d, and the EU supply of testing material to ensure the correct functioning of coronavirus tests in the Western Balkans. The region is also associated to the work of relevant health bodies.\n\nLooking ahead - an economic and investment plan for recovery \n\nThe Western Balkans will require continued support to address the impact of the pandemic once the immediate crisis is over. The European Commission will later in the year come forward with an Economic and Investment Plan for the region, to spur the long-term recovery, boost economic growth and support reforms required to move forward on the EU path.\n\nIt will also include a substantial investment package for the region. For the 2021-2027 period, the Commission has proposed a total envelope for the Pre-Accession Instrument III of \u20ac14.5 billion, of which the lion's share is destined for the Western Balkans. The Commission foresees a doubling in the provision of grants through the Western Balkans Investment Framework and substantially increasing the financial guarantees to support public and private investment in the region through a dedicated Guarantee Instrument under the Western Balkans Investment Framework.\n\nThe Green transition and the Digital transformation will play a central role in relaunching and modernising the economies of the Western Balkans. Investing in clean and digital technologies and capacities, together with a circular economy, will help create jobs and growth. Support will also be provided to improve the competitiveness of the economies of the Western Balkans, to better connect them within the region and with the EU, and to help make the Western Balkans fit for the digital age. A strong focus will be put on the transport and energy links, which are crucial for the economic development of the region and the EU alike.\n\nTackling fundamental reforms \n\nThe recovery from the current crisis will only work if the partners keep delivering on their reform commitments and produce tangible results in their implementation. This is also key to realising their European perspective. In addition to continued economic reforms, this requires a stronger focus on the rule of law, the functioning of democratic institutions and public administration.\n\nBackground\n\nEU heads of State and Government and those of the Western Balkans will gather on 6 May 2020 for an EU-Western Balkans' leaders meeting to tackle common challenges. Initially foreseen as a summit in Zagreb, the meeting will due to the COVID-19 pandemic now take place via videoconference. Today proposals are the Commission's contribution ahead of this meeting.\n\nThe EU's global response to the coronavirus pandemic follows a \u2018Team Europe' approach; combining resources from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Together with our partners, we are making sure that the substantial EU funding already allocated to the Western Balkans is targeted to help them address the impact of the pandemic.In parallel, some EU Member States are also providing bilateral support, whether financial or donations of supplies.\n\nFor More Information\n\nLink to Communication\n\nFactsheet on EU response to the coronavirus pandemic in the Western Balkans\n\nFactsheet EU Western-Balkans relations\n\nFactographs for partners: \n\nAlbania\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nKosovo\n\nMontenegro\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nSerbia\n\n","detail_title":["Western Balkans' leaders meeting: EU reinforces support to address COVID-19 crisis and outlines proposal for post-pandemic recovery"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_777\/IP_20_777_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":[],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"European Funds|National funds"},{"month_name":"November 2020","date":"11 November","title":"Building a European Health Union","abstract":"<p>The European Commission took the first steps towards building the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/priorities-2019-2024\/promoting-our-european-way-life\/european-health-union_en\">European Health Union<\/a>. \u00a0Drawing lessons from the current crisis, new proposals should ensure stronger preparedness and response during the current and future health crises.

This is following the positive steps regarding the conclusion of exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK announced on 31 July and with Johnson & Johnson on 13 August. Once the vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission now has agreed the basis for a contractual framework for the purchase of 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option to purchase 100 million more, on behalf of EU Member States. The Commission continues discussing similar agreements with other vaccine manufacturers.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \u201cThe European Commission's intense negotiations continue to achieve results. Today's agreement is the first cornerstone in implementing the European Commission's Vaccines Strategy. This strategy will enable us to provide future vaccines to Europeans, as well as our partners elsewhere in the world.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cToday, after weeks of negotiations, we have the first EU advance purchase agreement for a vaccine candidate. I would like to thank AstraZeneca for its constructive engagement on this important agreement for our citizens. We will continue to work tirelessly to bring more candidates into a broad EU vaccines portfolio. A safe and effective vaccine remains the surest exit strategy to protect our citizens and the rest of the world from the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe agreement approved today will be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.\n\nAstraZeneca's vaccine candidate is already in large-scale Phase II\/III Clinical Trials after promising results in Phase I\/II concerning safety and immunogenicity.\n\nThe decision to support the vaccine proposed by AstraZeneca is based on a sound scientific approach and the technology used (a non-replicative recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccine ChAdOx1), speed at delivery at scale, cost, risk sharing, liability and the production capacity able to supply the whole of the EU, among others.\n\nThe regulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will use existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. This includes an accelerated procedure for authorisation and flexibility in relation to labelling and packaging.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission would finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided would be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreement will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission reaches first agreement on a potential vaccine"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1438\/IP_20_1438_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Vivian LOONELA","phone":"+32 2 296 67 12","email":"vivian.loonela@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["coordinating spokesperson for the European Green Deal","public health","regional policy","environment","structural reforms","maritime affairs and fisheries"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"24 April","title":"Coronavirus Global Response: EU launches pledging effort","abstract":"<p>The EU joined forces with global partners to kick-start a pledging effort \u2013 the <a href=\"https:\/\/europa.eu\/global-response\/\">Coronavirus Global Response<\/a> \u2013 starting on 4 May 2020.

While we do not know today which vaccine will work best in the end, Europe is investing in a diversified portfolio of promising vaccines, based on various types of technologies. This increases our chances to obtain rapidly an effective remedy against the virus. A vaccine would be a truly global good. We are committed to help secure access also for more vulnerable countries to find their way out of this crisis.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cA safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is the surest exit strategy from the crisis. For that reason, we have been negotiating a united EU approach to secure doses of promising vaccine candidates in recent weeks. Today's announcement of the conclusion of exploratory talks with\u00a0Sanofi-GSK is the first important step in this direction, to provide equal access to the vaccine for our citizens.\u201d\n\nThe exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.\n\nThis is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0\n\nThe Commission is also ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission would finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided would be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen.\n\nSanofi-GSK's vaccine candidate is planning to seek marketing authorisation from EMA in June 2021, following Phase III clinical trials yielding the induction of a promising immune response.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Updated on 31\/07\/2020 at 19:00\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission concludes talks to secure future coronavirus vaccine for Europeans"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1439\/IP_20_1439_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Measures to prevent social hardship","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"22 April","title":"Macro-financial assistance package to support ten neighbouring countries","abstract":"<p>The Commission proposed a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_716\">macro-financial assistance package<\/a> worth EUR 3 billion for ten enlargement and neighbourhood partners to help them limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.

The proposal comes on top of the \u2018Team Europe' strategy, the EU's robust and targeted response to support partner countries' efforts in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. It represents an important demonstration of the EU's solidarity with these countries at a time of unprecedented crisis.\n\nThe proposal, following a preliminary assessment of financing needs, provides for the MFA funds to be distributed as follows: the Republic of Albania (\u20ac180 million), Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u20ac250 million), Georgia (\u20ac150 million), the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (\u20ac200 million), Kosovo (\u20ac100 million), the Republic of Moldova (\u20ac100 million), Montenegro (\u20ac60 million), the Republic of North Macedonia (\u20ac160 million), the Republic of Tunisia (\u20ac600 million) and Ukraine (\u20ac1.2 billion).\n\nValdis\u00a0Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People said: \u201cSupporting our neighbours is essential during this time of crisis to keep the entire region stable. As part of the EU's global response to the coronavirus pandemic, we need to help our neighbouring countries to cushion the worst of its economic impact. These \u2018crisis MFA programmes' will assist 10 countries in ensuring macro-economic stability and protecting their people and companies during the crisis.\u201d\n\nPaolo\u00a0Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cEuropean solidarity must not stop at the borders of our Union. Because in this global crisis, we stand or fall together. Today the European Commission is taking a decisive step to help ten of our neighbours in their fight against the Coronavirus. I call on the European Parliament and the Council to swiftly agree this important package.\u201d\n\nThe MFA funds will be made available for 12 months in the form of loans on highly favourable terms to help these countries cover their immediate, urgent financing needs. Together with the International Monetary Fund's support, the funds can contribute to enhancing macroeconomic stability and creating space to allow resources to be allocated towards protecting citizens and mitigating the coronavirus pandemic's negative socio-economic consequences. This instrument also remains available for other eligible countries experiencing balance-of-payments difficulties.\n\nThe Commission's proposal is subject to adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Given the urgent need for this support, the Commission counts on the cooperation of the co-legislators to ensure swift adoption of the proposal.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the proposal, the Commission stands ready to disburse the first instalment as swiftly as possible after the adoption of the MFA decision and upon the agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding with each partner country. The second instalment could be disbursed in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in the first half of 2021, provided that the policy measures attached to it have been implemented in a timely manner.\n\nBackground\n\nTeam Europe\n\nThe EU's response follows a \u2018Team Europe' approach, aimed at saving lives by providing quick and targeted support to our partners to face this pandemic. It combines resources from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to support partner countries and address their short-term financing needs, as well as the longer-term structural impacts on societies and the economy. The overall figure of the \u2018Team Europe' package reaches more than \u20ac20 billion. The first Team Europe packages are already being implemented in the EU's immediate neighbourhood: the Western Balkans, in the East and to the South.\n\nThe EU, as global actor and major contributor to the international development system, promotes a coordinated multilateral response, in partnership with the United Nations, International Financial Institutions, as well as the G7 and the G20.\n\nMacro-Financial Assistance\n\nMFA is part of the EU's wider engagement with neighbouring and enlargement countries and is intended as an exceptional EU crisis response instrument. It is available to enlargement and EU neighbourhood countries experiencing severe balance-of-payments problems with policy conditionality. To benefit from an MFA, countries should meet certain political pre-conditions in terms of respect of democratic principles, human rights and rule of law. They should also benefit from an IMF financial assistance programme. In the implementation of the assistance, the Commission will ensure consistency with recent and ongoing MFA operations.\n\nIn addition to MFA, the EU supports the Neighbourhood and Western Balkans through several other instruments, including humanitarian aid, budget support, thematic programmes, technical assistance, blending facilities and guarantees from the European Fund for Sustainable Development to support investment in sectors most affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFor more information\n\nCommission proposal for \u20ac3 billion macro-financial assistance package\n\nCoronavirus: EU global response to fight the pandemic\n\nMacro-Financial Assistance\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Ukraine\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Moldova\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Georgia\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Tunisia\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Jordan\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission proposes \u20ac3 billion macro-financial assistance package to support ten neighbouring countries"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_716\/IP_20_716_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Enda MCNAMARA","phone":"+32 2 296 49 76","email":"Enda.Mcnamara@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["economic affairs","economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"23 April","title":"Medical Devices Regulation","abstract":"<p>The Commission<a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_718\"> welcomed<\/a> the adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the proposal on the date of application of the Medical Devices Regulation.

This will allow all key players - Member States, health institutions and economic operators to give priority to the fight against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, forming a key position in the timing of the lifting of confinement measures as Member States return to the road of recovery.\n\nThe adopted amendment takes into consideration the need for an increased availability of vitally important medical devices across the EU, and at the same time continues to guarantee patient health and safety until the new legislation becomes applicable.\n\nVice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \u201cI welcome the adoption in record time by the European Parliament and the Council of the proposal to postpone by one year the date of application of the Medical Devices Regulation. We are determined to have our medical industries pouring all their energy into what we need them to be doing: helping fight the pandemic. The European Union will do whatever it takes to support our health systems in their hour of need.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cYesterday's adoption will allow us all, in this time of crisis, to maintain our focus on the most critical issues and to ensure the continued availability of vitally important medical devices. This is clear proof of our ongoing determination to tackle the pandemic through all possible means, while always maintaining the safety of patients as our utmost objective. I thank the Parliament and Council for the record time approval, cooperation and efficient handling of this urgent proposal.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus crisis increases demand for certain vital medical devices. It is therefore important to avoid any further difficulties or risks of potential shortages or delays in the availability of such devices that could be caused by the limited capacity of authorities or conformity assessment bodies related to the implementation of the Medical Devices Regulation.\n\nThe adopted amendment therefore postpones the application of the Medical Devices Regulation by one year - until 26 May 2021. The currently applicable rules will continue to guarantee patient health and safety.\n\nBackground \n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the public health crisis resulting from it is putting Member States, together with national authorities, health institutions and economic operators, under extreme pressure. These circumstances demand substantial additional resources, and the need for an increased availability of vitally important medical devices has considerably increased. At the time of adoption of the Medical Devices Regulation none of the above could have been foreseen.\n\nThe present situation strongly impacts upon the different areas covered by the Medical Devices Regulation. It is therefore highly probable that it would not have been possible for Member States, health institutions, economic operators and other relevant parties to implement and apply the Regulation from its foreseen date of application on 26 May 2020.\n\nIn order to ensure an effective regulatory framework for medical devices, the present amendment also postpones the date of repeal of the Directive on active implantable medical devices and the Directive on medical devices by one year.\n\nThe present adoption will not have impact on the date of application of the In Vitro Diagnostics Medical Devices Regulation, which becomes applicable from 26 May 2022.\n\nThe amendment of the Medical Devices Regulation complements other important measures in the area of medical devices, which the Commission continues to adopt in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Commission adopted the proposal on 3 April, and this was followed by the support of the European Parliament on 17 April. As a final step,\u00a0yesterday the Council has voted to adopt the proposal and it will enter into force upon publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nUseful links\n\nMedical devices\n\nDedicated Commission webpage on the EU's response to the COVID-19 outbreak\n\n","detail_title":["Medical Devices Regulation: Commission welcomes Council support to prioritise the fight against coronavirus"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_718\/IP_20_718_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"6 April","title":"Unlocking funds for 100,000 small and medium-sized businesses","abstract":"<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_569\">European Commission has unlocked \u20ac1 billion<\/a> from the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (EIF).

This will allow the EIF to issue special guarantees to incentivise banks and other lenders to provide liquidity to at least 100,000 European SMEs and small mid-cap companies hit by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, for an estimated available financing of \u20ac8 billion. Today's announcement fulfils the commitment in the Commission Communication of 13 March to bring immediate relief to hard-hit SMEs, with money able to flow already in April. It is part of the package of measures announced by the EIB Group on 16 March designed to rapidly mobilise support for Europe's SMEs and mid-caps.\n\nOne of the immediate economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic is the sudden lack of liquidity affecting small and medium-sized businesses. These companies are typically the most affected in a crisis, and it is essential to support them with adequate liquidity so they can survive the crisis. However, in a situation of liquidity crunch banks are not incentivised to lend SMEs money due to the sudden increase in perceived risk. That is why EU guarantees supporting these loans are necessary. As of today, the EIF is offering to the market dedicated EFSI-backed guarantees to contain the impact of the pandemic on small and medium sized enterprises and small mid-cap companies.\n\nEuropean Commission Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People, Valdis Dombrovskis, said: \u201cAcross Europe, our businesses are struggling. The EU is responding quickly to help cushion the blow and to help small and medium-sized companies, which are especially vulnerable. Today, the Commission and the European Investment Fund are making available \u20ac8 billion in financing, bringing immediate cash relief to SMEs in Europe affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Money will be flowing already this month via local banks and lenders to help those most hard-hit by the crisis.\u201d\n\nEIF Chief Executive, Alain Godard said: \u201cIn times of unprecedented crisis it is essential that SMEs receive the support they need. The EIF is working intensively to ensure a swift and adequate response to the COVID-19 virus outbreak and we are pleased to be launching this new \u20ac8 billion initiative with the Commission today. While this is an important first step, the EIB Group will continue to work on finding additional solutions to quickly meet the financing needs of entrepreneurs across Europe.\u201d\n\nThe \u20ac1 billion unlocked from the EFSI under the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility and the InnovFin SME Guarantee under Horizon 2020 allows the EIF to provide guarantees worth \u20ac2.2 billion to financial intermediaries, unlocking \u20ac8 billion in available financing. The guarantees will be offered through the EIF to the market, via a call for expressions of interest\u00a0issued today to several hundred financial intermediaries, comprising banks and alternative lenders. Key features of these guarantees will be:\n\n\tSimplified and quicker access to the EIF guarantee\n\tA higher risk cover \u2013 up to 80% of potential losses on individual loans (as opposed to the standard 50%);\n\tFocus on working capital loans across the EU;\n\tAllowing for more flexible terms, including postponement, rescheduling or payment holidays\n\n\nThe new features will be accessible to new as well as existing financial intermediaries already working with EIF, who will extend special conditions to more than a hundred thousand companies benefitting from guarantees under the COSME LGF and the InnovFin SMEG programmes.\n\nNext steps\n\nFollowing today's call for expression of interest, financial intermediaries with existing EIF agreements under these COSME and InnovFin programmes will be able to access the new guarantees immediately upon their request. Other financial intermediaries can access the guarantees following a swift application process. In that way new money can already start flowing to hard-hit businesses in April. SMEs will be able to apply directly to their local banks and lenders participating in the scheme, which will be listed on www.access2finance.eu.\n\nThe Commission and the EIB Group will continue to work on additional measures and will use all the tools at their disposal to help contain the coronavirus pandemic and address its economic consequences.\n\nBackground\n\nTo unlock the \u20ac1 billion from the EU budget, the Commission and the EIB Group have made a series of amendments to their specific agreements.\n\nThe European Investment Fund (EIF) is part of the European Investment Bank group. Its central mission is to support Europe's micro, small and medium-sized businesses by helping them to access finance. EIF designs and develops both venture and growth capital, guarantees and microfinance instruments which specifically target this market segment. In this role, EIF fosters EU objectives in support of innovation, research and development, entrepreneurship, growth and employment.\n\nCOSME\u00a0is the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) running from 2014 to 2020 with a total budget of \u20ac2.3 billion. At least 60% of the programme is devoted to improving access to finance for SMEs in Europe, with two financial instruments. The COSME Loan Guarantee Facility supports guarantees and counter-guarantees to financial institutions to help them provide more loans and lease finance to SMEs. COSME Equity Facility for Growth helps provide risk capital to SMEs mainly in the expansion and growth stages.\n\nHorizon 2020 \u00a0is the EU programme for Research and Innovation running from 2014 to 2020 with a total budget of \u20ac77 billion. Under Horizon 2020, InnovFin \u2013 the EU Finance for Innovators \u2013 financial instruments aim to facilitate and accelerate access to finance for innovative businesses across Europe. In particular, the InnovFin SME Guarantee (SMEG) Facility provides guarantees and counter-guarantees on debt financing of between \u20ac25,000 and \u20ac7.5 million to improve access to finance for innovative SMEs and Midcaps. Under InnovFin SMEG, a facility managed by the EIF, financial intermediaries \u2013 banks and other financial institutions \u2013 are guaranteed against a proportion of their losses incurred on the debt financing covered under the facility.\n\nThe European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is the financing pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe, which was launched in November 2014 to reverse the downward trend in investment levels and put Europe on the path to economic recovery. Its innovative approach based on the use of an EU budget guarantee provided to the EIB Group enables substantial public and private sector funds to be mobilised for investment into strategic sectors of the European economy. The Investment Plan for Europe has already generated more than \u20ac460\u00a0billion of investment and supported 1.1 million start-ups and SMEs across Europe.

The new support is particularly relevant in the context of the current coronavirus pandemic and will provide additional help for the most vulnerable persons in the region and assist hosting countries to better face public health challenges, amongst others.\n\nHigh Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\/Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell said: \u201cIn the tenth year of the Syrian crisis which has displaced half of the country's population, the European Union continues to stand by the Syrian refugees and neighbouring countries hosting them. Not only to face the most immediate challenges, including the coronavirus pandemic, but also to build up their future.\u00a0The EU will continue to support UN efforts for a comprehensive political solution to the Syrian conflict, mobilise necessary financial support for Syria and neighbouring countries, as well as provide a unique platform for dialogue with civil society. In this context, the EU will this year host its fourth Brussels Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi commented: \u201cThe European Union is stepping up its assistance to countries hosting Syrian refugees, in particular Jordan and Lebanon but also others, as a signal of solidarity with the most vulnerable populations in difficult circumstances, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The package of close to \u20ac240 million puts a particular emphasis on critical sectors for vulnerable populations such as social assistance, health, education and child protection. This will help strengthen the resilience of those already facing difficult situations to better face the multiple challenges linked to the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe newly adopted assistance package consists of the following actions:\n\n\t\u20ac100 million to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable local households and Syrian refugees, as well as to contribute to the establishment of sustainable social safety nets in Lebanon;\n\t\u20ac57.5 million to strengthen the public education system in Lebanon to deliver inclusive and quality education for vulnerable local and Syrian refugee children in Lebanon;\n\t\u20ac27.5 million to provide inclusive, equitable and quality education for Syrians in refugee camps in Jordan;\n\t\u20ac22 million to improve the public health system in Jordan, including prevention and management of diseases, in particular through primary health care;\n\t\u20ac11 million to empower local and refugee women and improve their access to livelihood opportunities in Jordan;\n\t\u20ac10.5 million in support to quality and sustainable child protection systems, policy and services for boys, girls and women in Lebanon;\n\t\u20ac10 million to improve the living and housing conditions of vulnerable returnees and support peacebuilding in western Ninewa in Iraq.\n\n\nThe assistance package was adopted by the Operational Board of the Trust Fund, which brings together the European Commission, EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. Observers of the Operational Board include Members of the European Parliament, representatives from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the World Bank, and the Syria Recovery Trust Fund. With this newly adopted package, the Trust Fund has committed over \u20ac2 billion in concrete actions in the region since 2015, helping refugees and host countries alike, doubling the target originally set.\n\nThis approved assistance package is part of already ongoing efforts to support Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries, pledged and provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis since 2014.\n\nBackground\n\nSince its establishment in December 2014, a significant share of the EU's support to help Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis. The Trust Fund reinforces an integrated EU aid response to the crisis and primarily addresses longer-term resilience and needs to enhance the self-reliance of Syrian refugees and, at the same time, contributes to ease the pressure on host communities and the administrations in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The Fund has also underpinned the EU Compacts agreed with Jordan and Lebanon to better assist them in coping with the protracted refugee crisis. With the newly adopted package, the Fund has mobilised over \u20ac900 million for Lebanon, over \u20ac500 million for both Jordan and Turkey and more than \u20ac160 million for Iraq. Overall, more than \u20ac2 billion has been mobilised from the EU budget and contributions from 21 EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.\n\nThe Trust Fund's programmes support basic education and child protection services for refugees, training and higher education, better access to healthcare, improved access to water and wastewater infrastructure, support to resilience, women empowerment and fighting gender based violence, as well as economic opportunities and social stability.

They addressed the response to the coronavirus pandemic, highlighting the importance of global solidarity, cooperation and effective multilateralism. The leaders discussed the need to draw lessons from the current situation in order to prevent future pandemics, and the steps to be taken in this regard. Building on the successful pledging initiative of \u201cthe Global Coronavirus Response\u201d that started on 4 May, the leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to global collaboration and sustained funding for developing and deploying effective antiviral medicines, diagnostics, treatments and vaccines in order to make them available to all at an affordable price. Illustrating the commitment of the EU and Japan to accelerate cooperation on research on health, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel and the Minister of State of Japan for Science and Technology Policy, Naokazu Takemoto, signed in the margins of the video conference, a Letter of Intent on strengthening cooperation in science, technology and innovation. This includes collaboration between Japan's Moonshot Research and Development Program and the EU's Horizon Europe Programme. Presidents von der Leyen and Michel and Prime Minister Abe stressed their determination to ensure a robust economic recovery and rebuild more sustainable, inclusive and resilient economies, in keeping with the Agenda 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. The leaders stressed the need to assist developing countries in their response to the coronavirus, for example through the \u201cTeam Europe\u201d support package of over \u20ac20 billion. The leaders also discussed the geopolitical consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and reiterated their commitment to upholding the rules-based international order and to strengthening practical cooperation. The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the EU-Japan strategic partnership, which has been strengthened by the EU-Japan Strategic Partnership Agreement\u00a0and the\u00a0Economic Partnership Agreement.

They have shown extraordinary solidarity to face the pandemic together in order to protect the health of the European citizens. Many companies across Europe retooled and revamped their production to meet the demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), disinfectants and medical devices. Today, the Commission has published a\u00a0factsheet and an interactive tool collecting stories of companies manufacturing vital products to combat the virus across Europe. Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton, said: \u201cI want to wholeheartedly thank companies for converting their production facilities to promptly help Europeans to access the protective equipment to keep them safe. The Commission is facilitating this either through what is in our power, or through coordination work with our Member States. We will overcome this crisis only if we work together. In this effort our industry plays a crucial role.\u201d From distilleries to textile companies, the industry has put its knowhow at the service of the citizens to produce, for instance, masks, protective gowns, hand sanitizers and ventilators. Over the last months, the Commission has taken actions in order to create the right conditions for industry to ramp up or retool production, including asking the European Standards Organisations to make standards for facemasks and other protective equipment freely available to all interested parties. In addition, in order to accelerate the approvals of essential products, and to help companies adapt their production lines, the Commission published guidance with practical Q&As in the following areas:PPE, leave-on hand cleaners and hand disinfectants as well as 3D printing.(For more information: Sonya Gospodinova \u2013 Tel. +32 229 66953; Federica Miccoli \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 5830; C\u00e9lia Dejond \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 88199)\n\n\u00a0\n\nCoronavirus: Following Commission's call, platforms remove millions of misleading ads \n\nAs part of its commitment to protect consumers online, the European Commission has coordinated a screening (\u2018sweep') of websites, with the aim of finding out where consumers in the EU are being subjected to content promoting false claims or scam products in the context of the coronavirus. The results show that, following the Commission's call, platforms have removed or blocked millions of misleading advertisements or product listings. The sweep \u2013 carried out by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network \u2013 consisted of two parts: a high-level screening of online platforms, and an in-depth analysis of specific advertisements and websites linked to products in high demand because of the coronavirus. Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice, said: \u201cThe major online platforms have positively replied to the European Commission's call to address scams and misleading offers and have shown a clear commitment to remove harmful content. However, as this recent sweep has shown, rogue traders continue to find new ways to exploit consumers' vulnerabilities, circumvent algorithmic checks and set up new websites. In the midst of a global pandemic, you need to be aware of this as a consumer \u2013 there are no miracle online cures. I am grateful that national consumer authorities remain on high alert and are working together with the Commission to protect consumers online.\u201d The Consumer Protection Authorities of 27 countries participated in the high-level screening of platforms and submitted 126 replies concerning both the companies with which the Commission has been in regular contact and additional national players. Particular attention was given to screening offers linked to protective masks and caps, sanitising gels, testing kits as well as food, food supplements and non-food products with alleged healing effects related to the coronavirus. See all the results of the sweep in the press release. The Commission has also published hereupdated advice for consumers and traders on how to avoid online rogue trading practices.

The financing is guaranteed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments. Gestamp, which employs some 43,000 personnel, will use the financial support to develop safer, lighter vehicles with lower emissions. The R&D activities will take place in Gestamp's plants in Spain, Germany, France and Sweden. Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for the Economy, said: \u201cWith the financial backing of the European Investment Bank under InvestEU, Gestamp will invest in the development of vehicles which are safer, less polluting, and more efficient. An investment in a green future which we must continue building together once we emerge from this crisis.\u201d The press release is available here. As of April 2020, the Investment Plan for Europe has mobilised \u20ac478.4 billion of investment across the EU, including \u20ac55.1 billion in Spain, and supported 1.17 million start-ups and small and medium-sized businesses.

Private investment is essential to finance Europe's economy and businesses. It contributes to the creation of jobs and to the diversification of services and products in our Single Market. Mobilising private funding will be particularly important to cope with the negative economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. If we are to encourage individuals and businesses to invest across the EU and to benefit from the Single Market, then our investment environment needs clear and coherent rules, with effective remedies. As announced in the New Industrial Strategy for Europe, the new Action Plan on Capital Markets Union will include an initiative to strengthen intra-EU investment protection and efforts to unlock more diverse sources of funding for European businesses, especially SMEs. Following the recent termination of the intra-EU Bilateral Investment Treaties, today's public consultation invites EU citizens and other stakeholders to express their views on the strengths or weaknesses of cross-border investing in the EU. The aim is to assess the current framework of investment protection, including both substantive rules and dispute settlement mechanisms. Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \u201cWe need to do everything we can to help Europe recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Fostering cross-border investment within the EU is now more important than ever. If we are to increase cross-border investment, we need to increase investors' confidence. I encourage as many stakeholders as possible to share their views and experiences concerning cross-border investing in the EU and how it can be improved.\u201d The public consultation will feed into the Commission's upcoming policy initiatives. Respondents are encouraged to provide as much information as possible here. The consultation will remain open until 8 September 2020.

The networks involve 1,373 organisations, including 158 SMEs. They will offer top-notch research and training opportunities around the globe to 2,000 PhD candidates. They will also contribute to increasing the overall quality and innovation of doctoral training in Europe and beyond. Commission Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \u201cCongratulations to all selected participants in the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions Programme! Today's announcement is a living example that research and innovation should work hand in hand with education. This is why we are working towards a European Education Area that has strong links with research. In that context, the European Universities initiative has great potential as it clearly promotes cooperation and activities that will strengthen the links between education, research and innovation, developing students' research skills, establishing joint education and research labs, and fostering joint strategies for smart specialisation.\u201d Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel, said: \u201cIn these exceptional times, we see more than ever the importance of supporting collaboration between researchers, enterprises and research centres from different countries to provide innovative solutions. The 147 projects selected, involving academic institutions and industrial partners from around the world, are a great example of such collaboration. I would like to congratulate all applicants that made it through this competitive process and wish them all the best in implementing their ideas and enhancing collaborations.\u201d The selected projects cover a variety of research areas, including engineering (31%), life sciences (24%) and social sciences (10%). The full list of selected projects is available here. European Researchers' Night, also funded under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions, is a Europe-wide public event that brings researchers closer to the public. In 2020, 51 European Researchers' Night projectswill be funded in 30 European countries. This year, due to the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the event initially scheduled for Friday 25 September 2020 will take place on Friday 27 November 2020.

The European Parliament had given its consent on 14 May. A \u201cEuropean Company\u201d is a type of public limited-liability company, whose status allows to run its business in different European countries using a single set of rules. The measures will allow EuropeanCompanies and the European Cooperative Societies to exceptionally hold their general meetings within twelve months of the end of the financial year, instead of within six months as provided for in the legislation. However, with the new rules, the general meetings should not take place later than 31 December 2020. Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice, and Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, said: \u201cWe welcome the swift adoption of those emergency measures by Council after Parliament's consent. This crisis shakes up all companies to the core, whether they are national or European. Thanks to those measures, European Companies and European Cooperative Societies will have more time to hold their general meetings and take the legally or economically necessary decisions to secure their functioning during those challenging times.\u201d Holding general meetings is critical to ensure that legally required or economically necessary decisions for the company or the cooperative society, shareholders, members and third parties are taken in due time. The emergency measures will enter into application on the day after their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.More information on the temporary measures for European Companies and European Cooperative Societies can be found on the Commission's page on Company law and Corporate Governance.

The Commission is concerned that the proposed transaction may reduce competition in the passenger air transport services between the European Economic Area (EEA) and Canada. Air Canada\u00a0and Transat are respectively the first and second largest providers of scheduled passenger air transport services between the EEA and Canada. At this stage, the Commission is concerned that the proposed transaction could significantly reduce competition on 33 origin and destination (O&D) citypairs between the EEA and Canada. The Commission's preliminary market investigation revealed that Air Canada and Transat have been historically competing head-to-head for the passenger air transport services between the EEA and Canada. At this stage, the Commission found that even if the Canadian airline WestJet has expanded its transatlantic operations to the EEA countries, it is unlikely that WestJet would exert a sufficient competitive constraint on the merged entity with respect to the O&Ds that the Commission found problematic following its preliminary market investigation. The Commission investigated the extent to which the coronavirus crisis would impact Air Canada, Transat and their competitors' operations and hence the competitive landscape in the mid- and long-term. The Commission will now carry out an in-depth investigation into the effects of the proposed transaction to determine whether it is likely to significantly reduce effective competition. Air Canada and Transat have decided not to submit commitments during the initial investigation to address the Commission's preliminary concerns. The opening of an in-depth investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, responsible for competition policy, said: \u201cAir Canada and Transat are the two leading airlines operating a wide network of routes between Europe and Canada. We will carefully assess whether the proposed transaction would negatively affect competition in these markets leading to higher prices, reduced quality or less choice for travellers flying over the Atlantic. This is a challenging time, especially in markets severely impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, but a return to normal and healthy market conditions must be based on markets that remain competitive.\u201d The full press release is available online.

The measure was approved under the State aid\u00a0Temporary Framework\u00a0adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on\u00a03 April and\u00a08 May 2020. The scheme is part of a wider Polish support programme, the so-called \u201cFinancial Shield for Large Enterprises.\u201d The total amount of loans that can be granted under the scheme is PLN 10 billion (approximately \u20ac2.2 billion). Under the scheme, the public support will take the form of subsidised loans at favourable interest rates. The scheme, which will be managed by the Polish Development Fund, is mostly targeted at large enterprises. It will however also be open to certain small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) registered in Poland, which will be eligible based on criteria defined by Poland. The scheme aims at enhancing access to liquidity for companies that are severely affected by the outbreak, thus helping them continue their activities, start investments and maintain employment. The Commission found that the Polish scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission therefore concluded that the measure is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. Executive-Vice President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThe \u20ac 2.2 billion Polish subsidised loan scheme will enable Poland to further support companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak.The measure will help businesses cover their immediate liquidity needs and continue their activities, start investment and maintain employment during and after the outbreak. We are working in close contact and cooperation with Poland, as with all Member States, to ensure that national support measures can be put in place as quickly and effectively as possible, in line with EU rules.\u201d The full press release is available online.

Trade credit insurance protects companies supplying goods and services against the risk of nonpayment by their clients. Given the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the risk of insurers not being willing to issue this insurance has become higher. The Dutch scheme ensures that trade credit insurance continues to be available to all companies, avoiding the need for buyers of goods or services to pay in advance, therefore reducing their immediate liquidity needs. The Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, and in particular Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which enables the Commission to approve State aid measures implemented by Member States to remedy a serious disturbance in their economy. The Commission found that the scheme notified by the Netherlands is compatible with the principles set out in the EU Treaty and is well targeted to remedy a serious disturbance to the Dutch economy. The Commission concluded that the measure will contribute to managing the economic impact of the coronavirus in the Netherlands. It is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the general principles set out in Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020 and 8 May 2020. On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThe Dutch guarantee scheme will help ensure that trade credit insurance remains available to all companies to secure their commercial exchanges. This will protect their liquidity needs and help them continue their activities in these difficult times. We continue working closely with Member States to ensure that national support measures can be put in place in a coordinated and effective manner, in line with EU rules.\u201d The full press release is available online.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April and 8 May 2020. Under the scheme, the support will take the form of subsidised debt instruments and recapitalisation instruments. The State will provide an initial investment of \u20ac100 million in the fund, and will guarantee bonds up to \u20ac400 million that will be issued to raise additional capital for the fund. The State's total investment in the fund may therefore increase up to \u20ac500 million. The fund will also aim to attract private investments for up to additional \u20ac500 million. The Commission found that the Lithuanian measure is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission concluded that the measure is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measure under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThis Lithuanian fund aims to unlock liquidity and capital support of up to \u20ac1 billion to Lithuanian companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak by facilitating their access to finance in these difficult times. It is the first scheme we have approved that will enable capital support to companies under the State aid Temporary Framework. The scheme ensures that the State is sufficiently remunerated for the risk taxpayers assume, that there are incentives for the State to exit as soon as possible, and that the support comes with strings attached, including a ban on dividends, bonus payments as well as further measures to limit distortions of competition. We continue to work in close cooperation with Member States to find workable solutions to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, in line with EU rules.\u201d The full press release is available online.

Ltd. (\"TBK\") of Japan. TB Kawashima Automotive Textile (India) manufactures and distributes interior textiles and fabrics for the automotive industry in India and in neighbouring countries. Before the transaction, it was controlled solely by Toyota Boshoku. AUNDE is active in the development and production of automotive products including yarns, technical textiles, seat covers and foam parts under the brands AUNDE, ISRINGHAUSEN and FEHRER for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers to the automotive industry in Europe and worldwide. Toyota Boshoku is active inthe development and production of various types of automotive components, including automotive textiles. TBK is active in the development, production and supply of various types of automotive textiles and interior fabrics, particularly in Asia. The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would raise no competition concerns, given that TB Kawashima Automotive Textile (India) will have no or negligible activities in the European Economic Area. The transaction was examined under the simplified merger review procedure.

The contract provides for the initial purchase of 80 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to request up to a further 80 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19.\n\nThe contract with Moderna will enlarge the already broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the contracts signed with AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, BioNTech-Pfizer and the contract approved with CureVac. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective. Member States can also decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cI'm very happy to announce today's agreement with the company Moderna to purchase up to 160 million doses of their future vaccine. This is our sixth contract with a vaccine producer, and we are working on yet another one. We are setting up one of the most comprehensive COVID-19 vaccine portfolios in the world, providing Europeans access to the most promising future vaccines under development so far. A safe and effective vaccine can help us end the pandemic, and return gradually to normal life.\u201d \n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cToday's agreement with Moderna is yet another important milestone of our EU Vaccines Strategy. I am happy that we have now concluded six\u00a0vaccine agreements so far. This is a clear demonstration of the European Health Union in action: a European Union that delivers tangible results for its citizens and a blueprint for our cooperation in the area of health in the future. A\u00a0safe and effective vaccine is more important than ever in helping to restore normality and overcome this pandemic. No one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d \n\nModerna is a U.S. based company pioneering the development of a new class of vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) transported into cells by lipid nanoparticles. The vaccine platform has been developed over the last decade. The basic principle is the use of this molecule as a data carrier, with the help of which the body itself can make proteins and trigger lasting immunity to COVID-19.\n\nThe Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, and its production capacity in Europe to supply the whole of the EU.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States on the basis of the Advance Purchase Agreements.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.\n\nOnce vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response. On 12 November, the European Union announced the contribution of an additional \u20ac100 million in grant funding to support the COVAX Facility.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nOverview of the Commission's Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission approves contract with Moderna to ensure access to a potential vaccine"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2200\/IP_20_2200_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?qid=1597339415327&uri=CELEX:52020DC0245","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response\/overview-commissions-response_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Working time and working time flexibility","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"September 2020","date":"18 September","title":"The Commission signs second contract to ensure access to a potential vaccine","abstract":"<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1680\">second contract with a pharmaceutical company<\/a> entered into force on 18 September following the contract's formal signature between Sanofi-GSK and the Commission.

The contract will allow all EU Member States to purchase up to 300 million doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine. Moreover, Member States may donate reserved doses to lower- and middle-income countries. Sanofi and GSK will also endeavour to provide a significant portion of their vaccine supply through a collaboration with the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility - the vaccine pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator for lower and middle income countries - in a timely manner.\n\nThe Commission has already signed a contract with AstraZeneca and continues discussing similar agreements with other vaccine manufacturers (Johnson & Johnson, CureVac, Moderna and BioNTech) with which it has concluded exploratory talks.\n\nPresident von der Leyen said: \u201cWith today's contract with Sanofi-GSK, the European Commission shows once again its commitment to ensuring equitable access to safe, effective and affordable vaccines not only for its citizens but also for the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. Agreements with other companies will be concluded soon and build a diversified portfolio of promising vaccines, based on various types of technologies, increasing our chances to find an effective remedy against the virus.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cWith several countries in Europe experiencing new outbreaks after the summer period, a safe and effective vaccine is more instrumental than ever to overcome this pandemic and its devastating effects on our economies and societies. This second agreement is yet another milestone in our EU Vaccine Strategy. Today we are expanding our possibilities to ensure that EU citizens and citizens around the world can gradually resume daily life and feel safe again.\u201d\n\nToday's contract is financed by the Emergency Support Instrument, which dedicates funds to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.\n\nSanofi and GSK are developing a recombinant vaccine for COVID-19, using innovative technology from both companies. Sanofi will contribute its S-protein COVID-19 antigen, which is based on recombinant DNA technology. GSK will contribute its adjuvant technology, of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore helping to protect more people.\u00a0The combination of a protein-based antigen together with an adjuvant is well-established and used in a number of vaccines available today to enhance the immune response. It can also improve the likelihood of delivering an effective vaccine that can be manufactured at scale.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe companies started a Phase 1\/ 2 study in September, followed by a Phase 3 study by the end of 2020. If successful, and subject to regulatory considerations, the companies aim to have the vaccine available by the second half of 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTogether with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will use existing flexibilities to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. The regulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Any vaccine put on the market will have to meet the necessary safety requirements and undergo the scientific assessment by the European Medicines Agency as part of the EU market authorisation procedure.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19.

This first emergency funding under Horizon Europe adds to a range of EU-funded research and innovation actions to fight the coronavirus and contributes to the Commission's overall action to prevent, mitigate and respond to the impact of coronavirus variants, in line with the new European bio-defence preparedness plan HERA Incubator.\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cWe continue to mobilise all means at our disposal to fight this pandemic and the challenges presented by coronavirus variants. We must use our combined strength to be prepared for the future, starting from the early detection of the variants to the organisation and coordination of clinical trials for new vaccines and treatments, while ensuring correct data collection and sharing at all stages.\u201d\n\nNew calls for urgent research into coronavirus variants\n\nThe Commission launched new calls that complement earlier actions to develop treatments and vaccines by organising and conducting clinical trials to advance the development of promising therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19. They will support the development of large scale, COVID-19 cohorts and networks beyond Europe's borders, forging links with European initiatives, as well as reinforce the infrastructures needed to share data, expertise, research resources and expert services among researchers and research organisations.\n\nThe projects funded are expected to:\n\n\tEstablish new and\/or build on existing large-scale, multi-centre and regional or multinational cohorts, including beyond Europe's borders, which should rapidly advance the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants.\n\tFurther develop promising therapeutic or vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19, having already completed preclinical development in clinical studies.\n\tSupport research infrastructures to speed up data sharing and deliver fast research support and expertise, to confront the coronavirus variants and to be ready for future epidemics.\n\n\nThe successful consortia are expected to collaborate with other relevant initiatives and projects at national, regional, and international level to maximise synergies and complementarity and avoid duplication of the research efforts.\n\nThese emergency calls will tackle the short to medium-term threat and simultaneously prepare for the future. They will contribute to building the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), which will enable the EU to anticipate and better tackle future pandemics.\n\nThe calls will open for submissions on 13 April and the deadline for submission is 6 May 2021. The new solutions need to be available and affordable for all, in line with the principles of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\nBackground\n\nIn February 2021, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the start of a European bio-defence preparedness plan HERA Incubator aimed at preparing Europe for an increased threat of coronavirus variants. The HERA Incubator will bring together science, industry and public authorities, and leverage all available resources to enable Europe to respond to this challenge.\n\nSince the beginning of the crisis, but also since much earlier, the Commission has been at the forefront of supporting research and innovation and coordinating European and global research efforts, including preparedness for pandemics. It has pledged \u20ac1.4 billion to the Coronavirus Global Response, of which \u20ac1 billion comes from Horizon 2020, the previous EU research and innovation programme.\n\nThe new special calls announced today under Horizon Europe, the successor of Horizon 2020, complement these earlier actions to fight the coronavirus: support for 18 projects with \u20ac48.2 million to develop diagnostics, treatments, vaccines and preparedness for epidemics; 8 projects with \u20ac117 million invested on the development of diagnostics and treatments through the Innovative Medicines Initiative; 24 projects with \u20ac133.4 million granted to addressing pressing needs and the socio-economic impact of the pandemic; and other measures to support innovative ideas through the European Innovation Council.

The two strategies are mutually reinforcing, bringing together nature, farmers, business and consumers to jointly work towards a competitive, sustainable future.In line with the European Green Deal, they propose ambitious EU actions and commitments to halt biodiversity loss in Europe and worldwide and transform our food systems into global standards for competitive sustainability, the protection of human and planetary health, as well as the livelihoods of all actors in the food value chain. The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated how vulnerable the increasing biodiversity loss makes us and how crucial a well-functioning food system is for our society. The two strategies put the citizen at the centre, by committing to increase the protection of land and sea, restoring degraded ecosystems and establishing the EU as a leader at the international stage both on the protection of biodiversity and on building a sustainable food chain. A full press release, a Q&A on the biodiversity strategy and a Q&A on the farm to fork strategy are available online as well as factsheets on the biodiversity strategy, the farm to fork strategy, the business case for biodiversity, the benefits for farmers and the contribution of the Common Agriculture Policy.

Researchers involved with the \u201cHG nCoV19 test\u201d project have obtained approval to put a new rapid point-of-care diagnostic for COVID-19 on the market. Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"This is a great example of EU research in action. I am encouraged to see that these researchers have risen to the challenge, developed this new diagnostic system so fast, and delivered on one of the aims of our first emergency call. It's crucial to diagnose coronavirus more quickly and more accurately, as it reduces the risk of further spread of the virus.\u201d Bringing together public and private organisations from Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and China, the \u201cHG nCoV19 test\u201d project developed a new portable diagnostic system to detect viral infection that gives accurate and reliable results in 30 minutes. Today, HiberGene, the Irish company coordinating the project, announced that it had obtained the CE marking required for medical devices to be placed in the market. The EU has been supporting HiberGene since as far back as July 2000, while its support to this specific project amounts to \u20ac930.000. The Commission has been at the forefront of supporting research and innovationand coordinating European and global research efforts since the beginning of the pandemic. On 4 May, it pledged \u20ac1.4 billion in total during the Coronavirus Global Response\u00a0pledging event, of which\u00a0\u20ac1 billion\u00a0comes through Horizon 2020, the EU's research and innovation programme, and is aimed at\u00a0developing vaccines, new treatments and diagnostic tools to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Since January 2020, \u20ac474 million has already been mobilised under Horizon 2020 to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. More information is available here.

Five of these new projects will concentrate on cybersecurity and privacy solutions for citizens and small and medium businesses (SMEs). The other four projects will work on improving critical security systems, such as healthcare infrastructures and multimodal transport systems. Furthermore, 21 projects will be funded through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the European networks and infrastructures programme, also covering the digital sector. With a total of \u20ac7.6 million, the latter projects will strengthen the EU's cybersecurity capacity to be better prepared and counter more efficiently cyber-threats and incidents. Three hospitals in Croatia and Latvia will, for example, increase their preparedness\u00a0by implementing technical and organisational improvements, while an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) for the Italian aviation sector will be set up. The support to the new projects is part of the EU's commitment to build a strong cybersecurity culture and capabilities to resist and respond to future cyber threats and attacks. More information on the EU's actions to strengthen cybersecurity capacities, including for 5G networks, is available in this\u00a0Q&A.

The EU is helping coordinate the delivery of medical ventilators offered by Denmark to Italy. Lithuania will receive FFP2 masks from the rescEU reserve of medical equipment, fully financed from the EU budget. In addition, the EU is financing the delivery of disinfectant, blankets and bedlinen to North Macedonia, Montenegro and Georgia donated by Estonia via the Mechanism. Slovakia also addedambulances to their offer to Ukraine under the Mechanism earlier this week. Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management, said:\u00a0\u201cThe rescEU reserve of medical equipment continues to prove its added value as we are sending further quality checked protective masks to Lithuania. In addition, Estonia, Slovakia and Denmark are mobilising further support via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to other countries. European countries helping one another is what our Union is all about.\u201d The EU Civil Protection Mechanism has already coordinated the delivery of assistance to 13 countries during this pandemic.

The proposed measures are temporary and aim at addressing the challenges faced by the organisers during the coronavirus outbreak, where public campaigning and paper collection of statements of support have become nearly impossible. For all the initiatives that were ongoing on 11 March 2020, the day when the World Health Organization declared the Coronavirus outbreak a worldwide pandemic, the Commission proposes to extend the period for collecting statements of support by 6 months. Initiatives that started their collection after 11 March and before 11 September should benefit from \u201ca proportionate extension\u201d. This means that the 1 year collection period will be counted only as of 11 September, however the ECIs can start collecting signatures already before that date. The Commission can introduce further prolongations to the collection periods in case of continued application of national measures in response to the pandemic or a new outbreak. Finally, the Commission proposal allows for possible extensions up to 3 months for the verification of the initiatives, which have completed their collection process. The possibility for an extension will also exist for the examination phase. The proposed temporary measures now need to be agreed by the European Parliament and the Council. The text of the proposal is available online and more information available on the European Citizens' Initiatives website.

At meetings via videoconference on 18 and 19 May 2020, EU Education, Youth and Culture Ministers shared information on their experiences of dealing with the crisis. Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, updated them on the Commission's latest activities to help them find solutions. Commissioner Gabriel said: \u201cDuring our constructive discussions over the past two days, I called on EU Ministers to back two initiatives under preparation under the Erasmus+ programme. The first would support distance learning and acquiring digital skills. The second would support skills development, digital competencies and social inclusion through the arts, linking our education, training and youth stakeholders with our grassroots organisations in the cultural and creative sectors. These are extraordinary times and we must mobilise all instruments at our disposal to respond to the crisis.\u201dMore information is available in press releases from the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the EU.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020 and 8 May 2020. The support will take the form of direct grants and will be accessible to companies of all sizes, including the self-employed, active in the agriculture, fishery and aquaculture sectors in the territory of Campania. The purpose of the scheme is to address the liquidity needs of these companies and to help them continue their activities during and after the outbreak. The measure is expected to support over 1,000 enterprises. The Commission found that the Italian scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. In particular, aid does not exceed \u20ac120,000 per company active in the fishery and aquaculture sector and \u20ac100,000 per company active in the primary production of agricultural products. The Commission concluded that the measure is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules. More information on the Temporary Framework and other actions taken by the Commission to address the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic can be found here.

The existing scheme was approved on 12 March 2020 and enables Denmark to compensate operators for the losses suffered as a consequence of the cancellations or postponement the events. Denmark notified the following modifications to this scheme: (i) as a direct consequence of further temporary prohibitions of public events decided by the Danish Government in the public health interest, the duration of the measure is extended to cover events that should have taken place between 6 March and 31 August 2020 (previously, only events scheduled until 30 March 2020 could be compensated); (ii) the scheme will now be accessible to organizers of events with more than 350 participants (previously, beneficiaries were organisers of events with more than 1,000 participants); and (iii) the budget of the measure has increased from DKK 91 million (\u20ac12 million) to DKK 2,310 million (\u20ac310 million). The Commission found that the amended Danish aid scheme will compensate damages that are directly linked to the coronavirus outbreak. It also found that the amended measure is proportionate, as the foreseen compensation does not exceed what is necessary to make good the damage. The Commission concluded that the amended scheme is in line with EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107(2)(b) TFEU, as it will contribute to mitigate the negative consequences of coronavirus for Danish businesses, without unduly distorting competition in the Internal Market.

The amendment was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April and 8 May 2020. On 9 April 2020, the Commission approved two Lithuanian aid schemes to provide liquidity to companies affected by the outbreak in the form of subsidised loans. The present amendment concerns only one of the two existing schemes, namely the measure - offered to SMEs via financial intermediaries - aiming at facilitating access to finance in the form of subsidised loans to companies facing cash shortages as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Lithuania notified the following modifications to this existing scheme: (i) an increase in the estimated total budget of the scheme from \u20ac100 million to \u20ac200 million; (ii) the maximum duration of the loans will be increased from 36 months to 72 months; and (iii) the maximum underlying loan amount per beneficiary will be increased to \u20ac1 million (from the original \u20ac100 000).

En deux ans, ces r\u00e8gles ont non seulement fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re dont nous traitons nos donn\u00e9es personnelles en Europe, mais sont \u00e9galement devenues une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au niveau mondial en mati\u00e8re de protection de la vie priv\u00e9e. Dans un environnement qui repose de plus en plus sur le traitement des donn\u00e9es, le RGPD garantit aux citoyens un contr\u00f4le accru sur leurs donn\u00e9es personnelles et \u00e9tablit en m\u00eame temps un cadre pour une innovation fiable. La RGPD est une pierre angulaire de la transition num\u00e9rique europ\u00e9enne. Au cours des deux derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les citoyens et les entreprises ont pris davantage conscience de l'importance de la protection des donn\u00e9es.

This new pledge brings us closer to achieving COVAX's target to deliver 1.3 billion doses for 92 low and middle income countries by the end of 2021. Team Europe is one of the lead contributors to COVAX with over \u20ac2.2 billion, including another \u20ac900 million pledged today by Germany.\n\nAnnouncing the new contribution at the G7 virtual leaders' meeting, President of the European Commission, Ursula\u00a0von der Leyen, said: \u201cLast year, as part of our Coronavirus Global Response, we committed to ensuring universal access to vaccines everywhere on Earth, for everyone who would need them. COVAX is best placed to help us reach this goal. This is why we decided to double the European Commission's contribution to COVAX, to \u20ac1 billion. With this new financial boost we want to make sure vaccines are soon delivered to low and middle-income countries. Because we will only be safe if the whole world is safe.\u201d\n\nJutta\u00a0Urpilainen, Commissioner for International Partnerships, added:\u00a0\u201cWe are in a race against the virus and COVAX is our best hope that all our partners, in Africa and elsewhere, have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. The EU has been leading efforts in international fora, such as the G20 and G7, to guarantee that collectively we ensure that COVID-19 vaccines become a global public good. This is why today we are doubling our support to COVAX.\u201d\n\nStella\u00a0Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, stressed:\u00a0\u201cHumanism and solidarity are essential values for Europe. These values have been our compass since the onset of the pandemic. The EU has invested close to\u00a0\u20ac3 billion to pre-finance the production of\u00a0safe and effective vaccines, which will benefit not only the EU but citizens across the world.\u00a0\u00a0Vaccines produced in Europe are now going all over the world and we as Team Europe are working to share doses secured under our advanced purchase agreements preferably through COVAX with the Western Balkans, Neighborhood and Africa \u2013 benefitting above all health workers and humanitarian needs.\u201d\n\nThe contribution announced today is composed of a new \u20ac300 million EU grant and \u20ac200 million in guarantees by the European Fund for Sustainable Development plus (EFSD+) that will back a loan by the European Investment Bank. This is subject\u00a0to the adoption of the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) by the Council and the European Parliament. The EIB loan to be guaranteed by EFSD+ is subject to the approval of the EIB's Board of Directors.\u00a0These funds will complement a previous\u00a0\u20ac100 million grant and\u00a0\u20ac400 million in guarantees from the EU budget.\n\nTo date, a total of 191 countries participate in the COVAX Facility, 92 of them low and middle-income economies eligible to get access to COVID-19 vaccines through Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). Most of these are in Africa. Through these contributions, the Commission and its partners will secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for all the participants in the Facility.\n\nVaccines will be procured and delivered to countries by the UNICEF Supply Division and the PAHO's Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines. The fast arrival of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has shown that multilateralism and multi-actor partnerships work to solve the most pressing problems of our time.\n\nBackground\n\nCOVAX is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.\n\nThe COVAX Facility aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021, including at least 1.3 billion doses for low and middle-income country. It will help to develop a diversified portfolio of vaccines, negotiated with different suppliers, and covering different scientific technologies, delivery times and prices. The COVAX Facility is a risk-sharing mechanism: it reduces the risk for manufacturers who invest without being sure about future demand, and it reduces the risk that countries would fail to secure access to a viable vaccine.\n\nThe European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world, and to promote global health. This is why together with partners it has helped raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the\u00a0Coronavirus Global Response, the global action in support of universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0Team Europe's contribution was as follows: EU Member States (\u20ac3.1 billion), European Commission (over \u20ac1.4 billion) and EIB (almost \u20ac2 billion pledged in May and \u20ac4.9 billion pledged in June).\n\nThe EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need. Through its Advanced Purchase Agreements, it requires manufacturers to make their production capacity available to supply all countries and calls for the free flow of vaccines and materials with no export restrictions. For instance, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-GSK, with whom the Commission\u00a0concluded an Advanced Purchase Agreement in September,\u00a0will endeavour to provide a significant portion of their vaccine supply through the COVAX facility.\n\nBuilding on the EU Vaccines Strategy, the EU is in the process of setting up vaccine sharing mechanism to allow EU Member States to redirect some of the doses procured under the advanced purchased agreement, preferably through COVAX.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU Global Response to coronavirus\n\n","detail_title":["EU doubles contribution to COVAX to \u20ac1 billion to ensure safe and effective vaccines for low and middle-income countries "],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_690\/IP_21_690_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Gesine KNOLLE","phone":"+32 2 295 43 23","email":"gesine.knolle@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","public health and food safety","public health","international cooperation and development","transport"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/global-response.europa.eu\/index_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"September 2020","date":"25 September","title":"Council approves EUR 87.4 billion in financial support for member states under SURE","abstract":"<p>The Council approved <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/press\/press-releases\/2020\/09\/25\/covid-19-council-approves-87-4-billion-in-financial-support-for-member-states-under-sure\/\">EUR 87.4 billion of financial support<\/a> to 16 member states in the form of EU loans under SURE \u2013 a temporary EU instrument to mitigate unemployment risks during the coronavirus crisis.<\/p>","presscorner_links":[],"all_links":["https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/press\/press-releases\/2020\/09\/25\/covid-19-council-approves-87-4-billion-in-financial-support-for-member-states-under-sure\/"],"detail_link":null,"detail_metadata":null,"detail_content":null,"detail_title":null,"detail_pdf_link":null,"press_contacts":null,"topics":null,"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"16 March","title":"EU funding offered to innovative vaccines company CureVac","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_474\">offered<\/a> up to EUR 80 million of financial support to CureVac, a highly innovative vaccine developer from T\u00fcbingen, Germany, to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the coronavirus in Europe.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_474"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_474"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_474","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"16 March 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Commission offered up to \u20ac80 million of financial support to CureVac, a higly innovative vaccine developer from T\u00fcbingen, Germany, to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the Coronavirus in Europe. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel, discussed with the CureVac management via videoconference. The Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Ambroise Fayolle, also participated. The support would come in form of an EU guarantee of a currently assessed EIB loan of an identical amount, in the framework of the InnovFin Infectious Disease Finance Facility under Horizon 2020.\n\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cIn this public health crisis it is of utmost importance that we support our leading researchers and tech companies. We are determined to provide CureVac with the financing it needs to quickly scale up development and production of a vaccine against the Coronavirus. I am proud that we have leading companies like CureVac in the EU. Their home is here. But their vaccines will benefit everyone, in Europe and beyond.\u201d\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cSupporting excellent EU research and innovation is an essential part of our coordinated response against the spread of the Coronavirus. In 2014, CureVac won EU's first ever innovation inducement prize. We are committed to support further its EU-based research and innovation in these critical times. Science and innovation in Europe are at the heart of our policies for protecting people's health.\u201d\n\nAmbroise Fayolle, Vice-President for Innovation in the European Investment Bank, said: \u201cThe EIB is and remains the EU Bank for innovation, even more than ever in the current health crisis. Thanks to our strong and fruitful long partnership with the Commission in the area of research and innovation financial instruments (InnovFin), we are determined to do our best to support CureVac scale up needs for the benefits of EU citizen and beyond.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFounded in 2000, CureVac is a German biopharmaceutical company that has developed a novel technology to overcome one of the biggest barriers to using vaccines: the need to keep them stable without refrigeration. Its vaccine technology is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that stimulate the immune system. Preliminary studies have shown that the technology holds a promise for rapid response to COVID-19. If proven, millions of vaccine doses could potentially be produced at low costs in existing CureVac production facilities. CureVac has already started its COVID-19 vaccine development program and estimates to launch clinical testing by June 2020.\n\nThe Commission recognised CureVac's potential to bring life-saving vaccines to people across the planet in safe and affordable ways already in 2014 when CureVac received the first ever EU innovation inducement prize of \u20ac2 million, funded by the EU's research and innovation programme, FP7. The award was intended to support further development of the breakthrough idea. Now the Commission and the EIB are strengthening jointly their efforts to provide the necessary means to CureVac, taking advantage of their long and fruitful cooperation in financial instruments dedicated to support research and innovation such as Horizon 2020 InnovFin and in particular its Infectious Disease Finance Facility.\n\nBackground\n\nThe support to CureVac is part of coordinated EU response to the public health threat of COVID-19.\n\nWorking closely with the industry, the Commission has mobilised up to \u20ac140 million in public and private funding to support urgently needed research. On 6 March, the Commission announced that it selected 17 projects involving 136 research teams to receive a total funding of \u20ac47.5 million from its research and innovation programme, Horizon 2020. The teams will work on developing vaccines, new treatments, diagnostic tests and medical systems aimed at preventing the spread of the Coronavirus. In addition, the Commission has committed up to \u20ac45 million for research on vaccines and treatments through a call published on 3 March by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), which is to be matched by the pharma industry, so up to \u20ac90 million in all.\n\nIn the past years the European Commission has invested greatly in research to prepare exactly for this type of public health emergency. Several EU funded projects are currently contributing to the European and global preparedness and response activities.\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission offers financing to innovative vaccines company CureVac"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_474\/IP_20_474_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Johannes BAHRKE","phone":"+32 2 295 86 15","email":"johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marietta GRAMMENOU","phone":"+32 2 298 35 83","email":"marietta.grammenou@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["digital economy","research and innovation"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"17 March","title":"Commission launches European team of scientific experts","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/transparency\/regexpert\/index.cfm?do=news.news\">An advisory panel on COVID-19<\/a> composed of epidemiologists and virologists from different Member States is brought together to formulate EU guidelines on science-based and coordinated risk management measures.<\/p>","presscorner_links":[],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/transparency\/regexpert\/index.cfm?do=news.news"],"detail_link":null,"detail_metadata":null,"detail_content":null,"detail_title":null,"detail_pdf_link":null,"press_contacts":null,"topics":null,"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Wage flexibility ","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"June 2020","date":"18 June","title":"Supporting Central African Republic and the regional response to the pandemic in the Horn of Africa to limit socio-economic risks of the pandemic","abstract":"<p>As part of the European Union's response to the COVID-19 crisis in Africa, the European Commission has decided to grant <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1074\">\u20ac54\u00a0million to the Central African Republic<\/a> to help the government shore up public expenditure negatively affected by the fight against the virus.

This additional budgetary support aims to help the country address the socio-economic risks associated with the health crisis and contribute to the gradual restoration of State authority over the country, which is essential for the country's economic and social development.'\n\nSlowing the spread of the COVID-19 virus means that the Central African government must use part of its resources for preventive health measures, which significantly increases pressure on public finances. The EU is therefore intervening with two budget support programmes going towards consolidating the State (\u20ac45\u00a0million) and reforming the security and governance sector (\u20ac9\u00a0million).\n\nThe new programme for consolidating the State (PACAE-RCA II) will consolidate economic governance in the Central African Republic and increase its fiscal space in 2020-21, by enhancing dialogue with the government in terms of the macroeconomic framework, public-finance reform, and the education and health sectors.\n\nBudgetary strengthening under the ongoing Support Programme for Reforming the Security and Governance Sectors will ensure continued European support for a return to peace and security. It is in addition to the initial allocation of \u20ac38\u00a0million to meet the funding needs for national security and justice policies and gradually to redeploy and resize the Central African Republic's domestic security forces and judiciary.\n\nIn order to get help to the government as quickly as possible, an advance disbursement of \u20ac23.5\u00a0million will be made in the coming weeks.\n\nOther measures to support the COVID-19 response in the Central African Republic\n\nThis financial support is supplemented by an immediate reallocation of \u20ac6.5\u00a0million from ongoing European Development Fund (EDF) programmes and the B\u00eakou Trust Fund to help the water, sanitation and health (WASH) sector. Water fountains and water supply sources have already been built in Bangui and Paoua and the distribution of medical equipment and local production of masks have been stepped up (160,000 units).\n\nOn 8\u00a0May, the Central African Republic benefited from the first \u2018Team Europe' humanitarian air bridge bringing in health equipment and humanitarian staff to support the fight against the pandemic in the country.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Central African Republic is trying to recover from the crisis it has been in since 2013. More than a year after the signing of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation between the Central African authorities and the 14 main armed groups in February\u00a02019, the humanitarian situation remains particularly critical (25% of the population displaced, 63% in need of humanitarian assistance) and the security situation is still fragile.\n\nThe European Union is the Central African Republic's leading partner from both a political and financial point of view. It has applied an integrated approach combining all the instruments at its disposal to support the country's progress towards peace, stability, democracy and development.\n\nThe National Indicative Programme (NIP) for the Central African Republic, totalling \u20ac442\u00a0million from the 11th EDF, is in line with the National Plan for Recovery and Peacebuilding (RCPCA). The priority sectors are: (1)\u00a0support for economic governance and social services, including education and health; (2) support for security sector reform and democratic governance; and (3) support for rural resilience and job creation. Support to civil society complements these three focal sectors.\n\nThe Central African Republic also benefits from the EU's B\u00eakou Trust Fund, which was set up in 2014 and has been extended until December\u00a02020. The Trust Fund totals \u20ac291\u00a0million. It is the only tool available to bridge the gap between the Central African Republic's humanitarian and developmental needs. Most projects under the Fund focus on more remote parts of the country and on the fields of health, rural development, economic recovery and job creation, support for civil society and the media, reconciliation, social cohesion, and the return of displaced persons.\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: EU supports Central African Republic with \u20ac54 million to limit socio-economic risks"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1074\/IP_20_1074_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Gesine KNOLLE","phone":"+32 2 295 43 23","email":"gesine.knolle@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","international cooperation and development"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"December 2020","date":"17 December","title":"Commission welcomes the adoption of the EU's long-term budget for 2021-2027","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2469\">welcomed the Council decision<\/a> to adopt the next long-term EU budget for the period 2021-2027.

As a result, \u20ac1.074 trillion [in 2018 prices] will become available for beneficiaries of EU funding during the next seven years.\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cWith NextGenerationEU and the new long term budget, we will be able to provide European people, businesses, regions and cities with the support they urgently need to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Today is a day of hope for Europe! We will build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe, ready for today's and tomorrow's challenges\u201d.\n\nEuropean Commissioner Johannes Hahn in charge of the budget, who worked to facilitate the deal since the beginning of the mandate, said: \u201cWith the final step taken today for the adoption of the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027, we can start the implementation process. The EU-Commission will spare no effort to lead Europe\u00b4s recovery from 1 January onwards. For the first time we will also have a mechanism in place which will help us to protect even better the EU taxpayers money. Now quick delivery is key! It is therefore crucial to complete the remaining steps for the launch of NextGenerationEU. The unprecedented financial firepower of MFF\/NGEU with a volume of \u20ac1.8 trillion will provide the necessary means for a sustainable recovery and Europe's green and digital transition.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, work towards finalising NextGenerationEU, the temporary recovery instrument created to fuel Europe's recovery from the coronavirus crisis, continues. Once adopted, the package of a total of \u20ac1.8 trillion [in 2018 prices] will be the largest package ever financed through the EU budget.\n\nWith the combined firepower of the long-term budget and NextGenerationEU, the EU will support citizens, companies and regions most affected by the coronavirus crisis. The package will also help rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe, which will be greener, more digital, more resilient and better fit for the current and forthcoming challenges.\n\nThe European Commission will be able to start committing the funds under the next multiannual financial framework as of 1 January 2021, following the adoption of the relevant sector-specific legislation as well as of the annual budget for 2021 by the European Parliament and the Council.\n\nFor the Commission to start borrowing under NextGenerationEU, thus making the instrument operational, the ratification of the new Own Resources Decision by all Member States in line with their constitutional requirements is still needed.\n\nThe Commission relies on the commitment of Member States to proceed as quickly as possible, in the interest of their citizens.\n\nBackground \n\nThe Commission put forward its proposal for the EU's next long-term budget on 2 May 2018. The framework proposal was immediately followed by legislative proposals for the 37 sectoral programmes (e.g. cohesion, agriculture, Erasmus, Horizon Europe, etc). Between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the Commission worked hand in hand with the rotating Presidencies of the Council, and in close collaboration with the European Parliament, to take the negotiations forward.\n\nOn 27 May 2020, in response to the unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus, the European Commission proposed the temporary recovery instrument NextGenerationEU with a firepower of \u20ac750 billion, as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027.\n\nOn 21 July 2020, EU heads of state or government reached a political agreement on the package.\n\nOn 10 November 2020, the European Parliament and the Council reached an agreement on the package.\n\nOn 10 December 2020, EU Member States in the European Council agreed to finalise the adoption of the MFF Regulation and the Own Resources Decision, at the level of the Council.\n\nToday's final step follows yesterday's vote in the European Parliament, which endorsed the MFF regulation with a significant majority.\n\nFor more information\n\nQ&A\n\nMFF website\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["EU budget: European Commission welcomes the adoption of the EU's long-term budget for 2021-2027"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2469\/IP_20_2469_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Claire JOAWN","phone":"+32 2 295 68 59","email":"claire.joawn@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","budget and human resources"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"December 2020","date":"28 December","title":"EUR 70 million package for early access to EU COVID-19 vaccines in the Western Balkans","abstract":"<p>The Commission adopted a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2539\">package of \u20ac70 million<\/a> under the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA II) to help fund the access of Western Balkans partners to COVID-19 vaccines procured by EU countries.

We continue to act in this spirit also in the case of vaccines, by taking steps to enable a quick start of vaccination campaigns to critical staff and most vulnerable groups in the region early on. Swift vaccination will be decisive in ending the pandemic and launching the socio-economic recovery of the Western Balkans.\u201d\n\nThe package will be disbursed in the form of grants that will help cover the cost of the vaccines for priority groups in the region, as well as necessary vaccination equipment. It will enable the Western Balkans to purchase a number of vaccines from the EU Advance Purchase Agreements with six manufacturers, with individual EU Member States sharing a part of their pre-allocated doses.\n\nWhile the EU continues to support the COVAX initiative, the world's facility to ensure fair and universal access to COVID-19 vaccines, and all Western Balkans partners have signed up to it, the delivery of vaccines under that scheme is expected to start later than the vaccination campaigns in the EU. Access to a number of doses from the EU purchase agreements will therefore enable the region to start vaccinations in parallel with EU Member States.\n\nThe Commission and the European Centre for Disease Control are also assisting the region in finalising vaccination strategies in line with Commission recommendations to ensure appropriate preparation of the campaigns and seamless administration of the vaccines. The EU is also funding a project with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to help manage logistics and the delivery of the vaccines.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world. This is why it immediately responded to the WHO's call for action and has helped raise almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the\u00a0Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\n\nThe COVAX Facility is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. Over \u20ac870 million have been so far announced by the EU and the EU Member States for COVAX. COVAX aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021, including over 1.3 billion for development countries. It will help to develop a diversified portfolio of vaccines, negotiated with different suppliers, and covering different scientific technologies, delivery times and prices.\n\nThe EU's participation in COVAX is complementary with the ongoing EU negotiations with vaccine companies launched under the EU Vaccines Strategy. The EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need. Through its Advanced Purchase Agreements, it requires manufacturers to make their production capacity available to supply all countries and calls for the free flow of vaccines and materials with no export restrictions.\n\nThe Commission is also coordinating the donation of some of the doses procured by the EU Member States to various partner countries in order to guarantee their early access to COVD-19 vaccines for health care workers and vulnerable populations until vaccines through COVAX are more widely available.\n\n","detail_title":["Commission adopts \u20ac70 million package for early access to EU COVID-19 vaccines in the Western Balkans"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2539\/IP_20_2539_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Tim McPHIE","phone":"+ 32 2 295 86 02","email":"tim.mcphie@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["climate action and energy"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"August 2020","date":"24 August","title":"Commission proposes to provide \u20ac81.4 billion in financial support for 15 Member States under SURE","abstract":"<p>The Commission presented <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1496\">proposals to the Council<\/a> for decisions to grant financial support of EUR 81.4 billion to 15 Member States under the SURE instrument.

SURE is a crucial element of the EU's comprehensive strategy to protect citizens and mitigate the severely negative socio-economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. It is one of the three safety nets agreed by the European Council to shield workers, businesses and countries.\n\nOnce the Council approves these proposals, the financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States. These loans will assist Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, in particular for the self-employed.\n\nFollowing consultations with the Member States that have requested support and after assessing their requests, the Commission proposes to the Council to approve the granting of financial support to:\n\n\tBelgium\t\u20ac7.8 billion\n\tBulgaria\t\u20ac511 million\n\tCzechia\t\u20ac2 billion\n\tGreece\t\u20ac2.7 billion\n\tSpain\t\u20ac21.3 billion\n\tCroatia\t\u20ac1 billion\n\tItaly\t\u20ac27.4 billion\n\tCyprus\t\u20ac479 million\n\tLatvia\t\u20ac192 million\n\tLithuania\t\u20ac602 million\n\tMalta\t\u20ac244 million\n\tPoland\t\u20ac11.2 billion\n\tRomania\t\u20ac4 billion\n\tSlovakia\t\u20ac631 million\n\tSlovenia\t\u20ac1.1 billion\n\n\nSURE can provide financial support of up to \u20ac100 billion in total to all Member States.\u00a0 The proposals put forward by the Commission to the Council for decisions to grant financial support amount to \u20ac81.4 billion and cover 15 Member States. Portugal and Hungary have already submitted formal requests which are being assessed. The Commission expects to put forward a proposal to grant support to Portugal and Hungary shortly. Member States which have not yet made formal requests may still do so.\n\nLoans provided to Member States under the SURE instrument will be underpinned by a system of voluntary guarantees from Member States. The Commission expects that the process of Member States finalising their guarantee agreements with the Commission will be completed very shortly.\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cWe must do everything in our power to preserve jobs and livelihoods. Today marks an important step in this regard: just four months after I proposed its creation, the Commission is proposing to provide \u20ac81.4 billion under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic across the EU. SURE is a clear symbol of solidarity in the face of an unprecedented crisis. Europe is committed to protecting citizens.\u201d\n\nValdis\u00a0Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said:\u00a0\u201cWorkers are currently enduring enormous insecurity, and we need to support them to overcome this crisis and relaunch our economies. That is why the Commission proposed SURE, to help protect workers and facilitate the economic rebound. Today, we welcome Member States' strong interest in accessing the cheap funding available under SURE to support short-time work schemes and similar measures, and we look forward to a fast decision process to start disbursing the loans.\u201d\n\nNicolas\u00a0Schmit, Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: \u201cSURE was one of the first safety nets we decided to put in place to guarantee that workers have an income while their jobs have been suspended, and that their employment is preserved. SURE will therefore help a swifter recovery. All Member States will soon have provided a cumulative \u20ac25 billion in guarantees, and we propose that the 15 Member States who requested support receive a cumulated \u20ac81.4 billion in loans. This is a demonstration of European solidarity, of how together we are stronger for the benefit of all European citizens.\u201d\n\nPaolo\u00a0Gentiloni,\u00a0Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cShort-time work schemes have played a key role in cushioning the impact on jobs of the COVID-19 pandemic. SURE is the European Union's contribution to these essential safety nets. It will help to protect workers against unemployment and preserve the jobs and skills that we will need as our economies recover. The high demand from our Member States confirms the vital importance of this scheme.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nAs part of its coronavirus response, the Commission proposed SURE on 2 April 2020. Member States in the Council adopted the regulation establishing SURE on 19 May 2020.\n\nEach Member State's contribution to the overall amount of the guarantee corresponds to its relative share in the total gross national income (GNI) of the European Union, based on the 2020 EU budget.\n\nFor more information\n\nProposals for Council Implementing Decision\n\nSURE Regulation\n\nFactsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes SURE\n\nCoronavirus response\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission proposes to provide \u20ac81.4 billion in financial support for 15 Member States under SURE"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1496\/IP_20_1496_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Enda MCNAMARA","phone":"+32 2 296 49 76","email":"Enda.Mcnamara@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["economic affairs","economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2021","date":"24 March","title":"Strengthening the transparency and authorisation mechanism for exports of COVID-19 vaccines","abstract":"<p>The Commission introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_1352\">the principles of reciprocity and proportionality<\/a> as new criteria to be considered for authorising exports under the transparency and authorisation mechanism for COVID-19 vaccine exports.

This system has significantly improved the transparency of exports. Nevertheless, the objective to ensure timely access to COVID-19 vaccines for EU citizens is still not met.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cThe EU is proud to be the home of vaccine producers who not only deliver to EU citizens but export across the globe. While our Member States are facing the third wave of the pandemic and not every company is delivering on its contract, the EU is the only major OECD producer that continues to export vaccines at large scale to dozens of countries. But open roads should run in both directions. This is why the European Commission will introduce the principles of reciprocity and proportionality into the EU's existing authorisation mechanism. The EU has an excellent portfolio of different vaccines and we have secured more than enough doses for the entire population. But we have to ensure timely and sufficient vaccine deliveries to EU citizens. Every day counts.\u201d\n\nTowards increased transparency, reciprocity and proportionality\n\nThe new regulation introduces two changes to the existing mechanism. First, in addition to the impact of a planned export to the fulfilment of the EU's Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs) with vaccine manufacturers, Member States and the Commission should also consider:\n\n\tReciprocity \u2013 does the destination country restrict its own exports of vaccines or their raw materials, either by law or other means? and\n\tProportionality \u2013 are the conditions prevailing in the destination country better or worse than the EU's, in particular its epidemiological situation, its vaccination rate and its access to vaccines.\n\n\nMember States and the Commission should assess whether the requested exports do not pose a threat to the security of supply of vaccines and their components in the Union.\n\nSecond, to gain a full picture of vaccine trade, the new act includes 17 countries previously exempted in the scope of the regulation.*\n\nThe EU remains committed to international solidarity and will therefore continue to exclude from this scheme vaccine supplies for humanitarian aid or destined to the 92 low and middle income countries under the COVAX Advance Market Commitment list.\n\nThe export authorisation scheme\n\nThis implementing act is targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary. It is fully consistent with the EU's international commitment under the World Trade Organization and the G20, and in line with what the EU has proposed in the context of the WTO's trade and health initiative. Member States decide on the requests for authorisation in accordance with the Commission's opinion.\n\nSince the start of this mechanism, 380 export requests to 33 different destinations have been granted for a total of around 43 million doses. Only one export request was not granted. The main export destinations include the United Kingdom (with approximately 10.9 million doses), Canada (6.6 million), Japan (5.4 million), Mexico (4.4 million), Saudi Arabia (1.5 million), Singapore (1.5 million), Chile (1.5 million), Hong Kong (1.3 million), Korea (1.0 million) and Australia (1.0 million).\n\nAbout the EU's vaccine strategy\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June 2020 a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs). Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that are actually purchased by Member States. The APA is therefore a de-risk investment upfront against a binding commitment from the company to pre-produce, even before it gets marketing authorisation. This should allow for a quick and steady delivery as soon as the authorisation has been granted.\n\nThe Commission has so far signed APAs with six companies (AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, BioNTech-Pfizer, CureVac, and Moderna), securing access to up to 2.6 billion doses. Negotiations are advanced with two additional companies. The four contracts with the companies whose vaccines have been granted conditional marketing authorisation amount to more than 1.6 billion doses.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommission Implementing Regulation\n\nPress release on the extension of the measure (11 March 2021)\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n*List of countries included: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Iceland, Lebanon, Libya, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Norway, North Macedonia, Serbia and Switzerland.\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Commission strengthens transparency and authorisation mechanism for exports of COVID-19 vaccines"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_1352\/IP_21_1352_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Miriam GARCIA FERRER","phone":"+32 2 299 90 75","email":"miriam.garcia-ferrer@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Sophie DIRVEN","phone":"+32 2 296 72 28","email":"sophie.dirven@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["trade, agriculture"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/trade.ec.europa.eu\/doclib\/html\/159498.htm","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_1121","https:\/\/trade.ec.europa.eu\/doclib\/html\/159414.htm"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"February 2021","date":"17 February","title":"Launch of the \u201cHERA Incubator\u201d","abstract":"<p>The Commission proposed immediate action to prepare Europe for the increased threat of coronavirus variants, including through the new <strong>European bio-defence preparedness plan called<\/strong><strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_641\">\u201cHERA Incubator\u201d<\/a><\/strong> .

The new European bio-defence preparedness plan against COVID-19 variants called \u201cHERA Incubator\u201d will work with researchers, biotech companies, manufacturers and public authorities in the EU and globally to detect new variants, provide incentives to develop new and adapted vaccines, speed up the approval process for these vaccines, and ensure scaling up of manufacturing capacities.\n\nTaking action now is important as new variants continue to emerge and challenges with scaling up vaccine production are arising. The HERA Incubator will also serve as a blueprint for the EU's long\u2011term preparedness for health emergencies.\n\nKey actions to boost preparedness, develop vaccines for the variants and increase industrial production:\n\n\tDetect, analyse and assess variants\n\tDeveloping specialised tests for new variants, and to support genomic sequencing in Member States with at least \u20ac75 million in EU funding;\n\tReaching the target of 5% of genome sequencing of positive tests to help identify variants, monitor their spread in populations, and screen their impact on transmissibility;\n\tStepping up research and data exchange on variants with \u20ac150 million funding;\n\tLaunching the VACCELERATE COVID-19 clinical trial network, bringing together 16 EU Member States and five associated countries including Switzerland and Israel to exchange data and progressively also include children and young adults as participants in clinical trials.\n\n\n\n\tSpeed up regulatory approval of adapted vaccines: based on the annual influenza vaccine model, the EU will provide accelerated approval for adapted COVID-19 vaccines by:\n\tAdapting the regulatory framework, such as amending the regulatory procedure to enable the approval of an adapted vaccine with a smaller set of additional data submitted to EMA on a rolling basis;\n\tProviding guidance on data requirements for developers from the European Medicines Agency so that the requirements for variants are known in advance;\n\tFacilitating certification of new or repurposed manufacturing sites through early involvement of regulatory authorities;\n\tConsidering a new category of emergency authorisation of vaccines at EU level with shared liability among Member States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRamp up production of COVID-19 vaccines: the EU will:\n\tUpdate or conclude new Advance Purchase Agreements to support the development of new and adapted vaccines through EU funding, with a detailed and credible plan showing capability to produce vaccines in the EU, on a reliable timescale. This should not prevent the EU from considering sources from outside the EU if needed, provided they meet the EU safety requirements;\n\tWork closely with manufacturers to help monitoring supply chains and addressing identified production bottlenecks;\n\tSupport the manufacturing of additional vaccines addressing new variants;\n\tDevelop a voluntary dedicated licensing mechanism to facilitate technology transfer;\n\tSupport cooperation between undertakings;\n\tEnsure the EU's manufacturing capacity by building up the \u201cEU FAB\u201d project.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actions announced today will go hand-in-hand with global cooperation via the World Health Organisation and global initiatives on vaccines. They will also prepare the ground for the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA). HERA will build on the actions launched today and provide a permanent structure for risk modelling, global surveillance, technology transfers, manufacturing capacity, supply chain risk mapping, flexible manufacturing capacity and vaccine and medicine research and development.\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cOur priority is to ensure that all Europeans have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines as soon as possible. At the same time, new variants of the virus are emerging fast and we must adapt our response even faster. To stay ahead of the curve, we are launching today the HERA Incubator. It brings together science, industry and public authorities, and pulls all available resources to enable us to respond to this challenge.\u201d\n\nMargaritis Schinas, Vice-President of the European Commission, said: \u201cIn our fight against the virus we are anticipating problems and acting proactively to mobilise all means to address the impact of variants. With our new bio-defence preparedness plan \u2018HERA Incubator', we are tackling parallel or subsequent series of pandemics deriving from the variants. Today's proposal is the perfect example of what the EU is best at: pooling efforts and complementing them by funding. This is the way to get out from the crisis,\u00a0ready to adapt to new circumstances and united in action - ensuring solidarity across the EU and the world.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cEurope is determined to stay ahead of the threat of new coronavirus variants. The HERA Incubator is an exercise in foresight, anticipation and united response. We can meet the dual challenge of addressing new variants and increasing our vaccine production capacity. It will build bridges between research, industry and regulators to speed up the processes - starting from the detection of variants all the way to the approval and production of vaccines. We need significant investments now and for the future and the HERA Incubator is a crucial part of our response.\u201d\n\nThierry Breton, Commissioner for the Internal Market, said: \u201cThe Task Force for ramping-up vaccine production is already engaging on a daily basis with industry to better address and anticipate potential bottlenecks. With this increased cooperation, we will ensure that the industrial phase of vaccine production allows manufacturers to meet their commitments while anticipating our future needs and adjusting vaccine production to future variants. Today, with HERA incubator, we are providing a strong structural response.This is not only about short term fixes: it will contribute to a higher level of autonomy in the area of health in the near future for our Continent.\u201d\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cResearch and innovation continue to be crucial in fighting the continuing challenges of this pandemic. The HERA Incubator and the reinforcement of European infrastructures and networks, supported by additional funding from Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe programmes, will help us deal with any variants and be better prepared for future outbreaks.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nThe EU Vaccine Strategy has secured access to 2.6 billion vaccine doses as part of the broadest global portfolio of safe and secure COVID-19 vaccines. Less than a year since the virus appeared for the first time in Europe, vaccination has started across all Member States. This is a remarkable achievement of European and global advanced research and vaccine development, condensing what usually takes 5-10 years in just over 10 months.\n\nAt the same time, there are challenges to scale-up industrial vaccine production to keep pace. In order to boost production capacity in Europe, a much closer, more integrated and more strategic public-private cooperation with industry is needed. In this spirit, the Commission has set-up a Task Force for Industrial Scale-up of COVID-19 vaccines to detect and help respond to issues in real-time.\n\nEurope now also needs to stay ahead of the curve as new and emerging threats continue to appear in the present or on the horizon. The most immediate of these are emerging and multiplying variants already spreading and developing in Europe and across the world. Presently, authorised vaccines are considered effective against the variants we are aware of. However, Europe must be ready and prepared for the possibility of future variants being more or fully resistant to existing vaccines.\n\nFor More Information \n\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council : HERA Incubator: Anticipating together the threat of COVID-19 variants\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nFactsheet\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Coronavirus response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: preparing Europe for the increased threat of variants"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_641\/IP_21_641_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Vivian LOONELA","phone":"+32 2 296 67 12","email":"vivian.loonela@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Sonya GOSPODINOVA","phone":"+32 2 296 69 53","email":"sonya.gospodinova@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Federica MICCOLI","phone":"+32 2 295 83 00","email":"federica.miccoli@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["coordinating spokesperson for the European Green Deal","education, youth, sport and culture","defence industry and space","Internal Market, defence industry and space","public health","internal market and industry","regional policy","environment","structural reforms","maritime affairs and fisheries"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/communication-hera-incubator-anticipating-together-threat-covid-19-variants_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_21_642","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_21_650","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/coronavirus-response\/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"December 2020","date":"21 December","title":"Commission authorises first safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19","abstract":"<p>The European Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2466\">granted a conditional marketing authorisation<\/a> for the COVID\u201119 vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, making it the first COVID-19 vaccine authorised in the EU.

This authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States.\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cToday we add an important chapter to a European success story. We approved the first safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19. More vaccines will come soon. Doses of the vaccine approved today will be available for all EU countries, at the same time, on the same conditions. The upcoming European vaccination days will also be a great moment of unity. This is a good way to end this difficult year, and to start turning the page on this pandemic. We are all in this together.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cThis is a big day for Europe. It is a day of true European solidarity in action. After\u00a0\u00a0months of \u00a0work, we are seeing our EU Vaccines Strategy bear fruit \u2013 access to safe, effective and affordable vaccines at the same time for all Member States. Today we witness what can be achieved collectively when we work together in a strong European Health Union. A Europe that cares and that supports. A Europe that leaves no stone unturned.\u201d\n\nBioNTech and Pfizer made a formal application for a conditional marketing authorisation on 1 December. This followed the analysis of their data in a \u2018rolling review' by EMA as from 6 October. Thanks to this rolling review, EMA managed to assess the conditional marketing authorisation application very rapidly. This procedure, specifically designed for emergency situations, ensures as swift an assessment as possible while ensuring that all requirements in terms of safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine are fully and thoroughly evaluated.\n\nOn the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional market authorisation.\n\nThe BioNTech\/Pfizer vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. This allows cells to manufacture harmless fragments of viral proteins that the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight subsequent, natural infection. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce fragments of the \u2018spike protein', a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells, to replicate, and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences \u2014 antibodies and T cells \u2014 against it.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Commission, the Member States and the company are now working towards the delivery of the first doses on 26 December, so that the EU vaccination days can start on 27 \u2013 28 \u2013 29 December.\n\nDeliveries will continue in December and on a steady weekly basis during the following months. Distribution of the full 200 million doses is scheduled to be completed by September 2021. The Commission and the Member States are working to activate the additional 100 million doses.\n\nBackground\n\nA conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However, once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks.\n\nOn 1 December 2020, EMA received an application for a CMA for the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. However, and since 6 October, EMA has already been assessing data on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality and results from laboratory studies and clinical trials in the context of a rolling review. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.\n\nThe European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, informational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional market authorisation.\n\nFor More Information\n\nStatement by President von der Leyen\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nQuestions and Answers: COVID-19 vaccination in the EU\n\nQuestions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nEU's legislation on medicinal products\n\nEMA and COVID-19 vaccines\n\nFactsheet: How vaccines work\n\nFactsheet: Health benefits of vaccines\n\nFactsheet: Authorisation process\n\nFactsheet: Long-term safety\n\nEU's current portfolio\n\n","detail_title":["European Commission authorises first safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2466\/IP_20_2466_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/statement_20_2510","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?qid=1597339415327&uri=CELEX:52020DC0245","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_2467","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_2390","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/coronavirus-response\/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/health\/human-use_en","https:\/\/www.ema.europa.eu\/en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2363","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2364","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2245","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2365","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_2244"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Working time and working time flexibility","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"December 2020","date":"22 December","title":"Recommendation on EU coordinated approach to travel and transport in response to new variant of coronavirus in the UK","abstract":"<p>Following the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in parts of England, of which a large proportion belongs to a new variant of the virus, the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2520\">Commission adopted a Recommendation<\/a> on a coordinated approach to travel and transport measures.

The recommendation builds on the Council Recommendation of 13 October on a coordinated approach to free movement in response to the COVID19-pandemic and several other guidance documents adopted by the Commission in the past months, in particular the Green Lanes Communication. While it is important to take swift temporary precautionary action to limit the further spread of the new strain of the virus and all non-essential travel to and from the UK should be discouraged, essential travel and transit of passengers should be facilitated. Flight and train bans should be discontinued given the need to ensure essential travel and avoid supply chain disruptions.\n\nCommissioner for Justice, Didier\u00a0Reynders, said:\u00a0\u201cGiven the current uncertainties and in light of the precautionary principle, Member States should take coordinated action to discourage non-essential travel between the UK and the EU. At the same time, blanket travel bans should not prevent thousands of EU and UK citizens from returning to their homes. While precautions are needed to contain the spread of the new coronavirus variant, with today's Recommendation, we therefore ensure that the restrictions are coordinated and provide for the necessary exemptions for citizens and residents returning home and other essential travellers.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said: \u201cSince March, the Commission has developed solid recommendations on internal and external border control for Member States to follow. This track record allows us to\u00a0address\u00a0the evolving situation and the new challenges that the pandemic poses. To be effective, our actions must be coordinated and today we are facilitating swift action to address the new coronavirus variant while ensuring that essential journeys can still take place.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Transport, Adina V\u0103lean, said: \u201cWith today's recommendation we offer clarity to the Member States on how to keep the connectivity and ensure transport services following the discovery of the new strain of the COVID virus. Within the EU, it is crucial that transport workers are exempted from any restrictive measures, as quarantine and testing. We have to continue to maintain the supply chains intact, in line with our Green Lanes Communication.\u201d\n\nUntil the end of December, free movement rules still apply to the UK. This means that Member States should not in principle refuse the entry of persons travelling from the UK. After the end of the transition period, the UK will be subject to Council Recommendation on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction.\n\nThe Commission recommends to Member States that:\n\n\tThey should implement the principles of the October Council Recommendation on coordinating free movement restrictions. In the light of the precautionary principle, all non-essential travel to and from the UK should be discouraged until further notice.\n\tHowever, Union citizens and UK citizens travelling to their Member State or country of residence as well as third-country nationals that enjoy EU free movement rights should be exempted from further temporary restrictions provided that they undergo a test or quarantine.\n\tTravellers with an essential function, for instance medical staff, should be required to undergo a test (RT-PCR test or a rapid antigen test within 72 hours prior to departure), but should not be required to undergo quarantine while exercising this essential function.\n\tTransport staff, within the EU, should be exempted from any travel ban across any border and from testing and quarantine requirements when they are travelling across a border to and from a vessel, vehicle, or aircraft. Where a Member State, in the specific context of the situation between the EU and the UK and in the coming days, requires rapid antigen tests for transport workers, this should not lead to transport disruptions.\n\tTransit of passengers, especially for essential travel, should be facilitated without quarantine. A test can be required, but authorities need to inform about such requirement in advance or offer testing during the journey.\n\tGiven the need to ensure essential travel and transit home as described in the recommendation, any prohibition of transport services, such as flight or train bans, should be discontinued.\n\tCargo flows need to continue uninterrupted, in accordance with the Green Lanes and the Air Cargo Communication, not least to ensure the timely distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, for example.\n\tThe public health authorities of the Member States should increase sequencing efforts and analyse virus isolates in a timely manner to swiftly identify cases of the new variant. They should also immediately identify cases involving persons who travelled to or from the UK in the past 14 days or who are close contacts of confirmed cases in order to ensure the appropriate follow up (eg. RT-PCR testing, isolation, enhanced contact tracing).\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nIn line with Article 126 of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, the transition period agreed by the parties will expire on 31 December 2020.\n\nAs of 1 January 2021, the United Kingdom will become a third country and Member States shall start applying the Recommendation on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU to persons travelling from the UK, in view of the end of the transition period. Accordingly, in principle only essential travel may take place from the United Kingdom. In order to benefit from an exemption from this general travel restriction, the Council would need to decide to add the United Kingdom to the list of third countries whose residents should not be affected by temporary external borders restriction on non-essential travel to the EU. The list is reviewed regularly by Member States in the Council.\n\nHowever, this limitation to essential travel shall not apply to Union citizens resident in the UK and UK nationals who are long-term residents in an EU Member States under the Long-term Residence Directive, independent of the purpose of travel.\n\nBackground\n\nThis year the Commission has played an important role in ensuring both the free movement of people and the free movement of goods within the European Union.\n\nThe Commission adopted a number of guidance documents on Green Lanes, including its Communication in October upgrading the concept of Green Lanes to cover not only road but also rail, waterborne freight and air cargo, to ensure that essential supply chains continue to function and to avoid any disruption of freight and logistics in the EU in the second wave of the pandemic.\n\nOn 30 June, the Council adopted a Recommendation on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction. In that Recommendation, the Council adopted a common approach with regard to the temporary restriction of non-essential travel as agreed by the Heads of State or Government of the EU on 17 March 2020 and the gradual lifting of such restriction.\n\nIn September, the Commission made a proposal for a Council Recommendation on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which was adopted on 13 October.\n\nA well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on the freedom of movement of people and goods is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, safeguard the health of citizens as well as maintain free movement within the Union, under safe conditions. This is important for the millions of citizens who rely on frictionless cross-border travel every day, and crucial for our efforts to start safely re-building the economy.\n\nFor More Information\n\nRecommendation on a coordinated approach to travel and transport in response to the SARS-COV-2 variant observed in the United Kingdom\n\nRecommendation on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement\n\nRecommendation on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU\n\nFrequently asked questions on the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union\n\n","detail_title":["Commission adopts Recommendation on EU coordinated approach to travel and transport in response to new variant of coronavirus in the UK"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2520\/IP_20_2520_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Christian WIGAND","phone":"+32 2 296 22 53","email":"christian.wigand@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Ciara BOTTOMLEY","phone":"+32 2 296 99 71 ","email":"ciara.bottomley@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"J\u00f6rdis FERROLI","phone":"+32 2 299 27 29","email":"jordis.ferroli@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["Rule of Law","Equality","justice, equality and rule of law","migration, home affairs and citizenship","Justice and Consumers","public health and food safety","security union","transport"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/commission-recommendation-coordinated-approach-travel-and-transport-response-sars-cov-2-variant-observed-united-kingdom_en","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/FR\/TXT\/?uri=CELEX%3A32020H1475","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=CELEX%3A32020H0912","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_104"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"15 April","title":"Further steps towards safe and reliable testing","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_659\">Guidelines on coronavirus testing methodologies<\/a> were presented by the Commission.

The guidance aims to support Member States in effectively using testing tools in the context of their national strategies and during the different stages of the pandemic, including when phasing out confinement measures. The Commission also aims to ensure that high-quality tools are available to assess the performance of the tests.\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cThe capacity to perform large-scale testing is key to detecting and slowing down the coronavirus pandemic and is a crucial pre-condition for a gradual return to our normal way of life. The main priority for us all is to fight the virus and protect our citizens from further exposure and infection, and to do so, we need to know where the virus is. In the absence of a vaccine, safe and reliable testing is our best bet to protect our health care workers, the most vulnerable of our citizens and our societies at large. This is a cornerstone of our roadmap towards lifting coronavirus containment measures.\u201d \n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: \u201cWe have been working hard to analyse the information on the quality assurance of the coronavirus tests and devices that are currently being used. The results show that there is a mismatch between the existing quality and what could be expected to ensure good performance of the tests. The European Commission has therefore developed test performance criteria which aim to improve the overall performance of these tests. This will benefit all European citizens and is a key part for of the exit strategy from the current crises.\u201d\n\nThe availability of reliable data over time is key to lifting containment measures. In order to achieve this, there needs to be sufficient monitoring of the progression of the coronavirus pandemic, including through large-scale testing.\n\nIn its guidelines, the Commission calls on manufacturers to produce \u201cstate of the art\u201d testing kits. Although the science relating to testing is still evolving rapidly, this obligation is important as the information provided by these test kits is used for crucial public health decisions.\n\nGiven the importance of tests in the current situation and the rapid development of the pandemic, the Commission is also insisting on pooling resources for the validation of coronavirus tests at EU-level. It is important to centralise the validation and to share the results at EU and international level.\n\nIn order to ensure the highest possible testing quality, make sure that tests are correctly used and further align the evaluation and validation of test device performance, the Commission is proposing to launch the following actions in the coming weeks:\n\n\tan assessment of common approaches in national strategies;\n\tthe sharing of information on the performance of tests;\n\tthe establishment of a network of coronavirus reference laboratories across the EU to facilitate the exchange of information, and the management and distribution of control samples;\n\tthe drafting of further guidance on performance evaluation and conformity assessment following additional dialogue with the industry and national competent authorities;\n\tmaking available tools for assessment of performance, such as reference materials and common methods for the comparison of devices;\n\tthe fight against counterfeit devices through international cooperation and cooperation between Member States' authorities;\n\tthe coordination of supply and demand by EU instruments such as the Clearing House, rescEU and joint procurement;\n\tsolidarity between Member States by ensuring a fair distribution of available stocks and laboratory equipment focussing on where they are most needed.\n\n\nBackground\n\nCurrently, EU legislation lays down a number of requirements for tests. The manufacturer of a test must prepare a technical file, which demonstrates that the test is safe and performs as intended.\n\nThere are currently two categories of tests:\n\n\ttests detecting the virus;\n\ttests detecting antibodies; these tests detect whether the patient has already been exposed to the virus and therefore produced antibodies.\n\n\nAssessing the performance level of a test can be very challenging as the biological materials necessary for this assessment are not always available. Moreover, unified ways to compare tests do not always exist.\n\nMore information\n\nDedicated Commission webpage on the EU's response to the Coronavirus outbreak\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission issues guidelines on testing"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_659\/IP_20_659_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"January 2021","date":"8 January","title":"Up to 300 million additional doses of BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_9\">proposed to the EU countries<\/a> to purchase an additional 200 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by BioNTech and Pfizer, with the option to acquire another 100 million doses.

It is therefore essential that we act decisively and collectively, to contain the spread of the virus and help patients, and to counter the economic fallout.\n\nAfter the videoconference, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \n\n\u201cLet me be very clear: The Commission is working flat out on both fronts.\n\n\tThe European Commission will, in a daily phone conference with the Health Ministers and the Ministers of Internal Affairs, coordinate the necessary measures. \n\tSecondly, the Commission will assemble a team of epidemiologists and virologists from different Member States to give us guidelines on the European level. \n\tThe European Commission is now taking stock of the available protective equipment and respiratory devices as well as their production and distribution capacity. Those are crucial for the entire health sector.\n\tOn research and development, we will reinforce the European initiative to fund targeted research on the Coronavirus.\n\tWe have mobilised \u20ac140 million of public and private funding for promising research on vaccines, diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\nOn the economic front:\n\nFirst and foremost, we must act at the macro-economic level. We will use all the tools at our disposal to make sure the European economy weathers this storm. This requires coordination between Member States, the Commission and the ECB. I am comforted that leaders have called for such a coordinated strategy.\n\nThe Commission will play its full part with no delay. I am working on the following measures to support Member States in their efforts:\n\n\tWe will make sure that state aid can flow to companies that need it;\n\tSecondly, we will make full use of the flexibility which exists in the Stability and Growth Pact;\n\n\nI will come with concrete ideas before the Eurogroup on Monday. So on both these fronts, we will clarify the rules of the game for Member States very quickly.\n\nFinally, I will bring forward a \u201cCorona Response Investment Initiative\u201d directed at\n\n\tthe health care systems,\n\tSMEs,\n\tlabour markets\n\tand other vulnerable parts of our economies. \n\n\nThe investment will be sizable and reach \u20ac25 billion quickly. To realise this, I will propose to Council and Parliament this week to release \u20ac7.5 billion of investment liquidity. I will set up a Task Force to work with Member States to ensure that the money starts flowing in the coming weeks.\n\nToday marks an important step in a coordinated response that the 27 Heads of State and Government, the President of the European Council and the Commission have been calling for. Now it is time for action.\u201d\n\nCorona Response Investment Initiative \u2013 how will it work?\n\nIn order to quickly direct \u20ac25 billion of European public investment to deal with the fallout of the Coronavirus crisis, the Commission will propose to relinquish this year its obligation to request refunding of unspent pre-financing for European structural and investment funds currently held by Member States.\n\nThe Member States will be required to use these amounts to speed up their investments under the structural funds. They will use this for the national co-financing they would normally have had to provide themselves in order to receive the next tranches of their structural fund envelopes. In view of the average co-financing rates across Member States, the \u20ac7.5 billion will be able to trigger the release and use of some \u20ac17.5 - \u20ac18 billion of structural funding across the EU.\n\nThis proposal can be implemented through a modification of the common provision regulation for the structural funds.\u00a0 The Commission will make this proposal to Council and Parliament this week. The national operational programmes would then be adapted, where necessary, to channel the funding towards areas such as short-term work measures, the health sector, labour market measures, and sectors particularly affected in the current circumstances.\n\nFor More Information\n\nWebsite on the Coronavirus Response\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus crisis: \u201cCommission will use all the tools at its disposal to make sure the European economy weathers the storm\u201d"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_440\/IP_20_440_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Eric MAMER","phone":"+32 2 299 40 73","email":"eric.mamer@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Dana SPINANT","phone":"+32 2 299 01 50","email":"dana.spinant@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":[],"for_more_information_links":[],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"17 April","title":"Unique EU consular operation brought home over 500,000 EU citizens from abroad","abstract":"<p>As of 17 April, the EU has managed in an <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_686\">unprecedented repatriation effort<\/a> to bring home over half a million of its citizens who were affected by coronavirus travel restrictions across the world.

At the beginning of the outbreak, around 600,000 EU citizens declared themselves stranded outside the EU. Most of them in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas. Intense efforts by the EU in terms of consular cooperation, EU funded repatriation flights and coordination have managed to bring home as of today already more than 500,000 of them. This concerns EU short-term travellers outside the EU. In March, the European Council tasked the High Representative\/Vice-President Josep Borrell\u00a0to coordinate the repatriation operations of the EU citizens and a dedicated Consular Task Force was set up by the European External Action Service. This Task Force works in close cooperation with the Member States and the European Commission. In an unprecedented effort, the Commission's Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) has co-financed and co-organised almost 200 flights that have brought back home around 45,000 EU citizens. This massive and historically unique consular cooperation of the EU Member States and EU institutions has also benefitted citizens from other partner countries, such as Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK, with 5,000 of their citizens being repatriated with EU flights. Currently, there are still around 98,900 EU citizens stranded abroad and efforts are ongoing to bring them home in the coming days. Find out more about the different stories and experiences from EU citizens repatriated thanks to the EU and Member States here\u00a0and on Twitter #WeTakeYouHome. A summary table of the repatriation flights is also available online.

The development of such apps and their take up by citizens can have a significant impact on the treatment of the virus and can play an important role in the strategy to lift containment measures, complementing other measures like increased testing capacities.\u00a0It is therefore important to ensure that EU citizens can fully trust such innovative digital solutions and can embrace them without fear. Especially when it comes to tracing apps, the largest possible participation is necessary to exploit their full potential to trace infection chains and rapidly stop the virus from spreading further.\u00a0EU rules, notably the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive, provide the strongest safeguards of trustworthiness (i.e. voluntary approach, data minimisation, time limitation) for such apps to operate widely and accurately.\u00a0The\u00a0guidance\u00a0aims to offer the necessary framework to guarantee that citizens have sufficient protection of their personal data and limitation of intrusiveness while using such apps. It\u00a0is accompanying an EU toolbox on contact tracing apps. Both follow the recent publication of the Commission Recommendation on a common EU approach for the use of mobile applications and mobile data to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures. The full press release is available online, as well as a video explaining who tracing apps function.

The updated DBP is based on a macroeconomic and budgetary outlook formulated before the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic and is, therefore, no longer realistic.\u00a0 The Austrian authorities are encouraged to present an update of the information given in the DBP in a technical update of the stability programme it has presented in April 2020. The Commission will make an assessment of Member States' stability and convergence programmes against the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact and issue recommendations, taking into account the activation of the general escape clause and the Commission's upcoming spring 2020 forecast. The DBP presented by the Austrian authorities in March 2020 updated the no-policy change DBP submitted in October 2019 by the caretaker government on the basis of unchanged policies.

As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission is today also announcing a contribution of \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \u201cGlobal collaboration is the only way to overcome a global pandemic. Under the Coronavirus Global Response and the Global Goal Unite campaign, we have seen the world come together as one. Almost \u20ac16 billion have been pledged so far and the most talented researchers and organisations are pooling their efforts to deliver vaccines, tests and treatments, which will be our universal, common good. Today, the Commission is announcing a \u20ac400 million contribution to COVAX for working together in purchasing future vaccines to the benefit of low and middle income countries. I'm confident this will bring us closer to our goal: beating this virus, together.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cIt is only by working together globally, in solidarity, that we can defeat the coronavirus. We need an inclusive international approach and as we are showing today, Team Europe \u2013 European Commission and EU Member States - is committed to ensuring the success of the COVAX Facility and facilitating access to a vaccine in an equitable manner for all people across the world.\u201d\u00a0\n\nJutta Urpilainen, Commissioner for International partnerships, said: \u201cOnly by securing equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine across the world will we end the pandemic and ensure a sustainable recovery; working with our partner countries is crucial so that we can build back better and healthier.\u201d\n\nThe COVAX Facility, co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, aims to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.\n\nAs part of a EU joint engagement (Commission, Member States and European financial institutions, notably EIB) to mobilise resources for the Coronavirus Global Response, the Commission intends to mobilise up to \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its underlying objectives as part of a Team Europe effort. The detailed terms and conditions for the EU's participation and contribution will be worked out in the coming days and weeks. Team Europe is ready to put its expertise and resources at work within COVAX to accelerate and scale-up development and manufacturing of a global supply of vaccines for citizens across the world, in poor and rich countries.\n\nThe EU's participation in COVAX will be complementary to the ongoing EU negotiations with vaccine companies that aim at scaling up manufacturing capacity of vaccine producers, contributing to global efforts.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it immediately responded to the WHO's call for action and has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\n\nAs a milestone under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to affordable coronavirus vaccination, treatment and testing, The Global Goal: Unite for our Future campaign was launched by NGO Global Citizen on 28 May under the patronage of President Ursula von der Leyen. \u00a0\n\nOn 4 May, the Commission also proposed a cooperation framework to align global efforts and accelerate progress in developing coronavirus vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics and strengthening health systems: the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT)-Accelerator.\n\nThree partnerships, based on the three priorities of the Coronavirus Global Response, are at its core. They gather industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations to work together on all steps needed to deliver new tools and solutions, from research to manufacturing and deployment.\n\nCOVAX is the vaccines pillar of the ACT-Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access for all countries across the world to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.\n\nCo-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, COVAX was launched at the end of April 2020 at an event co-hosted by the Director-General of the World Health Organization, the President of France, the President of the European Commission, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Since then, the EU has been actively engaged with Gavi, CEPI and other participant countries in the setting up of COVAX governance and financial tools. The final terms of the EU's participation following today's expression of interest still need to be defined.\n\nThe COVAX Facility aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021, by negotiating with a diversified portfolio of vaccine suppliers covering different scientific technologies, time delivery and prices. The COVAX Facility is an insurance mechanism which will reduce risk for manufacturers, concerned about investing without assured demand, and for countries, concerned about failing to secure access to a viable vaccine.\n\nMore Information:\n\nCoronavirus Global Response\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus Global Response: Commission joins the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX)"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1540\/IP_20_1540_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Vivian LOONELA","phone":"+32 2 296 67 12","email":"vivian.loonela@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Stephan MEDER","phone":"+32 2 291 39 17","email":"Stephan.Meder@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["coordinating spokesperson for the European Green Deal","mobility and transport","regional policy","environment","structural reforms","maritime affairs and fisheries","food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"December 2020","date":"7 December","title":"Vaccines and testing kits to be relieved of VAT","abstract":"<p>The Commission welcomed the adoption of important <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/taxation_customs\/agreement-on-crucial-VAT-relief-for-coronavirus-vaccines-and-testing-kits_en\">new measures<\/a> which will enable Member States to relieve EU hospitals, medical practitioners and individuals of Value-Added Tax (VAT) when acquiring coronavirus vaccines and testing kits.

It will enhance regional coordination of the COVID-19 response and strengthen the capacity of health systems in South-East Asia, while paying special attention to vulnerable populations.\n\nCommissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen, announced the programme at the 23rd EU-ASEAN Foreign Affairs Ministers meeting: \u201cThe South-East Asia Pandemic Response and Preparedness programme is part of the European Union's \u20ac350 million solidarity response to support our ASEAN partners in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. Strong regional coordination on access to information, equipment and vaccines is essential for overcoming this crisis. We are in this together and, as partners, stronger together.\u201d\n\nThe programme, with a duration of 42 months, will strengthen the monitoring and testing capacities of ASEAN Member States, as well as the capacity of their health institutions and workers to manage the caseload while maintaining essential health services. The programme will also support timely and transparent communication about the pandemic, and help reach people living in rural and remote areas with information about the preventive measures, symptoms and risks.\n\nBackground\n\nThe EU response to the coronavirus pandemic in the South-East Asian region amounts to \u20ac350 million. Adding the contribution from EU Member States, the Team Europe response reaches a total of more than \u20ac800 million.\n\nTo address the health and socio-economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the EU has reoriented programmes in South-East Asia, while focusing particularly on the need for public communication and research. The EU support to Indonesia, for example, has included digital solutions for tracking COVID-19 expenditures of the Government, helping to ensure their transparency and accountability.\n\nThe EU is a major development cooperation partner of ASEAN and its Member States. In the period 2014-2020, the EU supported the ASEAN Secretariat and ASEAN regional integration with over \u20ac250 million, while bilateral EU support to ASEAN Member States amounted to \u20ac2 billion.\n\nRegional development cooperation programmes focus mainly on connectivity through sustainable economic integration and trade; climate change, environment and disaster management; comprehensive EU-ASEAN policy dialogue in joint areas of interest; higher education and student mobility in ASEAN; and the elimination of violence against women and girls and support to the rights and opportunities of women migrant workers.\n\nThe ASEAN-EU Dialogue on Sustainable Development, started in 2017, is an important high-level policy platform for exchanges on sustainable development cooperation.\n\nASEAN includes 10 Member States: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nFor More Information:\n\nASEAN-EU Dialogue on Sustainable Development\n\nFactshhet: Team Europe supports ASEAN in the fight against\u00a0 COVID-19\n\n","detail_title":["Team Europe COVID-19 response: EU announces \u20ac20 million to support health systems in ASEAN "],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2242\/IP_20_2242_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Gesine KNOLLE","phone":"+32 2 295 43 23","email":"gesine.knolle@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","international cooperation and development"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/international-partnerships\/news\/asean-eu-dialogue-sustainable-development-towards-achieving-sustainable-development-goals_en","https:\/\/eeas.europa.eu\/sites\/eeas\/files\/20200721_factsheet_team_europe_asean_en.pdf"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"August 2020","date":"11 August","title":"EU funding for 23 new coronavirus research projects","abstract":"<p>The Commission will <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1460\">support 23 new research projects<\/a> with EUR 128 million under Horizon 2020, the EU\u2019s research and innovation programme.

The funding under Horizon 2020, the EU's research and innovation programme, is part of the Commission's \u20ac1.4 billion pledge to the Coronavirus Global Response initiative, launched by President Ursula von der Leyen in May 2020.\n\nThe 23 projects shortlisted for funding involve 347 research teams from 40 countries, including 34 participants from 16 countries outside of the EU. The funding will enable researchers to address the pandemic and its consequences by strengthening the industrial capacity to manufacture and deploy readily available solutions, develop medical technologies and digital tools, improve understanding of behavioural and socio-economic impacts of the pandemic, and to learn from large groups of patients (cohorts) across Europe. These research actions complement earlier efforts to develop diagnostics, treatments and vaccines.\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cEmergency funding from Horizon 2020 will enable researchers to rapidly develop solutions with and for patients, care workers, hospitals, local communities and companies. The results will help them to better cope with and survive coronavirus infections. It's encouraging to see the research community mobilise so rapidly and strongly.\u201d\n\nThierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, added: \"The excellent response to this call shows the wealth of new ideas to tackle coronavirus, including new digital health solutions. Digital solutions and technologies enabled us to stay connected and interact with each other during the confinement. They will also be an essential part of the long-term response to this virus and to increasing our resilience.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Commission is currently negotiating grant agreements with the selected beneficiaries. The new projects will cover:\n\n\tRepurposing manufacturing for rapid production of vital medical supplies and equipment needed for testing, treatment and prevention \u2013 for instance using injection moulding and additive manufacturing (3-D printing), adaptive production and supply chain methods, and repurposing manufacturing as a service network for fast reaction.\n\tDeveloping medical technologies and digital tools to improve detection, surveillance and patients' care \u2013 for example through the development of new devices for faster, cheaper and easier diagnosis (including remotely) plus new technologies to protect healthcare workers.\u00a0\n\tAnalysing behavioural and socio-economic impacts of the responses of government and public health systems, for instance on mental health, including gender-specific aspects in risk factors and the socioeconomic burden, to develop inclusive guidance for policymakers and health authorities and enhance preparedness for future similar events.\n\tLearning from large groups of patients (cohorts) by connecting existing cohorts in the EU and beyond to assess their exposure to certain risk factors to better understand the possible causes of disease in order to improve responsiveness to the virus and future public health threats.\n\tEnhancing collaboration of existing EU and international cohorts by networking research institutions that are collecting data on patient care to enable studies into patient's characteristics, risk factors, safety and effectiveness of treatments and potential strategies against coronavirus.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThis second emergency request for expressions of interest, launched by the Commission on 19 May 2020 gave researchers just under 4 weeks to prepare collaborative research projects. The research community mobilised rapidly. Research proposals were fast-tracked through evaluation by independent experts, enabling the Commission to shortlist a number of projects of excellent scientific quality and high potential impact. Although funding is conditional on a final Commission decision and the signature of the Horizon 2020 Grant Agreement, the research teams can already start their work.\n\nMany of the 23 short-listed projects have an international dimension beyond the EU and associated countries, with 34 organisations involved from 16 countries outside of the EU including countries associated to the Horizon 2020 programme (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland and Turkey) and third countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Columbia, Congo, Gabon, India, Korea, South Africa and the United States).\n\nThis new special call under Horizon 2020 complements earlier actions to support 18 projects with \u20ac48.2 million to develop diagnostics, treatments, vaccines and preparedness for epidemics, as well as the \u20ac117 million invested in 8 projects on diagnostics and treatments through the Innovative Medicines Initiative, and measures to support innovative ideas through the European Innovation Council.

It will help immunise 300 million children around the world and finance vaccine stockpiles to shield against outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\nToday's Global Vaccine Summit organised by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is an important milestone in strengthening health systems and immunisation capacities of the world's most vulnerable countries. This is instrumental in reaching the objectives of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\nAt the Coronavirus Global Response pledging event co-hosted by the European Commission on 4 May, more than \u20ac1.5 billion was pledged for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, including \u20ac488 million for deploying, once available, a vaccine against coronavirus.\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said, \u201cVaccines can only save lives if everyone who needs them can access them, especially in the most vulnerable communities and regions of the world. This is why Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance's work is so important. It gives developing countries the means to build stronger health systems and immunisation programmes, to make the world a safer place. I am glad that the European Commission can support Gavi in such a crucial endeavour. This will help us overcome this pandemic and avoid another.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen said, \u201cBuilding up immunisation systems is a fundamental part of the work the EU does with partner countries and Gavi to strengthen health systems, which will be more important than ever on our road to recovery from COVID-19. Improving children's access to basic health care, notably effective and safe vaccines, was key to almost halving global child mortality between 2000 and 2017. Ensuring more vulnerable children have continued access to vaccines will be key for our collective success over the next five years.\u201d\n\nThe new Commission pledge of \u20ac300 million represents more than its total contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance so far. The funding will help:\n\n\tVaccinate 300 million children and save up to 8 million lives.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tEnsure the successful transition of some countries into self-financing.\n\tLeverage US$ 3.6 billion in national co-financing and self-funded vaccine programmes.\n\tDeliver over 3.2 billion doses of life-saving vaccines to 55 countries.\n\tFacilitate 1.4 billion contacts between families and health services through vaccination.\n\tInsure the world against the re-emergence of polio through routine inactivated polio vaccine programmes in collaboration with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.\n\tFund vaccine stockpiles for emergency use to stop dangerous outbreaks.\n\n\nToday's pledge is made under the assumption that the EU's new\u00a0Multiannual Financial Framework and in particular the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), where the funds pledged for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, would come from, are adopted broadly along the lines proposed by the European Commission. On 2 June, the Commission proposed to increase NDICI funding for 2021-2027 to \u20ac86 billion in 2018 prices (\u20ac96.4 billion in current prices), including \u20ac10.5 billion from the new \u2018Next Generation EU'.\n\nBackground\n \n\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is a non-profit global public-private partnership, based in Geneva. Gavi's model is designed to leverage financial resources and expertise, bringing together governments and vaccine manufacturers in both industrialised and developing countries, key UN agencies, public health and research institutions, private sector and civil society, to save lives and protect health by increasing access to new and underused vaccines in poor countries. By August 2019, Gavi had helped avert 13 million deaths through routine immunisation for more than 760 million people as well as campaigns in 74 countries to immunise more than 960 million people.\n\nGavi is one of the 12 global health initiatives that have committed to working better together in the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Wellbeing for All, launched during the High Level Event at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019.\n\nThe Coronavirus Global Response builds on the commitment made by G20 leaders on 26 March to present a united front against the pandemic. With this in mind, on 24 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) and an initial group of health actors launched a global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global Access to COVID-19 Tools \u2013 the ACT Accelerator. Together, they issued a call to action.\n\nThe European Commission responded to this call by joining forces with global partners to host a pledging event \u2013 the Coronavirus Global Response Initiative \u2013 as of 4 May 2020.\n\nThe Coronavirus Global Response has so far raised \u20ac9.8 billion.

In addition, over \u20ac148 million will be granted to another 36 companies set to contribute to the recovery plan for Europe, bringing the total investment from Horizon 2020, the EU's research and innovation programme, to \u20ac314 million in this round.\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cThe enormous talent and breakthrough ideas of innovative European companies give us hope. Our increased support to the European Innovation Council will unlock their potential so that we can better tackle the coronavirus and support our recovery. The EIC responded quickly to the coronavirus crisis and demonstrated the agility and impact of EU funding.\u201d\n\nThe selected 36 companies that will contribute to the fight against the coronavirus will work on pioneering projects, such as on expanding the production of bio-decontamination wipes, developing ventilation monitoring systems that provide first aiders with real-time feedback on the quality of the ventilation given to the patient, developing an antibody platform to treat severe cases of infection, and many more. Furthermore, 139 companies tackling the coronavirus that could not receive funding in this round due to budget limitations have received the newly introduced COVID-19 Seal of Excellence, in recognition of the value of their proposal and in order to help them attract support from other funding sources.\n\nAn additional 36 companies, set to support the recovery plan for Europe, will work across a multitude of sectors and projects, which include for example the development of stronger and taller wind turbine towers made from wood modules, with the potential to massively reduce wind energy costs, an organic fertilizer production system, and a blockchain-based solution for sustainable recycling practices of manufacturers. And, another 679 Seals of Excellence were awarded to high-quality proposals who passed the EIC funding criteria, but could not be funded due to limited budget.\n\nA record number of almost 4000 start-ups and small and medium businesses (SMEs) applied to the EIC Accelerator pilot in March, of which over 1400 proposed innovations relevant to the coronavirus outbreak. This is why an extra \u20ac150 million was recently allocated to this funding round, bringing the combined total to over \u20ac314 million. The start-ups and SMEs selected for support come from 16 countries, including 12 EU Member States, the UK and 3 associated countries.\n\nBackground\n\nOut of the \u20ac314 million of EIC funding awarded, \u20ac174 million will be in the form of equity investments. Since its introduction in mid-2019, the EIC Accelerator pilot has offered the option of direct equity investments, up to \u20ac15 million, in addition to the grant support, up to \u20ac2.5 million. More than 10,000 start-ups and SMEs have applied so far with a total financial request for of over \u20ac26 billion. Of the 72 companies awarded support today, 46 are due to receive equity support.\n\nEquity investments are subject to an in-depth due diligence exercise, and will be managed by the future EIC Fund, which will actively seek out co-investors. EIC supported companies also benefit from a wide range of coaching, mentoring and advisory\/business acceleration services. For the first time these services will be offered to COVID-19 Seal of Excellence companies.\n\nThe EIC support to breakthrough ideas tackling the coronavirus is part of the joint EU effort to overcome the crisis. On 4 May, the Commission hosted a Coronavirus Global Response\u00a0pledging event, where \u20ac9.8 billion have been raised so far. The Commission pledged \u20ac1.4 billion during this\u00a0pledging event, of which\u00a0\u20ac1 billion\u00a0comes through\u00a0Horizon 2020 and is aimed at\u00a0ensuring collaborative development and universal deployment of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus. In the end of May the Commission announced the next steps in the\u00a0Coronavirus Global Response, namely the launch of a new campaign with the international advocacy organisation\u00a0Global Citizen,\u00a0\u201cGlobal Goal: Unite For Our Future\u201d,\u00a0that will culminate in a Global Pledging Summit on 27 June.\n\nFurthermore,the Commission has recently put forward its\u00a0proposal\u00a0for a major recovery plan for Europe.\u00a0 To ensure the recovery is sustainable, even, inclusive and fair for all Member States, the Commission is proposing to create\u00a0a\u00a0new recovery instrument, Next Generation EU,\u00a0embedded within a powerful, modern and revamped long-term EU budget. As part of the recovery instrument Next Generation EU, a \u20ac13.5 billion increase of the Horizon Europe budget is proposed that will be used to provide European support for health and climate-related research and innovation activities, including for breakthrough innovations by startups and SMEs.\n\n*For more information\n\nNew EIC Accelerator projects on coronavirus \n\nList of companies selected for EIC funding\n\nEnhanced European Innovation Council (EIC) pilot\u00a0website\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: EU grants \u20ac314 million to innovative companies to combat the virus and support recovery"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1007\/IP_20_1007_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Johannes BAHRKE","phone":"+32 2 295 86 15","email":"johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marietta GRAMMENOU","phone":"+32 2 298 35 83","email":"marietta.grammenou@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["digital economy","research and innovation"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"1 April","title":"Commission scientists develop new control material for reliable coronavirus-testing","abstract":"<p>European Commission scientists have designed <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_573\">new control material<\/a> that laboratories can use to check the correct functioning of their coronavirus tests and to avoid false negatives.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_573"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_573"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_20_573","detail_metadata":{"type":"Daily news","date":"1 April 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew control material developed by Commission scientists to help prevent coronavirus test failures\n\nEuropean Commission scientists have designed new control material that laboratories can use to check the correct functioning of their coronavirus tests and to avoid false negatives. Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Research and Innovation, responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: \u201cThis is EU science in action when it is needed and where it is needed, to support the EU's response to the current crisis. The JRC quickly identified a potential gap in the management of the coronavirus outbreak and immediately set to work to fill that gap. The new control material has the potential to improve the EU's capacity to respond to the virus outbreak and avoid valuable resources being wasted by inefficient tests.\u201d Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cQuick and reliable laboratory testing is fundamental to our strategy against coronavirus. The work of EU scientists to develop test control material will enable the verification of up to 60 million laboratory tests throughout the EU. This is a major achievement by our researchers, which will be crucial for our exit strategy when the time comes to start lifting social distancing measures.\u201d A recent EU survey identified the lack of positive control materials as one of the top three challenges faced by laboratories for the reliable implementation of coronavirus tests. A positive control material guarantees that laboratory tests are working correctly. It helps to avoid that a test could give a negative result if the person is positive. The JRC-designed control material is a synthetic, non-infectious part of the virus. Today, 3,000 samples of the control material are ready to be dispatched to testing laboratories across the EU. The samples are highly concentrated and only a very small quantity of the material is required to check one test. This means that one sample tube is enough for one laboratory to check up to 20,000 tests. Thus the 3,000 samples that are now ready make it possible to check up to 60 million tests throughout the EU. Further information and guidelines for orders are available here. Find more information on the material here.

As a result, European consumers will be able to save on their household bills, help reach EU-wide energy saving goals and reduce emissions. External power supplies are power adaptors used to convert electricity from household power mains into lower voltages, and are very common in European homes, with an average of ten per household and more than 2 billion in total in the EU. The new EU rules will make these external power supplies more energy efficient, aligning them to the highest standards worldwide. It is expected that electricity savings of over 4 TWh\/year by 2030 will be generated, enough to power the whole of Latvia for a month. This will result in avoiding greenhouse gas emission of more than 1.4 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year from 2030 onwards. External power supplies are used, for example, in consumer electronics (smartphones, loudspeakers, sound systems, televisions), ICT products (modems, routers, laptops, tablets, electronic displays), small kitchen appliances (blenders, juicers), and personal convenience products (shavers, electric toothbrushes). The ecodesign regulation for external power supplies is part of a broader package of measures adopted last year, consisting of 10 ecodesign and 6 energy labelling regulations. The full package is expected to deliver a total of 167 TWh of final energy savings per year by 2030. This is equivalent to the annual energy consumption of Denmark. The cumulative savings correspond to a reduction of over 46 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year from 2030 onwards. More information is available here.

EU legislation already provides public buyers in Member States with flexible solutions for rapidly satisfying urgent needs such as purchasing personal protective equipment, medicines and ventilators, to be supplied to those who need them as quickly as possible. Commissioner Breton, in charge of the Internal Market, said: \u201cPublic buyers are under immense pressure in the current emergency situation to ensure the availability of personal protective equipment such as face masks and protective gloves, of lifesaving ventilators and other medical supplies for all of those working relentlessly in the face of this crisis. I want to help them by fully explaining all the flexibilities and solutions provided by the EU public procurement framework to buy such material fast. The current coronavirus crisis presents an extreme and unforeseeable urgency \u2013 precisely for such a situation our European rules enable public buyers to buy within a matter of days, even hours, if necessary. I urge all public buyers to fully exploit these flexibilities and to not hesitate and ask for further guidance from the Commission if needed.\u201d The guidance outlines the options and flexibilities provided by the EU legislation. It provides an overview of the choice of tendering procedures available to public buyers and applicable deadlines. The guidance points out possibilities, which range from considerable shortening of the generally applicable deadlines to procuring without prior publication of tender notices in exceptional circumstances, such as the extreme urgency linked to the fight against the coronavirus. It also provides clarification for example on how in this situation of scarcity of key supplies public buyers could find alternative solutions and ways of engaging with the market. The guidance is available here.

The Commission has from the outset coordinated the exchange of information and recommendations with regard to cross border health actions and measures. A continued vigilance and fast response from the Commission and the Member States is essential to ensure that the spread of the virus can be contained and new, generalised lockdowns can be avoided.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Communication focuses on all necessary actions needed to enhance preparedness, including testing and contact tracing, improved public health surveillance and widened access to medical countermeasures such as personal protective equipment, medicines and medical devices. Actions also include measures on healthcare surge capacity, non-pharmaceutical countermeasures, support to minorities and vulnerable persons, and activities to reduce the burden of seasonal influenza.\n\nThe communication lays out a number of priority actions for national authorities, the Commission and EU Agencies:\n\n\tIncreased testing coverage, contact tracing and surveillance by public health bodies to map clusters in order to contain the spread of outbreaks. In addition to the Communication, the Commission adopted today an Implementing Decision\u00a0to support interoperability of mobile tracing and warning apps across national borders in the EU.\n\tEnsuring the smooth supply of personal protective equipment, medicines and medical devices through mechanisms such as emergency joint procurements and strategic EU stockpiles.\n\tMaintaining rapid access to public health surge capacities without neglecting other areas of healthcare, including through financial support for the transport of medical personnel and patients between Member States and the coordination of the deployment of emergency medical teams and equipment to requesting countries through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\tProvision of targeted and localised non-pharmaceutical measures, informed by research and evidence as well as timely information exchange on the effectiveness of re-introduced measures.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tSupporting vulnerable groups such as the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions and those on the margins of society through sharing best practices of testing, care, and treatment, including in mental health and psychosocial support.\n\tReducing the burden of seasonal flu to avoid additional pressure on the already-stretched health care systems, through increased vaccination coverage and other means such as ensuring additional national procurements for influenza vaccines.\n\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nMargaritis Schinas, Vice-President for Promoting the European Way of Life, said: \"We now know more about the virus but our duty is to remain vigilant and preventive. The set of measures presented today aim to counter further possible outbreaks of COVID-19. Drawing on the lessons of the past months we are planning ahead to avoid\u00a0improvisation, reinforcing our preparedness on all fronts, preserving the single market and its main freedoms, and facilitating the path towards economic and social recovery across the EU.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cWe have come a long way from the height of the COVID-19 pandemic but the virus is still circulating. Vigilance, preparedness and coordination are indispensable to prevent generalised outbreaks. Today we call for strong and joint action to protect our citizens and will support Member States in doing so. It is our responsibility to ensure that we are fully prepared. Now is not the time to let our guard down.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has put unparalleled pressure across the EU and indeed around the world. Many countries had to face widespread transmission of the virus in the community. The EU and its Member States have introduced measures to mitigate social and economic impacts, such as maintaining the functioning of the internal market, supporting the transport and tourism sectors, protecting employment and supporting medical care services for vulnerable groups. The Commission has also issued recommendations on travel and border measures necessary to protect the health of our citizens while also preserving the internal market.\u00a0\n\nMember States are increasingly coordinating their response, which is absolutely vital in ensuring that the epidemiological situation remains low across the EU. The public health measures taken by the countries helped to decrease the numbers of new infections to a level that was manageable by health systems. This in turn allowed the progressive lifting of the various restrictions imposed and the reopening of most activities, guided by the European roadmap to lifting of coronavirus measures.\n\nThe virus does not stop at EU borders. The Commission will continue to coordinate with other global actors, including the UN and WHO, to ensure the required international response to this global health threat, including equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommunication on short-term EU health preparedness for future COVID-19 outbreaks\n\nFactsheet: Preparing the EU for future COVID-19 outbreaks\n\nCoronavirus: new steps towards setting-up of an interoperability solution for mobile tracing and warning apps\u00a0\n\nCoronavirus website\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission strengthens preparedness for future outbreaks"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1340\/IP_20_1340_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/communication-short-term-eu-health-preparedness-future-covid-19-outbreaks_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_1351","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/newsroom\/sante\/newsletter-specific-archive-issue.cfm?archtype=specific&newsletter_service_id=327&newsletter_issue_id=24111&page=1&fullDate=Wed%2015%20Jul%202020&lang=default ","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"July 2020","date":"29 July","title":"45 EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights deliver over 1,000 tonnes of medical aid","abstract":"<p>Following a new <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1424\">EU Humanitarian Air Bridge<\/a> flight to South Sudan on 29 July carrying 41 tonnes of supplies, the Commission has now coordinated and financed the delivery of over 1,100 tons of medical equipment to critical areas in Africa, Asia and the Americas.

We will continue working both at home in Europe and internationally to support our partners facing this common challenge.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing transport capacities, the EU has also provided diplomatic support to facilitate access for the humanitarian delivery. The EU is coordinating closely with and complementing UN flight operations managed by the World Food Programme.\n\nBackground \n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has brought about huge logistical challenges for the humanitarian community. The EU Humanitarian Air Bridge, part of the Team Europe approach, offers air transport capacity to EU Member States in support of immediate logistical needs of humanitarian actors, including transport of humanitarian supplies and staff to and from third countries and covers 100 % of the transport costs. Through its return flights, the initiative also helps with the transport of humanitarian teams on rotation and assists with the repatriation of EU citizens. \u00a0While needs remain high in many critical areas; the EU's Humanitarian Air Bridge holds up the delivery of vital assistance during the absence of commercial cargo and passenger flights.\n\nFor More Information \n\nEU Humanitarian Air Bridge\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus global response: 45 EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights deliver over 1,000 tonnes of medical aid"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1424\/IP_20_1424_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/echo\/what\/humanitarian-aid\/humanitarian-air-bridge_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":1,"category":"Ensuring business continuity and support for essential services","subcategory":"Wage flexibility ","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"June 2020","date":"24 June","title":"Council agrees on the postponement of certain tax rules","abstract":"<p>The Council <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/press\/press-releases\/2020\/06\/24\/taxation-council-agrees-on-the-postponement-of-certain-tax-rules\/\">adopted an amendment<\/a> to the Directive on administrative cooperation in the area of taxation allowing member states an option to defer by up to 6 months the time limits for the filing and exchange of the following information: automatic exchanges of information on financial accounts of which the beneficiaries are tax residents in another member state, and reportable cross-border tax planning arrangements.<\/p>","presscorner_links":[],"all_links":["https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/press\/press-releases\/2020\/06\/24\/taxation-council-agrees-on-the-postponement-of-certain-tax-rules\/"],"detail_link":null,"detail_metadata":null,"detail_content":null,"detail_title":null,"detail_pdf_link":null,"press_contacts":null,"topics":null,"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"December 2020","date":"18 December","title":"Agreement reached on Recovery and Resilience Facility","abstract":"<p>The Commission welcomed <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2397\">the political agreement<\/a> reached between the European Parliament and the Council on the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

It will make \u20ac672.5 billion in loans and grants available to support reforms and investments undertaken by Member States. It will play a crucial role in mitigating the economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic and making European economies and societies more sustainable, resilient and better prepared for the green and digital transitions.\u00a0\n\nMain elements of agreement\n\nThe agreement, which requires final approval by the European Parliament and the Council, provides that the scope of the RRF will be structured around six pillars: green transition; digital transformation; smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and jobs; social and territorial cohesion; health and resilience; and policies for the next generation, children and youth, including education and skills.\n\nThe European Union has committed to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and the European Council last week backed the Commission's proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Member States should therefore prioritise reforms and investments that support the climate transition. The agreement provides that a minimum of 37% of expenditure on investments and reforms contained in each national recovery and resilience plan should support climate objectives. In addition, all investments and reforms must respect the \u201cdo no significant harm\u201d principle, ensuring that they do not significantly harm the environment.\n\nMember States should also ensure a high level of ambition when defining reforms and investments enabling the digital transition as part of their recovery and resilience plans. A minimum of 20% of expenditure on investments and reforms contained in each national plan should support the digital transition.\n\nThe recovery and resilience plans are also expected to contribute to effectively address the challenges identified in relevant country-specific recommendations under the European Semester, the framework for coordinating economic and social policies across the Union.\n\nThe agreement envisages a strong role for the European Parliament in the governance of the RRF. A regular \u201crecovery and resilience dialogue\u201d will enable the Parliament to invite the Commission to discuss different items related to the Facility.\n\nA scoreboard will be established and made publicly available to provide information on progress in the implementation of the RRF and national plans.\n\nMember States will need to put in place strong measures to protect the financial interests of the Union, especially to prevent fraud, corruption and conflicts of interest.\n\nIt was also agreed that 13% of the total amount allocated to Member States will be made available in pre-financing upon the approval of recovery and resilience plans, to ensure that the money starts flowing as soon as possible to support the nascent economic recovery.\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cWe have an unprecedented financial package - the EU Budget and our recovery plan NextGenerationEU - to power our economies. The Recovery and Resilience Facility will be right at the heart of NextGenerationEU. I welcome today's agreement as an important step towards financing the investments and reforms we need to support the economic recovery and laying the foundations for a stronger, more resilient Europe.\u201d\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People, said: \u201cThe EU's three main institutions have now reached political agreement on the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which paves the way for \u20ac672.5 billion in loans and grants. This Facility will support national reforms and investments that will support the recovery and help overhaul of EU economies, making them greener and more digital in an inclusive and socially-fair way. Member States now have the certainty they need to finalise their national plans, so they can access this unprecedented funding. We will support them every step along the way to make the most of this opportunity. Our focus now is to get funds flowing to those who need them most and get the EU's collective recovery fully underway.\u201d\n\nPaolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cThe Recovery and Resilience Facility opens the way for Europe not only to rebuild its economy after the pandemic but to transform it. I want to thank the German Presidency and the European Parliament's negotiators for helping to bring about this robust agreement. We now have a unique chance to deliver on our environmental commitments, to accelerate the digital transition, to boost skills and address inequality. To make a success of this opportunity, the Commission and national authorities must work hand in hand to approve swiftly and then implement effectively a set of ambitious, credible national plans. As this grim year draws to a close, let's look ahead to 2021 with both optimism and determination.\u201d\n\nNext steps\n\nThe text of the Regulation will now have to be finalised at technical level. The European Parliament and the Council must then formally approve the text so that the Regulation can enter into force as soon as possible.\n\nOnce the Regulation is in force, Member States will be able submit their recovery and resilience plans, setting out a coherent package of reforms and investment projects.\n\nBackground\n\nOn 10 November 2020, a political agreement was reached between the European Parliament, EU Member States in the Council as well as the Commission on the next long-term EU budget and NextGenerationEU. As a next step, the legal adoption of the MFF package along with the ratification of the Own Resources Decision is now urgently needed.\n\nOnce adopted, the EU's long-term budget, coupled with the NextGenerationEU initiative, which is a temporary instrument designed to drive the recovery of Europe, will be the largest stimulus package ever financed through the EU budget. A total of \u20ac1.8 trillion will help rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe. It will be a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommission webpage on the Recovery and Resilience Facility\n\nCommission proposal for establishing a Recovery and Resilience Facility\n\n","detail_title":["Commission welcomes political agreement on Recovery and Resilience Facility"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2397\/IP_20_2397_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Enda MCNAMARA","phone":"+32 2 296 49 76","email":"Enda.Mcnamara@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["economic affairs","economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"European Funds|National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2021","date":"14 April","title":"Accelerating the delivery of vaccines\u00a0","abstract":"<p>The European Commission reached an agreement with BioNTech-Pfizer to <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/statement_21_1741\">speed up the delivery of vaccines<\/a>. 50 million additional doses, initially foreseen for the fourth quarter of 2021, will be delivered in the second quarter, starting in April.

We are in a race against time. The faster we reach our target of having 70% of adults in the European Union vaccinated, the better chances we have of containing the virus.\n\nAnd the good news is: Vaccination is picking up speed across Europe! Member States have received over 126 million doses of vaccines as of yesterday. And I am happy to say that today we have reached 100 million vaccinations in the EU. This is a milestone that we can be proud of. Of these 100 million vaccinations, more than a quarter are second doses \u2013 which means that we have now more than 27 million people fully vaccinated.\n\nThis is good news. But as we can see with the announcement by Johnson & Johnson yesterday, there are still many factors that can disrupt the planned delivery schedule of vaccines. It is therefore important to act swiftly, anticipate and adjust whenever possible. We are doing everything in our power to support Europe's vaccination roll-out, also by increasing the supply of vaccines in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThis is why I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with BioNTech-Pfizer to, once again, speed up the delivery of vaccines. 50 million additional doses of BioNTech-Pfizer vaccines will be delivered in quarter 2 of this year, starting in April. Those 50 million doses were initially foreseen for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now, they are available in quarter 2.\n\nThis will bring the total doses delivered by BioNTech-Pfizer to 250 million doses in the second quarter. These doses will be distributed pro-rata to the population, among all the Member States. This will substantially help consolidate the roll-out of our vaccination campaigns. I want to thank BioNTech-Pfizer. It has proven to be a reliable partner. It has delivered on its commitments, and it is responsive to our needs. This is to the immediate benefit of EU citizens.\n\nBut let me also focus on the medium term. To prepare for the future, we are drawing the lessons from the first phase of our answer to the pandemic. It is clear that to defeat the virus decisively, we will need to be prepared for the following: At a certain point in time, we might need booster jabs to reinforce and prolong immunity; and if escape-variants occur, we will need to develop vaccines that are adapted to new variants; and we will need them early and in sufficient quantities. Having this in mind we need to focus on technologies that have proven their worth. mRNA vaccines are a clear case in point.\n\nBased on all this, we are now entering into a negotiation with BioNTech-Pfizer for a third contract. This contract will foresee the delivery of 1.8 billion doses of vaccine over the period of 2021 to 2023. And it will entail that not only the production of the vaccines, but also all essential components, will be based in the EU.\n\nThe negotiations we are launching today \u2013 and hope to conclude very rapidly \u2013 are a further important step in Europe's response to the pandemic. Other contracts, with other companies, may follow. We are in this together. And we will win this fight against the pandemic together.\n\nThank you.\n\n","detail_title":["Statement by President von der Leyen on developments in the Vaccines Strategy"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/statement_21_1741\/STATEMENT_21_1741_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[],"topics":[],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"June 2020","date":"24 June","title":"Supporting Sudan through EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flight","abstract":"<p>On 24 June, the second of two EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights arrived in Sudan, helping humanitarian workers and essential supplies reach people in need and supporting the coronavirus response in the country.

This fully EU-funded Humanitarian Air Bridge flight to Sudan was made possible through a coordinated Team Europe approach, bringing together the European Union, Sweden, France and the Humanitarian Logistics Network.\n\nAhead of the High-Level Sudan Partnership Conference taking place tomorrow, Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management and Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, Secretary of State to the Minister for European and Foreign Affairs of France, arrived in Khartoum to meet the Prime Minister of the Republic of Sudan, H.E. Mr Abdalla Hamdok, as well as other high-level authorities and representatives of the humanitarian community.\n\nCommissioner Lenar\u010di\u010d said: \u201cSudan is at an important juncture in its transition to democracy, as it is implementing reforms that can translate into a better life for its citizens, including the most vulnerable people. The EU is committed to supporting the Transitional Government's efforts for an inclusive peace in the country. It also welcomes the Transitional Government's clear message of openness to the international humanitarian community and the commitment to facilitate humanitarian workers' delivery of aid to remote areas and people in need.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation, Peter Eriksson, said: \u201cSweden has a strong commitment to support Sudan in recent years,\u201d said. \u201cI am proud that we have joined this Team Europe initiative and served as the lead facilitator of the EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to Sudan. With the two flights, we have been able to deliver vital humanitarian supplies and medical equipment and bring humanitarian workers to assist Sudan in countering the COVID-19 pandemic. I welcome this second flight to Sudan that has now landed in Khartoum.\u201d \n\nThe EU's Humanitarian Air Bridge to Sudan is part of the EU's Global Response to the coronavirus pandemic. Through the Global Response, \u20ac6 billion is supporting countries in Africa, of which more than \u20ac120 million was mobilised in Sudan.\n\nAs part of the Team Europe support, the EU is also announcing today the signature of a \u20ac11.5 million programme with the World Health Organization (WHO), of which \u20ac10 million is channelled through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. The programme will address critical needs in health governance, epidemiological surveillance, epidemic preparedness and response in the current coronavirus pandemic, including in Sudan where the focus will be on forcibly displaced people and vulnerable host communities.\n\nOn this occasion, the EU is also marking its support to a humanitarian project of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which will restart operations in Sudan after its expulsion by the previous regime in 2009 has been revoked.\n\nBackground:\n\nSudan faces one the world's largest humanitarian crises, with around 9 million people estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance. Despite the positive political transition process, the country continues to grapple with multiple challenges including a dire economic crisis as well as the desert locust outbreak. Moreover, the coronavirus pandemic adds to the pressure on the country's beleaguered health system.\n\nThe objective of the High-Level Sudan Partnership Conference to be held on 25 June 2020 is precisely to muster the necessary support. During this virtual event co-hosted by the EU, Germany, the United Nations and Sudan, international partners will showcase both their political support as well as pledge further financial assistance in support of Sudan's transition.\n\nEU humanitarian aid in Sudan\n\nThe EU has allocated, since 2011, around \u20ac550 million in funding for aid organisations in the country in response to this complex crisis. The overall humanitarian response in Sudan continues to address the most critical needs, in terms of food, shelter, emergency health care, access to clean water, education and protection assistance.\n\nEU development aid in Sudan\n\nSince 2016, the EU has supported the Sudanese population and the high number of refugees it hosts with development aid up to \u20ac242 million, mostly through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. These funds have been used, among others, to promote peace, support women and youth's economic empowerment, and ensure inclusive and sustainable growth for all. Since the civilian-led government took office in early September 2019, the EU has provided \u20ac88 million in development assistance to support political and economic reforms and contribute to stability and peace in Sudan.\n\nFor more information \n\nFactsheets:\n\nEU Humanitarian Air Bridge\n\nEU Humanitarian Aid in Sudan\n\nEU Development Aid in Sudan\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus response: Team Europe support to Sudan through EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flight"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1180\/IP_20_1180_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Gesine KNOLLE","phone":"+32 2 295 43 23","email":"gesine.knolle@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","international cooperation and development"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"June 2020","date":"10 June","title":"Strengthening action to tackle disinformation","abstract":"<p>The coronavirus pandemic has been accompanied by a massive wave of false or misleading information, including attempts by foreign actors to influence EU citizens and debates.

This follows the tasking by European leaders in\u00a0March 2020 to resolutely counter disinformation and reinforce resilience of European societies. The coronavirus pandemic has been accompanied by a massive wave of false or misleading information, including attempts by foreign actors to influence EU citizens and debates. The Joint Communication analyses the immediate response and proposes concrete action that can be quickly set in motion. \n\nHigh Representative\/Vice-President Josep Borrell said:\u00a0\u201cDisinformation in times of the coronavirus can kill. We have a duty to protect our citizens by making them aware of false information, and expose the actors responsible for engaging in such practices. In today's technology-driven world, where warriors wield keyboards rather than swords and targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns are a recognised weapon of state and non-state actors, the European Union is increasing its activities and capacities in this fight.\u201d\n\nVice-President for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 said:\u00a0\u201cDisinformation waves have hit Europe during the Coronavirus pandemic. They originated from within as well as outside the EU. To fight disinformation, we need to mobilise all relevant players from online platforms to public authorities, and support independent fact checkers and media. While online platforms have taken positive steps during the pandemic, they need to step up their efforts. Our actions are strongly embedded in fundamental rights, in particular freedom of expression and information.\u201d\n\nThe crisis has become a test case showing how the EU and its democratic societies deal with the disinformation challenge. The following aspects are key for a stronger and more resilient EU: \n\nUnderstand: First, it is important to distinguish between illegal content and content that is harmful but not illegal. Then, there are blurred boundaries between the various forms of false or misleading content: from disinformation, which is defined as intentional, to misinformation, which can be unintentional. The motivation can range from targeted influence operations by foreign actors to purely economic motives. A calibrated response is needed to each of these challenges. Furthermore, there is a need to provide more data for public scrutiny and improve analytical capacities. \n\nCommunicate: During the crisis, the EU has been stepping up its work to inform citizens about the risks and to enhance cooperation with other international actors to tackle disinformation. The Commission has been rebutting myths around the coronavirus, which have been viewed more than 7 million times. The European External Action Service, together with the Commission, enhanced strategic communication and public diplomacy in third countries, including the EU's neighbourhood. Foreign actors and certain third countries, in particular Russia and China, have engaged in targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally. For example, the EEAS East Stratcom Task Force detected and exposed more than 550 disinformation narratives from pro-Kremlin sources on the EUvsDisinfo website. \n\nCooperation has been an important cornerstone of the fight against disinformation:\n\n\tWith the European Parliament and the Council and between EU institutions and Member States, by using established channels, such as the Rapid Alert System and the EU integrated political crisis response. These channels will be further developed to strengthen capacities, to improve risk analysis and vital reporting in times of crisis.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tWith\u00a0international partners, including the WHO,\u00a0the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism, NATO and others. This led to an increased sharing of information, activities and best practices. It should be intensified to better address foreign influence and disinformation.\u00a0\n\tThe\u00a0EU will step up support and assistance to civil society actors, independent media and journalists in third countries as part of the \u2018Team Europe' package, and enhance support for monitoring violations of press freedom and advocacy for a safer media environment.\u00a0\n\tFinally, many consumers were misled to buy overpriced, ineffective or potentially dangerous products, and platform have removed millions of misleading advertisements. The Commission will continue to cooperate with online platforms and support the Consumer Protection Cooperation network of national authorities to fight these practices that infringe consumer protection law.\n\n\nTransparency: The Commission has closely monitored the actions of online platforms under the Code of Practice on Disinformation. There is a need for additional efforts, increased transparency and greater accountability:\n\n\tPlatforms\u00a0should provide monthly reports that include more detailed data on their actions to promote authoritative content, improve users' awareness, and limit coronavirus disinformation and advertising related to it. They should also step up their cooperation with fact-checkers - in all Members States, for all languages - and researchers, and be more transparent about implementation of their policies to inform users that interact with disinformation.\u00a0\n\tThe Commission strongly encourages other relevant stakeholders that are not yet signatories to the Code to participate in this new monitoring programme.\n\tBuilding\u00a0on the work of the newly established\u00a0European Digital Media Observatory, the EU will further strengthen its support to fact-checkers and researchers.\n\n\nEnsuring freedom of expression and pluralistic democratic debate is central to our disinformation response. The Commission will continue monitoring the impact of emergency measures taken by Member States in the coronavirus context, on EU law and values. The crisis demonstrated the role of free and independent media as an essential service, providing citizens with reliable, fact-checked information, contributing to saving lives.The EU will strengthen its support to independent media and journalists in the EU and around the world.The Commission calls upon Member States to intensify efforts to ensure that journalists can work safely and to make the most of the EU's economic response and recovery package to support media heavily hit by the crisis, while respecting their independence.\n\nEmpowering citizens, raising citizens awareness and increasing societal resilience implies enabling citizens to participate in the democratic debate by preserving access to information and freedom of expression, promoting citizens' media and information literacy, including critical thinking and digital skills. This can be done through media literacy projects and support to civil society organisations.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe actions proposed today will feed into future EU work on disinformation, notably the European Democracy Action Plan and the Digital Services Act.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Union has been actively tackling disinformation since 2015. Following a decision of the\u00a0European Council in March 2015, the\u00a0East StratCom Task Force\u00a0in the European External Action Service (EEAS) was set up. In 2016, the\u00a0Joint Framework on countering hybrid threats\u00a0was adopted, followed by the\u00a0Joint Communication on increasing resilience and bolstering capabilities to address hybrid threats\u00a0in 2018.\n\nThe Action Plan against Disinformation of December 2018 outlined four pillars for the EU's fight against disinformation: 1) improving the capabilities to detect, analyse and expose disinformation; 2) strengthening coordinated and joint responses, i.a. through the Rapid Alert System; 3) mobilising the private sector to tackle disinformation; 4) raising awareness and improving societal resilience.\n\nIn October 2018, the\u00a0Code of Practice\u00a0was signed by Facebook, Google, Twitter and Mozilla as well as trade associations representing online platforms, the advertising industry, and advertisers as a self-regulatory tool to tackle disinformation. Microsoft joined the Code in 2019. The signatories submitted self-assessments in October 2019. The Commission will publish a comprehensive assessment in the forthcoming weeks.\n\nFinally, in a Joint Communication of June 2019, the Commission and the High Representative concluded that while the European elections of May 2019 were not free from disinformation, the actions taken by the EU have contributed to narrow down the space for third-country influence as well as coordinated campaigns to manipulate public opinion.\n\nFor More Information\n\nJoint Communication \u2013 Tackling COVID-19 disinformation: getting the facts right\n\nFactsheet\n\nCoronavirus response website\n\nDedicated section on fighting disinformation during coronavirus pandemic\n\nAdvice to consumers and businesses on scams related to Covid-19\n\nEU vs disinfo website - https:\/\/euvsdisinfo.eu\/think-before-you-share\/\n\n2018 Action plan against disinformation\n\nThe Code of Practice against Disinformation\n\nEU co-funded projects to support media freedom and pluralism\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: EU strengthens action to tackle disinformation"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1006\/IP_20_1006_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Peter STANO","phone":"+32 2 295 45 53","email":"peter.stano@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Johannes BAHRKE","phone":"+32 2 295 86 15","email":"johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Adam KAZNOWSKI","phone":"+ 32 2 298 93 59","email":"adam.kaznowski@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Charles MANOURY","phone":"+32 2 291 33 91","email":"charles.manoury@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","digital economy","research and innovation"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/joint-communication-tackling-covid-19-disinformation-getting-facts-right_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response\/fighting-disinformation\/tackling-coronavirus-disinformation_en ","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response\/fighting-disinformation_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/consumers\/enforcement-consumer-protection\/scams-related-covid-19_en","https:\/\/euvsdisinfo.eu\/","https:\/\/euvsdisinfo.eu\/think-before-you-share\/","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/digital-single-market\/en\/news\/action-plan-against-disinformation","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/digital-single-market\/en\/news\/code-practice-disinformation","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/digital-single-market\/en\/news\/eu-funded-projects-support-media-freedom-and-pluralism-eu"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"May 2020","date":"2 May","title":"rescEU masks delivered to Spain, Italy and Croatia","abstract":"<p>Following earlier delivery to Italy, more batches of FFP2 protective masks have been distributed to <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_785\">Spain, Italy and Croatia<\/a> from rescEU - the first ever common European reserve of medical equipment set up last month to help countries affected by the coronavirus outbreak.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_785"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_785"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_785","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"2 May 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing last week's delivery to Italy, more batches of FFP2 protective masks are being distributed this weekend to Spain, Italy and Croatia from rescEU - the first ever common European reserve of medical equipment set up last month to help countries affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\u201dWe have worked around the clock to build up the rescEU reserve of medical equipment.

The new call for expressions of interest contributes to the Commission's \u20ac1.4 billion pledge to the Coronavirus Global Response initiative, launched by President Ursula von der Leyen on 4 May 2020.\n\nThe new call is the latest addition to a range of EU-funded research and innovation actions to fight the coronavirus. It complements earlier actions to develop diagnostics, treatments and vaccines by strengthening capacity to manufacture and deploying readily available solutions in order to rapidly address the pressing needs. It will also improve understanding of the behavioural and socio-economic impacts of the epidemic.\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"We are mobilising all means at our disposal to fight this pandemic with testing, treatments and prevention. But to succeed against the coronavirus, we must also understand how it impacts our society and how to best deploy these interventions rapidly. We must explore technological solutions to manufacture medical equipment and supplies faster, to monitor and prevent the spread of the disease, and to better care for patients.\u201d\n\nThierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, added: \"We are supporting the health authorities, healthcare professionals and the general public in all Member States in tackling the coronavirus crisis. To this end, we are deploying innovative technologies and tools that can quickly\u00a0be used to\u00a0prevent, optimally treat,\u00a0and recover from this pandemic and prepare\u00a0for its aftermath. These include digital solutions and technologies such as telemedicine, data, AI, robotics, and photonics.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe projects funded under this call should repurpose manufacturing for rapid production of vital medical supplies and equipment needed for testing, treatment and prevention, as well as develop medical technologies and digital tools to improve detection, surveillance and patients care. New research will learn from large groups of patients (cohorts) across Europe and better understanding of the behavioural and socio-economic impacts of the coronavirus epidemic could help improve treatment and prevention strategies.\n\nThe deadline for submission is 11 June 2020, while the call will focus on delivering results quickly. Europe, and the world at large, urgently need innovative solutions to contain and mitigate the outbreak, and to better care for patients, survivors, vulnerable groups, frontline health care staff and their communities. This is why the Commission aims to enable research work to start as quickly as possible through shorter timelines for the preparation of expressions of interest and for their evaluation.\n\nThe new solutions need to be available and affordable for all, in line with the principles of the Coronavirus Global Response. For this purpose, the Commission will include rapid data-sharing clauses in grant agreements, resulting from this new call, to ensure that findings and outcomes can be put to use immediately.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThis new special call under Horizon 2020 complements earlier actions to support 18 projects with \u20ac48.2 million to develop diagnostics, treatments, vaccines and preparedness for epidemics, as well as the \u20ac117 million invested in 8 projects on diagnostics and treatments through the Innovative Medicines Initiative, and measures to support innovative ideas through the European Innovation Council. It implements Action 3 of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan, a working document resulting from dialogues between the Commission services and national institutions.\n\nThe new call will cover five areas with the following indicative budgets:\n\n\tRepurposing of manufacturing for vital medical supplies and equipment (\u20ac23 million)\n\tMedical technologies, Digital tools and Artificial Intelligence analytics to improve surveillance and care at high Technology Readiness Levels (\u20ac56 million)\n\tBehavioural, social and economic impacts of the outbreak responses (\u20ac20 million)\n\tPan-European COVID-19 cohorts (\u20ac20 million)\n\tCollaboration of existing EU and international cohorts of relevance to COVID-19 (\u20ac3 million)\n\n\nCohort studies typically observe large groups of individuals, recording their exposure to certain risk factors to find clues as to the possible causes of disease.

This moment in history requires all of us, so let's join together to chart a better future, for everyone.\u201d\n\nArtist and Activist Miley Cyrus said: \"This moment requires all of us to act. As Global Citizens, we are calling on leaders around the world to combat the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has on marginalized communities by committing funds to develop and deliver tests, treatments, and therapeutics. Because of this global effort, we will be more able to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to COVID-19 testing and treatment, regardless of their income or where they live.\"\n\nArtist and Activist Shakira said: \u201cGlobal Citizens around the world are calling on world leaders to help bring an end to COVID-19 by urging them to commit the billions of dollars needed to deliver testing, treatments, and vaccines to everyone, everywhere. We need health equity and global justice, and we know that only by uniting to fight for the world we want can we build back toward a healthier future for all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Global Goal: Unite for our Future campaign was launched on 28 May under the patronage of President Ursula von der Leyen. The campaign, supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, focuses on addressing the pandemic's impact on the most vulnerable communities, ensuring equitable access to affordable coronavirus technologies and strengthening health systems everywhere.\n\nPledges announced on 27 June will support the following organisations:\n\n\t\u00a0 Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)\n\t\u00a0 The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND)\n\t\u00a0 GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance\n\t\u00a0 The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria\n\t\u00a0 Therapeutics Accelerator\n\t\u00a0 UNITAID\n\t\u00a0 WHO's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, powered by the UN Foundation\n\t\u00a0 The International and Regional Response Network\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Global Goal: Unite for our Future campaign is supported by Foundation Partners Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, and Corporate Partners Citi, Procter & Gamble, SAP, Verizon and Vodafone.\n\nThe campaign is a milestone under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to affordable coronavirus vaccination, treatment and testing. It is the Commission's response to the global call for action launched by the World Health Organization with governments and partners on 24 April 2020, for access to coronavirus vaccines everywhere, for everyone who needs them.\n\nTo help protect people everywhere, the Commission has recently presented an\u00a0EU Vaccines Strategy to speed up the development, manufacturing and deployment of coronavirus vaccines. With this strategy, the Commission will support efforts to accelerate the development and availability of safe and effective vaccines in a timeframe between 12 and 18 months, if not earlier. Delivering on this complex undertaking requires running clinical trials in parallel with investing in production capacity to be able to produce millions, or even billions, of doses of a successful vaccine. The Commission is fully mobilised to support the efforts of vaccine developers in their endeavour.\n\nIn addition, as a way to enhance vaccine multilateralism and avoid harmful competition between countries, President von der Leyen has proposed to explore, with our international partners, the creation of an inclusive international vaccine procurement mechanism. For this to work, a significant number of high-income countries would need to join an international buyers' group. They would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies, while at the same time enabling advance reservations for low- and middle-income countries.\u00a0 This would accelerate the development of vaccines and improve access to them across the world for all who need it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor more information\n\nCoronavirus Global Response website\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus Global Response: world leaders summit and concert line-up announced for 27 June"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1129\/IP_20_1129_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Dana SPINANT","phone":"+32 2 299 01 50","email":"dana.spinant@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":[],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"19 March","title":"First ever RescEU stockpile of medical equipment","abstract":"<p>The Commission decided to create a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_476\">strategic RescEU stockpile of medical equipment<\/a> such as ventilators and protective masks to help EU countries in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_476"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_476"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_476","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"19 March 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission has decided to create a strategic rescEU stockpile of medical equipment such as ventilators and protective masks to help EU countries in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cWith the first ever common\u00a0European reserve of emergency medical equipment we put EU solidarity into action. It will benefit all our Member States and all our citizens. Helping one another is the only way forward.\u201d\n\nMedical equipment part of the stockpile will include items such as:\n\n\tintensive care medical equipment such as ventilators,\n\tpersonal protective equipment such as reusable masks,\n\tvaccines and therapeutics,\n\tlaboratory supplies.\n\n\nCommissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d said: \"The EU is taking action to get more equipment to Member States. We are setting up a rescEU stockpile to rapidly get the supplies needed to fight the coronavirus. It will be used to support Member States facing shortages of equipment needed to treat infected patients, protect health care workers and help slow the spread of the virus. Our plan is to move ahead without delay.\u201d\n\nHow the rescEU stockpile works\n\n\tThe stockpile will be hosted by one or several Member States. The hosting State will be responsible for procuring the equipment.\n\tThe Commission will finance 90% of the stockpile. The Emergency Response Coordination Centre will manage the distribution of the equipment to ensure it goes where it is needed most.\n\tThe initial EU budget of the stockpile is \u20ac50 million, of which \u20ac40 million is subject to the approval of the budgetary authorities.\n\n\nIn addition, under the Joint Procurement Agreement, Member States are in the process of purchasing personal protective equipment, respiratory ventilators and items necessary for coronavirus testing. This coordinated approach gives Member States a strong position when negotiating with the industry on availability and price of medical products.\n\nNext steps\n\nOnce the measure enters into law on Friday 20 March, the Member State wishing to host rescEU stockpiles can apply for a direct grant from the European Commission. The direct grant covers 90 % of the costs of the stockpile while the remaining 10 % are borne by the Member State.\n\nBackground\n\nrescEU is part of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism which strengthens cooperation between Participating States in the field of civil protection, with a view to improving prevention, preparedness and response to disasters. The proposal upgrades the EU Civil Protection Mechanism's rescEU reserve of assets that already includes firefighting planes and helicopters. Through the Mechanism, the European Commission plays a key role in coordinating the response to disasters in Europe and beyond.\n\nWhen the scale of an emergency overwhelms the response capabilities of a country, it can request assistance via the Mechanism.\n\nTo date, all EU Member States participate in the Mechanism, as well as Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey. Since its inception in 2001, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has responded to over 330 requests for assistance inside and outside the EU.\n\nFor more information\n\nFactsheet: EU Civil Protection Mechanism\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n","detail_title":["COVID-19: Commission creates first ever rescEU stockpile of medical equipment"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_476\/IP_20_476_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"July 2020","date":"16 July","title":"Protecting seasonal workers","abstract":"<p>The Commission presented <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1342\">Guidelines to ensure the protection of seasonal workers<\/a> in the EU in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.

It provides guidance to national authorities, labour inspectorates, and social partners to guarantee the rights, health and safety of seasonal workers, and to ensure that seasonal workers are aware of their rights.\n\nCross-border seasonal workers enjoy a broad set of rights, but given the temporary nature of their work, they can be more vulnerable to precarious working and living conditions. The coronavirus pandemic has given more visibility to these conditions, and in some cases exacerbated them. In some cases such problems can increase the risk of COVID-19 clusters.\n\nNicolas Schmit, the Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: \u201cEach year, hundreds of thousands of seasonal workers help to underpin hugely important sectors of the EU's economy, such as food and agriculture. The coronavirus pandemic has shone a light on the challenging living and working conditions they face. This has to be addressed. Our guidelines are a wake-up call to Member States and companies to ensure they are fulfilling their duties to protect indispensable, yet vulnerable, workers.\u201d\n\nWhile the Commission monitors the proper application of Union rules in relation to seasonal workers, the responsibility for their proper application belongs to national authorities. Thus, appropriate actions are needed as a matter of urgency.\n\nThe guidelines cover a range of aspects, such as:\n\n\tthe right of seasonal workers to work in an EU Member State regardless of whether they are EU nationals or come from countries outside the EU\n\tsuitable living and working conditions, including physical distancing and appropriate hygiene measures\n\tclear communication to workers of their rights\n\tundeclared work\n\tsocial security aspects\n\n\nNational action\n\nThe Guidelines call on national authorities and social partners to make a renewed effort in fulfilling their role of ensuring the proper application and enforcement of the rules. They include concrete recommendations and suggestions on activities to be undertaken at national or EU level, such as:\n\n\tCalling on Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure decent working and living conditions for seasonal workers\n\tCalling on Member States to raise awareness on Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) requirements affecting seasonal workers, helping employers implement the relevant legal requirements and providing clear information to workers in a language they understand\n\tInviting Member States to provide practical guidance to smaller companies\n\tAsking Member States to strengthen field inspections to ensure to the proper application of the OSH rules for seasonal workers\n\n\nThe Commission will continue to work with Member States, social partners, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and the European Labour Authority (ELA) on this important issue.\n\nEU action\n\nThe Commission has planned a number of actions to boost the protection of seasonal workers' rights, including:\n\n\tA study collecting data on intra-EU seasonal work and identifying the main challenges, including in relation to sub-contracting;\n\tA survey on high-risk occupations, including seasonal workers, carried out by the EU-OSHA in close collaboration with the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee;\n\tAn awareness-raising campaign targeting sectors more exposed to seasonal work, coordinated by ELA;\n\tA hearing with European social partners on seasonal workers;\n\tA comparative analysis study in different Member States by the network of legal experts on free movement and the coordination of social security (MoveS);\n\tSupport to Member States through the European Platform tackling undeclared work and the #EU4FairWork4 campaign, to foster better awareness of rights and obligations among workers and employers.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe Guidelines presented today recall the rights of seasonal workers regardless of their status: whether they are EU citizens or third-country nationals, including those working regularly abroad on their own accord, or are posted for example through temporary work and recruitment agencies.\n\nIt is essential that seasonal workers and their employers have all the information they need both about the protection they enjoy as well as the obligations they need to fulfil.\n\nMore than 17.6 million EU citizens live or work in a Member States other than that of their nationality. Certain sectors of the European economy, in particular the agri-food and tourism sectors, depend on the support of seasonal workers from EU and non-EU countries for specific periods of the year. The Commission estimates that the average of active seasonal workers in the EU per year is between several hundred thousand and a million.\n\nWhile the Commission monitors the proper application of Union and national law rules in relation to seasonal workers in the EU, the responsibility for the proper application of these rules belongs to national authorities. In order to protect seasonal workers, Member States are invited to step up the enforcement of existing EU and national law and strengthen the field inspections in this respect, including with the support of the European Labour Authority (ELA).\n\nThese guidelines complement the Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak, published on 30 March 2020, and respond to a call of the European Parliament in its resolution of 19 June 2020 on the protection of cross-border and seasonal workers.\n\nFor More Information\n\nGuidelines on seasonal workers in the EU in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak (16 July 2020)\n\nGuidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak (30 March 2020)\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: European Commission calls for action in protecting seasonal workers"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1342\/IP_20_1342_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Siobh\u00e1n MILLBRIGHT","phone":"+32 2 295 73 61","email":"siobhan.millbright@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":1,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"April 2021","date":"14 April","title":"Commission ready to raise up to \u20ac800 billion for the recovery","abstract":"<p>The Commission has taken steps to ensure that borrowing under the temporary recovery instrument NextGenerationEU will be financed on the most advantageous terms for EU countries and their citizens.

The Commission will use a diversified funding strategy to raise up to around \u20ac800 billion in current prices until 2026. This approach, which will be in line with the best practices of sovereign issuers, will enable the Commission to raise the needed volumes in a smooth and efficient way. This will also attract investors to Europe and strengthen the international role of the euro.\n\nJohannes Hahn, Commissioner in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cNextGenerationEU is a game changer for European capital markets. Today, we are unveiling the engine that will pump the fuel to power NextGenerationEU. The funding strategy will operationalise the NextGenerationEU borrowing, so we will have all necessary tools in place to kick-start the social and economic recovery and promote our green, digital and resilient growth. The message is clear: as soon as the Commission has been legally enabled to borrow, we are ready to get going!\u201d \n\nBorrowing to finance the recovery\n\nNextGenerationEU \u2013 at the heart of the EU's response to the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 will be funded by borrowing on the capital markets. We will raise up to around \u20ac800 billion between now and end-2026.\n\nThis will translate into borrowing volumes of on average roughly \u20ac150 billion per year, which will make the EU one of the largest issuers in euro. All borrowing will be repaid by 2058.\n\nWhile the Commission has been borrowing before \u2013 to support EU Member States and third countries \u2013 the volumes, frequency and complexity of the NextGenerationEU borrowing have called for a fundamental change in the approach to capital markets.\n\nA diversified funding strategy will respond to these new funding needs. It will enable the Commission to mobilise all funds when required on the most advantageous terms for the EU Member States and their citizens.\n\nDiversified funding strategy: a snapshot\n\nA diversified funding strategy combines the use of different funding instruments and funding techniques with an open and transparent communication to the market participants.\n\nThe Commission's diversified funding strategy would combine:\n\n\tAnnual decision on borrowing volumes and 6-monthly communication on the funding plan's key parameters, to offer transparency and predictability to investors and other stakeholders;\n\tStructured and transparent relationships with banks supporting the issuance programme (via a Primary Dealer Network);\n\tMultiple funding instruments (medium and long-term bonds, some of which will be issued as NextGenerationEU green bonds, and EU-Bills) to maintain flexibility in terms of market access and to manage liquidity needs and the maturity profile;\n\tA combination of auctions and syndications, to ensure cost efficient access to the necessary funding on advantageous terms.\n\n\nThe borrowing operations will be embedded in a robust governance framework, which will ensure coherent and consistent execution.\n\nIn its work, the Commission will continue to coordinate with other issuers, including the EU Member States and supranationals.\n\nThe added value of a diversified funding strategy\u00a0\n\nThe diversified funding strategy will help the Commission to achieve two main objectives: address the large funding needs of NextGenerationEU and obtain the desired low cost and low execution risk in the interest of all Member States and their citizens:\n\n\tBy using a wide range of maturities and instruments and by making funding operations more predictable, the Commission will ensure a larger market absorption capacity. The ability to auction debt will make the funding operations even more efficient. This will help address the large funding needs.\n\tBy allowing flexibility to decide when to execute funding operations and which funding techniques or instruments to use, the Commission will obtain the desired low cost and low execution risk in the interest of all Member States.\n\n\nNext steps\n\nFollowing today's package, the Commission will proceed with a series of steps to operationalise the diversified funding strategy. Among them:\n\n\tSetting up a Primary Dealer Network. In line with practices of comparable issuers, the Commission will set up a Primary Dealer Network to facilitate the efficient execution of auctions and syndicated transactions, support liquidity in the secondary markets, and ensure the placement of our debt with the widest possible investor base. The application form and the General Terms and Conditions for participation will be published shortly.\n\tPublish the first annual Borrowing Decision (and accompanying Financing Decision) and first NextGenerationEU funding plan. To ensure transparent communication with the markets, the Commission will adopt its first annual borrowing decision and communicate the information related to its first funding plan before the start of the NextGenerationEU borrowing, expected this summer (timing being dependent on the approval of the Own Resources Decision by all Member States which will empower the Commission to borrow for NextGenerationEU). The borrowing operations can then start as soon as the Own Resources Decision will enter into force. Funding plans will then be updated semi-annually.\n\n\nBackground\n\nNextGenerationEU\n\nNextGenerationEU is at the heart of the EU response to the coronavirus crisis and aims to support the economic recovery and build a greener, more digital and more resilient future. The EU agreed this instrument as part of an over \u20ac2 trillion (in current prices) or \u20ac1.8 trillion (in 2018 prices) stimulus package, which also comprises the 2021-2027 long-term budget.\n\nThe centrepiece of NextGenerationEU is the Recovery and Resilience Facility - an instrument to offer grants and loans to support reforms and investments in the EU Member States with a total value of \u20ac723.8 billion in current prices.\n\nIn addition, NextGenerationEU will reinforce several EU programmes. To finance NextGenerationEU, the EU will borrow on the capital markets. Repayment will take place over a long-time horizon, until 2058. This will avoid immediate pressure on Member States' national finances and enable EU Member States to focus their efforts on the recovery.\n\nTo help repay the borrowing, the EU will look into introducing new own resources (or sources of revenue) to the EU budget, on top of the already existing ones.\n\nThe EU as a borrower\n\nThe European Commission, on behalf of the EU, is a well-established participant in the capital markets. Over a period of 40 years, the European Commission has run several lending programmes to support EU Member States and third countries.\n\nLast year, the Commission also started borrowing for SURE \u2013 the up to \u20ac100 billion instrument \u2013 to help protect jobs and keep people in employment. So far, 3\/4ths of the EU SURE funds have been raised in six very successful issuances, which has made it possible to finance loans to Member States on very advantageous terms.\n\nAll of these lending operations were financed on a back-to-back basis, mainly through syndicated bond issuances.\n\nFor More Information\n\nQ&A\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\nEU as borrower Investors relations\n\nFactsheets\n\nLegal acts\n\nPresentation for investors\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["NextGenerationEU: Commission gets ready to raise up to \u20ac800 billion to fund the recovery"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_1703\/IP_21_1703_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Claire JOAWN","phone":"+32 2 295 68 59","email":"claire.joawn@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","budget and human resources"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_21_1702","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/eu-borrower-investor-relations_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/eu-borrower-investor-relations\/factsheets_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/eu-borrower-investor-relations\/legal-texts_en#eu-funding-strategy-for-nextgenerationeu","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/eu-borrower-investor-relations\/investor-presentation_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"8 April","title":"Member States invited to prolong restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 May","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_616\">The Commission called for a coordinated approach<\/a> to the prolongation, as action at the external borders can only be effective if implemented by all EU and Schengen States at all borders, with the same end date and in a uniform manner.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_616"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_616"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_616","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"8 April 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday the Commission invited Schengen Member States and Schengen Associated States to prolong the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 May. The experience of Member States and other countries exposed to the pandemic shows the measures applied to fight the spread of the virus require more than 30 days to be effective. The Commission calls for a coordinated approach to the prolongation, as action at the external borders can only be effective if implemented by all EU and Schengen States at all borders, with the same end date and in a uniform manner.\n\nThe travel restriction, as well as the invitation to extend it, applies to the \u2018EU+ area', which includes all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) \u2013 30 countries in total.\n\nVice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \u201cAll Member States have successfully implemented social distancing measures to limit social interaction and slow down the spread of the virus. The restriction on non-essential travel from third counties to the EU complements these measures at the EU's external borders. While we can see encouraging first results, prolonging the travel restriction is necessary to continue reducing the risks of the disease spreading further. We should not yet let the door open whilst we are securing our house.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, added: \u201cThe current situation compels us to call for a prolongation of the restriction on non-essential travel to the EU. While coordinated action is key at the external borders, we also need to work together at the internal borders to make sure our internal market continues to function properly, and that vital products such as food, medicines and protective equipment can reach their destination without delay. We will continue assisting Member States in all these strands of work.\u201d\n\nThe Commission's assessment of the current situation points to a continued rise in the number of new cases and deaths across the EU, as well as to the progression of the pandemic outside of the EU, including in countries from where millions of people usually travel to the EU every year. In this context, prolonging the travel restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of the disease spreading further.\n\nThe risk of increasing community transmission is assessed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to be moderate if mitigation measures are in place and very high if insufficient mitigation measures are in place, while the risk that the capacity of health and social care systems will be exceeded in the coming weeks is assessed as high, even with mitigation measures in place.\n\nSince the implementation of the travel restriction in the second half of March, air passenger traffic has been almost reduced to zero, with the remaining flights being mainly limited to cargo transport and repatriation. A similar trend of passenger traffic can be seen in other modes of transport, such as in ferry, coach and rail transport.\n\nThe Commission will continue to assist Member States in implementing the restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, including through regular discussions in videoconference meetings with Home Affairs Ministers.\n\nAny further prolongation of the travel restriction beyond 15 May would need to be assessed again, based on the evolution of the epidemiological situation.\n\nParallel and coordinated action at external borders will be an essential aspect of a concerted EU exit strategy and the gradual lifting of the containment measures in Europe.\n\nBackground \n\nThe Commission invited Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days. Leaders endorsed this call on 17 March; and all EU Member States (except Ireland) and non-EU Schengen countries have since then taken national decisions to implement this travel restriction.\n\nThe travel restriction does not apply to EU citizens, citizens of non-EU Schengen countries and their family members, and non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in the EU for the purpose of returning home. In addition, to limit to the minimum the impact of the restriction on the functioning of our societies, Member States should not apply the restrictions to specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need. Essential staff, such as doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, researchers and experts helping to cope with the coronavirus, as well as persons carrying goods, frontier workers and seasonal agricultural workers, should also continue to be allowed to enter the EU.\n\nTo assist Member States, the Commission presented on 30 March 2020 guidance on how to implement the temporary travel restriction, facilitate repatriations from across the world, and deal with those compelled to stay in the EU longer than they are authorised to as a result of travel restrictions.\n\nFor More Information \n\nCommunication on the assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 8 April 2020\n\nQ&A for people travelling to and from the EU during the pandemic\n\nCommunication on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 16 March 2020\n\nCoronavirus: Commission presents practical guidance on implementing the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 30 March 2020\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission invites Member States to prolong restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 May"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_616\/IP_20_616_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Adalbert JAHNZ","phone":"+ 32 2 295 31 56","email":"adalbert.jahnz@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Ciara BOTTOMLEY","phone":"+32 2 296 99 71 ","email":"ciara.bottomley@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Laura BERARD","phone":"+32 2 295 57 21","email":"laura.berard@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["security union","migration, home affairs and citizenship"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/communication-assessment-state-play-communication-non-essential-travel_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/questions-answers-people-travelling-and-eu-during-pandemic_en","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=COM:2020:115:FIN","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_543"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"February 2020","date":"23 February","title":"In solidarity with China, EU delivers additional protective equipment","abstract":"<p>The Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_310\">co-financed<\/a> the delivery of more than 25 tonnes of personal protective equipment to China after the EU Civil Protection Mechanism was activated.

Once endorsed by the Council, it will allow Member States to undertake measures to deal adequately with the crisis, while departing from the budgetary requirements that would normally apply under the European fiscal framework.\n\nThe proposal represents an important step in fulfilling the Commission's commitment to use all economic policy tools at its disposal to support Member States' in protecting their citizens and mitigating the pandemic's severely negative socio-economic consequences.\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said:\"Today we propose maximum flexibility for our rules which will allow our national governments to support everybody - their healthcare systems, staff as well as the people so severly affected by the crisis. I want to make sure that we respond to the human as well as socio-economic dimension of the Coronavirus pandemic in the best way possible.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a major shock for the European and global economies. Member States have already adopted or are adopting budgetary measures to increase the capacity of their health systems and provide relief to those citizens and sectors that are particularly impacted. These measures, together with the fall in economic activity, will contribute to substantially higher budgetary deficits.\n\nThe Commission calls on the Council to endorse its proposal as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Commission stands ready to take further action as the situation evolves.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Commission and the Council have already clarified that the coronavirus pandemic qualifies as an \u201cunusual event outside the control of government\u201d. The Commission believes that more far-reaching flexibility under the SGP is required to protect European citizens and businesses from the consequences of this crisis and to support the economy following the pandemic. Therefore, the Commission decided to propose the activation of the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact.\n\nThe Commission's strategy to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic includes using the full flexibility of our fiscal and state-aid frameworks, mobilising the EU budget to allow the EIB Group to provide short-term liquidity to SMEs and directing \u20ac37 billion to the fight against coronavirus under the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative.\n\nToday's proposal follows the Commission's adoption a Temporary Framework for State-aid to enable Member States to ensure that sufficient liquidity remains available to businesses of all types and to preserve the continuity of economic activity during and after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFor more information\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes activating fiscal framework's general escape clause to respond to pandemic\n\nCommunication on the activation of the general escape clause\n\nPress release: Commission sets out European coordinated response to counter the economic impact of the Coronavirus\n\nEuropean Coordinated Response on Coronavirus: Questions and Answers\n\nPress release: Commission adopts Temporary Framework to enable Member States to further support the economy in the coronavirus outbreak\n\nCoronavirus website\n\nStability and Growth Pact\n\nVade Mecum on the Stability and Growth Pact\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission proposes to activate fiscal framework's general escape clause to respond to pandemic"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_499\/IP_20_499_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Enda MCNAMARA","phone":"+32 2 296 49 76","email":"Enda.Mcnamara@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["economic affairs","economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"February 2020","date":"28 February","title":"Procuring medical equipment jointly with Member States","abstract":"<p>The first out of four <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/health\/preparedness_response\/joint_procurement_en\">joint procurements<\/a> of personal protective equipment was launched together with Member States.

In a Communication adopted today, it calls on Member States to accelerate the roll-out of vaccination across the EU: by March 2021, at least 80% of people over the age of 80, and 80% of health and social care professionals in every Member State should be vaccinated. And by summer 2021, Member States should have vaccinated a minimum of 70% of the adult population.\n\nThe Commission also calls on Member States to continue to apply physical distancing, limit social contacts, fight disinformation, coordinate travel restrictions, ramp up testing, and increase contact tracing and genome sequencing to face up to the risk from new variants of the virus. As recent weeks have seen an upward trend in case numbers, more needs to be done to support healthcare systems and to address \u201cCOVID-fatigue\u201d in the coming months, from accelerating vaccination across the board, helping our partners in the Western Balkans, the Southern and Eastern neighbourhood and in Africa.\n\nToday's Communication sets out key actions for Member States, the Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which will help reduce risks and keep the virus under control:\n\nSpeeding up the roll-out of vaccination across the EU \n\n\tBy March 2021, at least 80% of people over the age of 80, and 80% of health and social care professionals in every Member State, should be vaccinated.\n\tBy summer 2021, Member States should have vaccinated 70% of the entire adult population.\n\tThe Commission, Member States and the EMA will work with companies to use the EU's potential for increased vaccine manufacturing capacity to the fullest.\n\tThe Commission is working with Member States on vaccination certificates, in full compliance with EU data protection law, which can support the continuity of care. A common approach is to be agreed by the end of January 2021 to allow Member States' certificates to be rapidly useable in health systems across the EU and beyond.\n\n\nTesting and genome sequencing\n\n\tMember States should update their testing strategies to account for new variants and expand the use of rapid antigen tests.\n\tMember States should urgently increase genome sequencing to at least 5% and preferably 10% of positive test results. At present, many Member States are testing under 1% of samples, which is not enough to identify the progression of the variants or detect any new ones.\n\n\nPreserving the Single Market and free movement while stepping up mitigation measures\n\n\tMeasures should be applied to further reduce the risk of transmission linked to the means of travel, such as hygiene and distancing measures in vehicles and terminuses.\n\tAll non-essential travel should be strongly discouraged until the epidemiological situation has considerably improved.\n\tProportionate travel restrictions, including testing of travellers, should be maintained for those travelling from areas with a higher incidence of variants of concern.\n\n\nEnsuring European leadership and international solidarity\n\n\tTo ensure early access to vaccines, the Commission is to set up a Team Europe mechanism to structure the provision of vaccines shared by Member States with partner countries. This should allow for sharing with partner countries access to some of the 2.3 billion doses secured through the EU's Vaccines Strategy, paying special attention to the Western Balkans, our Eastern and Southern neighbourhood and Africa.\n\tThe European Commission and Member States should continue supporting COVAX, including through early access to vaccines. Team Europe has already mobilised \u20ac853 million in support of COVAX, making the EU one of COVAX's biggest donors.\n\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cVaccination is essential to get out of this crisis. We have already secured enough vaccines for the entire population of the European Union. Now we need to accelerate the delivery and speed up vaccination. Our aim is to have 70% of our adult population vaccinated by summer. That could be a turning point in our fight against this virus. However, we will only end this pandemic when everyone in the world has access to vaccines. We will step up our efforts to help secure vaccines for our neighbours and partners worldwide.\u201d\n\nVice-President Margaritis Schinas, responsible for Promoting our European Way of Life, said: \u201cThe emergence of new variants of the virus and substantial rises in cases leave us no room for complacency.\u00a0Now more than ever must come a renewed determination for Europe to act together with unity, coordination and vigilance. Our proposals today aim to protect more lives and livelihoods later and relieve the burden on already stretched health care systems and workers. This is how the EU will come out of the crisis. The end of the pandemic is in sight though not yet in reach.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cWorking together with unity, solidary and determination, we can soon start to see the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Now in particular, we need swift and coordinated action against the new variants of the virus. Vaccinations will still take time until they reach all Europeans and until then we must take immediate, coordinated and proactive steps together. Vaccinations must accelerate across the EU and testing and sequencing must be increased \u2013 this is show we can ensure that we leave this crisis behind us as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nToday's Communication builds on the \u2018Staying safe from COVID-19 during winter' Communication of 2 December 2020.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommunication: A united front to beat COVID-19\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\n","detail_title":["Commission sets out key actions for a united front to beat COVID-19 "],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_143\/IP_21_143_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/communication-united-front-beat-covid-19_en","http:\/\/www.ec.europa.eu\/covid-19-vaccines"],"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"December 2020","date":"1 December","title":"Commission disburses EUR 8.5 billion under SURE to five Member States","abstract":"<p>The Commission has disbursed EUR 8.5 billion in t<a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_2241\">he third instalment of financial support to five Member States<\/a> under the SURE instrument.

Specifically, they will help cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, including for the self-employed.\n\nWith today's disbursement, 15 Member States have received around \u20ac40 billion under the EU SURE instrument between the end of October and the end of November.

This was translated into favourable pricing terms, meaning that Member States will receive more in loans than they will have to repay.\n\nThe SURE instrument can provide up to \u20ac100 billion in financial support to all Member States. The Commission has so far proposed to make \u20ac90.3 billion in financial support available to 18 Member States. The next disbursements will take place over the course of the months ahead, following the respective bond issuances.\n\nMembers of the College said: \n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cOur priority is to save people's lives, and also their livelihoods. The EU is mobilising \u20ac100 billion in loans for EU countries to finance short-time work schemes. This will provide support to our companies and help keep people employed. Today, another five Member States are receiving funding via SURE, and 15 have benefitted so far. More countries will be able to benefit soon.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cWith the third successful SURE issuance this year, we have provided 15 Member States with around \u20ac40 billion to support them with alleviating the social impact of the current COVID pandemic. This support will help businesses to keep their staff employed. The SURE programme is evidence of the EU's commitment to provide Member States quickly with the urgently needed financial means to overcome this crisis. The labelling as social bonds is a guarantee for investors that the money will be invested in social and sustainable projects, thus blending financial transactions with our political priorities\u201d.\n\nPaolo\u00a0Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cAfter the third hugely successful issuance of SURE social bonds last week, today we distribute another \u20ac8.5 billion to help workers and companies in five Member States. The social impact of the COVID crisis would have been so much worse without European countries' strong safety nets, especially short-time work schemes. I'm proud that through SURE, the European Commission is actively supporting these schemes and similar measures for the self employed \u2013 helping millions of our citizens to navigate these hard times.\u201d\n\nBackground \n\nOn 24 November, the European Commission issued the third social bond under the EU SURE instrument, for a total value of \u20ac8.5 billion. The issuing consisted of one single tranche due for repayment in July 2035.\n\nThe issuance has received an overwhelming response in the capital markets. It has attracted the largest-ever order book for any single tranche benchmark issuance and is the largest 15-year deal size by a supranational issuer to date. The favourable pricing terms that resulted from the high investors' interest are directly being passed on to the Member States receiving the loans.\n\nThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.\n\nFor More Information\n\nSURE Regulation\n\nFactsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes SURE\n\nCoronavirus response\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\nInvestor relations\n\n","detail_title":["Commission disburses \u20ac8.5 billion under SURE to five Member States"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_2241\/IP_20_2241_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[],"topics":[],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=CELEX:32020R0672","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/sites\/info\/files\/economy-finance\/sure_factsheet.pdf","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_572","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/eu-borrower\/eu-borrowing-activities\/eu-sure-social-bond-framework_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/business-economy-euro\/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination\/financial-assistance-eu\/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities\/sure_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/eu-borrower_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/eu-budget\/eu-borrower\/investor-relations_en#eu-sure-disbursements"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"2 April","title":"Mobilising all resources to protect lives and livelihoods","abstract":"<p>The Commission is further increasing its response by <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_582\">proposing to set up a EUR 100 billion solidarity instrument<\/a> to help workers keep their incomes and help businesses stay afloat, called <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/sites\/default\/files\/economy-finance\/sure_factsheet.pdf\">SURE<\/a>.

The Commission is further increasing its response by proposing to set up a \u20ac100 billion solidarity instrument to help workers keep their incomes and help businesses stay afloat, called SURE. It is also proposing to redirect all available structural funds to the response to the coronavirus. \n\nFarmers and fishermen will also receive support, as will the most deprived. All of these measures are based on the current EU budget and will squeeze out every available euro. They show the need for a strong and flexible long-term EU budget. The Commission will work to ensure that the EU can count on such a strong budget to get back on its feet and progress on the path to recovery.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak is testing Europe in ways that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago. The depth and the breadth of this crisis requires a response unprecedented in scale, speed and solidarity.\n\nIn the past weeks, the Commission has acted to provide Member States with all the flexibility they need to support financially their health care systems, their businesses and workers. It has acted to coordinate, speed up and reinforce the procurement efforts of medical equipment and has directed research funding to the development of a vaccine. It has worked tirelessly to ensure that goods and cross-border workers can continue to move across the EU, to keep hospitals functioning, factories running and shop shelves stocked. It has and continues to support the repatriation of EU citizens, their families and long-term residents to Europe from across the world.\n\nIn doing this, the Commission is acting on its conviction that the only effective solution to the crisis in Europe is one based on cooperation, flexibility and, above all, solidarity.\n\nToday's proposals take the response to a new level.\n\nCommenting on the proposals adopted today, President von der Leyen said: \u201cIn this coronavirus crisis, only the strongest of responses will do. We must use every means at our disposal. Every available euro in the EU budget will be redirected to address it, every rule will be eased to enable the funding to flow rapidly and effectively. With a new solidarity instrument, we will mobilise \u20ac100 billion to keep people in jobs and businesses running. With this, we are joining forces with Member States to save lives and protect livelihoods. This is European solidarity.\u201d\n\n\u20ac100 billion to keep people in jobs and businesses running: the SURE initiative\n\nWe need to cushion the economic blow in order for the EU economy to be ready to restart when the conditions are right. To achieve this, we must keep people in employment and businesses running. All Member States have or will soon have short-time work schemes to help achieve this.\n\nSURE is the Commission's answer to this: a new instrument that will provide up to \u20ac100 billion in loans to countries that need it to ensure that workers receive an income and businesses keep their staff. This allows people to continue to pay their rent, bills and food shopping and helps provide much needed stability to the economy.\n\nThe loans will be based on guarantees provided by Member States and will be directed to where they are most urgently needed. All Member States will be able to make use of this but it will be of particular importance to the hardest-hit.\n\nSURE will support short-time work schemes and similar measures to help Member States protect jobs, employees and self-employed against the risk of dismissal and loss of income. Firms will be able to temporarily reduce the hours of employees or suspend work altogether, with income support provided by the State for the hours not worked. The self-employed will receive income replacement for the current emergency.\n\n\tDelivering for the most deprived \u2013 the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived\n\n\nAs most of Europe practices social distancing to slow the spread of the virus, it is all the more important that those who rely on others for the most basic of needs are not cut off from help. The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived will evolve to meet the challenge: in particular, the use of electronic vouchers to reduce the risk of contamination will be introduced, as well as the possibility of buying protective equipment for those delivering the aid.\n\n\tSupporting fishermen and farmers\n\n\nEurope's farming and fisheries have an essential role in providing us with the food we eat. They are hard hit by the crisis, in turn hitting our food supply chains and the local economies that the sector sustains.\n\nAs with the structural funds, the use of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be made more flexible. Member States will be able to provide support:\n\n\tto fishermen for the temporary cessation of fishing activities;\n\tto aquaculture farmers for the temporary suspension or reduction of production and provide support;\n\tand to producer organisations for the temporary storage of fishery and aquaculture products.\n\n\nThe Commission will also shortly propose a range of measures to ensure that farmers and other beneficiaries can get the support they need from the Common Agricultural Policy, for example by granting more time to introduce applications for support and more time to allow administrations to process them, increasing advances for direct payments and rural development payments, and offering additional flexibility for on-the-spot checks to minimise the need for physical contact and reduce administrative burden.\n\nProtecting our economy and people with all available means\n\n\tRedirecting all Cohesion Policy funds to fight the emergency\n\n\nAll uncommitted money from the three Cohesion Policy funds \u2013 the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund - will be mobilised to address the effects of the public health crisis.\n\nTo make sure that funds can be re-directed to where they are most urgently needed, transfers between funds as well as between categories of regions and between policy objectives will be made possible. Moreover, co-financing requirements will be abandoned, as Member States are already using all their means to fight the crisis. Administration will be simplified.\n\n\tThe Emergency Support Instrument\n\n\nThe European Union has not faced a health crisis in its history on this scale or spreading at this speed. In response, the first priority is to save lives and to meet the needs of our health care systems and professionals who are working miracles every day right across our Union.\n\nThe Commission is working hard to ensure the supply of protective gear and respiratory equipment. Despite the strong production efforts of industry, Member States still face severe shortages of protective gear and respiratory equipment in some areas. They also lack sufficient treatment facilities and would benefit from being able to move patients to areas with more resources and dispatch medical staff to hardest-hit places. Support will also be needed for mass testing, for medical research, deploying new treatments, and for producing, purchasing and distributing vaccines across the EU.\n\nThe EU is today proposing to use all available remaining funds from this year's EU budget to help to respond to the needs of European health systems.\n\n\u20ac3 billion will be put into the Emergency Support Instrument, of which \u20ac300 million will be allocated to RescEU to support the common stockpile of equipment. The first priority would be managing the public health crisis and securing vital equipment and supplies, from ventilators to personal protective gear, from mobile medical teams to medical assistance for the most vulnerable, including those in refugee camps. The second area of focus would be on enabling the scaling up of testing efforts. The proposal would also enable the Commission to procure directly on behalf of the Member States.\n\nMore to come\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, the Commission will come forward with more proposals and will work with the other EU institutions to move forward as quickly as possible.\n\nFor more information\n\nQuestions and answers: Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus: New actions to mobilise essential investments and resources\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes SURE, a new temporary instrument worth up to \u20ac100 billion to help protect jobs and people at work\n\nQuestions and answers: European Union Emergency Support Instrument for the healthcare sector\n\nFactsheet: EU response to the coronavirus - latest updates\n\nFactsheet: the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative\n\nFactsheet: Coronavirus response: Support to the fishery and aquaculture sectors\n\nFactsheet: Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs - SURE\n\nLegal texts are available on the Commission's coronavirus response website\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: the Commission mobilises all of its resources to protect lives and livelihoods"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_582\/IP_20_582_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Eric MAMER","phone":"+32 2 299 40 73","email":"eric.mamer@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Dana SPINANT","phone":"+32 2 299 01 50","email":"dana.spinant@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Vivian LOONELA","phone":"+32 2 296 67 12","email":"vivian.loonela@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["coordinating spokesperson for the European Green Deal","economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights","regional policy","environment","budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","structural reforms","maritime affairs and fisheries"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":0,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Other initiatives or policies","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"March 2021","date":"27 March","title":"EU helps deliver vaccines to Moldova and medical items to Montenegro and North Macedonia","abstract":"<p>The EU has supported Romania in delivering 50,400 doses of vaccines to Moldova, following Moldova's request through the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/echo\/what\/civil-protection\/mechanism_en\">EU Civil Protection Mechanism<\/a>.

Concretely, the measures aim to better understand the virus' spread and the effectiveness of the response, ramp up well-targeted testing, bolster contact tracing, improve preparations for vaccination campaigns, and maintain access to essential supplies such as vaccination equipment, while keeping all goods moving in the single market and facilitating safe travel. This comes ahead of the European Leaders' virtual meeting on 29 October on COVID-19 coordination, following the 15 October European Council. Even though Member States are better prepared and more coordinated than in the early months of the pandemic, citizens, families and communities across Europe continue to face an unprecedented risk to their health and well-being.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cThe COVID-19 situation is very serious. We must step up our EU response. Today we are launching additional measures in our fight against the virus; from increasing access to fast testing, and preparing vaccination campaigns to facilitating safe travel when necessary. I call on Member States to work closely together. Courageous steps taken now will help save lives and protect livelihoods. No Member State will emerge safely from this pandemic until everyone does.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cThe rise in COVID-19 infection rates across Europe is very alarming. Decisive immediate action is needed for Europe to protect lives and livelihoods, to alleviate the pressure on healthcare systems, and to control the spread of the virus. Next month, we will present the first step towards a European Health Union. In the meantime, Member States must improve cooperation and data sharing. Our EU surveillance system is only as strong as its weakest link. It is only by showing true European solidarity and working together that we can overcome this crisis. Together we are stronger.\u201d\n\nThe Commission's Communication on additional COVID-19 response measures sets out next steps\u00a0in key areas to reinforce the EU's response to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases: \u00a0\n\n\t Improving the flow of information to allow informed decision-making \n\n\nEnsuring accurate, comprehensive, comparable and timely information on epidemiological data, as well as on testing, contact tracing and public health surveillance, is essential to track how the coronavirus spreads at regional and national level. To improve the sharing of data at EU level, the Commission calls on Member States to provide all relevant data to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Commission.\n\n\t Establishing more effective and rapid testing \n\n\nTesting is a decisive tool to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. To promote a common approach and effective testing, the Commission is today adopting a Recommendation on COVID-19 testing strategies, including the use of rapid antigen tests. It sets out key elements to be considered for national, regional or local testing strategies, such as their scope, priority groups, and key points linked to testing capacities and resources, and indications as to when rapid antigen testing may be appropriate. It also calls on Member States to submit national strategies on testing by mid-November. To directly purchase rapid antigen tests and deliver them to Member States, the Commission is mobilising \u20ac100 million under the Emergency Support Instrument. In parallel, the Commission is launching a joint procurement to ensure a second stream of access. Where Member States are applying prior testing requirements to incoming travellers and where no testing capacities are available for asymptomatic travellers in the country of origin, travellers should be offered the possibility to undergo a test after arrival. If negative COVID-19 tests are to be required or recommended for any activity, mutual recognition of tests is essential, in particular in the context of travel.\n\n\t Making full use of contact tracing and warning apps across borders \n\n\nContact tracing and warning apps help to break transmission chains. So far, Member States have developed 19 national contact tracing and warning apps, downloaded more than 52 million times. The Commission recently launched a solution for linking national apps across the EU through a \u2018European Federation Gateway Service'. Three national apps (Germany, Ireland, and Italy) were first linked on 19 October when the system came online. Many more will follow in the coming weeks. In total, 17 national apps are currently based on decentralised systems and can become interoperable through the service in the coming rounds; others are in the pipeline. All Member States should set up effective and compatible apps and reinforce their communication efforts to promote their uptake.\n\n\t Effective vaccination\n\n\nThe development and uptake of safe and effective vaccines is a priority effort to quickly end the crisis. Under the EU Strategy on COVID-19 vaccines, the Commission is negotiating agreements with vaccine producers to make vaccines available to Europeans and the world as soon as soon as they are proven safe and effective. Once available, vaccines need to be quickly distributed and deployed to maximum effect. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission will put in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies. To share the best practices, the conclusions of the first review on national vaccination plans will be presented in November 2020.\n\n\t Effective communication to citizens \n\n\nClear communication is essential for the public health response to be successful since this largely depends on the public adherence to health recommendations. All Member States should relaunch communication campaigns to counter false, misleading and dangerous information that continues to circulate, and to address the risk of \u201cpandemic fatigue\u201d. Vaccination is a specific area where public authorities need to step up their actions to tackle misinformation and secure public trust, as there will be no compromise on safety or effectiveness under Europe's robust vaccine authorisation system. Vaccines do not save lives \u2013 vaccination does.\n\n\t Securing essential supplies\n\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, the EU has supported manufacturers to ensure the availability of essential medicines and medical equipment. The Commission has launched a new joint procurement for medical equipment for vaccination. In order to give Member States better and cheaper access to the tools needed to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19, the Commission is today also extending the temporary suspension of customs duties and VAT on the import of medical equipment from non-EU countries. The Commission is also proposing that hospitals and medical practitioners should not have to pay VAT on vaccines and testing kits used in the fight against the coronavirus.\n\n\t Facilitating safe travel \n\n\nFree movement within the EU and the border-free Schengen area are prized achievements of European integration - the Commission is working to ensure that travel within Europe is safe both for travellers and for their fellow citizens:\n\n\tThe Commission calls on Member States to fully implement the Recommendation adopted by the Council for a common and coordinated approach to restrictions to free movement. Citizens and businesses want clarity and predictability. Any remaining COVID-19 related internal border control measures should be lifted.\n\tThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the ECDC are working on a testing protocol for travellers, to be used by public health authorities, airlines and airports to help the safe arrival of passengers. The Commission will also work with Member States and agencies on a common approach to quarantine practices, with inputs from ECDC to be presented in November.\n\tPassenger Locator Forms help Member States undertake risk assessments of arrivals and enable contact tracing. A pilot next month will allow Member States to prepare for the launch and use of a common EU digital Passenger Locator Form, while fully respecting data protection.\n\tRe-open EU provides timely and accurate information on health measures and travel restrictions in all Member States and some partner countries. The Commission calls on Member States to provide accurate and up-to-date information to turn Re-open EU into the one-stop-shop for information about health measures and travel possibilities across the EU. A mobile Re-open EU app is being developed and will launch in the coming weeks.\n\n\nWhen it comes to restrictions on non-essential travel from non-EU countries into the EU, the Commission is presenting guidance on categories of persons considered to be essential and therefore exempted from restrictions. This will help Member States to consistently implement the Council Recommendation on the temporary travel restriction to the EU. The Commission also once more encourages Member States to facilitate the reunion of those in durable relationships and provides examples of evidence that can be used for this purpose.\n\n\t Green Lanes extension\n\n\nSince March, the application of Green Lanes \u2013 most notably for road freight to cross borders in less than 15 minutes \u2013 has helped to maintain the supply of goods and the economic fabric of the EU. The Commission proposes to extend the Green Lane approach to ensure that multi-modal transport works effectively in areas including rail and waterborne freight and air cargo, and provides additional guidance to facilitate application in practice, on issues such as electronic documentation, and availability of rest and refuelling points. Member States should ensure the seamless free movement of goods across the Single Market.\n\nBackground \n\nRecent weeks have seen an alarming increase in the rate of COVID-19 infections across Europe, and sparked new measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus and mitigate its impact. With health systems again under pressure, more needs to be done to control and overcome the situation, protecting lives and livelihoods, and promote European solidarity. Although preparedness and cooperation between Member States has improved since the start of the pandemic, coordination remains essential and must be enhanced.\n\nFor more information\n\nCOVID-19 Communication on additional measures\n\nCommission's coronavirus response website \n\nFactsheet: Coronavirus Resurgence: New preparedness and response measures across the EU\n\nFactsheet: EU Coronavirus response\n\nRe-open EU\n\nContact tracing and warning apps\n\nEmergency Support Instrument\n\nGreen Lanes\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus resurgence: Commission steps up action to reinforce preparedness and response measures across the EU"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1986\/IP_20_1986_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Darragh CASSIDY","phone":"+32 2 298 39 78","email":"darragh.cassidy@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["public health","transport","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Working time and working time flexibility","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"July 2020","date":"14 July","title":"EUR 24 million for Uganda amid coronavirus pandemic","abstract":"<p>The EU will provide <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1341\">EUR 24 million in humanitarian assistance<\/a> for the most vulnerable people in Uganda in 2020, with a special focus on refugees and their host communities.

This action is part of the coordinated EU response to the public health threat of COVID-19.\n\nWith the additional amount from the Horizon 2020 programme, the Commission is scaling up the emergency call launched in January to fight the COVID-19 outbreak to \u20ac47.5 million. This allowed to select 17 projects involving 136 research teams from across the EU and beyond, which will start working on developing vaccines, new treatments, diagnostic tests and medical systems aimed at preventing the spread of the Coronavirus.\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cThe emergency funding from Horizon 2020 enables researchers to work immediately to tackle the outbreak of the Coronavirus on several fronts. Seeing the research community getting in action so rapidly gives us new hope that we will soon be one step closer to our goal of stopping the spread of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe Commission is currently negotiating grant agreements with the selected beneficiaries. The 17 projects will work on:\n\n\tDevelopment of new vaccines. The research will focus on developing a prophylactic vaccine and a therapeutic vaccine, which will be used for prevention and treatment respectively.\n\tRapid point-of-care diagnostic tests. Increased efforts will concentrate on enabling front-line health workers to make the diagnosis more quickly and more accurately, which will in turn reduce the risk of further spread of the virus.\n\tNew treatments, in which a dual approach will be adopted. Firstly, accelerating the development of new treatments currently in the pipeline (including therapeutic peptides, monoclonal antibodies and broad-spectrum antivirals), and secondly, screening and identifying molecules that could work against the virus, using advanced modelling and computing techniques.\n\tImproving epidemiology and public health, including our preparedness and response to outbreaks. These projects will help develop better monitoring systems in order to effectively prevent and control the spread of the virus, as well as contribute to the assessment of social dynamics.\n\n\nBackground\n\nOn 30 January 2020, the Commission launched a special call for expressions of interest to support research on COVID-19 with an initial budget of \u20ac10 million mobilised from the special fund for emergency research of the Horizon 2020 programme for research and innovation. The Commission received 91 proposals within the very short two-week deadline. Independent experts completed the evaluation of the proposals in record time. In parallel, thanks to the excellent quality of proposals received, the Commission mobilised additional funds in order to support a higher number of projects. Applicants were notified on 4 March.\u00a0 \n\nFurthermore, up to \u20ac45 million in Horizon 2020 funding will support additional research through the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private partnership between the Commission and the pharmaceutical industry. A commitment of a similar scale is expected from the pharmaceutical industry so that the total investment in the fast-track call launched on 3 March could reach up to \u20ac90 million. This means that the total amount in funding for coronavirus research, mobilised from Horizon 2020 and the industry through IMI, could reach almost \u20ac140 million.\n\nSeveral EU-funded projects are already contributing to preparedness and response to the COVID-19 outbreak, such as the European Virus Archive - GLOBAL (EVAg), the PREPARE project and the Commission involvement in the Global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness (GloPID-R) network.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommission response to COVID-19\n\nEU coronavirus research and innovation website\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n","detail_title":["COVID-19: Commission steps up research funding and selects 17 projects in vaccine development, treatment and diagnostics"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_386\/IP_20_386_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Johannes BAHRKE","phone":"+32 2 295 86 15","email":"johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marietta GRAMMENOU","phone":"+32 2 298 35 83","email":"marietta.grammenou@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Charles MANOURY","phone":"+32 2 291 33 91","email":"charles.manoury@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["digital economy","research and innovation"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"November 2020","date":"20 November","title":"EU mobilises EUR 86.5 million to fight COVID-19 in Ghana","abstract":"<p>Today, the European Union has mobilised EUR 86.5 million in emergency budget support to help Ghana in tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.

Contributing to inclusive and sustainable growth is at the core of LGX's mission, and today's bond listing marks an important milestone not just for Europe, but for sustainable finance,\u201d commented Robert Scharfe, CEO of LuxSE.\n\nUnprecedented investor response\n\nThe EUR 17 billion social bond issuance is the very first social bond issued by the European Commission. It consists of two tranches; a EUR 10 billion tranche with a 10-year maturity and a EUR 7 billion tranche with a 20-year maturity. The bond was 13 times oversubscribed, with demands exceeding EUR 233 billion, which reflects the enormous support from the investor community for a social bond that will safeguard jobs and fight the rising unemployment in European countries stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.\n\n\u201cToday's listing at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange is another highlight of a process which started months ago with our dedicated work to establish SURE. This instrument enables quick financial support for social matters, especially in the area of employment which is heavily affected by the crisis. The issuance of social bonds demonstrates the EU's firm commitment to foster sustainable finance also at global level. Last week's successful launch is proof that investors appreciate not only the safety guaranteed by the EU, but also the quality of investments, aligned with the EU's strategic political priorities such as sustainability, social fairness and an environmental-friendly economy,\u201d stated Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Budget and Administration.\n\nFighting unemployment\n\nEarlier this month, the European Commission established a Social Bond Framework aligned with the International Capital Market Association's Social Bond Principles. The Social Bond Framework received a favourable second-party opinion by Sustainalytics. Issued under the EU Debt Issuance Programme, the social bond issuance is governed by Luxembourg law.\n\nThe EU SURE programme has a mandate of borrowing up to EUR 100 billion on capital markets to support efforts to protect jobs and fight unemployment across Europe. So far, 17 Member States will receive financial support totalling EUR 87.9 billion under the programme to protect jobs and workers in their respective countries. Under the Social Bond Framework, the Member States will report on the allocation of the funds and on the concrete impact in terms of the number of jobs supported.\n\nSocial brought to the fore\n\nThe EU SURE social bond is listed at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and displayed on the Luxembourg Green Exchange, the world's leading platform exclusively dedicated to sustainable securities. LuxSE established LGX in 2016 as a direct contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. LGX facilitates sustainable investment and helps reorient capital flows towards green and sustainable development. Today, LGX encompasses around 830 securities representing more than EUR 320 billion.\n\nThe EU SURE social bond framework will contribute to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 on Good health and well-being and Goal 8 on Decent work and economic growth. In this way, the SURE social bond programme contributes to the sustainable development strategy established by the EU.\n\nAbout the Luxembourg Stock Exchange\n\nThe Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) is the gateway to access international investors.

The new funding follows increased appeals by humanitarian organisations, including the UN Global Appeal.\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management, said: \u201cThe Coronavirus pandemic is creating a humanitarian crisis of an enormous scale in some of the most fragile countries in the world. The pandemic threatens food security in countries where public health systems were already weak before this new crisis. We must act now to leave no area of the world unprotected. This is in our common interest. And it is crucial that humanitarian actors continue to have the access to carry out their life-saving work.\u201d\n\nThe new funding will help vulnerable people facing major humanitarian crises, notably in the Sahel and Lake Chad region, the Central African Republic, the Great Lakes region in Africa, Eastern Africa, Syria, Yemen, Palestine and Venezuela, as well as the Rohingya. It will provide access to health services, protective equipment, water and sanitation. It will be channelled through non-governmental organisations, international organisations, United Nations agencies, and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThe \u20ac50 million allocation comes in addition to significant humanitarian funding and actions already provided by the European Commission to respond to the most pressing needs created by the Coronavirus pandemic:\n\n\tIn February 2020, \u20ac30 million was allocated to the World Health Organization. Since then, the Commission has, subject to the agreement of the EU budgetary authorities,planned around \u20ac76 million to programmes included in the United Nations Global Humanitarian Response Plan. In addition, the Commission is providing direct funding for the work of humanitarian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Red Cross\/Red Crescent movement, which are in the frontline of the humanitarian response to Coronavirus.\n\tEU Humanitarian Air Bridge: On 8 May, the Commission also announced the establishment of an EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to transport humanitarian workers and emergency supplies for the Coronavirus response to some of the most critically affected areas around the world. The first flight on 8 May, operated in cooperation with France, transported around 60 humanitarian workers from various NGOs and UN agencies and 13 tonnes of humanitarian cargo to Bangui in the Central African Republic. Two subsequent humanitarian cargo flights to Central African Republic will transport a further 27 tonnes of humanitarian supplies in total.On 15 May, on the second destination of the EU humanitarian air bridge 20 tons of supplies and humanitarian and health workers were flown to the West-African country of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe. The flight was set-up in cooperation with the Portuguese government and several humanitarian partner organisations. On their return leg, the flight also brought back over 200 EU citizens and other passengers to Lisbon in a repatriation effort.\n\n\nThe additional humanitarian funding comes on top of some \u20ac20 billion in development and emergency funding from the Commission and Member States for both short-term and long-term needs around the world as part of a \u201cTeam Europe\u201d approach.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information\n\nA global European Union response to the pandemic\n\nCoronavirus Global Response: EU sets up a Humanitarian Air Bridge\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus global response: EU allocates additional \u20ac50 million in humanitarian aid"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_905\/IP_20_905_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Daniel PUGLISI ","phone":"+32 2 296 91 40","email":"daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response\/crisis-management-and-solidarity_en#assistance-outside-the-eu","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_813"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":1,"category":"Ensuring business continuity and support for essential services","subcategory":"Wage flexibility ","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"April 2020","date":"8 April","title":"EU global response to fight the pandemic","abstract":"<p>The European Commission and the EU High Representative set out <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_604\">plans for a robust and targeted EU response<\/a> to support partner countries' efforts in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.

The EU's collective action will focus on addressing the immediate health crisis and resulting humanitarian needs, strengthening partner countries' health, water and sanitation systems and their research and preparedness capacities to deal with the pandemic, as well as mitigating the socioeconomic impact. To underpin these actions, the EU will secure financial support to partner countries amounting to more than \u20ac15.6 billion from existing external action resources. Together with our partners, we are making sure that the substantial EU funding already allocated to them is targeted to help them deal with the impact of coronavirus.\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, commented: \u201cThe virus knows no borders. This global challenge needs strong international cooperation. The European Union is working tirelessly to fight the pandemic. We all know that only together we can stop the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. To that end, the EU will soon convene a virtual pledging event to help mobilise the necessary funding and support the World Health Organisation to assist the most vulnerable countries.\u201d\n\nHigh Representative\/Vice-President Josep Borrell, added: \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic requires united, global action in response. The European Union and its Member States are playing their part in tackling this health crisis and its severe consequences \u2013 at home and abroad. While we are doing everything we can to provide support of our citizens, we also need to assist our partners in our direct neighbourhood and beyond to address the impact it will have on their livelihoods, stability and security, as their problems are our problems. This is a global fight that we will either win or lose together. Cooperation and joint efforts at the international level and multilateral solutions are the way forward, for a true global agenda for the future.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen, explained: \u201dAs long as the coronavirus threatens lives somewhere, we are not safe. This is the core of international cooperation and partnerships. We need to work together in order to tackle our shared challenges. Today the European Commission steps up and leads with this significant global response package of more than \u20ac15.6billion the joint work with our partners, particularly in Africa, for a safer future for us all.\u201d\n\nNeighbourhood and Enlargement Commissioner, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, said: \u201cAs part of our global response to the coronavirus pandemic we are redirecting over \u20ac3.8 billion of foreseen funds for the Western Balkans and our immediate neighbours to the East and to the South, to where their real needs are today: for urgent response to the health crisis, to strengthen the health systems and to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the pandemic. We share a continent and we can only succeed together.\u201d\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management, warned: \u201cWe are facing what could become the biggest humanitarian crisis in decades. The impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the most fragile countries, migrants and the most vulnerable people is likely to be dramatic. This is particularly the case in the confined and often insalubrious setting of refugee and internally displaced people camps. That is why we need to respond vigorously to the public health emergency, make sure humanitarian actors continue to have access to carry out their life-saving assistance and support transport and logistic for key humanitarian operations.\u201d\n\nTeam Europe package\n\nThe EU's response follows a \u2018Team Europe' approach, aimed at saving lives by providing quick and targeted support to our partners to face this pandemic. It combines resources from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to support partner countries and address their short-term needs, as well as the longer-term structural impacts on societies and the economy. The first Team Europe packages are already being implemented in the immediate neighbourhood: the Western Balkans, in the East and to the South.\n\nThe EU, as global actor and major contributor to the international aid system, will promote a coordinated multilateral response, in partnership with the United Nations, International Financial Institutions, as well as the G7 and the G20.\n\nThe European Union will continue to adapt its response to the evolving situation and focus on the most affected countries in need of health support, such as countries in Africa, the Neighbourhood, the Western Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean. The EU's response will focus on the most vulnerable people, including migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons and their host communities and integrate its strategic objectives set out in the Green Deal and the Digital Agenda.\n\nFrom the overall package of \u20ac15.6 billion, \u20ac3.25 billion are channelled to Africa, including \u20ac1.19 billion for the Northern African neighbourhood countries.\n\nThe EU is securing in total \u20ac3.07 billion for the whole neighbourhood\u00a0\u2013 \u20ac2.1 billion\u00a0for the South and \u20ac962 million for the\u00a0Eastern Partner countries \u2013 and \u20ac800 million for the\u00a0Western Balkans and Turkey.\n\nIn addition, the overall package includes another \u20ac1.42 billion in guarantees for Africa and the neighbourhood from the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD).\n\nThe EU will support Asia and the Pacific with \u20ac1.22 billion, another \u20ac291 million will go for the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific region, \u20ac918 million to support our partners in Latin America and the Caribbean and \u20ac111 million to support Overseas Countries and Territories.\n\nDelivering the EU global response package in practice\n\n\u20ac502 million for Emergency response actions focus amongst others, on:\n\n\tProviding immediate support to the Response Plans of the World Health Organisation and the United Nations, as well as to the appeal of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to boost emergency preparedness and response in countries with weaker health systems and those dealing with humanitarian crises;\n\tProviding immediate humanitarian support in affected countries, in particular in health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and logistics;\n\tSupporting increased production in Europe of personal protective equipment and medical devices to meet urgent needs in Europe and in partner countries;\n\tOrganising the supply of in-kind assistance to affected countries through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism;\n\tProviding guarantee and liquidity provisions to local banks via International Financial Institutions and European Development Finance Institutions, supported by the European Fund for Sustainable Development;\n\tSupporting global efforts to combat export restrictions and ensure supply chains remain intact, notably for essential medical supplies and pharmaceuticals;\n\tAssociating the Western Balkans to EU initiatives such as the Joint Procurement Agreement for medical equipment and the European rapid alert system for communicable diseases. Countries negotiating their accession can also apply for the EU Solidarity Fund.\n\n\n\u20ac2.8 billion to support research, health and water systems. The EU is, amongst others:\n\n\tSupporting partner countries in building resilient, responsive health and social protection systems;\n\tSupporting communication and awareness efforts on basic protective measures and hygiene advice to prevent the spread;\n\tAllowing some EU funding from global health initiatives like the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) and the Global Financial Facility to be used to respond to the coronavirus, while ensuring continuation of vital health programmes;\n\tSupporting further research on diagnostics, treatment and prevention, and once a vaccine is available, fast-tracking approval and subsidizing vaccines and their delivery in vulnerable countries;\n\tSupporting experts training, epidemiological surveillance and strengthening regional health organisations in Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean and Asia and the Pacific;\n\tWelcoming candidate countries in the Western Balkans to the EU's Health Security Committee and reflecting how best to associate potential candidates;\n\tSupporting equal access to health systems for migrants, refugees and host communities.\n\n\n\u20ac12.28 billion to address the economic and social consequences.\u00a0The EU is amongst other:\n\n\tProviding direct budget support and concessional financing for partner countries to adopt reforms for socio-economic development and poverty reduction, and measures to protect workers during the crisis;\n\tMobilising macro-financial assistance for Western Balkan and neighbouring countries with the International Monetary Fund (IMF);\n\tSupporting the private sector, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the self-employed, via guarantees, liquidity provisions and technical assistance and further reorient guarantees from the European Fund for Sustainable Development towards short-term risk-sharing on loans;\n\tProviding public sector loans from the European Investment Bank, notably for healthcare equipment and supplies;\n\tWorking with international organizations and European companies to build strong and resilient value chains in strategic sectors and ensure labour rights and corporate social responsibility;\n\tPromoting forms of debt relief considered by the IMF in affected countries.\n\n\nFor More Information\n\nLink to the communication\n\nQuestions & Answers: The EU global response to fight the coronavirus pandemic\n\nFactsheet on concrete examples of EU support in partner countries\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: EU global response to fight the pandemic"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_604\/IP_20_604_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Ana PISONERO-HERNANDEZ","phone":"+32 2 295 43 20","email":"ana.pisonero-hernandez@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Gesine KNOLLE","phone":"+32 2 295 43 23","email":"gesine.knolle@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["foreign affairs and security policy","international cooperation and development"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/joint-communication-global-eu-response-covid-19_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_606","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/fs_20_607"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"January 2021","date":"29 January","title":"Commission puts in place transparency and authorisation mechanism for exports of COVID-19 vaccines","abstract":"<p>In an effort to ensure timely access to COVID-19 vaccines for all EU citizens and to tackle the current lack of transparency of vaccine exports outside the EU, the Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_307\">put in place a measure<\/a> requiring that such exports are subject to an authorisation by Member States.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_307"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_307"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_307","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"29 January 2021","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to ensure timely access to COVID-19 vaccines for all EU citizens and to tackle the current lack of transparency of vaccine exports outside the EU, the Commission has today put in place a measure requiring that such exports are subject to an authorisation by Member States.\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThe pandemic is having devastating effects in Europe and all around the world. Protecting the health of our citizens remains our utmost priority, and we must put in place the necessary measures to ensure we achieve this. This transparency and authorisation mechanism is temporary, and we will of course continue to uphold our commitments towards low and middle income countries.\u201d\n\nExecutive Vice-President and Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said: \u201cThis time-limited and targeted system covers only those COVID-19 vaccines that were agreed by Advanced Purchase Agreements with the EU. The aim is to provide greater clarity on vaccine production in the EU and their exports \u2013 this transparency has been lacking and is vital at this time. This mechanism includes a wide range of exemptions to fully honour our humanitarian aid commitments and protect vaccines deliveries to our neighbourhood, and to countries in need covered by the COVAX-facility.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides said: \u201cFor the best part of the last year we worked hard to get Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers to bring vaccines to the citizens, in Europe and beyond. We gave upfront funding to companies to build the necessary manufacturing capacity to produce vaccines, so deliveries can start as soon as they are authorised. We now need transparency on where the vaccines we secured are going and ensure that they reach our citizens. We are accountable towards the European citizens and taxpayers \u2013 that is a key principle for us.\u201d \n\nThe Commission has invested large amounts in the development of the production capacity of vaccine developers in the EU. This with the aim to ensure quicker delivery of vaccines to the European citizens, support planning and vaccination strategies with the ultimate goal to protect public health. It is therefore reasonable for the EU to monitor how the funds disbursed under the Advance Purchase Agreements (APA) have been used, especially in a context of potential shortages of essential COVID-19 vaccines. The main purpose is to offer public transparency to the European citizens. The transparency and authorisation system will require companies to notify the Member State authorities about the intention to export vaccines produced in the European Union.\n\nThe export authorisation scheme\n\nThis implementing act, adopted by urgency procedure and published today, provides for authorisations of exports outside the EU of COVID-19 vaccines until the end of March 2021. This scheme only applies to exports from companies with whom the EU has concluded Advance Purchased Agreements.\n\nBased on the previous experience with a similar measure on personal protective equipment in Spring 2020, the Commission will assist Member States in setting up the relevant mechanism to ensure a smooth and coordinated implementation of the regulation.\n\nThis measure is targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary. It is fully consistent with the EU's international commitment under the World Trade Organization and the G20, and in line with what the EU has proposed in the context of the WTO trade and health initiative. Committed to international solidarity, the EU excluded from this scheme vaccine supplies for humanitarian aid or destined to countries under the COVAX facility, as well as our neighbourhood.\n\nAbout the EU's vaccine strategy\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements (APA). Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. The APA is therefore a de-risk investment upfront against a binding commitment from the company to pre-produce, even before it gets\u00a0marketing authorisation. This should allow for a quick and steady delivery as soon as the authorisation has been granted.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommission Implementing Regulation\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\n","detail_title":["Commission puts in place transparency and authorisation mechanism for exports of COVID-19 vaccines"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_307\/IP_21_307_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Miriam GARCIA FERRER","phone":"+32 2 299 90 75","email":"miriam.garcia-ferrer@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Sophie DIRVEN","phone":"+32 2 296 72 28","email":"sophie.dirven@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["trade, agriculture"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R0111","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_21_308"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Companies"},{"month_name":"November 2020","date":"18 November","title":"Commission welcomes the political agreement on REACT-EU","abstract":"<p>The Commission welcomed the political agreement between the European Parliament and EU Member States in the Council on the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe package (REACT-EU).

The new\u00a0guidance recommends operational and organisational\u00a0steps to keep essential transport flows moving, including medical supplies and personnel.\n\nCommissioner for Transport Adina V\u0103lean declared: \"Air cargo amounts to approximately 35% of world trade by value and is a key part of freight transport. It keeps global supply chains functioning for many of the most high-value materials and it is a critical complement to the transport of freight by land and sea. We are providing concrete measures to keep such services running,\u00a0including on passenger planes. Time-sensitive products, such as medicines, need to be flown. The guidelines adopted today have also recommendations on removing or showing flexibility in night curfews or slot restrictions at airports,\u00a0and also special measures for air cargo personnel.\u201d\n\nThe measures include inviting Member States to grant temporary traffic rights for additional cargo operations from outside the EU if restrictions would normally apply, even if these cargo operations are conducted with passenger aircraft. Member States are also advised to temporarily remove night curfews and\/or slot restrictions at airports for essential air cargo operations, and to facilitate the use of passenger aircraft for cargo-only operations. Aircrew flying the aircraft should be exempted from travel restrictions if they do not show symptoms.\n\nIt is crucial that open airports have sufficient capacity to handle air cargo, and put in place special measures for transport personnel involved in the transport of goods.\n\nThese exceptional measures will be temporary for the duration of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nAny restrictions incompatible with Union law must be lifted. The Commission is also calling on all third countries to refrain from unnecessary restrictions on air cargo operations, in particular those incompatible with agreements in place. This is in the common interest of supply chain continuity for goods, including essential ones, such as highly specialised, urgent and critical products such as medical supplies.\n\nBackground\n\nContinued and uninterrupted air cargo services are vital for the economy and for fighting the coronavirus. European and global supply chains depend on them, and air cargo should be able to continuously deliver products such as food, medical supplies and other products, which are critical to the functioning of vulnerable supply chains. The Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services adopted by the European Commission on 16 March 2020, stress the principle that all EU internal borders should stay open to freight, and that the supply chains for essential goods continue to function. Member States should fully implement these guidelines at all internal border-crossings.\n\nThe Communication on the implementation of green lanes adopted by the European Commission on 23 March 2020 is intended to ensure continuous flow of goods in a cooperative manner across the EU to ensure all freight, including but not limited to essential goods such as food and medical supplies, gets to its destination quickly, without any delays.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU response to Coronavirus outbreak\n\nOverview of national measures by country\n\nCommunication on the implementation of green lanes\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission issues guidance to ensure essential freight keeps moving by air"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_533\/IP_20_533_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Stephan MEDER","phone":"+32 2 291 39 17","email":"Stephan.Meder@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["mobility and transport","transport","food safety","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/transport\/coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_510"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Ensuring business continuity and support for essential services","subcategory":"Wage flexibility ","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"23 March","title":"Ensuring continuous flow of goods across EU via green lanes","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_510\">New practical advice<\/a> was issued on implementing Guidelines for border management, in order to keep freight moving across the EU during the pandemic.

To ensure that EU-wide supply chains continue to operate, Member States are requested to designate, without delay, all the\u00a0relevant internal border-crossing points on the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) as \u2018green lane' border crossings. The green lane border crossings should be open to all freight vehicles, whatever goods they are carrying. Crossing the border, including any checks and health screening, should not take more than 15 minutes. \n\nCommissioner for Transport Adina V\u0103lean said: \u201cThe EU's transport network connects the whole of the EU. Our guidance document is intended to protect the EU's supply chains in these difficult circumstances, and to make sure both goods and transport workers are able to travel to wherever they are needed \u2013 without delay. A collective and coordinated approach to cross-border transport is more important today than ever before. The green lanes are also specifically designed to protect transport workers at the frontline of this crisis. This set of recommendations will ease their already stressful mission and it will bring more safety and predictability to their work.\u201d\n\nGreen lane border crossings\n\nProcedures at green lane border crossings should be minimised and streamlined to what is strictly necessary. Checks and screening should be carried out without drivers having to leave their vehicles, and drivers themselves should undergo only minimal checks. Drivers of freight vehicles should not be asked to produce any document other than their identification and driving license and if necessary a letter from the employer. The electronic submission\/display of documents should be accepted. \n\nNo freight vehicle or driver should face discrimination, irrespective of origin and destination, the driver's nationality or the vehicle's country of registration. \n\nIn light of the current situation, Member States are also urged to temporarily suspend all road access restrictions currently in place in their territory, such as weekend, night and sectoral bans. \n\nThe Commission encourages Member States to set up safe passage transit corridors to allow private drivers and their passengers, such as health and transport workers, as well as EU citizens being repatriated, regardless of their nationality, to directly pass with priority through the country in each necessary direction along the TEN-T Network. This should be done while staying strictly on the designated route and to take the necessary minimum rest breaks. Member States should ensure that they have at least one airport functional for repatriation and international relief flights.\n\nEnhanced cooperation among EU Member States and beyond\n\nFollowing the video-conference between EU Transport Ministers on 18 March, the Commission set up a network of national contact points and a platform to provide information on national transport measures taken by Member States in response to the coronavirus. The national contact points should support the effective functioning of the green lane border crossing points. Neighbouring non-EU countries are invited to work closely with this network to ensure the flow of goods in all directions. \n\nApplication of rules for transport workers\n\nTo keep transport moving, the Commission recommends that Member States take action to ensure the free movement of all workers involved in international transport, whatever the transport mode. In particular, rules such as travel restrictions, and mandatory quarantine of transport workers not displaying symptoms, should be waived. For example, Member States should not require that transport workers carry a doctor's certificate to prove their good health. To ensure the safety of transport workers, enhanced hygiene and operational measures are also needed in airports, ports, railway stations and other land transport hubs. Today's note from the Commission includes a full list of recommendations to protect drivers from the coronavirus (Annex 2).\u00a0 \n\nInternationally recognised certificates of professional competence should be considered sufficient to prove that a worker is active in international transport. In the absence of such certificates (not all international drivers have one), a letter signed by the employer (Annex 3) should be accepted. \n\nAll of these principles should also apply to third country nationals if they are essential to ensuring that cargo moves freely within and into the EU.\n\nBackground \n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is having a major disruptive impact on European transport and mobility. The European supply chain is maintained through an extensive network of freight transport services, including all modes of transport. Continued and uninterrupted land, waterborne and air cargo services are of crucial importance for the functioning of the EU's internal market and its effective response to the current public health crisis.\u00a0 \n\nMore Information \n\nEuropean Commission Communication on the implementation of the Green Lanes of the Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services\n\nGuidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services\n\nEuropean Commission's response to the Coronavirus\n\nOverview of national measures by country\n\n","detail_title":["Coronavirus: Commission presents practical guidance to ensure continuous flow of goods across EU via green lanes"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_510\/IP_20_510_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Stefan DE KEERSMAECKER","phone":"+32 2 298 46 80","email":"stefan.de-keersmaecker@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Stephan MEDER","phone":"+32 2 291 39 17","email":"Stephan.Meder@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["mobility and transport","transport","food safety","public health and food safety"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Protection of workers, adaptation of workplace","subcategory":"Wage flexibility ","type_of_measure":"Non-binding recommendations or other texts","funding":"No special funding required"},{"month_name":"March 2021","date":"16 March","title":"Commission disburses further \u20ac9 billion under SURE to seven EU countries","abstract":"<p>\u20ac9 billion were disbursed to seven EU countries in <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_21_1144\">the fifth instalment<\/a> of financial support under the SURE instrument.

This is the second disbursement in 2021. As part of today's operations, Czechia has received \u20ac1 billion, Spain \u20ac2.87 billion, Croatia \u20ac510 million, Italy \u20ac3.87 billion, Lithuania \u20ac302 million, Malta \u20ac123 million and Slovakia \u20ac330 million. This is the first time that Czechia has received funding under the instrument. The other six EU countries have already benefitted from loans under SURE.\n\nThese loans will assist Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help Member States cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures that they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, including for the self-employed. Today's disbursements follow the issuance of the fifth social bond under the EU SURE instrument, which attracted a considerable interest by investors.\n\nSo far, 16 Member States have received a total of \u20ac62.5 billion under the SURE instrument in back-to-back loans. Throughout 2021, the Commission will seek to raise in addition over \u20ac25 billion through the issuance of EU SURE bonds.\n\nOnce all SURE disbursements have been completed, Czechia will have received \u20ac2 billion, Spain \u20ac21.3 billion, Croatia \u20ac1 billion, Italy \u20ac27.4 billion, Lithuania \u20ac602 million, Malta \u20ac244 million and Slovakia \u20ac631 million.\n\nAn overview of the amounts disbursed up to date and the different maturities of the bonds are available online\u00a0here.\n\nOverall, the Commission has so far proposed a total of \u20ac90.6 billion in financial support to 19 Member States, of which \u20ac90.3 billion for 18 Member States have been authorised. The Council approval of the proposed \u20ac230 million to Estonia is expected in due course.\n\nIn addition, Member States can still submit requests to receive financial support under SURE which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion.\n\nMembers of the College said:\u00a0\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said:\u00a0\u201cWith SURE, we mobilise up to \u20ac100 billion in loans to help finance short-time work schemes. Today's fifth disbursement is great news for the seven EU countries concerned, especially for Czechia who is receiving SURE support for the first time. It will help protect people's jobs and support businesses across our Union. We are all in this together.\u201d \u00a0\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cFollowing the fifth successful bond issuance under SURE, we have now disbursed \u20ac62.5 billion to 16 Member States to help their economies and people to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. The SURE programme shows once again the EU's commitment to help Member States alleviate the social impact of the current pandemic. More will come.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Paolo\u00a0Gentiloni,\u00a0Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cA year has passed since the first lockdowns were imposed across much of Europe. These and subsequent restrictions were absolutely necessary, but they of course had a severe impact on our economies. As we continue to fight COVID-19, it's great to see further SURE funding flow to EU countries: providing much-needed European support for workers and the self-employed as they continue to navigate this unprecedented crisis.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nOn 9 March 2021, the European Commission issued the fifth social bond under the EU SURE instrument and the second one for 2021, for a total value of \u20ac9 billion. The issuance consisted of a single tranche, due for repayment in June 2036.\n\nThe bond attracted a strong interest by investors, thanks to which the Commission once again obtained very good pricing conditions. These are being passed on directly to the EU Member States. This achievement was reached in a context of recent volatility in capital markets and rising global interest rates.\n\nThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.\n\nMore information\n\nPress release on the fifth bond issuance\n\nSURE Regulation\n\nFactsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes SURE\n\nCoronavirus response\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\n","detail_title":["Commission disburses further \u20ac9 billion under SURE to seven Member States"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_1144\/IP_21_1144_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Balazs UJVARI","phone":"+32 2 295 45 78","email":"balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Claire JOAWN","phone":"+32 2 295 68 59","email":"claire.joawn@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Miriam GARCIA FERRER","phone":"+32 2 299 90 75","email":"miriam.garcia-ferrer@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["budget and human resources, humanitarian aid and crisis management","trade, agriculture","budget and human resources"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"May 2020","date":"12 May","title":"EUR 117 million for treatments and diagnostics through the Innovative Medicines Initiative","abstract":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_837\">Eight large-scale research projects<\/a>, aimed at developing treatments and diagnostics for the coronavirus, were selected in a fast-track call for proposals, <a href=\"\/info\/news\/covid19-horizon-2020-partly-funding-innovative-medicines-initiative-fast-track-call-2020-mar-03_en\">launched in March<\/a> by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private partnership.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_837"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_837","\/info\/news\/covid19-horizon-2020-partly-funding-innovative-medicines-initiative-fast-track-call-2020-mar-03_en"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_837","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"12 May 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission announced today that 8 large-scale research projects, aimed at developing treatments and diagnostics for the coronavirus,were selected in a fast-track call for proposals, launched in March by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private partnership.\n\nIn order to fund a larger number of high-quality proposals, the Commission increased its commitment to \u20ac72 million (up from the originally planned \u20ac45 million) from Horizon 2020, the EU's research and innovation programme. \u20ac45 million will be provided by the pharmaceutical industry, IMI associated partners and other organisations involved with the projects, bringing the total investment to \u20ac117 million. \n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cWe need to bring together the expertise and resources of the public and the private sector in order to defeat this pandemic and prepare for any future outbreaks. With this funding from Horizon 2020 and our industry and other partners, we are speeding up the development of coronavirus diagnostics and treatments, essential tools that we need to tackle the global emergency.\u201d\n\nThe projects selected today are part of the\u00a0common European response\u00a0 to the coronavirus outbreak that the Commission is coordinating since the beginning of the crisis.\u00a0On 4 May, the Commissionpledged \u20ac1.4 billion in total during the Coronavirus Global Response pledging event, of which \u20ac1 billion comes through Horizon 2020 and is aimed at developing vaccines, new treatments and diagnostic tools to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Moreover, since January 2020 the Commission has mobilised a total of \u20ac352 million under Horizon 2020. This includes, among others, \u20ac48.2 million awarded to\u00a018 research projects that have started working on preparedness and response to outbreaks, rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, new treatments and new vaccines.\n\nOut of the 8 projects funded under the IMI call, 5 are focusing on diagnostics and 3 on treatments. The ones that will be working on diagnostic tools intend to develop devices that can be used anywhere, such as in the doctor's surgery or in a patient's own home, and can deliver fast results in 14-40 minutes. The other projects, which will focus on the development of treatments, will primarily work on the current coronavirus outbreak, while they will make substantial efforts to prepare for future outbreaks.\n\nIn total, these projects comprise 94 organisations, such as universities, research organisations, companies, and public organisations. There is also strong involvement of small and medium businesses (SMEs), which make up over 20% of the participants and will receive 17% of the budget.\n\nThe list of projects that have been selected for funding, pending successful finalisation of the Grant Agreements with IMI, is available here. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThe Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is a public-private partnership between the European Commission and the pharmaceutical industry represented by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).

This funding will support part of their public expenditure on medical and personal protective equipment, emergency support to the population, and measures of prevention, monitoring and control of the spread of the disease.\n\nCommissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira said: \u201cThe EU Solidarity Fund is\u00a0a\u00a0concrete demonstration of\u00a0European solidarity in action. Since its creation, it has delivered effective assistance and relief\u00a0to millions of people\u00a0during\u00a0difficult times. Last year, we extended its scope to cover major health emergencies. Now we are proposing to mobilise much needed coronavirus-related financial assistance. The\u00a0EUSF\u00a0is once again accomplishing its core mission.\u201d\n\nThe aid package proposed today also includes the \u20ac132.7 million of advance payments already received by Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Hungary and Portugal. The mobilisation of the EUSF final payments to the 17 Member States is based on a thorough assessment of the applications submitted, ensuring consistency in the approach and equal treatment.\u00a0\n\nNext steps\n\nThe financial contribution proposed by the Commission has now to be approved by the European Parliament and the Council. The financial aid will then be disbursed to the applicant countries.\n\nBackground\n\nThe EUSF was created after the severe floods in Central Europe in the summer of 2002, primarily to assist eligible countries in the emergency and recovery operations following natural disasters. Between 2002 and 2020, the EUSF has mobilised a total of over \u20ac6.5 billion for interventions in 96 disaster events in 23 Member States and 1 accession country. The EUSF is a special instrument of solidarity and is mobilised upon applications and the assessment of their eligibility. In the forthcoming programming period 2021-2027, it will be part of the newly established Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve. Since April 2020, in the framework of the EU efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, the scope of the EUSF was extended to cover major public health emergencies.\n\nIn 2020, the EUSF provided \u20ac683.7 million to Croatia following the devastating effects of the earthquake in Zagreb and its surroundings and \u20ac7 million\u00a0to Poland\u00a0to assist\u00a0 in its reconstruction efforts following the floods in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship province. In 2021, the Commission has already authorised advance payments to France and Greece following regional disasters affecting their respective territories.\n\nFor More Information\n\nTable with the proposed EUSF aid amounts per country\n\nEU Solidarity Fund support to major health emergencies (COVID-19 outbreak)\n\nEU Solidarity Fund: supporting disaster recovery 2002-2020 (data story)\n\n\u00a0\n\n","detail_title":["EU Solidarity in action: Commission proposes to mobilise almost \u20ac530 million to support emergency measures against the coronavirus pandemic"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_21_1111\/IP_21_1111_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Vivian LOONELA","phone":"+32 2 296 67 12","email":"vivian.loonela@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Veronica FAVALLI","phone":"+32 2 298 72 69","email":"veronica.favalli@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["coordinating spokesperson for the European Green Deal","regional and urban policy","regional policy","environment","structural reforms","maritime affairs and fisheries"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/regional_policy\/sources\/thefunds\/doc\/solidarity\/eusf_contributions_covid_en.pdf","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/regional_policy\/en\/funding\/solidarity-fund\/covid-19","https:\/\/cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu\/stories\/s\/An-overview-of-the-EU-Solidarity-Fund-2002-2019\/qpif-qzyn"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Promoting the economic, labour market and social recovery","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"National funds"},{"month_name":"March 2020","date":"13 March","title":"Setting out coordinated response to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus","abstract":"<p>The Commission presented an immediate response to <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_459\">mitigate the socio-economic impact<\/a> of the COVID-19 outbreak, centred on a European coordinated response, and <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/sites\/default\/files\/eu_coronavirus_response.pdf\">via a range of tools<\/a>, e.g. State aid, flexibility of the European fiscal framework, liquidity to the banking sector, EU budget, and more.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?qid=1586871536966&amp;uri=CELEX:32020R0461\">ENTRY INTO FORCE<\/a> 1 April 2020.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_459"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_459","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/sites\/default\/files\/eu_coronavirus_response.pdf","https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?qid=1586871536966&uri=CELEX:32020R0461"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_459","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"13 March 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 is a severe public health emergency for our citizens, societies and economies with infections in all Member States.

We will do whatever is necessary to support the Europeans and the European economy.\u201d\n\nState aid Framework Flexibility\n\nThe main fiscal response to the Coronavirus will come from Member States' national budgets. EU State aid rules enable Member States to take swift and effective action to support citizens and companies, in particular SMEs, facing economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nMember States can design ample support measures in line with existing EU rules. First, they can decide to take measures, such as wage subsidies, suspension of payments of corporate and value added taxes or social contributions. In addition, Member States can grant financial support directly to consumers, for example for cancelled services or tickets that are not reimbursed by the operators concerned. Also, EU State aid rules enable Member States to help companies cope with liquidity shortages and needing urgent rescue aid. Article 107(2)(b) TFEU enables Member States to compensate companies for the damage directly caused by exceptional occurrences, including measures in sectors such as aviation and tourism.\n\nCurrently, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy is of a nature and scale that allows the use of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU. This enables the Commission to approve additional national support measures to remedy a serious disturbance to the economy of a Member State.\n\nThe Commission's assessment for the use of Article 107(3)b for other Member States will take a similar approach. The Commission is preparing a special legal framework under Article 107(3)(b) TFEU to adopt in case of need.\n\nThe Commission stands ready to work with all Member States to ensure that possible national support measures to tackle the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus can be put in place in a timely manner.\n\nEuropean Fiscal Framework Flexibility\n\nThe Commission will propose to the Council to apply the full flexibility provided for in the EU fiscal framework so that they can implement the measures needed to contain the coronavirus outbreak and mitigate its negative socio-economic effects.\n\nFirst, the Commission considers that the COVID-19 pandemic qualifies as an \u201cunusual events outside the control of government\u201d. This allows accommodating exceptional spending to contain the COVID-19 outbreak such as health care expenditure and targeted relief measures for firms and workers.\n\nSecond, the Commission will recommend adjusting the fiscal efforts required from Member States in case of negative growth or large drops in activity.\n\nFinally, the Commission stands ready to propose to the Council to activate the general escape clause to accommodate a more general fiscal policy support. This clause would \u2013 in cooperation with the Council \u2013 suspend the fiscal adjustment recommended by the Council in case of a severe economic downturn in the euro area or the EU as a whole.\n\nEnsuring solidarity in the Single Market\n\nOnly with solidarity and Europe-wide coordinated solution, we will be able to effectively manage this public health emergency. Solidarity is key in this crisis, in particular to ensure that essential goods, necessary to mitigate the health risks of the outbreak, can reach all those in need. It is essential to act together to secure production, stocking, availability and rational use of medical protective equipment and medicines in the EU, openly and transparently, rather than taking unilateral measures that restrict the free movement of essential healthcare goods.\n\nThe Commission is therefore taking all necessary steps to that end including by providing guidance for Member States on how to put in place adequate control mechanisms to ensure security of supply, and by launching an accelerated joint procurement procedure for these goods and issuing a recommendation on non CE-marked protective equipment.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak is having a major impact on our transport systems, given the close interlink of European supply chains, supported by an extensive network of freight services on land, at sea, and airborne. The Commission is working with Member States to ensure the flow of essential goods across land borders. The international and European aviation industry has been particularly hit. As announced by President von der Leyen on 10 March, to help ease the economic and ecological impact of the outbreak, the Commission is proposing today targeted legislation to temporarily alleviate airlines from the \u201cuse-it-or-lose-it\u201d rule \u2013 whereby air carriers must use at least 80% of their airports slots within a given period in order to keep them within the corresponding period of the next year.\n\nFinally, the Commission is liaising with Member States, international authorities and key EU professional associations to monitor the impact of the crisis on the tourism sector and coordinate support measures.\n\nMobilising the EU budget\n\nTo bring immediate relief to hard-hit SMEs, the EU budget will deploy its existing instruments to support these companies with liquidity, complementing measures taken at national level. In the coming weeks, EUR1 billion will be redirected from the EU budget as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund to incentivise banks to provide liquidity to SMEs and midcaps. This will help at least 100,000 European SMEs and small mid-caps with about EUR 8 billion of financing. We will also provide credit holidays to the existing debtors that are negatively affected.\n\nAlleviating the impact on employment\n\nWe need to protect workers from unemployment and loss of income to avoid permanent effect. The Commission stands ready to support Member States in this, promoting, in particular short-time work schemes, upskilling and reskilling programmes that have proven effective in the past.\n\nThe Commission will furthermore accelerate the preparation of the legislative proposal for a European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme aiming at supporting Member State policies that preserve jobs and skills.\n\nMoreover, the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative will facilitate the deployment of the European Social Fund \u2013 a fund geared towards supporting workers and healthcare.\n\nThe European Globalisation Adjustment Fund could also be mobilised to support dismissed workers and those self-employed under the conditions of the current and future Regulation. Up to EUR 179 million is available in 2020.\n\nCoronavirus Response Investment Initiative\n\nUnder this new initiative, the Commission proposes to direct EUR 37 billion under Cohesion policy to the fight against the Coronavirus crisis. To this effect, the Commission proposes to relinquish this year its obligation to request Member States to refund unspent pre-financing for the structural funds. This amounts to about EUR 8 billion from the EU budget, which Member States will be able to use to supplement EUR 29 billion of structural funding across the EU. This will effectively increase the amount of investment in 2020 and help to front-load the use of the as yet unallocated EUR 28\u00a0billion of cohesion policy funding within the 2014-2020 cohesion policy programmes. The Commission calls upon the European Parliament and the Council to swiftly approve this proposal, so that it can be adopted within the next two weeks.\n\nIn addition, the Commission is proposing to extend the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund by also including a public health crisis within its scope, in view of mobilising it if needed for the hardest hit Member States. Up to EUR 800 million is available in 2020.\u00a0\n\nFor More Information\n\nMEMO: European Coordinated Response on Coronavirus \u2013 Questions and Answers\n\nFactsheet: EU Coronavirus Response\n\nCommunication on the economic aspects of the COVID-19 crisis\n\nAnnex to the Communication on the economic aspects of the COVID-19 crisis\n\nProposal for a Regulation on COVID-19 Response Investment Initiative\n\nProposal for a Regulation on airport slots\n\nProposal for a Regulation to provide financial assistance to Member States and countries negotiating their accession to the Union seriously affected by a major public health emergency\n\nCoronavirus website\n\n*Updated 13-03-2020,\u00a017:22\n\n","detail_title":["COVID-19: Commission sets out European coordinated response to counter the economic impact of the Coronavirus*"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_459\/IP_20_459_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Eric MAMER","phone":"+32 2 299 40 73","email":"eric.mamer@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Dana SPINANT","phone":"+32 2 299 01 50","email":"dana.spinant@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Vivian LOONELA","phone":"+32 2 296 67 12","email":"vivian.loonela@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marta WIECZOREK","phone":"+32 2 295 81 97","email":"marta.wieczorek@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Arianna PODESTA","phone":"+32 2 298 70 24","email":"arianna.podesta@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["coordinating spokesperson for the European Green Deal","responsible for questions regarding Eurostat","competition","economic and financial affairs, jobs and social rights","regional policy","environment","structural reforms","maritime affairs and fisheries"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_20_458","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/eu-coronavirus-response_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/communication-economic-aspects-covid-19-crisis_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/annexes-communication-economic-aspects-covid-19-crisis_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/proposal-regulation-covid-19-response-investment-initiative_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/files\/proposal-regulation-airport-slots_en","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/sites\/info\/files\/regulation-coronavirus-financial-assistance-accession-countries-march-2020_en.pdf","https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/live-work-travel-eu\/health\/coronavirus-response_en"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Regional funds"},{"month_name":"January 2021","date":"28 January","title":"Prolonging State aid Temporary Framework to further support the economy","abstract":"<p>The Commission has decided to prolong until 31\u00a0December\u00a02021 the <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_496\">State aid Temporary Framework<\/a> adopted on 19\u00a0March\u00a02020 to support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak.

Together with many other support measures that can be used by Member States under the existing State aid rules, the Temporary Framework enables Member States to ensure that sufficient liquidity remains available to businesses of all types and to preserve the continuity of economic activity during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nExecutive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is severe. We need to act fast to manage the impact as much as we can. And we need to act in a coordinated manner. This new Temporary Framework enables Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nThe State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, based on Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, recognises that the entire EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. To remedy that, the Temporary Framework provides for five types of aid:\n\n(i)\u00a0 Direct grants, selective tax advantages and advance payments: Member States will be able to set up schemes to grant up to \u20ac800,000 to a company to address its urgent liquidity needs.\n\n(ii)\u00a0 State guarantees for loans taken by companies from banks: Member States will be able to provide State guarantees to ensure banks keep providing loans to the customers who need them.\n\n(iii) Subsidised public loans to companies: Member States will be able to grant loans with favourable interest rates to companies. These loans can help businesses cover immediate working capital and investment needs.\n\n(iv) Safeguards for banks that channel State aid to the real economy: Some Member States plan to build on banks' existing lending capacities, and use them as a channel for support to businesses \u2013 in particular to small and medium-sized companies. The Framework makes clear that such aid is considered as direct aid to the banks' customers, not to the banks themselves, and gives guidance on how to ensure minimal distortion of competition between banks.\n\n(v) Short-term export credit insurance: The Framework introduces additional flexibility on how to demonstrate that certain countries are not-marketable risks, thereby enabling short-term export credit insurance to be provided by the State where needed.\n\nGiven the limited size of the EU budget, the main response will come from Member States' national budgets. The Temporary Framework will help target support to the economy, while limiting negative consequences to the level playing field in the Single Market.\n\nThe Temporary Framework therefore includes a number of safeguards. For example, It links the subsidised loans or guarantees to businesses to the scale of their economic activity, by reference to their wage bill, turnover, or liquidity needs, and to the use of the public support for working or investment capital. The aid should therefore help businesses to weather the downturn and to prepare a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe Temporary Framework complements the many other possibilities already available to Member States to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, in line with EU State aid rules. On 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak setting out these possibilities. For example, Member States can make generally applicable changes in favour of businesses (e.g. deferring taxes, or subsidising short-time work across all sectors), which fall outside State Aid rules. They can also grant compensation to companies for damage suffered due to and directly caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. This can be useful to support particularly impacted sectors, such as transport, tourism, hospitality and retail.\n\nThe Framework will be in place until the end of December 2020. With a view to ensuring legal certainty, the Commission will assess before that date if it needs to be extended.\n\nBackground\n\nState aid rules enable Member States to take swift and effective action to support citizens and companies, in particular SMEs, facing economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe Temporary Framework adopted today complements the ample possibilities for Member States to design measures in line with existing EU State aid rules, as set out in the Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak of 13 March 2020. In particular, they can adopt measures that fall outside the scope of State aid control, such as national funds granted to health services or other public services to tackle the Covid-19. Member States can also immediately act through public support measures that are available to all companies such as wage subsidies, suspension of payments of corporate and value added taxes or social contributions. In addition, Member States can grant financial support directly to consumers, for example for cancelled services or tickets that are not reimbursed by the operators concerned.\n\nIn addition, EU State aid rules enable Member States to help companies cope with liquidity shortages and needing urgent rescue aid. Article 107(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enables Member States to compensate companies for the damage directly caused by exceptional occurrences, such as those caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, including measures in sectors such as aviation and tourism.\n\nThe Commission had adopted a Temporary Framework in 2008, in response to the global financial crisis.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommunication from the Commission - Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n","detail_title":["State aid: Commission adopts Temporary Framework to enable Member States to further support the economy in the COVID-19 outbreak"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_496\/IP_20_496_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Arianna PODESTA","phone":"+32 2 298 70 24","email":"arianna.podesta@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Giulia ASTUTI","phone":"+32 2 295 53 44","email":"giulia.astuti@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["responsible for questions regarding Eurostat","competition","European statistics (ESTAT)"],"for_more_information_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/competition\/state_aid\/what_is_new\/sa_covid19_temporary-framework.pdf"],"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Supporting businesses to stay afloat","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Legislations or other statutory regulations","funding":"Regional funds"},{"month_name":"July 2020","date":"6 July","title":"Commission and EIB provide CureVac with a \u20ac75 million financing for vaccine development and expansion of manufacturing","abstract":"<p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) and CureVac, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines, <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1238\">entered into a \u20ac75 million loan agreement<\/a> to support the company's ongoing development of vaccines against infectious diseases, including its vaccine candidate CVnCoV aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections.<\/p>","presscorner_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1238"],"all_links":["https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1238"],"detail_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1238","detail_metadata":{"type":"Press release","date":"6 July 2020","location":"Brussels"},"detail_content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\tEuropean Investment Bank and CureVac sign \u20ac75 million loan agreement for the development and large-scale production of vaccines, including CureVac's vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2\n\tThe EIB loan will support CureVac's activities to complete its new messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) production facility in T\u00fcbingen, Germany\n\tThe transaction is financed under the Infectious Diseases Finance Facility of Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation programme for 2014-2020\n\n\nThe European Investment Bank (EIB) and CureVac, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on optimised mRNA, entered into a \u20ac75 million loan agreement to support the Company's ongoing development of vaccines against infectious diseases, including its vaccine candidate CVnCoV aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition, the loan will support the Company's efforts to expand its existing Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certified production capabilities and accelerate the completion of its fourth production site in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. The EIB financing will be provided in three \u20ac25 million tranches upon completion of pre-defined milestones.\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cThe coronavirus will be with us, as long as we do not have a vaccine against it. This is why our work on this front, together with international actors, is so crucial. Recently we have presented our vaccines strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of vaccines against the novel coronavirus. And since the beginning of the pandemic, we increased the funding for the Infectious Diseases Finance Facility by \u20ac400 million to allow the EIB to process a higher volume of projects addressing this disease. With our support to CureVac we accelerate our efforts to find safe and effective solutions for everyone in Europe and globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not need a pandemic to prove that new vaccines can be breakthroughs for public health,\u201d said Ambroise Fayolle,\u00a0EIB\u00a0Vice-President\u00a0in\u00a0charge of innovation and health. \u201cBut in times like ours it becomes clear just how important they are to keep societies running globally. In fact, the only way to end the dramatic situation the world is facing since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would be a safe and effective vaccine. Thanks to our cooperation with the European Commission, we can finance more and more innovative biotech and medtech companies, such as CureVac, in their research and development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics solutions. This is an added value of Europe, and the EIB does everything it can to maximise this value for the sake of people.\u201d\n\nPierre Kemula, Chief Financial Officer of CureVac, added: \u201cWe are very pleased with the EIB financing. It allows us to further invest in our mRNA technology platform to fight life-threatening diseases. We are working intensively to develop a safe and effective low dose mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and started a Phase 1 clinical trial of CVnCoV in June. We are looking forward to expediting the completion of our industrial-scale production site to provide critically needed supply of innovative mRNA-based vaccines.\u201d\n\nAbout CureVac's mRNA technology platform\n\nCureVac's mRNA technology platform has shown potential in the clinical development and production of mRNA based vaccines and therapeutics. The Company's proprietary RNAoptimizer\u00ae platform aims to optimize the properties of mRNA medicines based on its three core pillars: protein design, mRNA optimization and mRNA delivery. The technology can be tailored to induce varying degrees of immune responses against specific protein antigens of choice, potentially providing potent prophylactic vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases at a low dose, such as Rabies, as well as immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. The technology can also be adapted to avoid immune activation for purposes of protein therapy and antibodies, thereby providing potential new therapeutic modalities for patients suffering from a vast range of diseases.\n\nThe Infectious Diseases Finance Facility (IDFF) of the EU's Horizon 2020 programme backs the loan to CureVac. The IDFF is an example of successful collaboration between the European Commission and the EIB in the face of a health crisis. Through the IDFF, the EIB has supported 13 companies with total lending of \u20ac316 million for developing cures, vaccines and diagnostics against various infectious diseases, most prominently the coronavirus.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Investment Bank is the long-term lending institution of the European Union owned by its Member States. It makes long-term finance available for sound investments in order to contribute towards EU policy goals. The EIB also supports investments outside the EU.\n\nThe InnovFin Infectious Diseases Finance Facility (IDFF) is a financial product dedicated to support the fight against infectious diseases. The joint European Commission and EIB Group initiative falls under Horizon2020, the 2014-2020 EU research and innovation programme. IDFF enables the EIB to provide between \u20ac7.5 million and \u20ac75 million of funding to innovative players active in developing vaccines, drugs, medical and diagnostic devices and research infrastructure for combatting infectious diseases. The loans finance clinical trials, market access, and the development of prototypes or industrial roll out of novel equipment, pre-clinical R&D and working capital needs. The IDFF has been reinforced by \u20ac400 million to better tackle the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nCureVac is a leading clinical stage biotechnology company in the field of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology with 20 years of expertise in developing and optimizing this versatile molecule for medical purposes. The principle of CureVac's proprietary technology is the use of mRNA as a data carrier to instruct the human body to produce its own proteins capable of fighting a wide range of diseases. The company applies its technologies for the development of cancer therapies, antibody therapies, the treatment of rare diseases, and prophylactic vaccines. CureVac is headquartered in T\u00fcbingen, Germany with sites in Frankfurt and Boston, USA.\n\n","detail_title":["Commission and EIB provide CureVac with a \u20ac75 million financing for vaccine development and expansion of manufacturing"],"detail_pdf_link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/api\/files\/document\/print\/en\/ip_20_1238\/IP_20_1238_EN.pdf","press_contacts":[{"name":"Johannes BAHRKE","phone":"+32 2 295 86 15","email":"johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu"},{"name":"Marietta GRAMMENOU","phone":"+32 2 298 35 83","email":"marietta.grammenou@ec.europa.eu"}],"topics":["digital economy","research and innovation"],"for_more_information_links":null,"businesses":1,"citizens":0,"workers":0,"category":"Reorientation of business activities","subcategory":"Income support for people in employment (e.g. short-time work)","type_of_measure":"Company practices","funding":"National funds"}]
