to help protect people everywhere, the European Commission is presenting a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of vaccines against COVID-19. An effective and safe vaccine against the virus is our best bet to achieve a permanent solution to the pandemic. Time is of the essence. Every month gained in finding such a vaccine saves lives, livelihoods and billions of euros. Today's strategy proposes a joint EU approach and builds on the mandate received from EU health ministers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"This is a moment for science and solidarity. Nothing is certain, but I am confident that we can mobilise the resources to find a vaccine to beat this virus once and for all. We must be ready to manufacture and deploy such a vaccine across Europe and the world. This vaccine will be a breakthrough in the fight against the coronavirus, and a testament to what partners can achieve when we put our minds, research and resources together. The European Union will do all in its power to ensure that all peoples of this world have access to a vaccine, irrespective of where they live.\" Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides said: \"Working together will increase our chances of securing access to a safe and effective vaccine at the scale we need and as quickly as possible. It will ensure fair and equitable access for all across the EU and globally, thus offering the best opportunity of finding a permanent exit strategy from the COVID-19 crisis. This is the EU at its best: pooling resources, joining efforts, bringing tangible results to the everyday lives of people. No one is safe until everyone is safe and we will leave no stones unturned in our efforts to protect EU and global citizens.\" Vaccine development is a complex and lengthy process. With today's strategy, the Commission will support efforts to accelerate the development and availability of safe and effective vaccines in a timeframe between 12 and 18 months, if not earlier. Delivering on this complex undertaking requires running clinical trials in parallel with investing in production capacity to be able to produce millions, or even billions, of doses of a successful vaccine. The Commission is fully mobilised to support the efforts of vaccine developers in their endeavour. This is not a European challenge, but a global one. The European Union will not be safe until the entire world has access to a vaccine, and as such, the EU and its Member States have both a responsibility and an interest to make a vaccine universally available. An important step towards joint action between Member States has already been taken in the formation of an inclusive vaccine Alliance by France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The EU Vaccine Strategy will implement a joint approach going forward. The strategy has the following objectives: Ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines. Securing swift access to vaccines for Member States and their populations while leading the global solidarity effort. Ensuring equitable access to an affordable vaccine as early as possible. The EU strategy rests on two pillars: Securing the production of vaccines in the EU and sufficient supplies for its Member States through Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers via the Emergency Support Instrument . Additional financing and other forms of support can be made available on top of such agreements. Adapting the EU's regulatory framework to the current urgency and making use of existing regulatory flexibility to accelerate the development, authorisation and availability of vaccines while maintaining the standards for vaccine quality, safety and efficacy. Advance Purchase Agreements In order to support companies in the swift development and production of a vaccine, the Commission will enter into agreements with individual vaccine producers on behalf of the Member States. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission will finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers. This will take the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided will be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. The related funding will come from a significant part of the 2.7 billion Emergency Support Instrument . Additional support will be available through loans from the European Investment Bank. Financing criteria When taking the financing decision on what vaccines to support, the following non-exhaustive criteria will be taken into account, including: soundness of scientific approach and technology used, speed of delivery at scale, cost, risk sharing, liability, coverage of different technologies, early engagement with EU regulators, global solidarity, and capacity to supply through development of production capacity within the EU. There is always a risk that supported candidates fail during clinical trials. This Strategy is therefore similar to an insurance policy, by transferring some of the risks from industry to public authorities in return for assuring Member States of equitable and affordable access to a vaccine, should one become available. A flexible and robust regulatory process Regulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will make the greatest use of existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. This includes an accelerated procedure for authorisation, flexibility in relation to labelling and packaging, and a proposal to provide temporary derogations from certain provisions of the GMO legislation to speed up clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines containing genetically modified organisms. Companies with a promising vaccine candidate, already in or close to starting clinical trials, are invited to contact the Commission at . Global solidarity The EU is contributing to the global effort for universal testing, treatment and vaccination by mobilising resources through international pledging and by joining forces with countries and global health organisations through the Access To Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator collaborative framework. The Global Coronavirus Response pledging campaign raised 9.8 billion by the end of May 2020. A second step is underway in partnership with Global Citizen and other governmental and non-governmental partners, culminating in a global pledging summit on 27 June. The European Commission is committed to the principle of universal, equitable and affordable access to vaccines, especially for the most vulnerable countries. It is ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world.

Global solidarity The EU is contributing to the global effort for universal testing, treatment and vaccination by mobilising resources through international pledging and by joining forces with countries and global health organisations through the Access To Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator collaborative framework. The Global Coronavirus Response pledging campaign raised 9.8 billion by the end of May 2020. A second step is underway in partnership with Global Citizen and other governmental and non-governmental partners, culminating in a global pledging summit on 27 June. The European Commission is committed to the principle of universal, equitable and affordable access to vaccines, especially for the most vulnerable countries. It is ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world.

The new funding is the result of the modification of two operational programmes from the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). Italy's national ESF programme \"Active employment policies\" will receive 4.5 billion to support employment in the areas most affected by the pandemic. The additional funds will help increase the hiring of young people and women, allow workers to participate in training, and support tailor-made services for job seekers. In addition, they will help protect jobs in small businesses in the regions of Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily and Sardinia. Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Nicolas Schmit , said: \" The EU continues to support its citizens in overcoming the coronavirus crisis. The new funding for Italy will help create jobs, notably for young people and women, in the regions most in need. Investing in skills is another priority and key in mastering the green and digital transitions. We are also paying close attention to the most vulnerable people in Italy by reinforcing funding for food aid. \" Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira , said: \"Europe's regions are at the heart of Europe's recovery from the pandemic. I am glad that the EU Member States are making use of the EU's emergency support to fight the pandemic and kick-start a long-term sustainable and inclusive recovery. REACT-EU's funding will help Italians in the most impacted regions to recover from the crisis and prepare the basis for future-oriented modern economies.\" In particular, To support jobs , Italy will use 2.7 billion to reduce taxes paid by employers on social security contributions by 30%. Small businesses in the regions of Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily and Sardinia will benefit from this reduction if the worker remains in employment for at least nine months after the period for which the allowance is requested. To boost the employment of young people , Italy will invest 200 million to reduce the social security contribution for employers who, in 2021 and 2022, hire people under the age of 36 with open-ended contracts. This includes the transformation of fixed-term contracts. An additional 37.5 million will be used to support employers who hire women , again offering an incentive by reducing social security contributions. The 'New Skills Fund' will be supported with 1 billion. It combines the need to reduce the consequences on employment of the coronavirus emergency with training of workers. It funds the hours which are not worked (due, for instance, to difficulties of the company) provided they are used by workers to attend training courses. Italy will also use 500 million to reinforce and modernise the network of public employment services for implementing active labour market policies . As part of this investment, job seekers, especially long-term unemployed, will be able to conclude a tailor-made agreement with job centres, helping them to find employment according to their individual needs and skill-set. Finally, 81.7 million will support Italian authorities in preparing, managing, controlling and evaluating the new programmes. In addition to new ESF funding, the Italian national FEAD programme will receive 190 million to deliver food aid to people in need. The demand for help in accessing sufficient healthy food has grown significantly since the coronavirus crisis started. Around 10,000 partner organisations in Italy will provide more and better food packages to at least 2.5 million people in need, alongside improved social services for the recipients. Background As part of NextGenerationEU, REACT-EU provides a top-up of 50.6 billion in additional funding (in current prices) to Cohesion policy programmes over the course of 2021 and 2022. Measures focus on supporting labour market resilience, jobs, small and medium-sized enterprises, and low-income families. It also helps set future-proof foundations for the green and digital transitions and a sustainable socio-economic recovery in accordance with the REACT-EU objectives and with the 2020 country specific recommendations for the country concerned issued in the context of the European Semester. These additional resources should be used for projects that foster crisis repair capacities in the coronavirus pandemic, as well as investments in operations contributing to preparing a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy. REACT-EU entered into force on 24 December 2020 and can finance expenditure retroactively from 1 February 2020 until 31 December 2023.

Against the backdrop that Europe currently is at the epicentre of the global COVID-19 crisis, the two Presidents thanked all G20 leaders for the solidarity shown to the European Union and its Member States most affected by the crisis. They also underlined that the European Union is committed to international cooperation in tackling this pandemic and will continue to assist vulnerable countries and communities around the world, especially in Africa. The Presidents of the Commission and the Council stressed that unprecedented events call for unprecedented action and that fast, massive and coordinated global action is necessary on the health and economic fronts to save lives and avoid a further economic crisis. The G20 has a pivotal role in ensuring such global coordination. The Presidents insisted that G20 countries should coordinate their macroeconomic policies, mobilising all instruments available, to mitigate the economic downturn, support workers and companies most affected. President von der Leyen and President Michel also stressed that in order to limit the economic impact on our economies and to maintain our ability to manufacture and provide the necessary protective and medical equipment, it is imperative that we keep trade flows and supply chains open. The EU called on G20 members to assist each other in repatriating citizens stranded abroad who wish to return home. The European Union thanked the G20 Presidency for its focus on global coordination towards enhancing our collective pandemic preparedness and welcomed the fact that the G20 asked the WHO, working closely together with relevant organisations, to come up quickly with a global initiative on pandemic preparedness and response.

Greece is one of the first countries receiving a pre-financing payment under the RRF. The pre-financing will help to kick-start the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Greece's recovery and resilience plan. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the implementation of the investments and reforms outlined in Greece's recovery and resilience plan. The country is set to receive 30.5 billion in total over the lifetime of its plan (17.8 billion in grants and 12.7 billion in loans). Today's disbursement follows the recent successful implementation of the first borrowing operations under NextGenerationEU. By the end of the year, the Commission intends to raise up to a total of 80 billion in long-term funding, to be complemented by short-term EU-Bills, to fund the first planned disbursements to Member States under NextGenerationEU. Part of NextGenerationEU, the RRF will provide 723.8 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across Member States. The Greek plan is part of the unprecedented EU response to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 crisis, fostering the green and digital transitions and strengthening resilience and cohesion in our societies. Supporting transformative investments and reform projects The RRF in Greece finances investments and reforms that are expected to have a deeply transformative effect on Greece's economy and society. Here are some of these projects: Securing the green transition: 645 million will go towards financing the interconnection with the Cyclades Islands, increasing the potential for renewable energy sources as well as storage capacity. Supporting the digital transition: measures worth 375 million will boost the adoption of digital technologies, in particular by small and medium-sized enterprises, and will support the purchases of digital services and new technology cash registers. Reinforcing economic and social resilience: 740 million will be invested in strengthening active labour market policies to increase full-time employment, also for long-term unemployed and disadvantaged people. Further 627 million will be invested in improving and digitalising public administration; digitalising the justice system and accelerating legal court procedures; modernising and simplifying tax legislation. Members of the College said: President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"I am delighted that today Greece will receive the first disbursement of funds under NextGenerationEU.

This authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \"Securing safe vaccines for Europeans is our utmost priority. With the AstraZeneca vaccine now authorized, 400 million additional doses will be available in Europe. I expect the company to deliver these doses as agreed, so that Europeans can be vaccinated as soon as possible. We will continue doing all we can to secure more vaccines for Europeans, our neighbours and our partners worldwide. \" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \" With this newly authorised vaccine, our portfolio continues to take shape. Our EU Vaccines Strategy has always aimed to have a vaccine portfolio that is broad and diverse, with different technologies used, to maximise our chances of providing safe and effective vaccines to citizens as soon as possible. The European Medicines Agency's authorisation today is another step towards delivering on this promise. The Commission continues to work around the clock to secure more vaccines for Europe and our international partners . We are leaving no stone unturned in our fight against this pandemic. \" The AstraZeneca vaccine will be given to adults aged 18 years and older for preventing COVID-19 . The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. People vaccinated will receive two injections of the AstraZeneca vaccine. According to EMA , most of the participants in the studies were between 18 and 55 years old. There are not yet enough results in older participants (over 55 years old) to provide a figure for how well the vaccine will work in this group. However, protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines; as there is reliable information on safety in this population, EMA's scientific experts considered that the vaccine can be used in older adults. More information is expected from ongoing studies, which include a higher proportion of elderly participants. On the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional marketing authorisation. The AstraZeneca vaccine is based on an adenovirus, a harmless virus which delivers the 'instructions' from the virus that causes COVID-19.This allows the body's own cells to make the protein unique to the COVID-19 virus. The person's immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by COVID-19. Next steps According to the contract signed with the European Commission on 27 August 2020, AstraZeneca will deliver the total amount of 400 million doses throughout 2021. These will add to the 600 million doses of the vaccine by BioNTech-Pfizer and the 160 million doses of the vaccine by Moderna. Background A conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However it also ensures that this COVID-19 vaccine meets the EU standards, as for all other vaccines and medicines. Once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. CMAs are foreseen in the EU legislation specifically for public health emergencies and is considered the most appropriate regulatory mechanism in this pandemic for granting access to all EU citizens and for underpinning mass vaccination campaigns. AstraZeneca submitted an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA on 11 January 2021. However, assessment already started beforehand. EMA had started assessing non-clinical data from laboratory studies in October 2020 and updated its rolling review end of December 2020 on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks. The European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional marketing authorisation.

The person's immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by COVID-19. Next steps According to the contract signed with the European Commission on 27 August 2020, AstraZeneca will deliver the total amount of 400 million doses throughout 2021. These will add to the 600 million doses of the vaccine by BioNTech-Pfizer and the 160 million doses of the vaccine by Moderna. Background A conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However it also ensures that this COVID-19 vaccine meets the EU standards, as for all other vaccines and medicines. Once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. CMAs are foreseen in the EU legislation specifically for public health emergencies and is considered the most appropriate regulatory mechanism in this pandemic for granting access to all EU citizens and for underpinning mass vaccination campaigns. AstraZeneca submitted an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA on 11 January 2021. However, assessment already started beforehand. EMA had started assessing non-clinical data from laboratory studies in October 2020 and updated its rolling review end of December 2020 on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks. The European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional marketing authorisation.

Efforts include increasing production by existing manufacturers, facilitating imports and activating alternative ways of producing equipment. Upon the urgent request of the Commission, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), in collaboration with all their members, have agreed to immediately make available a number of European standards for certain medical devices and personal protective equipment. This action will help both EU and third-country companies willing to manufacture these items to swiftly start production and place products on the internal market more easily while ensuring a high degree of safety. Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton said: \"We need to act collectively with urgency, solidarity, and audacity. I am encouraging manufacturers to increase and diversify production, building on positive examples such as textile and shoe manufacturers starting to produce masks and gowns. I will do everything possible to support their efforts. I am pleased to announce that following contacts with the Commission, CEN\/CENELEC has agreed to make freely available the standards needed for such companies to be able to produce masks and other protective equipment.\" Today's agreement has immediate effect. The 11 standards developed by CEN and potentially 3 additional ones developed jointly with ISO that are made available cover common filtering masks, medical gloves and protective clothing. This initiative complements the Commission Recommendation on the conformity assessment and market surveillance procedures, which provides guidance to national bodies on allowing non CE-marked personal protection equipment that comply with the necessary health and safety standards to enter the EU market within the context of the Coronavirus. How the free access to these standards helps increasing production Providing free access to the national adoptions of these European standards helps both EU and third-country companies which are reconverting their production lines to manufacture quickly these critical items for preventing the coronavirus pandemic. The use of the standards will enable companies that use them to access the market for such fundamental medical and protection equipment quicker and to provide those in need with such medical equipment. Normally, standards must be purchased and used in line with the intellectual property right rules, as the copyright of the standards lies with the organisations, which have developed the standards. The derogation from this business model is a strong European response, based on a sense of social responsibility and solidarity, to address the shortage problem of protective equipment deriving from the Covid-19 epidemics. The standards are available for free download from the websites of CEN national members. Background European standards are an essential pillar of a fully functioning internal market. They reduce costs, promote innovation, ensure interoperability between different devices and services, and help companies to access markets. To support EU product legislation, the Commission can request the development of European harmonised standards to facilitate compliance by manufacturers of the relevant requirements. Once agreed and referenced in the Official Journal of the European Union, these harmonised standards become part of EU law and allow companies an easy and direct access to the internal market for their products, while ensuring a high degree of safety for consumer. European legislation for medical devices and personal protection equipment does also rely on harmonised standards. In our common effort to face the corona virus outbreak, the Commission and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) have agreed to make a number of harmonised standards for important protective equipment like face masks and single-use gloves freely available to those companies that are willing to start producing these items.

It does not care who we are, or where we are: everyone is at risk. As long as COVID-19 exists somewhere in the world, no one is safe. The European Union, its Member States, and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, acting together as ' Team Europe ', pool resources and expertise to jointly tackle the destructive impact of COVID-19. We are adapting our priorities and programmes with partner countries to meet their needs and respond in a quicker and more coherent manner. Team Europe steps up delivery of its COVID-19 recovery package and future work with partner countries In practice, we help: to halt the spread of COVID-19 by contributing to a fast and equitable access to safe, quality, effective and affordable tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus to strengthen partner countries' healthcare, water and sanitation systems to mitigate the immediate social and economic consequences of the crisis Team Europe is mobilising about 46 billion in support of our partner countries. Vaccines Our efforts to guarantee equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines started early on. We hosted a pledging marathon, which raised a total of 15.9 billion to develop and deploy vaccines, tests and treatments. As a result, Team Europe's support to the most promising manufacturers in both vaccine development and build-up of manufacturing capacity helped to speed up the process, which usually takes years, into less than one year. We have together with our partners set up the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator initiative and the COVAX Facility , a global initiative bringing together governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines reach those most in need. Team Europe is investing over 3 billion to help secure 1.8 billion doses of vaccines for 92 low and middle-income countries. Our support will continue. The EU has worked with its industrial partners to make vaccines available for low and middle-income countries in 2021 and 2022, and Member States are sharing their vaccines via COVAX. The EU will support partners with vaccination strategies and the distribution of supplies. As Team Europe, we are also working on an initiative for manufacturing and access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies in Africa. It will help create vaccines manufacturing in Africa, including by supporting the set-up of regional manufacturing hubs. Other regions could be associated in the future.

organisations providing immediate humanitarian support in affected countries, in particular in health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and logistics increasing production in Europe of personal protective equipment and medical devices to meet urgent needs in Europe and in partner countries organising the supply of in-kind assistance to affected countries through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism providing guarantee and liquidity provisions to local banks via International Financial Institutions and European Development Finance Institutions, supported by the European Fund for Sustainable Development supporting global efforts to provide sufficient supply of essential goods, food and water, measures to combat export restrictions and ensure supply chains remain intact, notably for essential medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Supporting healthcare systems and the response to the pandemic in partner countries What the EU is doing: strengthening the preparedness and response capacities of countries with fragile healthcare systems and providing critical medical supplies and equipment. This has been a successful approach in recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika providing protective equipment for health workers in the most vulnerable countries, both directly and through the World Health Organization's Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) helping to train public health workers in epidemiological surveillance and the use of mobile labs strengthening regional epidemiological surveillance and disease control institutions in Africa (Africa CDC and its regional centres), the Caribbean (CARPHA) and the Pacific (SPC) supporting communication and awareness efforts on basic protective measures and hygiene advice to prevent the spread. Economic response Budget support will allow governments to deliver essential services and loan guarantees to boost economic activity and safeguard livelihoods What is the EU doing : re-orientating support to national governments via direct budget support and financing (on-going programmes in 90 countries and territories, including neighbourhood countries), to shore up the economy and allow governments to continue to deliver vital health services access to loans and guarantees, despite the crisis situation (see Guarantees and blending ) supporting the private sector through loan guarantees, technical assistance and increased access to liquidity support, working capital and trade finance.

It does not care who we are, or where we are: everyone is at risk. As long as COVID-19 exists somewhere in the world, no one is safe. The European Union, its Member States, and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, acting together as ' Team Europe ', pool resources and expertise to jointly tackle the destructive impact of COVID-19. We are adapting our priorities and programmes with partner countries to meet their needs and respond in a quicker and more coherent manner. Team Europe steps up delivery of its COVID-19 recovery package and future work with partner countries In practice, we help: to halt the spread of COVID-19 by contributing to a fast and equitable access to safe, quality, effective and affordable tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus to strengthen partner countries' healthcare, water and sanitation systems to mitigate the immediate social and economic consequences of the crisis Team Europe is mobilising about 46 billion in support of our partner countries. Vaccines Our efforts to guarantee equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines started early on. We hosted a pledging marathon, which raised a total of 15.9 billion to develop and deploy vaccines, tests and treatments. As a result, Team Europe's support to the most promising manufacturers in both vaccine development and build-up of manufacturing capacity helped to speed up the process, which usually takes years, into less than one year. We have together with our partners set up the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator initiative and the COVAX Facility , a global initiative bringing together governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines reach those most in need. Team Europe is investing over 3 billion to help secure 1.8 billion doses of vaccines for 92 low and middle-income countries. Our support will continue. The EU has worked with its industrial partners to make vaccines available for low and middle-income countries in 2021 and 2022, and Member States are sharing their vaccines via COVAX. The EU will support partners with vaccination strategies and the distribution of supplies. As Team Europe, we are also working on an initiative for manufacturing and access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies in Africa. It will help create vaccines manufacturing in Africa, including by supporting the set-up of regional manufacturing hubs. Other regions could be associated in the future.

organisations providing immediate humanitarian support in affected countries, in particular in health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and logistics increasing production in Europe of personal protective equipment and medical devices to meet urgent needs in Europe and in partner countries organising the supply of in-kind assistance to affected countries through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism providing guarantee and liquidity provisions to local banks via International Financial Institutions and European Development Finance Institutions, supported by the European Fund for Sustainable Development supporting global efforts to provide sufficient supply of essential goods, food and water, measures to combat export restrictions and ensure supply chains remain intact, notably for essential medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Supporting healthcare systems and the response to the pandemic in partner countries What the EU is doing: strengthening the preparedness and response capacities of countries with fragile healthcare systems and providing critical medical supplies and equipment. This has been a successful approach in recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika providing protective equipment for health workers in the most vulnerable countries, both directly and through the World Health Organization's Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) helping to train public health workers in epidemiological surveillance and the use of mobile labs strengthening regional epidemiological surveillance and disease control institutions in Africa (Africa CDC and its regional centres), the Caribbean (CARPHA) and the Pacific (SPC) supporting communication and awareness efforts on basic protective measures and hygiene advice to prevent the spread. Economic response Budget support will allow governments to deliver essential services and loan guarantees to boost economic activity and safeguard livelihoods What is the EU doing : re-orientating support to national governments via direct budget support and financing (on-going programmes in 90 countries and territories, including neighbourhood countries), to shore up the economy and allow governments to continue to deliver vital health services access to loans and guarantees, despite the crisis situation (see Guarantees and blending ) supporting the private sector through loan guarantees, technical assistance and increased access to liquidity support, working capital and trade finance.

It does not care who we are, or where we are: everyone is at risk. As long as COVID-19 exists somewhere in the world, no one is safe. The European Union, its Member States, and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, acting together as ' Team Europe ', pool resources and expertise to jointly tackle the destructive impact of COVID-19. We are adapting our priorities and programmes with partner countries to meet their needs and respond in a quicker and more coherent manner. Team Europe steps up delivery of its COVID-19 recovery package and future work with partner countries In practice, we help: to halt the spread of COVID-19 by contributing to a fast and equitable access to safe, quality, effective and affordable tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus to strengthen partner countries' healthcare, water and sanitation systems to mitigate the immediate social and economic consequences of the crisis Team Europe is mobilising about 46 billion in support of our partner countries. Vaccines Our efforts to guarantee equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines started early on. We hosted a pledging marathon, which raised a total of 15.9 billion to develop and deploy vaccines, tests and treatments. As a result, Team Europe's support to the most promising manufacturers in both vaccine development and build-up of manufacturing capacity helped to speed up the process, which usually takes years, into less than one year. We have together with our partners set up the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator initiative and the COVAX Facility , a global initiative bringing together governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines reach those most in need. Team Europe is investing over 3 billion to help secure 1.8 billion doses of vaccines for 92 low and middle-income countries. Our support will continue. The EU has worked with its industrial partners to make vaccines available for low and middle-income countries in 2021 and 2022, and Member States are sharing their vaccines via COVAX. The EU will support partners with vaccination strategies and the distribution of supplies. As Team Europe, we are also working on an initiative for manufacturing and access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies in Africa. It will help create vaccines manufacturing in Africa, including by supporting the set-up of regional manufacturing hubs. Other regions could be associated in the future.

organisations providing immediate humanitarian support in affected countries, in particular in health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and logistics increasing production in Europe of personal protective equipment and medical devices to meet urgent needs in Europe and in partner countries organising the supply of in-kind assistance to affected countries through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism providing guarantee and liquidity provisions to local banks via International Financial Institutions and European Development Finance Institutions, supported by the European Fund for Sustainable Development supporting global efforts to provide sufficient supply of essential goods, food and water, measures to combat export restrictions and ensure supply chains remain intact, notably for essential medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Supporting healthcare systems and the response to the pandemic in partner countries What the EU is doing: strengthening the preparedness and response capacities of countries with fragile healthcare systems and providing critical medical supplies and equipment. This has been a successful approach in recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika providing protective equipment for health workers in the most vulnerable countries, both directly and through the World Health Organization's Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) helping to train public health workers in epidemiological surveillance and the use of mobile labs strengthening regional epidemiological surveillance and disease control institutions in Africa (Africa CDC and its regional centres), the Caribbean (CARPHA) and the Pacific (SPC) supporting communication and awareness efforts on basic protective measures and hygiene advice to prevent the spread. Economic response Budget support will allow governments to deliver essential services and loan guarantees to boost economic activity and safeguard livelihoods What is the EU doing : re-orientating support to national governments via direct budget support and financing (on-going programmes in 90 countries and territories, including neighbourhood countries), to shore up the economy and allow governments to continue to deliver vital health services access to loans and guarantees, despite the crisis situation (see Guarantees and blending ) supporting the private sector through loan guarantees, technical assistance and increased access to liquidity support, working capital and trade finance. Business response What EU businesses are doing: Stepping up local production of medical and protective equipment in developing countries Supporting governments in coordinating private and public sector response to COVID Providing reduced costs and free services such as internet connection services Targeting population groups and reaching out through social media to educate the general population on p- rotective measures Providing free standards to manufacture COVID related equipment and making financial contributions Related documents","1aecc808816f3afc48d32a4f74643d05dba90897000619e4b30478704338880a":"Today, the Commission has issued new practical advice to ensure that mobile workers within the EU, in particular those in critical occupations to fight the coronavirus pandemic, can reach their workplace. This includes but is not limited to those working in the health care and food sectors, and other essential services like childcare, elderly care, and critical staff for utilities. Together with the Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU also issued today, this responds to requests made by EU leaders on 26 March and seeks to address practical concerns of citizens and companies affected by the measures taken to limit the spread of the coronavirus, as well as of national authorities implementing the measures. While it is understandable that Member States have introduced internal border controls to limit the spread of the coronavirus, it is imperative that critical workers are able to reach their destination without delay. Nicolas Schmit , the Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: \"Thousands of women and men working hard to keep us safe, healthy and with food on the table need to cross EU borders to go to work. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that they are not hindered in their movement, while taking every precaution to avoid further spread of the pandemic.\" The guidelines published today identify a range of workers that exercise critical occupations, and for which continued free movement in the EU is deemed essential. The list provided in these guidelines is not exhaustive. Examples include health associate professionals, child and elderly care workers, scientists in health-related industries, those needed to install critical medical devices, firefighters and police officers, transport workers, as well as persons working in the food sector. The Commission urges Member States to establish specific burden free and fast procedures to ensure a smooth passage for such frontier workers, including proportionate health screening. Beyond these specific categories of workers, the guidelines also clarify that Member States should allow frontier workers in general to continue crossing borders if work in the sector concerned is still allowed in the host Member State.Member States should treat cross border workers and national workers in the same manner. As regards seasonal workers, particularly in the agricultural sector, Member States are asked to exchange information on their different needs at technical level and to establish specific procedures to ensure a smooth passage for such workers, in order to respond to labour shortages as a result of the crisis. Seasonal workers in agriculture perform in certain circumstances critical harvesting, planting and tending functions. In such a situation, Member States should treat those persons as critical workers and communicate to the employers the necessity to provide for adequate health and safety protection. These guidelines complement the recently adopted Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services as well as the Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU which were also presented today. The Commission will continue to identify the best practices with Member States which can be extended to all Member States for allowing workers to exercise their crucial occupations without undue hindrance. Background The coronavirus pandemic has led to the introduction of unprecedented measures across EU Member States, including reintroduced checks at the internal borders. Frontier workers, posted workers as well as seasonal workers live in one EU country but work in another. Many of them are crucial for their host Member States, for instance for the health care system, the provision of other essential services including the setting up and maintenance of medical equipment and infrastructure, or ensuring the supply of necessity goods. A coordinated approach at EU level is therefore key. On 26 March, the Heads of State or government stated: \"We will urgently address, with the assistance of the Commission, the remaining problems concerning EU citizens blocked at internal EU borders and prevented from returning to their home countries and cross-border and seasonal workers who have to be able to continue essential activities while avoiding further spread of the virus.\" These guidelines presented today are the Commission's immediate response to this call, alongside the Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU which include the repatriation of EU citizens.

This latest EU mask delivery is part of a new Commission funded purchase of 10 million masks via the Emergency Support Instrument to provide direct support to Member States to mitigate the immediate consequences of the pandemic and anticipate the needs related to the exit and recovery. Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides , said: \"We are doing everything we can to support Member States in getting protective equipment to health workers on the frontline. They are Europe's modern day heroes. This is EU solidarity in action to help respond to the needs of European health systems and 3 billion has been mobilised from the EU budget to directly support national efforts. We remain steadfast in our commitment: together we can win this fight.\" The masks will be delivered to Member States and regions in need in weekly instalments of 1.5 million masks over the coming six weeks. These deliveries take place on top of the hundreds of thousands of masks already provided from the rescEU reserve of medical equipment in the past weeks, as well as assistance mobilised via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism . Only a few weeks ago, on 24 April, the Commission decided to mobilise, under the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI), 320 million for Emergency Support actions, of which 100 million are for essential health-related products that will be procured in the coming months. Background The Commission is mobilising 3 billion from the EU budget to directly support Member States' health care systems, of which 2.7 billion will be channelled through the Emergency Support Instrument and 300 million through the rescEU medical equipment capacity. Additional contributions are possible, including from Member States. The Emergency Support Instrument allows direct support to EU Member States in their efforts to address the pandemic through measures that can deliver greater impact if taken at EU level. It does not replace existing instruments (joint procurement, rescEU, etc.) but complements them. This will allow the Commission to support a wide range of initiatives, including: purchasing medical equipment such as ventilators and masks; coordinating and financially supporting the transport of patients to EU Member States with spare hospital capacity; contributing to increase the rollout and testing across the EU; supporting the deployment of vaccines, some of which might be the result of significant support under other EU initiatives. Thanks to this tool, the EU can deploy targeted actions preventing and mitigating the immediate acute consequences in one or more Member States and to support in a coordinated manner the needs related to the exit and recovery from the corona crisis in the medium to long term. The Commission will thus be providing a holistic EU response throughout the corona crisis. To implement the support, the Commission continues to work closely with national health authorities, international organisations and with the non-governmental sector.

This latest EU mask delivery is part of a new Commission funded purchase of 10 million masks via the Emergency Support Instrument to provide direct support to Member States to mitigate the immediate consequences of the pandemic and anticipate the needs related to the exit and recovery. Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides , said: \"We are doing everything we can to support Member States in getting protective equipment to health workers on the frontline. They are Europe's modern day heroes. This is EU solidarity in action to help respond to the needs of European health systems and 3 billion has been mobilised from the EU budget to directly support national efforts. We remain steadfast in our commitment: together we can win this fight.\" The masks will be delivered to Member States and regions in need in weekly instalments of 1.5 million masks over the coming six weeks. These deliveries take place on top of the hundreds of thousands of masks already provided from the rescEU reserve of medical equipment in the past weeks, as well as assistance mobilised via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism . Only a few weeks ago, on 24 April, the Commission decided to mobilise, under the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI), 320 million for Emergency Support actions, of which 100 million are for essential health-related products that will be procured in the coming months. Background The Commission is mobilising 3 billion from the EU budget to directly support Member States' health care systems, of which 2.7 billion will be channelled through the Emergency Support Instrument and 300 million through the rescEU medical equipment capacity. Additional contributions are possible, including from Member States. The Emergency Support Instrument allows direct support to EU Member States in their efforts to address the pandemic through measures that can deliver greater impact if taken at EU level. It does not replace existing instruments (joint procurement, rescEU, etc.) but complements them. This will allow the Commission to support a wide range of initiatives, including: purchasing medical equipment such as ventilators and masks; coordinating and financially supporting the transport of patients to EU Member States with spare hospital capacity; contributing to increase the rollout and testing across the EU; supporting the deployment of vaccines, some of which might be the result of significant support under other EU initiatives.

This package includes 80 million in new funds as well as 30 million reallocated from non-contracted actions under the EUTF. In line with the Joint Communication on the global EU response to COVID-19 , this new funding will also strengthen the immediate response capacity, reinforce the health systems and services in the North African partner countries, mitigate the socio-economic impact of the crisis, as well as allow for the continuation of actions to protect refugees and migrants and stabilise local communities. Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi , said: \" With today's substantial and targeted assistance package we are responding to the urgent needs to fight the COVID-19 crisis and address the needs of some of the most vulnerable groups in North Africa, in particular refugees, migrants and displaced persons. In Libya, while the armed conflict continues, the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa has already supported over 200,000 beneficiaries with hygiene kits and medical assistance and over 1.7 million people have now better access to basic services in local communities, thanks to the renovation of health centres .\" Support to Libya Libya remains the biggest beneficiary under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, with 455 million in programmes, with the majority going to protection of migrants and refugees and community stabilisation, alongside actions for border management. As part of the EU's comprehensive approach and support on migration in Libya, three new programmes adopted today will improve the resilience of both Libyans and migrants for the health challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic: A 30.2 million protection programme will provide protection services to migrants and vulnerable groups, such as health assistance to treat tuberculosis, non-food items, emergency cash assistance and emergency evacuations outside of Libya (when travel restrictions are lifted); A specific 20 million COVID-19 programme will strengthen immediate response to the virus, including personal protective equipment and training for health staff; the strengthening of laboratory capacities and intensive care response. It will also reinforce the health system and services in the country in the medium term; A 25 million community stabilisation programme to continue to improve the living conditions in the Libyan municipalities, in particular in the South, by enhancing access to basic and social services. In order to fund these essential new actions, 30 million has been re-allocated from existing Border Management programmes in Libya, which will now amount to 57.2 million. While Border Management in Libya remains a priority in order to continue to save lives at sea, the reallocation of funding reflects the need to adapt existing actions to the changing security situation on the ground. The revised Border Management programme will strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and Port Security's capacity for search and rescue activities and prevention of migrant smuggling, support the maintenance of boats, provide further training as well as support the establishment of the Libyan Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre. Support to Tunisia In Tunisia, two new programmes will strengthen support to migrants and the most vulnerable groups, who may be particularly hard hit by the current crisis: A 9.3 million governance and protection programme to provide protection services to vulnerable migrants, improve access to health services as well as to continue to support migration governance and to the Tunisian-led service for the reintegration of returnees hosted by the 'Office des Tunisiens a l'etranger' (OTE); A 5 million skills mobility programme built on two bilateral mobility agreements in place between France and Tunisia for young professionals and seasonal workers, based on the principle of circular mobility and for workers to gain needed skills in the country of origin. Regional COVID-19 response A new 10 million COVID-19 fast track emergency response programme has also been adopted to support the most vulnerable populations in North Africa tackling their emergency needs as well as the social and economic consequences of the crisis in order to contribute to the national efforts already in place. Other regional initiatives A 3.7 million regional child protection programme, with a focus on Libya and Egypt, has been adopted to improve the protection and expand access to sustainable solutions for unaccompanied and separated children and youth along the Central Mediterranean Route. 6.5 million was also adopted to fund a Technical Cooperation Facility to ensure effective monitoring and evaluations of all the actions implemented under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund of Africa. Background The EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa was established in 2015 to address the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration and to contribute to better migration management. The Trust Fund covers three windows: the Sahel and Lake Chad, the Horn of Africa, and the North of Africa. Today's assistance package brings the total funding mobilised through the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa to nearly 888 million since its launch in 2015. The new funding was approved by the Operational Committee of the Trust Fund, which brings together the European Commission, the EU Member States, the United Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland. Observers of the Operational Committee include partner countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia as well as Members of the European Parliament. The Trust Fund is also reorienting ongoing interventions in key sectors in Libya to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Reallocation of existing actions in Libya allowed implementing partners to provide personal protective equipment, hygiene kits, training to medical staff as well as awareness campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus among vulnerable groups. EU Institutions, EU Member States and other donors have so far allocated resources amounting to 5 billion to the EUTF. With today's adoption, the EUTF now funds 246 programmes totalling close to 4.8 billion. The funding is divided between three regions as follows: Sahel\/Lake Chad, 2 billion (104 programmes); Horn of Africa, 1.79 billion (99 programmes); North of Africa, 888 million (39 programmes).

The funds will complement the 400 million in guarantees the EU already committed for COVAX, making the Union one of the leading donors. With this new contribution, the EU is further stepping up investment in support of the global recovery. At the virtual Paris Peace Forum, where world leaders and international organizations are discussing the global response and the recovery from the pandemic, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \" In the midst of the wrecking COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that a global recovery will only be possible if safe and effective vaccines are available to all who need it. The EU is increasing its support to the COVAX Facility to this end and I am proud that Team Europe is a leading contributor to COVAX. Together, we can make the global recovery happen .\" Jutta Urpilainen , Commissioner for International Partnerships, said: \"The EU is demonstrating we are serious about our commitments to leave no one behind and make the COVID-19 vaccine a global public good. With this additional 100 million in grant funding, the EU join forces with international partners, in a spirit of solidarity and multilateralism, and will help secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for those who need it the most in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific countries.\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \" Of all the lessons we have learned this year, the clearest is that there is strength in solidarity. COVAX is an example of this. With this additional contribution we are one step closer to the objective of funding the purchase of 2 billion vaccines for the most vulnerable populations in 92 low and middle-income countries. But more support will be required next year to produce and distribute a safe and efficacious vaccine across the world as soon as it becomes available. We will not relent in this effort.\" The proposed allocation of 100 million from the 11 th European Development Fund (EDF) general reserve will adopt the form of a grant contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as administrator of COVAX Facility, the world's facility for universal and fair access to COVID-19 vaccines. To date, a total of 184 countries participate in the COVAX Facility, being 92 of them low and middle-income economies eligible to get access to COVID-19 vaccines through Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). Through this grant, the Commission and its partners will secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for all the participants in the Facility, including African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. This grant support will strategically complement the 400 million of bank guarantees the EU will make available to Gavi through the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the framework of the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), raising the total EU contribution for COVAX to 500 million.* Several EU Member States are contributing as well to COVAX and its underlying objectives, highlighting another example of the power of Team Europe, that is mobilising more than 870 million for COVAX, including the 100 million in EU grant and 400 million in guarantees. The figure also includes new contributions announced today by France (100 million), Spain (50 million) and Finland (2 million). Vaccines will be procured and delivered to countries by UNICEF Supply Division and the PAHO's Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines. Background COVAX is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. The COVAX Facility aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. It will help to develop a diversified portfolio of vaccines, negotiated with different suppliers, and covering different scientific technologies, delivery times and prices. The COVAX Facility is a risk-sharing mechanism: it reduces the risk for manufacturers who invest without being sure about future demand, and it reduces the risk that countries would fail to secure access to a viable vaccine. The European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home, and to promote global health. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery. Team Europe 's contribution was as follows: EU Member States (3.1 billion), European Commission (over 1.4 billion) and EIB (almost 2 billion pledged in May and 4.9 billion pledged in June). The EU's participation in COVAX will be complementary with the ongoing EU negotiations with vaccine companies launched under the EU Vaccines Strategy. The EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need. Through its Advanced Purchase Agreements, it requires manufacturers to make their production capacity available to supply all countries and calls for the free flow of vaccines and materials with no export restrictions. For instance, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-GSK, with whom the Commission concluded an Advanced Purchase Agreement in September , will endeavour to provide a significant portion of their vaccine supply through the COVAX facility. World leaders and international organizations are participating in this virtual third edition of The Paris Peace Forum , initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron to revive collective governance, international cooperation and multilateralism at a time of growing challenges and when international norms and institutions are being challenged. Discussions this year, under the overarching theme ' Bouncing back to a better planet ', will focus on improving the global governance of health and promoting green financing.

The United States and the EU are technological leaders in advanced vaccine platforms, given decades of investments in research and development. It is vital that we aggressively pursue an agenda to vaccinate the world. Coordinated U.S. and EU leadership will help expand supply, deliver in a more coordinated and efficient manner, and manage constraints to supply chains. This will showcase the force of a Transatlantic partnership in facilitating global vaccination while enabling more progress by multilateral and regional initiatives. Building on the outcome of the May 2021 G20 Global Health Summit, the G7 and U.S.-EU Summits in June, and on the upcoming G20 Summit, the U.S. and the EU will expand cooperation for global action toward vaccinating the world, saving lives now, and building better health security. Pillar I: A Joint EU\/US Vaccine Sharing Commitment : the United States and the EU will share doses globally to enhance vaccination rates, with a priority on sharing through COVAX and improving vaccination rates urgently in low and lower-middle income countries. The United States is donating over 1.1 billion doses, and the EU will donate over 500 million doses. This is in addition to the doses we have financed through COVAX. We call for nations that are able to vaccinate their populations to double their dose-sharing commitments or to make meaningful contributions to vaccine readiness. They will place a premium on predictable and effective dose-sharing to maximize sustainability and minimize waste. Pillar II: A Joint EU\/US Commitment to Vaccine Readiness : the United States and the EU will both support and coordinate with relevant organisations for vaccine delivery, cold chain, logistics, and immunization programs to translate doses in vials into shots in arms. They will share lessons learned from dose sharing, including delivery via COVAX, and promote equitable distribution of vaccines. Pillar III: A Joint EU\/US partnership on bolstering global vaccine supply and therapeutics: the EU and the United States will leverage their newly launched Joint COVID-19 Manufacturing and Supply Chain Taskforce to support vaccine and therapeutic manufacturing and distribution and overcome supply chain challenges. Collaborative efforts, outlined below, will include monitoring global supply chains, assessing global demand against the supply of ingredients and production materials, and identifying and addressing in real time bottlenecks and other disruptive factors for global vaccine and therapeutics production, as well as coordinating potential solutions and initiatives to boost global production of vaccines, critical inputs, and ancillary supplies. Pillar IV : A Joint EU\/US Proposal to achieve Global Health Security . The United States and the EU will support the establishment of a Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) by the end of 2021 and will support its sustainable capitalization. The EU and United States will also support global pandemic surveillance, including the concept of a global pandemic radar. The EU and the United States, through HERA and the Department of Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, respectively, will cooperate in line with our G7 commitment to expedite the development of new vaccines and make recommendations on enhancing the world's capacity to deliver these vaccines in real time. We call on partners to join in establishing and financing the FIF to support to prepare countries for COVID-19 and future biological threats. Pillar V: A Joint EU\/US\/Partners Roadmap for regional vaccine production . The EU and the United States will coordinate investments in regional manufacturing capacity with low and lower-middle income countries, as well as targeted efforts to enhance capacity for medical countermeasures under the Build Back and Better World infrastructure and the newly established Global Gateway partnership. The EU and the United States will align efforts to bolster local vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa and forge ahead on discussions on expanding the production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments and ensure their equitable access. We call on partners to join in supporting coordinated investments to expand global and regional manufacturing, including for mRNA, viral vector, and\/or protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines.

The United States and the EU are technological leaders in advanced vaccine platforms, given decades of investments in research and development. It is vital that we aggressively pursue an agenda to vaccinate the world. Coordinated U.S. and EU leadership will help expand supply, deliver in a more coordinated and efficient manner, and manage constraints to supply chains. This will showcase the force of a Transatlantic partnership in facilitating global vaccination while enabling more progress by multilateral and regional initiatives. Building on the outcome of the May 2021 G20 Global Health Summit, the G7 and U.S.-EU Summits in June, and on the upcoming G20 Summit, the U.S. and the EU will expand cooperation for global action toward vaccinating the world, saving lives now, and building better health security. Pillar I: A Joint EU\/US Vaccine Sharing Commitment : the United States and the EU will share doses globally to enhance vaccination rates, with a priority on sharing through COVAX and improving vaccination rates urgently in low and lower-middle income countries. The United States is donating over 1.1 billion doses, and the EU will donate over 500 million doses. This is in addition to the doses we have financed through COVAX. We call for nations that are able to vaccinate their populations to double their dose-sharing commitments or to make meaningful contributions to vaccine readiness. They will place a premium on predictable and effective dose-sharing to maximize sustainability and minimize waste. Pillar II: A Joint EU\/US Commitment to Vaccine Readiness : the United States and the EU will both support and coordinate with relevant organisations for vaccine delivery, cold chain, logistics, and immunization programs to translate doses in vials into shots in arms. They will share lessons learned from dose sharing, including delivery via COVAX, and promote equitable distribution of vaccines. Pillar III: A Joint EU\/US partnership on bolstering global vaccine supply and therapeutics: the EU and the United States will leverage their newly launched Joint COVID-19 Manufacturing and Supply Chain Taskforce to support vaccine and therapeutic manufacturing and distribution and overcome supply chain challenges. Collaborative efforts, outlined below, will include monitoring global supply chains, assessing global demand against the supply of ingredients and production materials, and identifying and addressing in real time bottlenecks and other disruptive factors for global vaccine and therapeutics production, as well as coordinating potential solutions and initiatives to boost global production of vaccines, critical inputs, and ancillary supplies. Pillar IV : A Joint EU\/US Proposal to achieve Global Health Security . The United States and the EU will support the establishment of a Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) by the end of 2021 and will support its sustainable capitalization. The EU and United States will also support global pandemic surveillance, including the concept of a global pandemic radar. The EU and the United States, through HERA and the Department of Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, respectively, will cooperate in line with our G7 commitment to expedite the development of new vaccines and make recommendations on enhancing the world's capacity to deliver these vaccines in real time. We call on partners to join in establishing and financing the FIF to support to prepare countries for COVID-19 and future biological threats. Pillar V: A Joint EU\/US\/Partners Roadmap for regional vaccine production . The EU and the United States will coordinate investments in regional manufacturing capacity with low and lower-middle income countries, as well as targeted efforts to enhance capacity for medical countermeasures under the Build Back and Better World infrastructure and the newly established Global Gateway partnership. The EU and the United States will align efforts to bolster local vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa and forge ahead on discussions on expanding the production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments and ensure their equitable access. We call on partners to join in supporting coordinated investments to expand global and regional manufacturing, including for mRNA, viral vector, and\/or protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines.

This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Slovenia's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Slovenia to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF is at the heart of NextGenerationEU which will provide 800 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Slovenian plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market. The Commission assessed Slovenia's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms set out in Slovenia's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience. Securing Slovenia's green and digital transitions The Commission finds that Slovenia's plan devotes 42% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. Measures to support securing Slovenia's green transition include investments to promote renewables, increase the energy efficiency and seismic renovation of buildings, promote climate change adaptation, and upgrade rail infrastructure. The Commission finds that the Slovenia's plan devotes 21% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. These include efforts to digitalise the public administration, investments in connectivity and digital skills and for the digitalisation of businesses. Reinforcing Slovenia's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that the Slovenian plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Slovenia by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes important reforms on long-term care, healthcare, pensions and labour market, education and skills, R&D and innovation, business environment and public procurement. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Slovenia's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars referred to in the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects The Slovenian plan proposes projects in seven European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects, which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the twin transitions. For instance, as part of the reskill and upskill flagship, Slovenia has proposed to provide 114 million to strengthen digital skills and competences of students, employees and public servants, either as part of the modernisation of the education system or through life-long learning. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The control systems put in place by Slovenia are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said: President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Slovenia's recovery and resilience plan. It combines investments for the green and digital transitions, with reforms of long-term care, healthcare, and pension systems for the benefit of all Slovenian citizens. I am proud that NextGenerationEU will provide 2.5 billion in financing to make this possible.\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \"This forward-looking recovery plan will help Slovenia to emerge stronger after the crisis and get onto a greener and more digital path. From its commitment to boost energy-efficiency and the seismic renovation of buildings to digital transformation of its public administration and healthcare systems, these investments will benefit Slovenia's economy and society for many years to come. There is also a strong social dimension, with reforms to national pension and healthcare and care sectors to improve social protection, along with skills-enhancement programmes and better access to affordable housing. We welcome the coherent mix of reforms and investments that should produce real change in Slovenia. Now it is time to put it into practice.\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \"Slovenia begins its presidency with the good news that the Commission has approved its recovery and resilience plan: an extensive programme of investments and reforms that will deliver real benefits for the Slovenian people for years to come. The plan will give a significant boost to public investment. It contains no fewer than 50 initiatives ranging from building renovations to the improvement of water systems and from upgraded rail infrastructure to the digitalisation of public services. I particularly welcome the commitments to strengthen the health system and boost the supply of affordable housing. Last but not least, Slovenia's competitiveness will be enhanced by measures to increase competition, modernise in public procurement, strengthen capital markets and reduce the administrative burden.\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a decision to provide 1.8 billion in grants and 705 million in loans to Slovenia under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 231 million to Slovenia in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the allocated grant amount for Slovenia. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the recovery and resilience plan, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

This authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \"We are providing more COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans. With the Moderna vaccine, the second one now authorised in the EU, we will have a further 160 million doses. And more vaccines will come. Europe has secured up to two billion doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines. We'll have more than enough safe and effective vaccines for protecting all Europeans.\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"We are all in this together and united. This is why we have negotiated the broadest vaccine portfolio in the world for all our Member States. Today we are authorising a second safe and effective vaccine from Moderna, which together with BioNTech-Pfizer, will ensure that 460 million doses will be rolled out with increasing speed in the EU, and more will come. Member States have to ensure that the pace of vaccinations follows suit. Our efforts will not stop until vaccines are available for everyone in the EU.\" Moderna submitted on 30 November 2020 an application for marketing authorisation to EMA, which had already started a rolling review of the data in November. Thanks to this rolling review, EMA has been assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine as data has become available. EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has thoroughly assessed the data and recommended by consensus that a formal conditional marketing authorisation is granted. A conditional marketing authorisation is one of EU's regulatory mechanisms for facilitating early access to medicines that fulfil an unmet medical need, including in emergency situations such as the current pandemic. On the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional market authorisation. The Moderna vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in biology, transferring instructions from DNA to the cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions produce harmless fragments of the virus, which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce a spike protein, a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences antibodies and T cells against it. Next steps* Moderna, with whom the Commission signed a contract on 25 November, will deliver the total amount of 160 million doses between the first and the fourth quarters of 2021. It will add to the 300 million doses of the vaccine distributed by BioNTech\/Pfizer, the first vaccine to have been authorised in the EU on 21 December 2020. Background A conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However, once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. Moderna submitted on 30 November 2020 an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA. EMA has already been assessing data on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality and results from laboratory studies and clinical trials in the context of a rolling review . This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks. The European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional market authorisation.

Luxembourg is one of the first countries receiving a pre-financing payment under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). It will help to kick-start the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the implementation of the investments and reforms outlined in Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan. The country is set to receive 93.4 million in total, fully consisting of grants, over the lifetime of its plan. Today's disbursement follows the recent successful implementation of the first borrowing operations under NextGenerationEU. By the end of the year, the Commission intends to raise up to a total of 80 billion in long-term funding, to be complemented by short-term EU-Bills, to fund the first planned disbursements to Member States under NextGenerationEU. Part of NextGenerationEU, the RRF will provide 723.8 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across Member States. The Luxembourg plan is part of the unprecedented EU response to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 crisis, fostering the green and digital transitions and strengthening resilience and cohesion in our societies. Supporting transformative investments and reform projects The RRF in Luxembourg finances investments and reforms that are expected to have a deeply transformative effect on Luxembourg's economy and society. Here are some of these projects: Securing the green transition: The RRF supports with 30.5 million sustainable transport in Luxembourg through a support scheme to extend the network of charging points for electric vehicles across the country. Supporting the digital transition: The RRF helps with 10 million to strengthen Luxembourg's cyber security resilience, co-financing Luxembourg's ultra-secure communication infrastructure \"LuxQCI Lab\", based on quantum technology, as part of a European project. Reinforcing economic and social resilience: setting up a \"Housing Pact 2.0\" with municipalities to reform funding of new or renovated affordable and sustainable housing. Members of the College said President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"With this very first disbursement, we are truly making NextGenerationEU real in Luxembourg. A month and a half ago, I was delighted to give the Commission's green light to Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan, one of the greenest, most environmentally-friendly we have received, with strong investments in clean energy, renewables and sustainable mobility. The EU is giving Luxembourg a boost to achieve the green transition.\" Johannes Hahn , Commissioner for Budget and Administration, said: \"After three very successful bond issuances under NextGenerationEU over the past few weeks, and the first payments for other NGEU programmes, I am glad that we have now also reached the disbursement stage for the RRF. Intense cooperation with Luxembourg and solid preparation within the Commission allowed us to pay out the funds in record time. This shows that with the resources raised, we will be able to swiftly deliver on the pre-financing needs of all Member States, thus giving them the initial boost in implementing the numerous green and digital projects included in their national plans.\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \"The first funds we disbursed today will help Luxembourg emerge stronger from the crisis. One third of the plan is dedicated to clean mobility. The digitalisation of the public administration will benefit citizens and businesses alike. The plan also invests in the improvement of workers' digital skills. The ambitious renewables project in Neischmelz will provide residents of the new housing district with clean electricity and heating.\" For More Information Questions and Answers: European Commission endorses Luxembourg's 93 million recovery and resilience plan Recovery and Resilience Facility: Questions and Answers Factsheet on Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan Council Implementing Decision on Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan Commission Staff Working document: Analysis of the recovery and resilience plan of Luxembourg Recovery and Resilience Facility Recovery and Resilience Facility Regulation Press release: third NextGenerationEU bond Press release: Commission's first funding plan EU as a borrower websiteYou are here: Home Press corner NextGenerationEU: EC disburses pre-financing to Luxembourg Available languages: Deutsch English francais Press release 3 August 2021 Brussels NextGenerationEU: European Commission disburses 12.1 million in pre-financing to Luxembourg Page contents Top Top Print friendly pdf Related media Press contact The European Commission has today disbursed 12.1 million to Luxembourg in pre-financing, equivalent to 13% of the country's financial allocation.

Supporting the digital transition: The RRF helps with 10 million to strengthen Luxembourg's cyber security resilience, co-financing Luxembourg's ultra-secure communication infrastructure \"LuxQCI Lab\", based on quantum technology, as part of a European project. Reinforcing economic and social resilience: setting up a \"Housing Pact 2.0\" with municipalities to reform funding of new or renovated affordable and sustainable housing. Members of the College said President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"With this very first disbursement, we are truly making NextGenerationEU real in Luxembourg. A month and a half ago, I was delighted to give the Commission's green light to Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan, one of the greenest, most environmentally-friendly we have received, with strong investments in clean energy, renewables and sustainable mobility. The EU is giving Luxembourg a boost to achieve the green transition.\" Johannes Hahn , Commissioner for Budget and Administration, said: \"After three very successful bond issuances under NextGenerationEU over the past few weeks, and the first payments for other NGEU programmes, I am glad that we have now also reached the disbursement stage for the RRF. Intense cooperation with Luxembourg and solid preparation within the Commission allowed us to pay out the funds in record time. This shows that with the resources raised, we will be able to swiftly deliver on the pre-financing needs of all Member States, thus giving them the initial boost in implementing the numerous green and digital projects included in their national plans.\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \"The first funds we disbursed today will help Luxembourg emerge stronger from the crisis. One third of the plan is dedicated to clean mobility. The digitalisation of the public administration will benefit citizens and businesses alike. The plan also invests in the improvement of workers' digital skills. The ambitious renewables project in Neischmelz will provide residents of the new housing district with clean electricity and heating.\" For More Information Questions and Answers: European Commission endorses Luxembourg's 93 million recovery and resilience plan Recovery and Resilience Facility: Questions and Answers Factsheet on Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan Council Implementing Decision on Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan Commission Staff Working document: Analysis of the recovery and resilience plan of Luxembourg Recovery and Resilience Facility Recovery and Resilience Facility Regulation Press release: third NextGenerationEU bond Press release: Commission's first funding plan EU as a borrower website Print friendly pdf NextGenerationEU: EC disburses pre-financing to Luxembourg English (48.592 kB - PDF) Download (48.592 kB - PDF) Related media Previous Next Press contact Arianna PODESTA Phone +32 2 298 70 24 Mail Flora MATTHAES Phone +32 2 298 39 51 Mail IP\/21\/4024 Share this page: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn E-mail European Commission European Commission website Follow the European Commission Facebook Twitter Other social media European Union EU institutions European Union About the Commission's new web presence Language policy Resources for partners Cookies Privacy policy Legal notice Contact+32 2 298 70 24 +32 2 298 39 51","28ea89b6ba8ee9366abfbaf5dc60516b8e85bce605c3ef875ee2dc7ac5cf54e2":"The European Commission has adopted a Temporary Framework to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. Together with many other support measures that can be used by Member States under the existing State aid rules, the Temporary Framework enables Member States to ensure that sufficient liquidity remains available to businesses of all types and to preserve the continuity of economic activity during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager , in charge of competition policy, said: \" The economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is severe. We need to act fast to manage the impact as much as we can. And we need to act in a coordinated manner. This new Temporary Framework enables Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy at this difficult time .\" The State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, based on Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, recognises that the entire EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. To remedy that, the Temporary Framework provides for five types of aid: (i) Direct grants, selective tax advantages and advance payments : Member States will be able to set up schemes to grant up to 800,000 to a company to address its urgent liquidity needs. (ii) State guarantees for loans taken by companies from banks : Member States will be able to provide State guarantees to ensure banks keep providing loans to the customers who need them. (iii) Subsidised public loans to companies : Member States will be able to grant loans with favourable interest rates to companies. These loans can help businesses cover immediate working capital and investment needs. (iv) Safeguards for banks that channel State aid to the real economy : Some Member States plan to build on banks' existing lending capacities, and use them as a channel for support to businesses in particular to small and medium-sized companies. The Framework makes clear that such aid is considered as direct aid to the banks' customers, not to the banks themselves, and gives guidance on how to ensure minimal distortion of competition between banks. (v) Short-term export credit insurance : The Framework introduces additional flexibility on how to demonstrate that certain countries are not-marketable risks, thereby enabling short-term export credit insurance to be provided by the State where needed. Given the limited size of the EU budget, the main response will come from Member States' national budgets. The Temporary Framework will help target support to the economy, while limiting negative consequences to the level playing field in the Single Market. The Temporary Framework therefore includes a number of safeguards. For example, It links the subsidised loans or guarantees to businesses to the scale of their economic activity, by reference to their wage bill, turnover, or liquidity needs, and to the use of the public support for working or investment capital. The aid should therefore help businesses to weather the downturn and to prepare a sustainable recovery. The Temporary Framework complements the many other possibilities already available to Member States to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, in line with EU State aid rules. On 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak setting out these possibilities. For example, Member States can make generally applicable changes in favour of businesses (e.g. deferring taxes, or subsidising short-time work across all sectors), which fall outside State Aid rules. They can also grant compensation to companies for damage suffered due to and directly caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. This can be useful to support particularly impacted sectors, such as transport, tourism, hospitality and retail. The Framework will be in place until the end of December 2020. With a view to ensuring legal certainty, the Commission will assess before that date if it needs to be extended. Background State aid rules enable Member States to take swift and effective action to support citizens and companies, in particular SMEs, facing economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The Temporary Framework adopted today complements the ample possibilities for Member States to design measures in line with existing EU State aid rules, as set out in the Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak of 13 March 2020. In particular, they can adopt measures that fall outside the scope of State aid control, such as national funds granted to health services or other public services to tackle the Covid-19. Member States can also immediately act through public support measures that are available to all companies such as wage subsidies, suspension of payments of corporate and value added taxes or social contributions. In addition, Member States can grant financial support directly to consumers, for example for cancelled services or tickets that are not reimbursed by the operators concerned. In addition, EU State aid rules enable Member States to help companies cope with liquidity shortages and needing urgent rescue aid. Article 107(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enables Member States to compensate companies for the damage directly caused by exceptional occurrences, such as those caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, including measures in sectors such as aviation and tourism. The Commission had adopted a Temporary Framework in 2008 , in response to the global financial crisis.

The new contract also provides for the possibility to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries. Today's contract with Moderna builds upon the broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the already signed contracts with BioNTech\/Pfizer , AstraZeneca , Sanofi-GSK , Janssen Pharmaceutica NV , Curevac and Moderna. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe has access to 2.6 billion doses, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective. The Commission has granted conditional marketing authorisation for the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer on 21 December 2020, Moderna on 6 January 2021 and AstraZeneca on 29 January 2021. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \" Today, we are securing 300 million additional doses of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Moderna, which is already used for vaccination in the European Union. This brings us closer to our major objective: ensure that all Europeans have access to safe and effective vaccines as quickly as possible. With a portfolio of up to 2.6 billion doses, we will be able to provide vaccines not just to our citizens, but to our neighbours and partners as well. \" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"With this new contract with Moderna, we are adding another 300 million doses of an authorised safe and effective vaccine. It marks another step towards our objective of providing swift access to safe and effective vaccinations to citizens in Europe and beyond over the course of this year. The contract is important not only for the short term needs of the EU, but also for our future work to limit the rapid spread of new variants.\" The Moderna vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in biology, transferring instructions from DNA to the cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions produce harmless fragments of the virus, which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce a spike protein, a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences antibodies and T cells against it. The Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the companies' experience in vaccine development and their production capacity to supply the whole of the EU, as well as their capacity to potentially develop a vaccine against coronavirus variants. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements . Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen. Once vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission has adopted further actions to reinforce preparedness and response measures across the EU, a strategy on staying safe from COVID-19 during winter offering further support to Member States in the deployment of vaccines and a new Communication on a united front the beat COVID-19. The Commission has also adopted a plan to prepare Europe for the increased threat of variants and the possibility of them being resistant to existing vaccines. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with 400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.

This is an important step towards the EU disbursing 13.9 billion in grants and 2.7 billion in loans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) over the period 2021-2026. This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Portugal to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF - at the heart of NextGenerationEU - will provide up to 672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Portuguese plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market. The Commission assessed Portugal's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms contained in Portugal's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience. Securing Portugal's green and digital transition The Commission's assessment finds that Portugal's plan devotes 38% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes investments to finance a large-scale renovation programme to increase the energy efficiency of buildings or the promotion of energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources in industrial processes. The Commission finds that the Portugal's plan devotes 22% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. This includes efforts to digitalise the public administration and to modernise the computer systems of the National Health Service, as well as technological laboratories in secondary schools and professional training centres. Reinforcing Portugal's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that Portugal's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Portugal by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures in the areas of accessibility and resilience of social services and the health system, labour market, education and skills, R&D and innovation, climate and digital transition, business environment, quality and sustainability of public finances and efficiency of the justice system. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Portugal's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects Portugal's plan proposes projects in six European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects, which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the green and digital transition. For instance, Portugal has proposed to provide 610 million to renovate public and private buildings to improve their energy performance. This will result in Portugal reducing its energy bill, greenhouse gas emissions and energy dependence, as well as reducing energy poverty. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The control systems put in place by Portugal are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said: President Ursula von der Leyen said: \" Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Portugal's 16.6 billion recovery and resilience plan, the first to be endorsed by the Commission. The plan was designed in Portugal. The reforms and investments contained in this plan will allow Portugal to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for the future. In short, it will help build a better future for the Portuguese people. We will stand by Portugal every step of the way. Your success will be our success. A European success .\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" Portugal was the first country to present its plan and today we are happy to confirm our positive assessment. This is a solid plan that will put Portugal on a path of higher growth, create new jobs for the future as well as stronger and sustainable social protection. The proposed measures cover a broad spectrum of reforms and investments to equip Portugal for the green and digital transition, ranging from digitalising the public administration, improving workers' skills, creating energy-efficient housing, to better protecting the country's vast forests. I also welcome the plan's strong social focus, including measures to improve childcare and strengthen the health care system. This plan will allow Portugal to grow back stronger. We will now work closely with Portugal on its full implementation .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" The reforms and investments included in the Portuguese plan will enhance the country's resilience and give a strong boost to its climate transition and digital transformation efforts. With its measures to support social services, the national health service and education and training, the plan also has a very strong social dimension. This is our first completed assessment of a national recovery and resilience plan, marking a key milestone in the implementation of NextGenerationEU. And it is fitting that the first plan to be assessed positively is Portugal's: not only because it was the first to be submitted, but also because the Portuguese Presidency played such a key role in putting in place the legal and financial framework for this unprecedented common European endeavour .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide 13.9 billion in grants and 2.7 billion in loans to Portugal under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 2.2 billion to Portugal in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Portugal. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

It includes measures in the areas of accessibility and resilience of social services and the health system, labour market, education and skills, R&D and innovation, climate and digital transition, business environment, quality and sustainability of public finances and efficiency of the justice system. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Portugal's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects Portugal's plan proposes projects in six European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects, which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the green and digital transition. For instance, Portugal has proposed to provide 610 million to renovate public and private buildings to improve their energy performance. This will result in Portugal reducing its energy bill, greenhouse gas emissions and energy dependence, as well as reducing energy poverty. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The control systems put in place by Portugal are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said: President Ursula von der Leyen said: \" Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Portugal's 16.6 billion recovery and resilience plan, the first to be endorsed by the Commission. The plan was designed in Portugal. The reforms and investments contained in this plan will allow Portugal to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for the future. In short, it will help build a better future for the Portuguese people. We will stand by Portugal every step of the way. Your success will be our success. A European success .\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" Portugal was the first country to present its plan and today we are happy to confirm our positive assessment. This is a solid plan that will put Portugal on a path of higher growth, create new jobs for the future as well as stronger and sustainable social protection. The proposed measures cover a broad spectrum of reforms and investments to equip Portugal for the green and digital transition, ranging from digitalising the public administration, improving workers' skills, creating energy-efficient housing, to better protecting the country's vast forests. I also welcome the plan's strong social focus, including measures to improve childcare and strengthen the health care system. This plan will allow Portugal to grow back stronger. We will now work closely with Portugal on its full implementation .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" The reforms and investments included in the Portuguese plan will enhance the country's resilience and give a strong boost to its climate transition and digital transformation efforts. With its measures to support social services, the national health service and education and training, the plan also has a very strong social dimension. This is our first completed assessment of a national recovery and resilience plan, marking a key milestone in the implementation of NextGenerationEU. And it is fitting that the first plan to be assessed positively is Portugal's: not only because it was the first to be submitted, but also because the Portuguese Presidency played such a key role in putting in place the legal and financial framework for this unprecedented common European endeavour .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide 13.9 billion in grants and 2.7 billion in loans to Portugal under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 2.2 billion to Portugal in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Portugal. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

It will provide critical and targeted support in key areas such as health, water, sanitation and hygiene. The newly adopted package brings the total assistance mobilised through the EU Trust Fund to over 2.2 billion since 2015, doubling the target originally set. High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\/Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell, said: \"Jordan and Lebanon are showing huge resilience and solidarity in hosting Syrian refugees. It is our duty to continue supporting them, especially in the current coronavirus pandemic situation. The EU will host the fourth Brussels Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region on 30 June in direct support of the UN efforts for a comprehensive political solution to the Syrian conflict and to mobilise necessary financial support for Syria and neighbouring countries. The Conference will also continue to provide a unique platform for dialogue with civil society organisations from the region.\" Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi , commented: \" Our continued commitment to support Syrian refugees and partner countries like Jordan and Lebanon hosting them remains unwavering. We are responding today to the urgent needs in fighting the COVID-19 crisis with a substantial and targeted assistance package. Despite the European Union's continued strong solidarity with partner countries, the needs of the Syrian refugees continue to be important and cannot be neglected. In this regard, the 2020 Brussels IV Conference will provide an opportunity for the international community to mobilise the necessary financial assistance.\" Jordan and Lebanon are the countries hosting the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. Today's additional support package focuses on health and water, sanitation and hygiene services: Jordan - 20.1 million in total: 11 million to contribute to the coronavirus national response plan, in particular for procurement of medical equipment 4 million to support essential water and sanitation services and hygiene kits in refugee camps and for vulnerable host communities 3.6 million to strengthen ongoing health and social protection to Palestine Refugees from Syria and hosting communities 1.5 million to support further equipping three emergency departments in hospitals to face the pandemic Lebanon - 34.6 million in total: 10 million to ensure safe municipal water distribution for Syrian refugees and host population 10 million to cover the medical management of mild cases in light of the pandemic 6 million to provide critical hygiene kits, as well as infection prevention and control kits in informal settlements and for vulnerable Lebanese 5 million to the Lebanese Red Cross as the front line responder to the coronavirus 3.6 million to strengthen ongoing health and social protection support for Palestine Refugees from Syria and hosting communities The assistance package was adopted by the Operational Board of the Trust Fund, which brings together the European Commission, the EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. Observers of the Operational Board include Members of the European Parliament, representatives from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the World Bank, and the Syria Recovery Trust Fund. The Trust Fund is also reorienting ongoing interventions in key sectors in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Since the beginning of the outbreak and thanks to the Trust Fund's flexibility, the EU and contributing countries have been able to provide personal protective equipment, hygiene kits, infection prevention trainings, health education and awareness campaigns, and essential protection services to women facing gender based violence. Background Since its establishment in December 2014, a significant share of the EU's support to help Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis . The Trust Fund reinforces an integrated EU response to the crisis and primarily addresses longer-term resilience and needs to enhance the self-reliance of Syrian refugees. At the same time, it contributes to ease the pressure on host communities and the administrations in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The Trust Fund has also underpinned the EU Compacts agreed with Jordan and Lebanon to better assist them in coping with the protracted refugee crisis. With the newly adopted package, it has mobilised over 900 million for Lebanon, over 500 million for both Jordan and Turkey and more than 160 million for Iraq. Overall, more than 2.2 billion have been mobilised from the EU budget and contributions from 21 EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. The Trust Fund's programmes support basic education and child protection services for refugees, training and higher education, better access to healthcare, improved access to water and wastewater infrastructure, support to resilience, women empowerment and fighting gender based violence, as well as economic opportunities and social stability. The Fund can also support internally displaced persons in Iraq and actions in the Western Balkans.

The envisaged contract with Valneva would provide for the possibility for all EU Member States to purchase together 30 million doses, and they could further purchase up to 30 million more doses. Today's finalisation of exploratory talks with Valneva come in addition to an already secured broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the contracts already signed with AstraZeneca , Sanofi-GSK , Janssen Pharmaceutica NV , BioNtech-Pfize r, CureVac , and Moderna and exploratory talks concluded with Novavax . This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective, as is already the case for BioNTech\/Pfizer and Moderna , recently authorised in the EU. Member States are able to donate vaccines to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \"The continuing COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and around the globe makes it more important than ever that all Member States have access to the broadest possible portfolio of vaccines to help protect people in Europe and beyond. Today's step toward reaching an agreement with Valneva further complements the EU's vaccines portfolio and demonstrates the Commission's commitment to find a lasting solution to the pandemic.\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"With this eighth vaccine, we are adding to our already broad and diversified range of vaccines in our portfolio. By doing this, we can maximise our chances of making sure that all citizens can have access to safe and effective of vaccinations by the end of 2021. All Member States have now started their vaccination campaigns and will start receiving an increasing number of doses in order to cover all their needs during this year .\" Valneva is a European biotechnology company developing an inactivated virus vaccine. This is a traditional vaccine technology, used for 60-70 years, with established methods and a high level of safety. Most of the influenza vaccines and many childhood vaccines use this technology. This is currently the only inactivated vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe. The Commission, with the support of EU Member States, has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply all EU Member States. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen. Once vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies and has adopted further actions to reinforce preparedness and response measures across the EU and a strategy on staying safe from COVID-19 during winter offering further support to Member States in the deployment of vaccines. The Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with 400 million in guarantees an additional 100 million in grant funding to support COVAX Facility and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response. This 500 million from the EU budget combined with contributions from EU Member States and the EIB will be a key contribution for the COVAX Facility to ensure over one billion vaccine doses will be made available to people in low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2021.

After a successful pilot phase , the system goes live today with the first wave of national apps now linked through this service: Germany's Corona-Warn-App, Ireland's COVID tracker, and Italy's immuni. Together, these apps have been downloaded by around 30 million people, which corresponds to two-thirds of all app downloads in the EU. Thierry Breton , Commissioner for Single Market, said: \"Many Member States have launched voluntary contact tracing and warning apps, and the Commission has supported them in make these apps safely interact with each other. Free movement is an integral part of the Single Market the gateway is facilitating this while helping save lives.\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, added : \"Coronavirus tracing and warning apps can effectively complement other measures like increased testing and manual contact tracing. With cases on the rise again, they can play an important role to help us break the transmission chains. When working across borders these apps are even more powerful tools. Our gateway system going live today is an important step in our work, and I would call on citizens to make use of such apps, to help protecting each other.\" Jens Spahn , Germany's Federal Minister of Health, said: \"Everywhere in Europe, infections are on the rise again. Right now, national warning apps are making a real difference. Because every infection chain that, thanks to an app, is broken more quickly helps to contain the pandemic. With the new gateway service, we are connecting apps across Europe. Like this, contacts can also be warned during or following a trip abroad.\" In the fight against coronavirus, most Member States have decided to launch a contact tracing and warning app. In total, 20 apps which are based on decentralised systems can be interoperable through the gateway service. They can be linked to the gateway after following a protocol that foresees several tests and checks, and an update has to be issued for each app. The second group of apps will be linked next week. Then, Czechia's eRouska, Denmark's smitte stop, Latvia's Apturi COVID and Spain's Radar Covid are expected to join, while further apps will be linked to the system in November. The overview of participating Member States is available on a dedicated webpage . The gateway ensures that apps work seamlessly cross-borders. Thus, users will only need to install one app and when they travel to another participating European country they will still benefit from contact tracing and receiving alerts, be it in their home country or abroad. The gateway server keeps the amount of data exchanged to a minimum. It will efficiently receive and pass on arbitrary identifiers between national apps. No other information than arbitrary keys, generated by the apps, will be handled by the gateway: the information is pseudonymised, encrypted, kept to the minimium, and only stored as long as necessary to trace back infections. It does not allow the identification of individual persons, nor to track location or movement of devices. The setup of the gateway follows the agreement by Member States on technical specifications to ensure a safe exchange of information between the backend servers of national contact tracing and warning apps based on a decentralised architecture. The system was developed and set up in less than two months by T-Systems and SAP, and will be operated from the Commission's data centre in Luxembourg. Background Contact tracing apps, if fully compliant with EU rules and well-coordinated, can play a key role in all phases of crisis management. They can complement existing manual contact tracing and help interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Thereby, they can contribute to saving lives. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Member States, backed by the Commission, have been assessing the effectiveness, security, privacy, and data protection aspects of digital solutions to address the crisis. They have developed an EU toolbox for contact tracing and warning apps, which was accompanied by guidance on data protection . This was part of a common coordinated approach to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures, as set out in a Commission Recommendation . To ensure tracing and warning apps work cross-border, Member States, with the support of the Commission agreed on interoperability guidelines in May, on a set of technical specifications in June, and the Commission adopted an Implementing Decision to provide a legal basis for the gateway service. In September, the system was tested in a pilot phase .

Thus, users will only need to install one app and when they travel to another participating European country they will still benefit from contact tracing and receiving alerts, be it in their home country or abroad. The gateway server keeps the amount of data exchanged to a minimum. It will efficiently receive and pass on arbitrary identifiers between national apps. No other information than arbitrary keys, generated by the apps, will be handled by the gateway: the information is pseudonymised, encrypted, kept to the minimium, and only stored as long as necessary to trace back infections. It does not allow the identification of individual persons, nor to track location or movement of devices. The setup of the gateway follows the agreement by Member States on technical specifications to ensure a safe exchange of information between the backend servers of national contact tracing and warning apps based on a decentralised architecture. The system was developed and set up in less than two months by T-Systems and SAP, and will be operated from the Commission's data centre in Luxembourg. Background Contact tracing apps, if fully compliant with EU rules and well-coordinated, can play a key role in all phases of crisis management. They can complement existing manual contact tracing and help interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Thereby, they can contribute to saving lives. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Member States, backed by the Commission, have been assessing the effectiveness, security, privacy, and data protection aspects of digital solutions to address the crisis. They have developed an EU toolbox for contact tracing and warning apps, which was accompanied by guidance on data protection . This was part of a common coordinated approach to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures, as set out in a Commission Recommendation . To ensure tracing and warning apps work cross-border, Member States, with the support of the Commission agreed on interoperability guidelines in May, on a set of technical specifications in June, and the Commission adopted an Implementing Decision to provide a legal basis for the gateway service. In September, the system was tested in a pilot phase .

And I want to thank the medical staff who is treating them and doing an outstanding job not only in Europe but all over the world. As you know, the Coronavirus has brought governments and health systems throughout Europe to work at all different levels to contain this virus. And so does the Commission, with the support from our agency, the ECDC, and in very close cooperation with the WHO. You have witnessed that from the very beginning of the outbreak of the Coronavirus, the European Union has acted. We have for example activated our alert system immediately. We have an ongoing risk assessment that is being carried out in close coordination with all the Member States. I think very important is our European Health Security Committee that is coordinating all these different national measures, so that we have a very comprehensive approach to contain the virus. We have informed you on a regular basis over the last weeks about the support that the Commission provides to the national authorities, in very close cooperation with the agencies. ECDC has announced today that the risk level has risen to moderate to high for people in the European Union. In other words, the virus continues to spread. We all know that there are many, many different actions that are needed to address the Coronavirus. They are very multifaceted, they are very manifold. And since eight weeks, we are working intensively on these different work strands. The Commission has been addressing all these work strands. We have a situation that is very complex and it requires on the one side, very swift action and on the other side, a strong coordination at all the levels and all the different sectors not only on the European level but of course on the national level. And then, a very comprehensive and coherent approach towards the topic from all 27 Member States and the European Union. This is why today we are launching the corona response team. This corona response team brings together all the different strands of action that have been in place since many, many weeks you have witnessed their outstanding work , but also brings in place in the corona response team the new work streams, the emerging work streams. The corona response team has basically three main pillars. The first pillar is the medical field. It includes topics from prevention and procurement. There are relief measures, information and foresight. It is always in close cooperation with ECDC and our European Medicines Agency. The second big and important column is the pillar that covers mobility, from transport to travel advice and also to the Schengen-related questions. The third pillar covers the economy. It is looking in-depth at various business sectors such as tourism or transport, trade, but of course, it is also looking at the value chains and at the broader macro-economic picture we have. To bundle this, we also have in parallel launched today a website on the corona response team where all the information we have gathered over all the weeks and that comes on a daily basis is collected and bundled so that there is a direct access to the very complex, wide-reaching work the corona response team is doing. There are other topics that are presented on the website and worked on in the corona response team, as for example news, press releases, calendars, social media, statistics, which are important on a daily basis from all the different questions that occur in this scenario, [as well as] the general information, like access to studies or links to others, the role and responsibilities, again, if you have different questions that have to be addressed. Allow me now to introduce the five Commissioners, who will be working together on all these different topics. It is Janez Lenarcic, who is in charge of crisis management. It is Stella Kyriakides, who is charge of all the health issues. It is Ylva Johansson, who in charge of border-related issues. It is Adina Valean, who is in charge of mobility. And Paolo Gentiloni, who is dealing with the macroeconomic aspects. And I would like to invite the different Commissioners now to present their aspects for the day, because this is a situation, where on a daily basis we have actual topics and news we want to work on.You are here: Home Press corner President von der Leyen on the EU's response to COVID-19 Available languages: English Statement 2 March 2020 Brussels Remarks by President von der Leyen at the joint press conference with Commissioners Lenarcic, Kyriakides, Johansson, Valean and Gentiloni at the ERCC ECHO on the EU's response to COVID-19 Page contents Top Top Print friendly pdf Related media Good afternoon to all of you, First of all, I want to express my full sympathy for those who are suffering from the Coronavirus.

This funding is part of a wide range of research and innovation actions taken to fight the coronavirus and contributes to the Commission's overall action to prevent, mitigate and respond to the impact of the virus and its variants, in line with the new European bio-defence preparedness plan HERA Incubator . The 11 short-listed projects involve 312 research teams from 40 countries, including 38 participants from 23 countries outside of the EU. Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel , said: \"The European Union has been taking strong action to fight the coronavirus crisis. Today we are stepping up our research efforts to meet the challenges and threats that coronavirus variants present. By supporting these new research projects and reinforcing and opening relevant research infrastructures, we continue to fight this pandemic as well as prepare for future threats.\" Most of the projects will support clinical trials for new treatments and vaccines, as well as the development of large scale, coronavirus cohorts and networks beyond Europe's borders, forging links with European initiatives . Other projects will reinforce and widen access to the research infrastructures providing services, or needed to share data, expertise, and research resources among researchers, to enable research addressing coronavirus and its variants. These infrastructures include those already active such as the European COVID-19 Data Platform and the relevant European Life Science Research Infrastructures . The successful consortia will collaborate with other relevant initiatives and projects at national, regional, and international level to maximise synergies and complementarity and avoid duplication of the research efforts. They will contribute to building the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), which will enable the EU to anticipate and better tackle future pandemics. Background In February, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the start of a European bio-defence preparedness plan HERA Incubator aimed at preparing Europe for an increased threat of coronavirus variants. The HERA Incubator will bring together science, industry and public authorities, and leverage all available resources to enable Europe to respond to this challenge. In April, the Commission announced the new calls for urgent research into coronavirus variants with an initial budget of 123 million mobilised as part of the first emergency funding under Horizon Europe . Although funding for these 11 projects is conditional on a final Commission decision, and the signature of the Horizon Europe Grant Agreements in the coming months, the research teams can already start their work. The Commission has been at the forefront of supporting research and innovation and coordinating European and global research efforts, including preparedness for pandemics. It pledged 1.4 billion to the Coronavirus Global Response , of which 1 billion comes from Horizon 2020 , the previous EU research and innovation programme (2014-2020).

Those cities have been severely hit, impeding them to implement their European Capital of Culture initiatives. The Commission also proposes to postpone the year in which Novi Sad (Serbia) is due to host a European Capital of Culture from 2021 to 2022 and the year in which Timisoara (Romania) and Elefsina (Greece) will hold the title from 2021 to 2023. Margaritis Schinas , Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, said: \" Rijeka and Galway deserve a fair chance to bounce back and showcase their resilience and creativity. Opening hearts and minds, welcoming diverse audiences and artists has always been the lifeblood of the European Capitals of Culture. And it shall remain so. I am confident that for Novi Sad, Timisoara and Elefsina, additional time will allow weathering the current downturn in the cultural and tourism sectors and mobilising relevant investment, including through solidarity at European level .\" Mariya Gabriel , Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \" Culture has been badly hit by the pandemic and European Capitals of Culture are no exception. Despite the energy, enthusiasm and professionalism of their teams and partners, Rijeka and Galway were unable to roll out their 2020 European Capital of Culture programmes as planned.

The measure was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework . The recapitalisation measure is part of a larger recapitalisation package, which also foresees a significant participation of private investors, including the conversion of outstanding privately-held debt instruments into equity. SAS is a major network airline operating in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. In the second quarter of 2020, SAS suffered substantial losses due to the coronavirus outbreak and the travel restrictions that Denmark, Sweden and other countries had to impose to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The Commission found that measure notified by Denmark and Sweden is in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission concluded that the recapitalisation measure will contribute to manage the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in Denmark and Sweden: the measure aims at restoring the balance sheet position and liquidity of SAS in the exceptional situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic, while maintaining the necessary safeguards to limit competition distortions. It is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the two Member States, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the general principles as set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measure under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager , in charge of competition policy, said: \"SAS plays a key role for the connectivity and economy of Scandinavian countries. As many other companies active in the aviation sector, SAS has been severely hit by the current crisis. With this measure, Denmark and Sweden will contribute up to 1 billion to SAS's recapitalisation and help the airline weather the current crisis. At the same time, the Member States will be sufficiently remunerated for the risk taxpayers assume, and the support will come with strings attached to limit distortions of competition. I welcome the participation by private investors to the plan, as it limits the need for State aid, while contributing to the recovery of companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\" A full press release is available online.

The Commission found that the transaction, as originally notified, would have raised competition concerns in the EEA market for account-to-account core infrastructure services (\"A2A CIS\") in relation to managed solutions. The Commission was concerned that the proposed acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices and less choice in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services. To address the Commission's concerns, Mastercard and Nets offered to transfer to a suitable purchaser a global license to distribute, supply, sell, develop, modify, upgrade or otherwise use Nets' Realtime 24\/7 technology, with which the target business currently competes in A2A CIS tenders. The transfer also includes all necessary personnel and services, such as consultancy services and transitional support services, including access to all necessary components and capabilities to provide managed services based on Nets' Realtime 24\/7 technology. The proposed commitments fully address the Commission's competition concerns, as they will increase competition in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services in the EEA, by allowing a new player to effectively and credibly compete in this space. The Commission therefore concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, no longer raises competition concerns in the EEA. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager , responsible for competition policy, said: \" Companies and citizens seek competitive and innovative payment solutions for their banking transactions. This merger, as originally notified, would have significantly reduced competition in the market for account-to-account core infrastructure services and undermined the development of new real-time payment solutions, which are becoming increasingly important. Today's decision ensures that effective competition is preserved and facilitates the emergence of a new provider of real-time payment infrastructure services in the European Economic Area .\" A full press release is available online.

Those cities have been severely hit, impeding them to implement their European Capital of Culture initiatives. The Commission also proposes to postpone the year in which Novi Sad (Serbia) is due to host a European Capital of Culture from 2021 to 2022 and the year in which Timisoara (Romania) and Elefsina (Greece) will hold the title from 2021 to 2023. Margaritis Schinas , Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, said: \" Rijeka and Galway deserve a fair chance to bounce back and showcase their resilience and creativity. Opening hearts and minds, welcoming diverse audiences and artists has always been the lifeblood of the European Capitals of Culture. And it shall remain so. I am confident that for Novi Sad, Timisoara and Elefsina, additional time will allow weathering the current downturn in the cultural and tourism sectors and mobilising relevant investment, including through solidarity at European level .\" Mariya Gabriel , Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \" Culture has been badly hit by the pandemic and European Capitals of Culture are no exception. Despite the energy, enthusiasm and professionalism of their teams and partners, Rijeka and Galway were unable to roll out their 2020 European Capital of Culture programmes as planned. I hope that both cities will make the most of the possibility offered to them to prolong their special year. I am sure that Timisoara, Elefsina and Novi Sad, the European Capitals of Culture next in line, will benefit from extra time to prepare their ambitious programmes .\" The Commission's proposal now passes to the European Parliament and the Council for consideration and final adoption.

The EIF's guarantee to RBBH is provided under the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility, as part of its coronavirus economic support package. This tool helps provide working capital to European SMEs for the recovery. Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal market, said: \"Small and medium-sized enterprises are heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic. We reacted very quickly to provide them with immediate liquidity. Thanks to this rapid action, the coronavirus measure under the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility is already available in more than 20 European countries. With today's agreement SMEs in Bosnia and Herzegovina will benefit from the EU support for recovery as well.\" For more information, see this press release .

The measure was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework . The recapitalisation measure is part of a larger recapitalisation package, which also foresees a significant participation of private investors, including the conversion of outstanding privately-held debt instruments into equity. SAS is a major network airline operating in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. In the second quarter of 2020, SAS suffered substantial losses due to the coronavirus outbreak and the travel restrictions that Denmark, Sweden and other countries had to impose to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The Commission found that measure notified by Denmark and Sweden is in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission concluded that the recapitalisation measure will contribute to manage the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in Denmark and Sweden: the measure aims at restoring the balance sheet position and liquidity of SAS in the exceptional situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic, while maintaining the necessary safeguards to limit competition distortions. It is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the two Member States, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the general principles as set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measure under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager , in charge of competition policy, said: \"SAS plays a key role for the connectivity and economy of Scandinavian countries. As many other companies active in the aviation sector, SAS has been severely hit by the current crisis. With this measure, Denmark and Sweden will contribute up to 1 billion to SAS's recapitalisation and help the airline weather the current crisis. At the same time, the Member States will be sufficiently remunerated for the risk taxpayers assume, and the support will come with strings attached to limit distortions of competition. I welcome the participation by private investors to the plan, as it limits the need for State aid, while contributing to the recovery of companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\" A full press release is available online.

The Commission found that the transaction, as originally notified, would have raised competition concerns in the EEA market for account-to-account core infrastructure services (\"A2A CIS\") in relation to managed solutions. The Commission was concerned that the proposed acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices and less choice in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services. To address the Commission's concerns, Mastercard and Nets offered to transfer to a suitable purchaser a global license to distribute, supply, sell, develop, modify, upgrade or otherwise use Nets' Realtime 24\/7 technology, with which the target business currently competes in A2A CIS tenders. The transfer also includes all necessary personnel and services, such as consultancy services and transitional support services, including access to all necessary components and capabilities to provide managed services based on Nets' Realtime 24\/7 technology. The proposed commitments fully address the Commission's competition concerns, as they will increase competition in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services in the EEA, by allowing a new player to effectively and credibly compete in this space. The Commission therefore concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, no longer raises competition concerns in the EEA. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager , responsible for competition policy, said: \" Companies and citizens seek competitive and innovative payment solutions for their banking transactions. This merger, as originally notified, would have significantly reduced competition in the market for account-to-account core infrastructure services and undermined the development of new real-time payment solutions, which are becoming increasingly important. Today's decision ensures that effective competition is preserved and facilitates the emergence of a new provider of real-time payment infrastructure services in the European Economic Area .\" A full press release is available online.

Kernaman est active dans le secteur de l'electricite et detient deux unites de turbines a gaz a cycle combine, un centre d'optimisation et de repartition, ainsi que les actifs et passifs associes. TOTAL S.A. est active dans tous les secteurs de l'industrie petroliere et gaziere, ainsi que dans les secteurs des energies renouvelables, de la production d'electricite et de la neutralite carbone. La Commission a conclu que la concentration envisagee ne souleverait pas de probleme de concurrence, car les chevauchements entre les activites des entreprises sont tres limites. La transaction a ete examinee dans le cadre de la procedure simplifiee de controle des concentrations.

KG and Gehe Immobilien Verwaltungs-GmbH (\"Gehe\") by Alliance Healthcare Deutschland AG, all of Germany. Both Gehe and Alliance Healthcare are mainly active in pharmaceutical wholesaling in Germany and supply retail pharmacies in Germany. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns, either at national level or at regional level in the catchment areas around distribution warehouses across Germany. This is because there will be a sufficient number of credible competitors available at national level and in each catchment area and the companies will face additional competitive pressure from direct sales of manufacturers after the transaction. The transaction was examined under the normal merger review procedure. More information is available on the Commission's competition website, in the public case register under the case number M.9711 .

Depuis, la Journee mondiale de l'aide humanitaire est une occasion de commemorer les hommes et les femmes qui risquent d'etre attaques, blesses ou tues dans le cadre de leur travail humanitaire. Cette annee, la pandemie de coronavirus a considerablement accru les besoins en matiere d'aide humanitaire. En outre, les civils dans les zones de conflit sont regulierement tues ou blesses lors d'attaques ciblees ou aveugles.

The payments made today are going to 41 national and regional programmes in 16 Member States (France, Greece, Czechia, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Estonia Austria, Denmark, Finland, Bulgaria, Sweden, Portugal and Croatia) from the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe initiative (REACT-EU) , the initiative which helps Member States finance crisis response and recovery measures following the coronavirus pandemic. The funds under the REACT-EU constitute additional resources for existing Cohesion policy programmes. The measures under REACT-EU will bridge the gap between the emergency response and long-term investments by strengthening the resilience of healthcare systems, preserving and creating employment, in particular for young people, supporting the most vulnerable in our society, and providing working capital and investment support for small and medium-sized enterprises. REACT-EU finances targeted measures for the green and digital transitions to quickly address the negative consequences of the outbreak, for example, through investments in energy efficiency, urban greening and digitalisation. The disbursement follows the successful implementation of the first borrowing operation under NextGenerationEU. The 20 billion 10-year bond was the largest-ever institutional bond issuance in Europe and the largest amount the EU has raised in a single transaction. By the end of this year, the Commission intends to raise some 80 billion in long-term funding, to be complemented by short-term EU-Bills. Members of the College said: Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira , said: \" I am glad that Cohesion policy remains at the forefront of crisis response and recovery. REACT-EU was the first NextGenerationEU Instrument to be finalised, its programmes were the first ones to be adopted and it is now the first channelling support to our economy, businesses and workers. REACT-EU brings much needed additional investment firepower to existing Cohesion policy programmes to further stimulate a robust, fair and cohesive recovery.\" Commissioner for Budget and Administration, Johannes Hahn , added: \"I am very happy that we succeeded to kick-start the NextGenerationEU issuances as scheduled. As of today money under NextGenerationEU is already used via REACT-EU to help our regions and cities recover from the pandemic and build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe.\" Reaching the real economy The additional funds will be primarily channelled through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF), including the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI). Some of the new resources will also be used to top-up the European Fund for Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) for the 2014-2020 period. To provide the maximum possible assistance to the Member States, the conditions for the use of these additional resources have been simplified: National co-financing is not obligatory - that means that the EU can cover 100% of the cost if Member States deem it necessary. Immediate liquidity in the form of an 11% pre-financing will help to ensure a quick roll-out of this support, preventing any bottlenecks. There is no ex-ante conditionality, nor any requirements for thematic concentration or allocation by category of region. The scope of support is wide and transfers between ERDF and ESF are possible. Projects dating back to 1 February 2020 can be retroactively reimbursed. Ensuring transparency and accountability To coincide with these first payments, a new REACT-EU dashboard has been launched on the Commission's Cohesion Open Data Platform, to provide up to date information on the use of the REACT-EU resources across the EU. Cross-cutting themes such as green, digital and specific measures for climate adaptation are highlighted, in addition to data on specific investment areas by fund. The dashboard was put in place to facilitate access to public data and to ensure transparency and accountability. Background NextGenerationEU is a temporary recovery instrument of some 800 billion in current prices to support Europe's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and help build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe. To finance NextGenerationEU, the European Commission on behalf of the EU will raise from the capital markets up to around 800 billion between now and end-2026: 407.5 billion for grants (under RRF, REACT-EU and other EU budget programmes); 386 billion for loans. This will translate into borrowing volumes of an average of roughly 150 billion per year. REACT-EU is part of NextGenerationEU and provides 50.6 billion additional funding (in current prices) over the course of 2021 and 2022 to Cohesion policy programmes. Measures focus on supporting labour market resilience, jobs, SMEs and low-income families, as well as setting future-proof foundations for the green and digital transitions and a sustainable socio-economic recovery.

The aim of this package is to ensure that banks can continue to lend money to support the economy and help mitigate the significant economic impact of the Coronavirus. It includes an Interpretative Communication on the EU's accounting and prudential frameworks, as well as targeted \"quick fix\" amendments to EU banking rules. The rules put in place following the financial crisis have ensured that banks in the EU are now more resilient and better prepared to deal with shocks to the economy. Today's Communication recalls that EU rules allow banks and their supervisors to act in a flexible, but responsible, manner during economic crises to support citizens and firms, particularly small and medium-sized companies. Today's Regulation also implements some targeted changes to maximise the capacity of credit institutions to lend and to absorb losses related to the Coronavirus pandemic, while still ensuring their continued resilience. Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People said: \"We are supporting households and businesses as much as we can to deal with the economic fallout of the Coronavirus. The banking sector can do a lot to help here. We are using the full flexibility of the EU's banking rules and proposing targeted legislative changes to enable banks to keep the liquidity taps turned on, so that households and companies can get the financing they need. I will soon also be launching roundtable discussions bringing together consumer and business groups with the financial sector so that we can address the most urgent needs of our citizens and companies.\" The Commission will engage with the European financial sector to explore how it can develop best practices that could further support citizens and businesses. The EU's response to this crisis must be coordinated in order to avoid national fragmentation and to ensure a level playing field. Targeted amendments to banking rules The Commission proposed today a few targeted \"quick fix\" amendments to the EU's banking prudential rules (the Capital Requirements Regulation) in order to maximise the ability of banks to lend and absorb losses related to Coronavirus. The Commission proposes exceptional temporary measures to alleviate the immediate impact of Coronavirus-related developments, by adapting the timeline of the application of international accounting standards on banks' capital, by treating more favourably public guarantees granted during this crisis, by postponing the date of application of the leverage ratio buffer and by modifying the way of excluding certain exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio. The Commission also proposes to advance the date of application of several agreed measures that incentivise banks to finance employees, SMEs and infrastructure projects. Interpretative Communication Today's Communication confirms the recent statements on using flexibility within accounting and prudential rules, such as those made by the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank, amongst others. The Commission encourages banks and supervisory authorities to make use of the flexibility in the EU's accounting and prudential frameworks. For example, the Communication confirms and welcomes the flexibility available in EU rules when it comes to public and private moratoria on loan repayments (EBA guidelines of 2 April). The Communication also highlights areas where banks are invited to act responsibly, for example by refraining from making dividend distributions to shareholders or adopting a conservative approach to the payment of variable remuneration.

Children can also receive a test or recovery certificate. These certificates could also be received by their parents and stored in the parents' smartphone app. EU Member States also agreed that minors travelling with parents should be exempt from quarantine when the parents do not need to undergo quarantine, for example due to vaccination. Children under 12 should also be exempt from travel-related testing. How can citizens get the certificate? National authorities are in charge of issuing the certificate. It could, for example, be issued by test centres or health authorities, or directly via an eHealth portal. Vaccination certificates are issued by the Member State where the vaccination has been administered. Test certificates are issued by the Member State where the test has taken place.

The EU Digital COVID Certificate is accepted in all EU Member States. It helps ensuring that restrictions currently in place can be lifted in a coordinated manner. When travelling, the EU Digital COVID Certificate holder should in principle be exempt from free movement restrictions: Member States should refrain from imposing additional travel restrictions on the holders of an EU Digital COVID Certificate, unless they are necessary and proportionate to safeguard public health. In such a case for instance as a reaction to new variants of concern that Member State would have to notify the Commission and all other Member States and justify this decision. How does the certificate work? The EU Digital COVID Certificate contains a QR code with a digital signature to protect it against falsification. When the certificate is checked, the QR code is scanned and the signature verified. Each issuing body (e.g. a hospital, a test centre, a health authority) has its own digital signature key. All of these are stored in a secure database in each country. The European Commission has built a gateway through which all certificate signatures can be verified across the EU. The personal data of the certificate holder does not pass through the gateway, as this is not necessary to verify the digital signature. The European Commission also helped Member States to develop national software and apps to issue, store and verify certificates and supported them in the necessary tests to on-board the gateway. Are citizens who are not yet vaccinated able to travel to another EU country? Yes. The EU Digital COVID Certificate should facilitate free movement inside the EU. It is not a pre-condition to free movement, which is a fundamental right in the EU. Without a certificate, you might however be subject to restrictions like testing or quarantine. Member States can introduce travel restrictions. Please check Re-openEU for the latest updates. To ensure that there is no discrimination against individuals who are not vaccinated, the EU Digital COVID Certificate also covers test certificates and certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19. This way everyone can benefit from the EU Digital COVID Certificate. The recommendation on coordinating free movement restrictions in the EU was amended mid-June with a view to the holiday season, further clarifying exemptions for fully vaccinated and recovered persons, efforts to ensure family unity (exempting children traveling with their parents from quarantine, if parents are exempted) and the updated colour-coding of the ECDC map. Does it matter which vaccine citizens received? Vaccination certificates will be issued to a vaccinated person for any COVID-19 vaccine. The certificate should clearly indicate the name of the vaccine administered. When it comes to waiving free movement restrictions, Member States only have to accept vaccination certificates for vaccines which received EU marketing authorisation. Member States may also decide to waive restrictions for travellers that received another vaccine, for instance those included on the WHO emergency list, but they are not obliged to. If you have been vaccinated with a vaccine not authorised in the EU, we advise you to check which vaccines are accepted by the respective Member State prior to your travel. Fully vaccinated persons with the EU Digital COVID Certificate should be exempted from travel-related testing or quarantine 14 days after having received the last dose of a COVID-19 vaccine approved for the entire EU . The same is true for recovered persons with the certificate. Can EU citizens, or non-EU citizens legally residing in the EU, who were vaccinated abroad get the EU certificate? If so, how? EU citizens who were vaccinated in a third country can request the EU Digital COVID Certificate, from the Member State of their nationality or residence, if they provide reliable proof of vaccination with a vaccine also authorised in that Member State. Member States are not obliged to offer this possibility. The list of COVID-19 vaccines administered by third countries, for which several EU Member States waive travel restrictions as they consider them as corresponding to the ones approved by the EU, is available online: . Alternatively, the EU can decide to automatically recognise certificates issued by other countries, by adopting equivalence decisions. Currently there are 16 countries (and territories) for which the EU adopted an equivalence decision and whose COVID certificates are recognised under the same conditions as the EU Digital COVID Certificate. This includes Albania Andorra Switzerland Faroe Islands Israel Iceland Liechtenstein Morocco Monaco North Macedonia Norway Panama San Marino Turkey Ukraine The Vatican Can citizens get the certificate already after the first vaccination dose? Yes, an EU Digital COVID certificate should be issued already after the first vaccination dose. The number of doses administered will be clearly stated on the vaccination certificate. Member States might not accept a partial vaccination for lifting travel restrictions. Please check national travel restrictions prior to your travel with the national authorities. I had two doses in two different Member States can I get the EU COVID Certificate? Yes. A Member State, where you received the first dose should issue an EU Digital COVID Certificate indicating the first dose. The Member State, which administered the second dose, will then issue an EU Digital COVID Certificate indicating the second dose, once you provide to the authorities there the information confirming the first dose previously received. I had a mixed vaccine (two doses come from two different vaccine providers) can I get the EU Digital COVID Certificate? Yes. An EU Digital COVID Certificates should be issued to any person who received a COVID-19 vaccination. Such certificate should clearly indicate the name of the vaccine and the number of doses administered. When it comes to waiving travel restrictions, Member States agreed that EU citizens who received mixed doses in a two-dose series of COVID-19 vaccination, in line with national vaccination strategies, are considered \"fully vaccinated\". What about tests? Persons with a negative test in the EU Digital COVID Certificate format should be exempted from possible quarantine requirements, except when they come from areas heavily affected by the virus. The Member States agreed on a standard validity period for tests: 72 hours for PCR tests and, where accepted by a Member State, 48 hours for rapid antigen tests. Which tests are accepted for the test certificate? Only so-called NAAT tests (including RT-PCR tests) and rapid antigen tests featured in the common list established on the basis of Council Recommendation 2021\/C 24\/01 are eligible for a test certificate issued under the EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation. Each Member State can decide whether it accepts rapid antigen tests, or only NAAT tests (such as RT-PCR tests). Which tests can be used for a recovery certificate? Certificates of recovery (indicating that a person has recovered from an infection with COVID-19) can only be issued following a positive NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) such as RT-PCR test. They can be issued 11 days after the date of the initial test. What data does the certificate include? Is the data safe? The EU Digital COVID Certificate contains necessary key information such as name, date of birth, date of issuance, relevant information about vaccine\/ test\/recovery and a unique identifier. This data remains on the certificate and is not stored or retained when a certificate is verified in another Member State. The certificates will only include a limited set of information that is necessary. This cannot be retained by visited countries. For verification purposes, only the validity and authenticity of the certificate is checked by verifying who issued and signed it. All health data remains with the Member State that issued an EU Digital COVID Certificate. What to do if the certificate contains mistakes or incorrect data? For any technical issues with your EU Digital COVID Certificate please contact the national authorities responsible for issuing the certificates. Recognition of COVID certificates from third (non-EU) countries So far, 16 non-EU countries (and territories) joined the EU Digital COVID Certificate system. This includes: Albania Andorra Switzerland Faroe Islands Israel Iceland Liechtenstein Morocco Monaco North Macedonia Norway Panama San Marino Turkey Ukraine The Vatican The COVID Certificates issued in those 16 countries (and territories) are accepted in the EU under the same conditions as the EU Digital COVID Certificate. Likewise, the EU Digital COVID Certificate is accepted by those 16 countries. Validity of the certificates The Commission has proposed, and Member States have adopted, an update to the Council recommendation on free movement restrictions . It includes specific provisions although Member States can be less strict as well: Fully vaccinated persons holding an EU Digital COVID Certificate should be exempt from travel-related testing or quarantine 14 days after having received the last dose . This should also cover recovered persons having received a single dose of a 2-dose vaccine. Recovered persons , holding an EU Digital COVID Certificate should be exempt from travel-related testing or quarantine during the first 180 days after a positive PCR test. Persons with an EU Digital COVID test certificate should be exempt from possible quarantine requirements: 72 hours for PCR tests and, where accepted by a Member State, 48 hours for rapid antigen tests. Potential use of certificates for access to facilities EU law covers the use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate to facilitate safe free movement inside the EU. Member States can also use the COVID-19 certificates for domestic purposes, such as access to events or venues, but this is not regulated at the EU level. In case a Member State adopts a system of COVID-19 certificate for domestic purposes, it should ensure that the EU Digital COVID Certificate is also fully accepted. This is to make sure that travellers going to another Member State do not have to obtain an additional national certificate. For how long will the EU Digital COVID Certificate be in place? The Regulation on the EU Digital COVID Certificate will apply for 12 months as from 1 July 2021. The Commission will present a report to the European Parliament and the Council three months before the end of application of the Regulation. Together with this report, the Commission could propose to extend the COVID Certificate if necessary, taking into account the evolution of the epidemiological situation on the pandemic. Can non-EU citizens travel to the EU? Under the current EU approach, non-EU travellers who are fully vaccinated with an EMA-authorised vaccine should be able to travel to the EU for any purpose. EU Member States can also decide to allow in those vaccinated with vaccines having completed the WHO Emergency Use Listing process. Travel is also possible from countries where the health situation has improved sufficiently. The Council regularly reviews - and where relevant updates a list of such countries, based on an evaluation of the health situation. All travel to the EU from countries included on this list should be possible, regardless of vaccination status. The list is available here . In addition, family members of EU citizens and residents, as well as those who have an essential reason to come to Europe should continue to be able to do so. How can non-EU travellers prove they have been vaccinated? Can they get an EU Digital COVID Certificate? The purpose of the EU Digital COVID Certificate is to help facilitate free movement and travel within the EU for both EU citizens and non-EU nationals already in the EU. When it comes to proving vaccination status for those travelling from outside the EU, EU Member States could accept vaccination certificates from non-EU countries containing the necessary data (identification of the person, type of vaccine and date of vaccination), taking into account the ability to verify the authenticity, validity and integrity of the certificate. The EU can also decide to automatically recognise certificates issued by other countries. Currently this is the case for 16 countries: Switzerland Iceland Liechtenstein North Macedonia Norway San Marino Turkey Ukraine The Vatican And from 15 September 2021: Albania Andorra Faroe Islands Israel Monaco Morocco Panama The COVID Certificates issued in these countries are accepted in the EU under the same conditions as the EU Digital COVID Certificate. Lastly, an EU Member State may, upon request, issue an EU Digital COVID Certificate to a non-EU national wishing to travel to the EU, provided that all reliable proof of vaccination, has been presented, but it is not obliged to do so. For more details as regards the rules in place for non-EU nationals to enter from outside the EU, you can consult the Re-open EU website.

Certificates of recovery (indicating that a person has recovered from an infection with COVID-19) can only be issued following a positive NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) such as RT-PCR test. They can be issued 11 days after the date of the initial test. What data does the certificate include? Is the data safe? The EU Digital COVID Certificate contains necessary key information such as name, date of birth, date of issuance, relevant information about vaccine\/ test\/recovery and a unique identifier. This data remains on the certificate and is not stored or retained when a certificate is verified in another Member State. The certificates will only include a limited set of information that is necessary. This cannot be retained by visited countries. For verification purposes, only the validity and authenticity of the certificate is checked by verifying who issued and signed it. All health data remains with the Member State that issued an EU Digital COVID Certificate. What to do if the certificate contains mistakes or incorrect data? For any technical issues with your EU Digital COVID Certificate please contact the national authorities responsible for issuing the certificates. Recognition of COVID certificates from third (non-EU) countries So far, 16 non-EU countries (and territories) joined the EU Digital COVID Certificate system. This includes: Albania Andorra Switzerland Faroe Islands Israel Iceland Liechtenstein Morocco Monaco North Macedonia Norway Panama San Marino Turkey Ukraine The Vatican The COVID Certificates issued in those 16 countries (and territories) are accepted in the EU under the same conditions as the EU Digital COVID Certificate. Likewise, the EU Digital COVID Certificate is accepted by those 16 countries. Validity of the certificates The Commission has proposed, and Member States have adopted, an update to the Council recommendation on free movement restrictions . It includes specific provisions although Member States can be less strict as well: Fully vaccinated persons holding an EU Digital COVID Certificate should be exempt from travel-related testing or quarantine 14 days after having received the last dose . This should also cover recovered persons having received a single dose of a 2-dose vaccine. Recovered persons , holding an EU Digital COVID Certificate should be exempt from travel-related testing or quarantine during the first 180 days after a positive PCR test. Persons with an EU Digital COVID test certificate should be exempt from possible quarantine requirements: 72 hours for PCR tests and, where accepted by a Member State, 48 hours for rapid antigen tests. Potential use of certificates for access to facilities EU law covers the use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate to facilitate safe free movement inside the EU. Member States can also use the COVID-19 certificates for domestic purposes, such as access to events or venues, but this is not regulated at the EU level. In case a Member State adopts a system of COVID-19 certificate for domestic purposes, it should ensure that the EU Digital COVID Certificate is also fully accepted. This is to make sure that travellers going to another Member State do not have to obtain an additional national certificate. For how long will the EU Digital COVID Certificate be in place? The Regulation on the EU Digital COVID Certificate will apply for 12 months as from 1 July 2021. The Commission will present a report to the European Parliament and the Council three months before the end of application of the Regulation. Together with this report, the Commission could propose to extend the COVID Certificate if necessary, taking into account the evolution of the epidemiological situation on the pandemic. Can non-EU citizens travel to the EU? Under the current EU approach, non-EU travellers who are fully vaccinated with an EMA-authorised vaccine should be able to travel to the EU for any purpose. EU Member States can also decide to allow in those vaccinated with vaccines having completed the WHO Emergency Use Listing process. Travel is also possible from countries where the health situation has improved sufficiently. The Council regularly reviews - and where relevant updates a list of such countries, based on an evaluation of the health situation. All travel to the EU from countries included on this list should be possible, regardless of vaccination status. The list is available here . In addition, family members of EU citizens and residents, as well as those who have an essential reason to come to Europe should continue to be able to do so. How can non-EU travellers prove they have been vaccinated? Can they get an EU Digital COVID Certificate? The purpose of the EU Digital COVID Certificate is to help facilitate free movement and travel within the EU for both EU citizens and non-EU nationals already in the EU. When it comes to proving vaccination status for those travelling from outside the EU, EU Member States could accept vaccination certificates from non-EU countries containing the necessary data (identification of the person, type of vaccine and date of vaccination), taking into account the ability to verify the authenticity, validity and integrity of the certificate. The EU can also decide to automatically recognise certificates issued by other countries. Currently this is the case for 16 countries: Switzerland Iceland Liechtenstein North Macedonia Norway San Marino Turkey Ukraine The Vatican And from 15 September 2021: Albania Andorra Faroe Islands Israel Monaco Morocco Panama The COVID Certificates issued in these countries are accepted in the EU under the same conditions as the EU Digital COVID Certificate. Lastly, an EU Member State may, upon request, issue an EU Digital COVID Certificate to a non-EU national wishing to travel to the EU, provided that all reliable proof of vaccination, has been presented, but it is not obliged to do so. For more details as regards the rules in place for non-EU nationals to enter from outside the EU, you can consult the Re-open EU website.

How can citizens get the certificate? How does it help free movement? How does the certificate work? Are citizens who are not yet vaccinated able to travel to another EU country? Does it matter which vaccine citizens received? Recognition of COVID certificates from third (non-EU) countries Validity of the certificates Potential use of certificates for access to facilities For how long will the EU Digital COVID Certificate be in place? Can non-EU citizens travel to the EU? Timeline Documents The EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation entered into application on 01 July 2021. EU citizens and residents will now be able to have their Digital COVID Certificates issued and verified across the EU. Learn how to get the certificate from your national health authority by selecting your country on the interactive map below. What is the EU Digital COVID Certificate? An EU Digital COVID Certificate is a digital proof that a person has either been vaccinated against COVID-19 received a negative test result or recovered from COVID-19 Key features of the certificate Digital and\/or paper format with QR code free of charge in national language and English safe and secure valid in all EU countries Who can get the EU Digital COVID certificate? All EU citizens and their family members Non-EU nationals who are legally staying or residing in a Member State and have the right to travel to other Member States Can children get an EU Digital COVID Certificate? Yes, children can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given its green light to the use of the BioNTech Pfizer vaccine Comirnaty and the Moderna vaccine Spikevax for children of 12-17 years. Children can also receive a test or recovery certificate. These certificates could also be received by their parents and stored in the parents' smartphone app. EU Member States also agreed that minors travelling with parents should be exempt from quarantine when the parents do not need to undergo quarantine, for example due to vaccination. Children under 12 should also be exempt from travel-related testing. How can citizens get the certificate? National authorities are in charge of issuing the certificate. It could, for example, be issued by test centres or health authorities, or directly via an eHealth portal. Vaccination certificates are issued by the Member State where the vaccination has been administered. Test certificates are issued by the Member State where the test has taken place. Recovery certificates are issued by the Member State where the recovered person is located. Information on how to get the certificate should be provided by the national health authorities. The digital version can be stored on a mobile device. Citizens can also request a paper version. Both will have a QR code that contains essential information, as well as a digital signature to make sure the certificate is authentic. Member States have agreed on a common design that can be used for the electronic and paper versions to facilitate the recognition. Select your country on the interactive map below to learn how to get the certificate from your national health authority. {\"service\":\"map\",\"version\":\"3.0\",\"custom\":[\"\/\/ec.europa.eu\/assets\/comm\/digital-certificate-map\/bsim-digital.js\",\"\/\/ec.europa.eu\/assets\/comm\/digital-certificate-map\/bsim-digital.css\"]} How does it help free movement? The EU Digital COVID Certificate is accepted in all EU Member States. It helps ensuring that restrictions currently in place can be lifted in a coordinated manner. When travelling, the EU Digital COVID Certificate holder should in principle be exempt from free movement restrictions: Member States should refrain from imposing additional travel restrictions on the holders of an EU Digital COVID Certificate, unless they are necessary and proportionate to safeguard public health. In such a case for instance as a reaction to new variants of concern that Member State would have to notify the Commission and all other Member States and justify this decision. How does the certificate work? The EU Digital COVID Certificate contains a QR code with a digital signature to protect it against falsification. When the certificate is checked, the QR code is scanned and the signature verified. Each issuing body (e.g. a hospital, a test centre, a health authority) has its own digital signature key. All of these are stored in a secure database in each country. The European Commission has built a gateway through which all certificate signatures can be verified across the EU. The personal data of the certificate holder does not pass through the gateway, as this is not necessary to verify the digital signature. The European Commission also helped Member States to develop national software and apps to issue, store and verify certificates and supported them in the necessary tests to on-board the gateway. Are citizens who are not yet vaccinated able to travel to another EU country? Yes. The EU Digital COVID Certificate should facilitate free movement inside the EU. It is not a pre-condition to free movement, which is a fundamental right in the EU. Without a certificate, you might however be subject to restrictions like testing or quarantine. Member States can introduce travel restrictions. Please check Re-openEU for the latest updates. To ensure that there is no discrimination against individuals who are not vaccinated, the EU Digital COVID Certificate also covers test certificates and certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19. This way everyone can benefit from the EU Digital COVID Certificate. The recommendation on coordinating free movement restrictions in the EU was amended mid-June with a view to the holiday season, further clarifying exemptions for fully vaccinated and recovered persons, efforts to ensure family unity (exempting children traveling with their parents from quarantine, if parents are exempted) and the updated colour-coding of the ECDC map. Does it matter which vaccine citizens received? Vaccination certificates will be issued to a vaccinated person for any COVID-19 vaccine. The certificate should clearly indicate the name of the vaccine administered. When it comes to waiving free movement restrictions, Member States only have to accept vaccination certificates for vaccines which received EU marketing authorisation. Member States may also decide to waive restrictions for travellers that received another vaccine, for instance those included on the WHO emergency list, but they are not obliged to. If you have been vaccinated with a vaccine not authorised in the EU, we advise you to check which vaccines are accepted by the respective Member State prior to your travel. Fully vaccinated persons with the EU Digital COVID Certificate should be exempted from travel-related testing or quarantine 14 days after having received the last dose of a COVID-19 vaccine approved for the entire EU . The same is true for recovered persons with the certificate. Can EU citizens, or non-EU citizens legally residing in the EU, who were vaccinated abroad get the EU certificate? If so, how? EU citizens who were vaccinated in a third country can request the EU Digital COVID Certificate, from the Member State of their nationality or residence, if they provide reliable proof of vaccination with a vaccine also authorised in that Member State. Member States are not obliged to offer this possibility. The list of COVID-19 vaccines administered by third countries, for which several EU Member States waive travel restrictions as they consider them as corresponding to the ones approved by the EU, is available online: . Alternatively, the EU can decide to automatically recognise certificates issued by other countries, by adopting equivalence decisions. Currently there are 16 countries (and territories) for which the EU adopted an equivalence decision and whose COVID certificates are recognised under the same conditions as the EU Digital COVID Certificate. This includes Albania Andorra Switzerland Faroe Islands Israel Iceland Liechtenstein Morocco Monaco North Macedonia Norway Panama San Marino Turkey Ukraine The Vatican Can citizens get the certificate already after the first vaccination dose? Yes, an EU Digital COVID certificate should be issued already after the first vaccination dose. The number of doses administered will be clearly stated on the vaccination certificate. Member States might not accept a partial vaccination for lifting travel restrictions. Please check national travel restrictions prior to your travel with the national authorities. I had two doses in two different Member States can I get the EU COVID Certificate? Yes. A Member State, where you received the first dose should issue an EU Digital COVID Certificate indicating the first dose. The Member State, which administered the second dose, will then issue an EU Digital COVID Certificate indicating the second dose, once you provide to the authorities there the information confirming the first dose previously received. I had a mixed vaccine (two doses come from two different vaccine providers) can I get the EU Digital COVID Certificate? Yes. An EU Digital COVID Certificates should be issued to any person who received a COVID-19 vaccination. Such certificate should clearly indicate the name of the vaccine and the number of doses administered. When it comes to waiving travel restrictions, Member States agreed that EU citizens who received mixed doses in a two-dose series of COVID-19 vaccination, in line with national vaccination strategies, are considered \"fully vaccinated\". What about tests? Persons with a negative test in the EU Digital COVID Certificate format should be exempted from possible quarantine requirements, except when they come from areas heavily affected by the virus. The Member States agreed on a standard validity period for tests: 72 hours for PCR tests and, where accepted by a Member State, 48 hours for rapid antigen tests. Which tests are accepted for the test certificate? Only so-called NAAT tests (including RT-PCR tests) and rapid antigen tests featured in the common list established on the basis of Council Recommendation 2021\/C 24\/01 are eligible for a test certificate issued under the EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation. Each Member State can decide whether it accepts rapid antigen tests, or only NAAT tests (such as RT-PCR tests). Which tests can be used for a recovery certificate? Certificates of recovery (indicating that a person has recovered from an infection with COVID-19) can only be issued following a positive NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) such as RT-PCR test. They can be issued 11 days after the date of the initial test. What data does the certificate include? Is the data safe? The EU Digital COVID Certificate contains necessary key information such as name, date of birth, date of issuance, relevant information about vaccine\/ test\/recovery and a unique identifier. This data remains on the certificate and is not stored or retained when a certificate is verified in another Member State. The certificates will only include a limited set of information that is necessary. This cannot be retained by visited countries. For verification purposes, only the validity and authenticity of the certificate is checked by verifying who issued and signed it. All health data remains with the Member State that issued an EU Digital COVID Certificate. What to do if the certificate contains mistakes or incorrect data?

This is an important step towards the EU disbursing 6.3 billion in grants under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Slovakia's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Slovakia emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF at the heart of NextGenerationEU will provide up to 672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Slovak plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market. The Commission assessed Slovakia's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms set out in Slovakia's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience. Securing Slovakia's green and digital transition The Commission's assessment finds that Slovakia's plan devotes 43% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes investments in new renewable energy capacities, energy efficiency, greening of private and public buildings (including hospitals and schools), developing new infrastructure for electric vehicle charging points, public transport, the decarbonisation of industry and adaptation to climate change. The Commission's assessment finds that Slovakia's plan devotes 21% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. This includes investments in e-governance, the digital transformation of education and healthcare, together with support for enhancing the digital technologies available to businesses, particularly SMEs. Reinforcing Slovakia's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that Slovakia's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Slovakia by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures that tackle long-standing challenges in the areas of education, childcare and healthcare. Research, development and innovation are also addressed with comprehensive measures that are expected to tackle the most important shortcomings. These include the low quality and inclusiveness of education, fragmented research, development and innovation policy coordination, insufficient public-private cooperation, and weak research, development and innovation performance. Additional measures proposed in the plan to improve the justice system, public procurement and the fight against money laundering have the potential to contribute to effectively addressing many underlying challenges. Several reforms are expected to improve the long-term sustainability of public finances, notably the planned pension reform. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Slovakia's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects The Slovak plan proposes projects in all seven European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects that address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the twin transition. For instance, Slovakia has proposed to provide 528 million to renovate at least 30,000 family houses to improve their energy and green performance, while reducing people's energy bills and greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapting to climate change with water retention measures. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The controls systems put in place by Slovakia are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said : President Ursula von der Leyen said: \" I am delighted to present the European Commission's positive assessment of Slovakia's recovery and resilience plan. The plan represents a significant effort by Slovakia to address the challenges it faces and ensure nobody is left behind as we secure the green and digital transitions. It includes a large number of reforms as well as many climate-relevant investments and will provide a boost to digitalisation. We will stand by you every step of the way to ensure that the plan delivers its full potential .\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" This is a strong recovery plan that will set Slovakia on the track to an inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and a more resilient economy with higher growth prospects. Ambitious investments and reforms in education, science and healthcare will increase the country's attractiveness for doing business and create more opportunities across the country. I welcome in particular the strong emphasis on green and digital projects, which will improve the competitiveness of firms and the quality of public services ultimately improving people's wellbeing too. The intense preparation of this plan bodes well for its implementation .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" Our positive assessment of Slovakia's plan brings the country a big step closer to benefitting from 6.3 billion in NextGenerationEU grants. This ambitious plan will help to boost investment in renewable energy, sustainable transport and decarbonisation in the Upper Nitra region. It will support reforms to improve education and healthcare, while also ensuring both the adequacy of pensions and the sustainability of the pension system .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide 6.3 billion in grants to Slovakia under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 823 million to Slovakia in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Slovakia. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

This is an important step towards the EU disbursing 93 million in grants under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). This financing will support the implementation of the investment and reform measures outlined in Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan. It will support Luxembourg's efforts to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF at the heart of NextGenerationEU will provide up to 672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU.

Securing Luxembourg's green and digital transition The Commission's assessment finds that Luxembourg's plan allocates 61% of total expenditure to measures that support climate objectives. This includes measures to supply renewable energy to a housing district project in Neischmelz, a support scheme for the deployment of charging points for electric vehicles, and the \"Naturpakt\" scheme encouraging municipalities to protect the natural environment and biodiversity. The Commission finds that Luxembourg's plan devotes 32% of total expenditure to measures that support the digital transition. This includes investments in the digitalisation of public services and procedures; digitalisation of projects for healthcare, such as an online solution for remote healthcare checks; and the establishment of a laboratory for testing ultra-secure communication connections based on quantum technology. In addition, investments in targeted training programmes will provide job seekers and workers on short-time work schemes with digital skills. Reinforcing Luxembourg's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that Luxembourg's plan is expected to contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of challenges identified in the relevant country-specific recommendations (CSRs). Specifically, it contributes to addressing CSRs on labour market policies through addressing skills mismatches and enhancing the employability of older workers. It also contributes to increasing the resilience of the healthcare system, increasing available housing, the green and digital transitions, and the enforcement of the anti-money laundering framework. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Luxembourg's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects Luxembourg's plan proposes projects in five European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects dealing with issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the green and digital transitions. For instance, Luxembourg has proposed measures aimed at increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of public administration service through enhanced digitalisation. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The control systems put in place by Luxembourg are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said : President Ursula von der Leyen said : \" Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan.

I am proud that NextGenerationEU will play an important role in supporting these efforts .\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" Congratulations to Luxembourg for designing a recovery plan whose focus on the green and digital transitions goes way beyond the minimum requirements. This will make a significant contribution to Luxembourg's recovery from the crisis, promising a brighter future for its young people by investing in digital skills programmes, training for jobseekers and the unemployed, as well as increasing the supply of affordable and sustainable housing. These investments will make Luxembourg's economy fit for the next generation. It is also good to see Luxembourg's plans to invest in renewable energy and further digitalise its public services both areas with potential for solid economic growth .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" Although its financial contribution is relatively limited in size, Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan is set to deliver real improvements in a number of areas. Particularly positive is the strong focus on supporting the Grand Duchy's climate transition, with important measures to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles and increase energy efficiency in buildings. Citizens will also benefit from the drive to boost digital public services and provide more affordable housing. Lastly, I welcome the fact that the plan includes significant steps to further reinforce the anti-money laundering framework and its enforcement .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide 93 million in grants to Luxembourg under the RRF.

It will support Luxembourg's efforts to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF at the heart of NextGenerationEU will provide up to 672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Luxembourgish plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market. The Commission assessed Luxembourg's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's assessment considered in particular whether the investments and reforms set out in Luxembourg's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience. Securing Luxembourg's green and digital transition The Commission's assessment finds that Luxembourg's plan allocates 61% of total expenditure to measures that support climate objectives. This includes measures to supply renewable energy to a housing district project in Neischmelz, a support scheme for the deployment of charging points for electric vehicles, and the \"Naturpakt\" scheme encouraging municipalities to protect the natural environment and biodiversity. The Commission finds that Luxembourg's plan devotes 32% of total expenditure to measures that support the digital transition. This includes investments in the digitalisation of public services and procedures; digitalisation of projects for healthcare, such as an online solution for remote healthcare checks; and the establishment of a laboratory for testing ultra-secure communication connections based on quantum technology. In addition, investments in targeted training programmes will provide job seekers and workers on short-time work schemes with digital skills. Reinforcing Luxembourg's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that Luxembourg's plan is expected to contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of challenges identified in the relevant country-specific recommendations (CSRs). Specifically, it contributes to addressing CSRs on labour market policies through addressing skills mismatches and enhancing the employability of older workers. It also contributes to increasing the resilience of the healthcare system, increasing available housing, the green and digital transitions, and the enforcement of the anti-money laundering framework. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Luxembourg's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects Luxembourg's plan proposes projects in five European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects dealing with issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the green and digital transitions. For instance, Luxembourg has proposed measures aimed at increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of public administration service through enhanced digitalisation. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The control systems put in place by Luxembourg are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said : President Ursula von der Leyen said : \" Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan. The plan places a strong emphasis on measures that will help secure the green transition, demonstrating Luxembourg's commitment to creating a more sustainable future. I am proud that NextGenerationEU will play an important role in supporting these efforts .\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" Congratulations to Luxembourg for designing a recovery plan whose focus on the green and digital transitions goes way beyond the minimum requirements. This will make a significant contribution to Luxembourg's recovery from the crisis, promising a brighter future for its young people by investing in digital skills programmes, training for jobseekers and the unemployed, as well as increasing the supply of affordable and sustainable housing. These investments will make Luxembourg's economy fit for the next generation. It is also good to see Luxembourg's plans to invest in renewable energy and further digitalise its public services both areas with potential for solid economic growth .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" Although its financial contribution is relatively limited in size, Luxembourg's recovery and resilience plan is set to deliver real improvements in a number of areas. Particularly positive is the strong focus on supporting the Grand Duchy's climate transition, with important measures to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles and increase energy efficiency in buildings. Citizens will also benefit from the drive to boost digital public services and provide more affordable housing. Lastly, I welcome the fact that the plan includes significant steps to further reinforce the anti-money laundering framework and its enforcement .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide 93 million in grants to Luxembourg under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 12 million to Luxembourg in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Luxembourg. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

Once adopted, the package of a total of 1.8 trillion will be the largest package ever financed through the EU budget. It will help rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe, which will be greener, more digital, more resilient and better fit for the current and forthcoming challenges. President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"I welcome today's agreement on our Recovery Plan and the next Multiannual Financial Framework. We now need to move forward with finalising the agreement on the next long-term budget and NextGenerationEU by the end of the year. Help is needed for citizens and business badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Our recovery plan will help us turn the challenge of the pandemic into an opportunity for a recovery led by the green and digital transition\". European Commissioner Johannes Hahn in charge of the budget, who worked to facilitate the deal since the beginning of the mandate, said: \"Today's agreement will allow to reinforce specific programmes under the long-term budget for 2021-2027 (including Horizon Europe, Erasmus+, EU4Health). All in all, the EU long-term budget together with NextGenerationEU will amount to more than 1.8 trillion. It will play an essential role to support the recovery and make sure traditional beneficiaries of EU funds receive the sufficient means to continue their work during these very challenging times for all\". Main elements of today's compromise include: More than 50% of the amount will support modernisation through policies that include research and innovation , via Horizon Europe; fair climate and digital transitions , via the Just Transition Fund and the Digital Europe Programme; preparedness, recovery and resilience , via the Recovery and Resilience Facility, rescEU and a new health programme, EU4Health. Traditional policies such as cohesion and common agricultural policy also continue to receive significant financial support, so much necessary to ensure stability in times of crisis and their modernisation that should contribute to the recovery and the green and digital transitions. 30% of the EU funds will be spent to fight climate change , the highest share ever of the largest European budget ever. The package also pays a specific attention to biodiversity protection and gender equality. The budget will have strengthened flexibility mechanisms to guarantee it has the capacity to address unforeseen needs. This is making it a budget fit not only for today's realities but also for tomorrow's uncertainties. As proposed in May 2020 and agreed by EU leaders on 21 July 2020, to finance the recovery, the EU will borrow on the markets at more favourable costs than many Member States and redistribute the amounts. A clear roadmap towards new own resources to help repay the borrowing. The Commission has committed to put forward proposals on a carbon border adjustment mechanism and on a digital levy by June 2021, with a view to their introduction at the latest by 1 January 2023. The Commission will also review the EU Emissions Trading System in spring 2021, including its possible extension to aviation and maritime. It will propose an own resource based on the Emissions Trading System by June 2021. In addition, the Commission will propose additional new own resources, which could include a Financial Transaction Tax and a financial contribution linked to the corporate sector or a new common corporate tax base. The Commission will work to make a proposal by June 2024. In terms of EU budget protection, now, for the first time, the EU will have a specific mechanism to protect its budget against breaches of the rule of law as agreed on 5 November. At the same time, final beneficiaries of EU funding in the Member State concerned will not be negatively affected by this mechanism. Next steps The MFF Regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement endorsed today must now be formally adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, in line with their respective roles and procedures. In parallel, work must continue towards a final adoption of all other elements of the package, including the sectoral legislation and the Own Resources Decision. In the case of the Own Resources Decision, which will enable the Commission to borrow, ratification by all Member States in line with their constitutional requirements is also needed. The European Parliament, at the September plenary, has already provided its positive opinion on this piece of legislation. The adoption by the Council is the next step. In parallel, negotiations on the annual budget for 2021 have to take place. The 21-day conciliation period, during which the European Parliament and the Council should reach an agreement, runs between 17 November and 7 December this year. The Commission remains fully committed to accompany the process. Background The Commission put forward its proposal for the EU's next long-term budget on 2 May 2018. The framework proposal was immediately followed by legislative proposals for the 37 sectoral programmes (e.g. cohesion, agriculture, Erasmus, Horizon Europe, etc). Between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the Commission worked hand in hand with the rotating Presidencies of the Council, and in close collaboration with the European Parliament, to take the negotiations forward. On 27 May 2020, in response to the unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus, the European Commission proposed the temporary recovery instrument NextGenerationEU of 750 billion, as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027. On 21 July 2020, EU heads of state or government reached a political agreement on the package. Since then, the European Parliament and the Council, and with the participation of the European Commission, held 11 trilateral political trilogues on the deal with the aim of fine-tuning the final parameters of the deal.

As part of the Team Europe global package, these funds contribute to the recovery from the pandemic and also support the transition towards democracy and medium-term development objectives. Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen , said: \" With this budget support, the EU is contributing to mitigate the most urgent budgetary needs of The Gambian Government in the context of the pandemic. As The Gambia's key partner, the European Union encourages the Government to strengthen democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and to take the lead in building the necessary national consensus around the future direction of the democratic transition, with a new Constitution at its core .\" The pandemic constitutes an unprecedented global health and economic crisis with detrimental and long-lasting socio-economic impacts. This budget support serves to support The Gambia in tackling its economic and fiscal impact, including loss of government revenue, unforeseen additional expenses and the consequences of global disruptions to supply chains. This will contribute to The Gambia's ongoing efforts to strengthen the democratic transition initiated in 2017. Channelled to the National Treasury of The Gambia, the EU funds will be used in accordance with The Gambia's own Public Financial Management systems and policy priorities. By providing fiscal space to address the pandemic and to continue financing basic public services such as healthcare and education, these funds will support The Gambia's resilience to the crisis. This funding also directly supports the long-term efforts to achieve debt sustainability. In addition, the EU will provide technical assistance and capacity building in areas such as public financial management and statistical development. Background Since the democratic transition, the EU has provided to The Gambia 365 million in development funds during the period 2016-2020 and 38.95 million from the EU Emergency Trust Fund from 2015 to 2019. The EU is committed to assist in strengthening the democratic and economic governance in The Gambia as well as its resilience capacity. The EU supports the priorities of The Gambian Government in view of encouraging inclusive and sustainable growth, achieving the necessary reforms related to human rights, to democracy, and on the rule of law.

Member States under the SURE instrument. As part of today's operations, Croatia has received 510 million, Cyprus 250 million, Greece 2 billion, Italy an additional 6.5 billion, Latvia 120 million, Lithuania 300 million, Malta 120 million, Slovenia 200 million and Spain an additional 4 billion. This support, in the form of loans granted on favourable terms, will assist these Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, including for the self-employed. At the end of October, Italy, Spain and Poland already received a total of 17 billion under the EU SURE instrument. Once all SURE disbursements have been completed to the 9 countries receiving financial support today, Croatia will receive 1 billion, Cyprus 479 million, Greece 2.7 billion, Italy 27.4 billion, Latvia 192 million, Lithuania 602 million, Malta 244 million, Slovenia 1.1 billion and Spain 21.3 billion. Today's disbursement follow the second issuance of social bonds under the EU SURE instrument , marked by very strong investor interest . The SURE instrument can provide up to 100 billion in financial support to all Member States. The Commission has so far proposed to make 90.3 billion in financial support available to 18 Member States. The next disbursements will take place over the course of the months ahead, following the respective bond issuances. Members of the College said: President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said : \"The second wave is hitting Europe hard. The EU is here to support. We want to protect people from this virus and we also want to protect their jobs, as this crisis affects businesses too. Many jobs are on the line. With SURE, we mobilise up to 100 billion in loans to EU countries to help finance short-time work schemes. This second disbursement of 14 billion will help workers receive an income. More will come.\" Commissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \" The second SURE issuance has once again been an overwhelming success and I am glad that as a result of it citizens in more of our Member States are getting the much needed support at times of crisis.\" Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni said: \"After last week's second issuance of SURE social bonds, again massively oversubscribed, today we deliver the 14 billion raised to nine EU countries. In these sombre times for so many European workers and companies, I am proud that the Commission is helping to bring hope and support.\" Background On 10 November, the European Commission issued social bonds for the second time under the EU SURE instrument, for a total value of 14 billion. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with 8 billion due for repayment in November 2025 and 6 billion due for repayment in November 2050. The issuance has received an overwhelming response in the capital markets and the bonds were 13 and 11.5 times oversubscribed, respectively for the 5- and 30-year tranche, resulting in favourable pricing terms for both bonds. The terms on which the Commission borrows are passed on directly to the beneficiary Member States. The bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.

A first flight to DRC is leaving today with Janez Lenarcic , European Commissioner for Crisis Management on board, together with Philippe Goffin, Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs and of Defense, and Jean-Yves Le Drian, French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs. In Kinshasa, they will meet the President of the DRC, H.E. Felix Tshisekedias well as humanitarian organisations and civil society in the capital and in Goma. Commissioner Lenarcic said: \"These new EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights to the DRC bring emergency aid to help those most in need. Defeating coronavirus in the long term means working together, in particular with African nations who are our key partners. We are delivering 40 tons of humanitarian cargo in total on board the three flights to the DRC. It is in our common interest to work in solidarity.\" Commissioner Lenarcic also stated that, in 2020, the EU is supporting the most vulnerable in the DRC with a total of 40.83 million in humanitarian funding. The cargo of the three EU humanitarian air bridge flights to the DRC includes: water purifiers, nutrition support, and general medical supplies; other supplies, such as laboratory equipment, masks, gloves and personal protective equipment are also intended to support the coronavirus response in the DRC, complementing efforts by the DRC Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO), and in line with the country's COVID-19 Response Plan. The flights are fully EU funded, and are part of a joint effort between the European Union, Belgium, France, and humanitarian aid organisations, and in cooperation with the DRC authorities. Since the beginning of May, the EU has organised four other Humanitarian Air Bridge flights - three to the Central African Republic and one to Sao Tome e Principe. Other flights are in the pipeline, including further flights to Africa, but also to other regions with high humanitarian needs. Background Team Europe support The EU Humanitarian Air Bridge operations form part of the EU's global response to the coronavirus pandemic within the Team Europe approach. Team Europe's support to the whole African continent in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic amounts to 3.25 billion, reaffirming the EU's leading partner to African countries. This funding is helping countries strengthen their health system, support their economies in these challenging times, train health staff and reinforce social support systems. EU humanitarian and development aid support in the DRC Humanitarian needs in the DRC are among the highest in the world. While battling the coronavirus pandemic, the country continues to grapple with Ebola (the 11 th Ebola virus disease outbreak declared on 01 June 2020, just as the 10 th one was dwindling), a measles outbreak, and cholera. The EU's 2020 humanitarian funding in the DRC includes recently announced EU humanitarian assistance in reaction to the coronavirus pandemic: 4.5 million is allocated to coronavirus infection prevention and control measures, and access to quality health care, water, sanitation and hygiene. An additional 2.78 million has been channeled to the World Health Organization (WHO) to support early detection and response, and expertise on the ground. Through its development aid, the EU is also, among other sectors, supporting the health care system in the DRC through a multi-year programme (2014-2020) with an overall budget of 222 million. It aims at improving both the accessibility and quality of health services through support to health centres and hospitals, to local health supervision authorities, and the medicines supply system.

To support and encourage cross-border healthcare cooperation between national, regional and local authorities, the Commission has today issued practical guidance to Member States. Cooperation across borders can help ease the pressure on overburdened hospitals by transferring patients suffering from coronavirus for treatment in Member States where hospital places are available. The Commission will also support Member States or non-governmental organisations to send qualified teams of medical personnel to offer assistance across borders. Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \"EU unity and solidarity are vital in the fight against Coronavirus. Cooperating across borders can make the difference in saving lives by alleviating overstretched health care capacities in Member States. Faced with the greatest crisis in generations, we will leave no stone unturned in our collective response.\" Commissioner Stella Kyriakides, responsible for Health and Food Safety said: \"We can only overcome the coronavirus crisis together. Life-saving cooperation between Member States is key. EU solidarity has been tangible over the past weeks with Member States treating patients from their neighbours, even when stretched themselves. This is the EU at its best, and with our guidance today, we want to encourage more cross-border treatment of patients, more deployment of healthcare staff from EU countries with extra capacity, to where it is needed most. Solidarity saves lives.\" Today's guidelines set out a more coordinated approach to cross-border cooperation on emergency healthcare. The guidelines also outline additional support and assistance to be provided by the Commission to Member States health authorities, in particular by: Coordinating requests for cross-border healthcare assistance through the Health Security Committee , chaired by the Commission, and the EU Early Warning and Response System. Such requests could cover for instance intensive care places, treatment and transfer of patients or qualified teams of medical personnel. The Commission will closely monitor these requests and the assistance available in the Member States. Supporting health authorities requesting assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The Mechanism allows the Commission to coordinate and co-fund the emergency cross border transport of patients and qualified teams of medical personnel. Setting out arrangements for patient mobility across borders and clarifying the steps to be taken for the reimbursement of healthcare costs of cross-border treatment in compliance with the Social Security Coordination Regulations. Encouraging the deployment of qualified teams of medical personnel across borders. The Commission also encourages local, regional and national health authorities to use existing bi-lateral and regional agreements and clarify the mutual recognition of professional medical qualifications. Operating a Clinical Management Support System to support healthcare professionals to share knowledge and expertise. The system provides a Web conferencing platform that allow clinicians to exchange knowledge, discuss, and share clinical cases across the EU.* In addition, regarding financial assistance for cross-border healthcare cooperation, the Commission has also extended the Solidarity Fund to cover public health emergencies. Moreover, health expenditure is eligible under the Structural Funds and further flexibility to shift funds was already provided as part of the co-ordinated economic response to the coronavirus outbreak.

The agreement will also end the pending litigation before the Brussels Court. Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides said: \"Today's settlement agreement guarantees the delivery of the remaining 200 million COVID-19 vaccine doses by AstraZeneca to the EU. While this week we reached the important milestone of 70% full vaccination of the EU's adult population, there are significant differences in vaccination rates between our Member States, and the continued availability of vaccines, including AstraZeneca's, remain crucial. And as the strongest supporter of global vaccine cooperation and solidarity, we will continue helping the rest of the world. Our aim is to share at least 200 million doses of vaccines through COVAX with low and middle-income countries until the end of this year. Vaccine solidarity is and remains our trademark.\" This settlement agreement provides for the firm commitment by AstraZeneca to deliver, in addition to the around 100 million doses delivered until end of Q2, 135 million doses by the end of 2021 (60 million doses by the end of Q3 and 75 million doses by the end of Q4) and the remaining doses (65 million) by the end of March 2022.This will bring the total number of doses delivered to 300 million doses as agreed under the contract. Member States will be provided with regular delivery schedules and capped rebates will apply in the event of any delayed doses. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements . In view of the current and new escape SARS-CoV-2 variants, the Commission and the Member States are negotiating with companies already in the EU vaccine portfolio new agreements that would allow to purchase rapidly adapted vaccines in sufficient quantities to reinforce and prolong immunity. In order to purchase the new vaccines, Member States are allowed to use the REACT-EU package, one of the largest programmes under the new instrument Next Generation EU that continues and extends the crisis response and crisis repair measures.

The initiative will help create an enabling environment for local vaccines manufacturing in Africa and tackle barriers on both supply and demand sides, backed by 1 billion from the EU budget and the European development finance institutions such as the European Investment Bank (EIB). This amount will be further enhanced by contributions from EU Member States. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \" Local health capacities and institutions are the foundation of global health, but today Africa imports 99% of its vaccines and 94% of its medicines. This has to change. Team Europe will support Africa with over 1 billion and expertise to help develop its own pharmaceutical, biotech and medtech industries, and ease equitable access to quality and safe products and technologies. The Initiative will also help develop a number of regional manufacturing hubs across the continent, so that the whole of Africa can benefit.\" Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen , said: \" The Team Europe initiative will contribute to our African partners' efforts to improve access to affordable, life-saving health products, advance universal health coverage, and strengthen health systems. It will also boost skills and help create jobs and opportunities for Africa's younger generations. Born from a key lesson learnt from this pandemic, this initiative incarnates the spirit of solidarity and mutually beneficial partnerships that the EU promotes.\" Tackling COVID-19 and preparing for the next pandemic The world now has safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19. Team Europe's immediate priority therefore remains to support and accelerate vaccination campaigns in partner countries, primarily through support to COVAX, vaccine-sharing, and addressing logistical gaps and developing the capacity of health authorities and workers. COVID-19 has highlighted an underlying structural problem: the wide discrepancy in manufacturing capacities worldwide. Europe for example has been able to manufacture 400 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far, and to export half of them. At the same time, the crisis has shown the importance of diversifying global value chains, and opens a window of opportunity for Africa and Europe. African leaders have called for boosting pharmaceutical production in Africa, and Team Europe is responding to this call to support the continent in building its own strong manufacturing and production capacities. The new initiative will complement existing efforts within the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, notably the COVAX Manufacturing Task Force. A 360initiative, with support in the short, medium, and long term The Team Europe initiative is an integrated and comprehensive support package that will tackle barriers to manufacturing and access to health products and technologies in Africa from all angles, and will place the continent's own actors and institutions at its heart. On the supply side , together with the EIB and development banks, the initiative will incentivise and de-risk investment into local pharmaceutical and biotech companies. For example, the European Commission and the EIB are announcing today a coordination platform for European development banks to facilitate investment in the health sector in Africa. The Team Europe initiative will support technology transfer and develop a number of regional manufacturing hubs in alignment with the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) which recently launched the Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing. Together with several African and international counterparts, the Commission is already actively engaging in promising projects in South Africa, Senegal, Egypt, Morocco and Rwanda. On the demand side , the initiative will work with African leaders and communities to tackle the fragmentation of local markets and help consolidate demand, facilitate market integration and the use of locally produced goods. The initiative will greatly strengthen pharmaceutical and health systems, thus creating an enabling environment for sustainability. It will contribute to developing human resources by investing in skills and education, by increasing African research capacities, and by enhancing scientific cooperation between the two continents. The initiative will also address the problem of falsified products and boost confidence in local goods by strengthening regulatory frameworks. In this context, the future African Medicines Agency (AMA) can count on the European Medicines Agency. The European Commission is also willing to support digital solutions, for example to trace vaccines and medicines across the supply chain. This specific Team Europe initiative will be further backed up by other national, regional and global health initiatives supported by Global Europe. The Commission is keen to underpin health systems and promote health security and pandemic preparedness. Next steps Work has already begun to make these commitments a reality. The Commission has been engaged for a number of months with African partners, EU Member States, the EIB, European development finance institutions, and the private sector. A number of EU Member States have indicated their interest to join this Team Europe initiative. The comprehensive strategy and operational steps will be prepared in close collaboration with African partners. Team Europe will work intensively during this year to prepare first announcements at the next EU-Africa summit.

This includes a pledge of 1.4 billion by the Commission. This almost reaches the initial target of 7.5 billion and is a solid starting point for the worldwide pledging marathon, which begins today. The aim is to gather significant funding to ensure the collaborative development and universal deployment of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \"Today the world showed extraordinary unity for the common good. Governments and global health organisations joined forces against coronavirus. With such commitment, we are on track for developing, producing and deploying a vaccine for all. However, this is only the beginning. We need to sustain the effort and to stand ready to contribute more. The pledging marathon will continue. After governments, civil society and people worldwide need to join in, in a global mobilisation of hope and resolve.\" The pledging event was co-convened by the European Union, Canada, France, Germany, Italy (also incoming G20 presidency), Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (also holding the G20 presidency), Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. The initiative is a response to the call from the World Health Organization (WHO) and a group of health actors for a global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global access to new coronavirus essential health technologies. The Coronavirus Global Response Initiative is comprised of three partnerships for testing, treating and preventing underpinned by health systems strengthening. An ongoing pledging marathon Today is an extraordinary achievement but also the start of a process to mobilise more resources. The initial target of 7.5 billion will not be enough to ensure the distribution of coronavirus health technologies worldwide, as this involves significant costs in terms of production, procurement and distribution. To help reach the objectives of the Coronavirus Global Response, the European Commission is committing 1 billion in grants and 400 million in guarantees on loans through reprioritisation of Horizon 2020 (1 billion), RescEU (80 million), the Emergency Support Instrument (150 million) and external instruments (170 million). 100 million will be donated to CEPI and 158 million to the World Health Organization. EU-funded calls for proposals and subsequent projects under Horizon 2020 will be aligned with the objectives of the three partnerships and subject to open access to data. Funding under RescEU will go towards the procurement, stockpiling and distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Donors are invited to continue pledging to the Coronavirus Global Response. They can choose which priority to donate to Test, Treat or Prevent. They can also donate to the horizontal work stream of the Coronavirus Global Response, aiming to help health systems in the world cope with the pandemic. The Commission will soon announce the breakdown of the amount raised today and how much will go to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and health systems strengthening related to COVID-19. A cooperation framework to align global efforts A universal and affordable Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT-Accelerator) was the main objective of the 24 April call to action from global health partners. For this, significant funding is needed, as well as a solid collaborative structure, with a clarity of purpose to ensure that the donated money is put to good use and to avoid fragmentation of efforts. Based on discussions with public and private sector partners as well as non-profit organisations, the European Commission proposes a collaborative framework for the ACT-accelerator global response. This framework is designed as a coordination structure to steer and oversee progress made globally in accelerating work on developing vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics with universal access as well as strengthening health systems as required for meeting these three priorities. This collaboration framework is intended to be time-bound (2 years, renewable) and build on existing organisations without creating any new structures. In the European Commission's view, it would bring together partners like the WHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and some of the initial convenor countries as well as many recognised global health actors such as CEPI, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund or UNITAID. The core of the framework would be three partnerships based on the three priorities of the Coronavirus Global Response. They gather industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations, with a \"whole-value-chain\" approach: from research to manufacturing and deployment. The three partnerships would work as autonomously as possible, with a transversal work stream on enhancing the capacity of health systems and knowledge and data sharing. The Commission registers and keeps track of pledges up until end of May but will not receive any payments into its accounts. Funds go directly to the recipients. Recipients will, however, not decide alone on the use of the donation, but deploy it in concertation with the partnership.The commitment is for all new vaccines, diagnostics and treatments against coronavirus to be made available globally for an affordable price, regardless of where they were developed. Next steps The global response must also include civil society, and the global community of citizens. For that reason, the European Commission is joining forces with NGOs such as Global Citizen and other partners. The Global Vaccines Summit that Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will organise on 4 June will mobilise additional funding to protect the next generation with vaccines. As the world relies on Gavi's work for making vaccination available everywhere, the success of Gavi's replenishment will be crucial to the success of the Coronavirus Global Response. Background The Coronavirus Global Response builds on the commitment made by G20 leaders on 26 March. Grounded in a vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of the coronavirus, an initial group of global health actors launched a call to action for global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global access to new coronavirus essential health technologies. On 24 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) and an initial group of health actors launched a collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global Access to COVID-19 Tools the ACT Accelerator. Together, they issued a call to action . The European Commission responded to this call by joining forces with global partners to host a pledging event the Coronavirus Global Response Initiative as of 4 May 2020. Funding, including the EU contribution, pledged since 30 January 2020 the date when the WHO declared coronavirus a global health emergency will be counted as part of the Coronavirus Global Response funding target with the commitment that these will contribute to and align with the ACT-Accelerator framework.

This is an important step towards the EU disbursing 69.5 billion in grants under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) over the period 2021-2026. This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Spain's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Spain to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF at the heart of NextGenerationEU will provide up to 672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Commission assessed Spain's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms set out in Spain's plan contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the context of the European Semester; contain measures that effectively support the green and digital transitions; and contribute to strengthening the growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience of the Member State. Securing Spain's green and digital transition The Commission's assessment finds that Spain's plan devotes 40% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes measures to promote urban and long-distance sustainable mobility, increase the energy efficiency of buildings, decarbonise industry and reduce energy dependency, as well as to deploy new technologies for green hydrogen and renewables. The plan also includes measures to help mitigate the adverse effects of climate change by preserving coastal spaces, ecosystems and biodiversity and promote the circular economy by improving water and waste management. The Commission finds that Spain's plan devotes 28% of its total allocation to the digital transition. This includes measures on the digitalisation of the public administration, industry and business, including a specific programme for the digitalisation of SMEs. There are also investments in digital equipment for education and improving digital skills. Reinforcing Spain's economic and social resilience The Commission's assessment considers that Spain's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations (CSRs) addressed to Spain by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures in the areas of employment to reduce labour market segmentation and enhance active labour market policies. It also includes measures in the area of education and skills, as well as social policies, including support to the health system's resilience and capacity. The plan addresses, to a large extent, CSRs in the areas of investment in the green and digital transition, research, development and innovation, clean and efficient production and use of energy, energy infrastructure, water and waste management and sustainable transport. There are also measures to enhance the business climate, with important actions planned in better regulation, the reduction of late payments, and the reform of the insolvency framework and public procurement. The plan also addresses the CSR in the area of public finances, including reforms of the spending review system, the tax system and the pension system. The Spanish recovery and resilience plan contributes in a comprehensive and adequately balanced manner to all six pillars of the Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects Spain's plan proposes projects in all seven European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the twin transition. For instance, Spain's plan includes 6.1 billion to invest in clean technologies and accelerate the development and use of renewables. The plan envisages 7.8 billion to improve the energy efficiency of public and private buildings. Other measures support the European Flagship Recharge and Refuel by investing in recharging and boosting electric vehicle infrastructure and promoting sustainable mobility. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan do any significant harm to the environment. The controls systems put in place by Spain are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said: President Ursula von der Leyen said: \" I am delighted to present the European Commission's positive assessment of Spain's 69.5 billion recovery and resilience plan. This plan will deeply transform Spain's economy, make it greener, more digital, more resilient. We have endorsed this plan because it is ambitious, far-sighted and will help build a better future for the Spanish people. The strong national ownership of the plan bodes well for its successful implementation .\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" Spain's recovery plan sets an ambitious roadmap to boost the country's economic performance and to reinforce its social cohesion, using 69.5 billion in EU grants to deliver a broad set of reforms and investments. The plan places a welcome focus on jobs creation and on the next generation, with measures to address youth unemployment, enhance the provision of skills relevant for the labour market and improve the business environment and public administration. It will put in place large-scale investments to help citizens, businesses, firms and the public administration embrace the digital and green and transitions. I also congratulate Spain for proposing projects in all areas of common European interest such as clean power, sustainable transport or digital connectivity. We will now work with the Spanish authorities to ensure the plan is fully implemented .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" Today marks an important milestone for Spain after such an immensely difficult period. The completion of our assessment brings Spain's recovery and resilience plan a big step closer to implementation. With its strong focus on the green and digital transitions and its comprehensive programme of reforms and investments, the Spanish plan is as ambitious as the situation demands. This is a unique opportunity not only to strengthen the country's recovery from the pandemic but to build an economy that is more socially just, more sustainable and more dynamic. In short, an economy that better serves all segments of Spanish society .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a decision to provide 69.5 billion in grants to Spain under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 9 billion to Spain in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Spain. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

This is an important step towards the EU disbursing 69.5 billion in grants under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) over the period 2021-2026. This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Spain's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Spain to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF at the heart of NextGenerationEU will provide up to 672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Commission assessed Spain's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms set out in Spain's plan contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the context of the European Semester; contain measures that effectively support the green and digital transitions; and contribute to strengthening the growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience of the Member State. Securing Spain's green and digital transition The Commission's assessment finds that Spain's plan devotes 40% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes measures to promote urban and long-distance sustainable mobility, increase the energy efficiency of buildings, decarbonise industry and reduce energy dependency, as well as to deploy new technologies for green hydrogen and renewables. The plan also includes measures to help mitigate the adverse effects of climate change by preserving coastal spaces, ecosystems and biodiversity and promote the circular economy by improving water and waste management. The Commission finds that Spain's plan devotes 28% of its total allocation to the digital transition. This includes measures on the digitalisation of the public administration, industry and business, including a specific programme for the digitalisation of SMEs. There are also investments in digital equipment for education and improving digital skills. Reinforcing Spain's economic and social resilience The Commission's assessment considers that Spain's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations (CSRs) addressed to Spain by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures in the areas of employment to reduce labour market segmentation and enhance active labour market policies. It also includes measures in the area of education and skills, as well as social policies, including support to the health system's resilience and capacity. The plan addresses, to a large extent, CSRs in the areas of investment in the green and digital transition, research, development and innovation, clean and efficient production and use of energy, energy infrastructure, water and waste management and sustainable transport. There are also measures to enhance the business climate, with important actions planned in better regulation, the reduction of late payments, and the reform of the insolvency framework and public procurement. The plan also addresses the CSR in the area of public finances, including reforms of the spending review system, the tax system and the pension system. The Spanish recovery and resilience plan contributes in a comprehensive and adequately balanced manner to all six pillars of the Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects Spain's plan proposes projects in all seven European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the twin transition. For instance, Spain's plan includes 6.1 billion to invest in clean technologies and accelerate the development and use of renewables. The plan envisages 7.8 billion to improve the energy efficiency of public and private buildings. Other measures support the European Flagship Recharge and Refuel by investing in recharging and boosting electric vehicle infrastructure and promoting sustainable mobility. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan do any significant harm to the environment. The controls systems put in place by Spain are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds.

The issuing consisted of two bonds, with 10 billion due for repayment in October 2030 and 7 billion due for repayment in 2040. There was very strong investor interest in this highly rated instrument, and the bonds were more than 13 times oversubscribed, resulting in favourable pricing terms for both bonds. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: \"For the first time in history, the Commission is issuing social bonds on the market, to raise money that will help keep people in jobs. This unprecedented step matches the extraordinary times we are living in. We are sparing no efforts to safeguard livelihoods in Europe. I'm glad that countries hit badly by the crisis will receive support under SURE rapidly.\" European Commissioner Johannes Hahn in charge of Budget and Administration said: \"With this operation, the European Commission has made a first step towards entering the major league in global debt capital markets. The strong investor interest and the favourable conditions under which the bond was placed are further proof of the great interest in EU bonds. The \"social bond\" character of the issuance has helped to attract investors who wish to help EU Member States in supporting employment through these difficult times.\" Both bonds were issued on attractive terms, reflecting the high level of interest. The 10-year bond was priced at 3 basis points above mid-swaps. The 20-year bond was priced at 14 basis points over mid-swaps. The final new issue premiums have been estimated at 1 bps and 2 bps for the 10-year and 20-year tranches respectively, both values being extremely limited given the amounts printed. These represent attractive pricing conditions for the Commission's largest ever bond issuance and a favourable debut for the SURE programme. The terms on which the Commission borrows are passed on directly to the Member States receiving the loans. (See here for more details on the pricing of the transaction). The banks that supported the European Commission with this transaction (\"joint bookrunners\") were Barclays (IRL), BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Nomura and UniCredit. The funds raised will be transferred to the beneficiary Member States in the form of loans to help them cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes and similar measures as a response to the pandemic. In that context, the Commission announced earlier this month that it would issue the entire EU SURE bond of up to 100 billion as social bonds, and adopted an independently evaluated Social Bond Framework . Background on SURE So far, 17 Member States will receive financial support under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. Financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States. These loans will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the pandemic, in particular for the self-employed. SURE could also finance some health-related measures, in particular at the work place, used to ensure a safe return to normal economic activity. Member States can still submit formal requests for support under SURE, which has an overall firepower of up to 100 billion to help protect jobs and workers affected by the pandemic. The Commission has already proposed a total of 87.8 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States. Background on the EU borrowing The EU was established by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and is 0% risk weighed as an issuer (Basel III). The EU's borrowings are direct and unconditional obligations of the EU, guaranteed by the EU Member States through the EU budget. The European Commission is empowered by the EU Treaty to borrow on the international capital markets, on behalf of the European Union. The EU borrows exclusively in Euros for on-lending in Euros to sovereign borrowers. The EU currently operates four loan programmes: The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (\"EFSM\"), the Balance of Payments facility (\"BoP\"), the Macro-Financial Assistance (\"MFA\") and the Support to mitigate Unemployment Risk in an Emergency (SURE), recently adopted by the Council on 19 May 2020. The bonds issued by the EU under SURE will benefit from a social bond label. Further details on the issuance: Ahead of the transaction, the EU sent a Request for Proposal (RfP) to 20 banks on 9 October 2020 informing them of its intention to raise significant amounts in the market. The formal mandate for a dual tranche issue was announced on Monday, 19 October at 13:25 CET. Books were opened on Tuesday, 20 October 2020 in the morning at 08:55 CET and closed at 10:00 CET.

Given that the health situation in certain third countries remains critical, the Commission does not propose a general lifting of the travel restriction at this stage. The restriction should be lifted for countries selected together by Member States, based on a set of principles and objective criteria including the health situation, the ability to apply containment measures during travel, and reciprocity considerations, taking into account data from relevant sources such as ECDC and WHO. For countries towards which the restriction remains in place, the Commission proposes to enlarge the categories of permitted travellers to include, for instance, international students. The Commission is also issuing guidance to Member States to ensure that the resumption of visa operations abroad is well coordinated with the gradual lifting of the travel restrictions. Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson ,said: \" Following the lifting of all internal border checks inside the Union, we are proposing a clear and flexible approach towards removing r estrictions on travel to the EU starting on 1 July. International travel is key for tourism and business, and for family and friends reconnecting. While we will all have to remain careful, the time has come to make concrete preparations for lifting restrictions with countries whose health situation is similar to the EU's and for resuming visa operations.\" Gradually removing restrictions on travel to the EU Actions at the EU's external borders must be coordinated and uniform to be effective. As travellers entering the EU can move freely from one country to another, it is crucial that Member States coordinate their decisions on lifting travel restrictions. This is why Member States should agree on a common list of non-EU countries for which travel restrictions can be lifted as of 1 July, to be reviewed on a regular basis. To this end, the Commission proposes: Objective criteria : The decision to lift restrictions for a specific country should be based on the epidemiological situation and coronavirus response in that country, the ability to apply containment measures during travel, and whether or not that country has lifted travel restrictions towards the EU. Restrictions should be lifted first with countries whose epidemiological situation is similar to the EU average and where sufficient capabilities to deal with the virus are in place. Restrictions should remain in place for countries whose situation is worse than in the EU. The Commission proposes a detailed checklist to help Member States reach a common assessment. Decisions on lifting travel restrictions would concern non-EU nationals residing in a specific country (not its nationals). Common and coordinated approach : The Commission proposes a coordination mechanism whereby it would support Member States and Schengen Associated States at technical level and facilitate the preparation of a list of countries for which travel restrictions could be lifted. Decisions on lifting restrictions should then be prepared with Member States under the EU's integrated political crisis response mechanism. Member States should adopt such decisions in a coordinated manner and ensure uniform application across the EU. This will be a dynamic process and the integrated political crisis response mechanism would need to coordinate further updates. Flexibility : It will be possible to reintroduce travel restrictions for a specific country if the criteria are no longer met. In addition, Member States can still refuse entry to a non-EU traveller presenting a threat to public health, even coming from a country for which restrictions were lifted. In line with the proposed checklist, the Commission also recommends to lift travel restrictions for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia as of 1 July, given that their epidemiological situation is similar or better than that of the EU. This also follows on the Commission's readiness to closely associate the Western Balkans region with the implementation of the roadmap towards lifting containment measures. Where the travel restrictions continue to apply, Member States should ensure that those travelling to study are exempted, together with highly skilled non-EU workers if their employment is necessary from an economic perspective and the work cannot be postponed or performed abroad. EU citizens and citizens of Schengen Associated States and non-EU nationals legally residing in the EU, as well as their family members, should also be exempt from the travel restriction regardless of whether or not they are returning home, as was the case until now. In the roadmap on lifting containment measures presented on 15 April, the Commission indicated that travel restrictions within the EU would need to start being lifted gradually before restrictions at the external borders can be relaxed in a second stage. This is now well under way, with several Member States having already lifted restrictions within the EU and others planning to do so as of 15 June 2020. The Commission strongly encourages the remaining Member States to finalise the process of removing restrictions to free movement and lifting internal border controls within the EU by 15 June 2020 . Resuming visa operations Most Member States decided to suspend or reduce the processing of visa applications as part of pandemic-related measures. Travellers will need to be able to access visa services again and Member States should synchronise the resumption of visa operations with the lifting of travel restrictions. This is why today the Commission presents guidance for a phased and coordinated return of visa operations to normal. A harmonised approach is best achieved through consulates simultaneously resuming operations in each location and through full implementation of EU visa rules , together with good communication towards the public. The guidance also covers hygiene measures and precautions for receiving visa applicants. Finally, if a Member State requires health checks, these should take place at the time of travel or shortly before, rather than when applying for a visa; and should apply to all travellers from a given location irrespective of their nationality or visa status. Background The Commission invited Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days, subsequently extending it twice until 15 June . The travel restriction, as well as today's invitation to prolong it until 30 June, applies to all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) 30 countries in total. All these countries implement it through national law. Nationals of 105 countries are required to obtain a visa before travelling to the EU. Visa applications can usually be submitted at Member States' consulates in almost all non-EU countries around the world. The EU's visa policy for short stays is applied fully by 26 Schengen Member States and, in normal times, results in 15 million visas being issued each year.

Background The Commission invited Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days, subsequently extending it twice until 15 June . The travel restriction, as well as today's invitation to prolong it until 30 June, applies to all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) 30 countries in total. All these countries implement it through national law. Nationals of 105 countries are required to obtain a visa before travelling to the EU. Visa applications can usually be submitted at Member States' consulates in almost all non-EU countries around the world. The EU's visa policy for short stays is applied fully by 26 Schengen Member States and, in normal times, results in 15 million visas being issued each year.

The Commission's guidance aims to offer people the chance to get some well-needed rest, relaxation and fresh air. As soon as the health situation allows, people should be able to catch up with friends and family, in their own EU country or across borders, with all the safety and precautionary measures needed in place. The package also aims to help the EU tourism sector recover from the pandemic, by supporting businesses and ensuring that Europe continues to be the number one destination for visitors. The Commission's Tourism and Transport package includes: An overall strategy towards recovery in 2020 and beyond; A common approach to restoring free movement and lifting restrictions at EU internal borders in a gradual and coordinated way ; A framework to support the gradual re-establishment of transport whilst ensuring the safety of passengers and personnel ; A recommendation which aims to make travel vouchers an attractive alternative to cash reimbursement for consumers ; Criteria for restoring tourism activities safely and gradually and for developing health protocols for hospitality establishments such as hotels . For tourists and travellers T he Commission is looking to give people the ability, confidence and safety to travel again with the following measures: Safely restoring freedom of movement and lifting internal border controls : Free movement and cross-border travel are key to tourism. As Member States manage to reduce the circulation of the virus, blanket restrictions to free movement should be replaced by more targeted measures. If a generalised lifting of restrictions is not justified by the health situation, the Commission proposes a phased and coordinated approach that starts by lifting restrictions between areas or Member States with sufficiently similar epidemiological situations. The approach must also be flexible, including the possibility to reintroduce certain measures if the epidemiological situation requires. Member States should act on the basis of the following 3 criteria: epidemiological , notably focusing on areas where situation is improving, based on guidance by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and using the regional map developed by the ECDC ; the ability to apply containment measures throughout the whole journey including at border crossings, including additional safeguards and measures where physical distancing may be difficult to ensure and economic and social considerations, initially prioritising cross-border movement in key areas of activity and including personal reasons. The principle of non-discrimination is of particular importance: when a Member State decides to allow travel into its territory or to specific regions and areas within its territory, it should do so in a non-discriminatory manner allowing travel from all areas, regions or countries in the EU with similar epidemiological conditions. In the same vein, any restrictions must be lifted without discrimination, to all EU citizens and to all residents of that Member State regardless of their nationality, and should be applied to all parts of the Union in a similar epidemiological situation. Restoring transport services across the EU while protecting the health of transport workers and passengers: The guidelines present general principles for the safe and gradual restoration of passenger transport by air, rail, road and waterways. The guidelines put forth a series of recommendations, such as the need to limit contact between passengers and transport workers, and passengers themselves, reducing, where feasible, the density of passengers. The guidelines also include indications on the use of personal protective equipment such as face masks and on adequate protocols in case passengers present coronavirus symptoms. The guidelines also make recommendations for each mode of transport and call for coordination among Member States in light of re-establishment of gradual connections between them. Safely resuming tourism services: The Commission sets out a common framework providing criteria to safely and gradually restore tourism activities and developing health protocols for hotels and other forms of accommodation, to protect the health of both guests and employees. These criteria include epidemiological evidence; sufficient health system capacity being in place for local people and tourists; robust surveillance and monitoring and testing capacity and contact tracing. These guidelines will allow people to safely stay at hotels, camping sites, Bed&Breakfasts or other holiday accommodation establishments, eat and drink at restaurants, bars and cafes and go to beaches and other leisure outdoor areas. Ensuring cross-border interoperability of tracing apps: Member States, with the support of the Commission, agreed on guidelines to ensure cross-border interoperability between tracing apps so that citizens can be warned of a potential infection with coronavirus also when they travel in the EU. This will guide developers working with national health authorities. Such tracing apps must be voluntary, transparent, temporary, cybersecure, using anonymised data, should rely on Bluetooth technology and be inter-operable across borders as well as across operating systems. Interoperability is crucial: EU citizens must be able to receive alerts of a possible infection in a secure and protected way, wherever they are in the EU, and whatever app they are using. The Commission is supporting Member States in finding the right solution, in line with the principles set out in the EU toolbox and the Commission guidance on data protection . Making vouchers a more attractive option for consumers: Under EU rules, travellers have the right to choose between vouchers or cash reimbursement for cancelled transport tickets (plane, train, bus\/coach, and ferries) or package travel. While reaffirming this right, the Commission's recommendation aims to ensure that vouchers become a viable and more attractive alternative to reimbursement for cancelled trips in the context of the current pandemic, which has also put heavy financial strains on travel operators. The voluntary vouchers should be protected against insolvency of the issuer, with a minimum validity period of 12 months, and be refundable after at most one year, if not redeemed. They should also provide passengers sufficient flexibility, should allow the passengers to travel on the same route under the same service conditions or the travellers to book a package travel contract with the same type of services or of equivalent quality. They should also be transferable to another traveller. For tourism businesses The Commission aims to support Europe's tourism sector by: Ensuring liquidity for tourism businesses, in particular SMEs, through: o Flexibility under State aid rules allowing Member States to introduce schemes, such as guarantee schemes for vouchers and further liquidity schemes, to support companies in the transport and travel sectors and to ensure that reimbursement claims caused by the coronavirus pandemic are satisfied. The schemes for vouchers can be approved by the Commission very rapidly, upon notification by the Member State concerned . o EU funding: EU continues providing immediate liquidity to businesses affected by the crisis through the Coronavirus Response Instrument Initiative, under shared management with Member States. In addition, the Commission has made available up to 8 billion in financing for 100,000 small businesses hit by the crisis, with the European Investment Fund. Saving jobs with up to 100 billion in financial relief from the SURE programme: The SURE programme helps Member States cover the costs of national short-time work schemes and similar measures allowing companies to safeguard jobs. The Commission also supports partnerships between employment services, social partners and companies to facilitate reskilling, especially for seasonal workers . Connecting citizens to local tourism offer, promoting local attractions and tourism and Europe as a safe tourist destination: The Commission will work with Member States to promote a patronage voucher system under which customers can support their favourite hotels or restaurants. The Commission will also promote pan-European communication campaigns featuring Europe as a number one tourist destination. To complement short-term measures, the Commission will continue to work with Member States to promote sustainable tourism in line with the European Green Deal and encourage a digital transformation of tourism services to offer more choice, better allocation of resources and new ways of managing travel and tourist flows. The Commission will organise a European tourism convention with EU institutions, the industry, regions, cities and other stakeholders to jointly build the future of a sustainable, innovative and resilient European tourism ecosystem the 'European Agenda for Tourism 2050'. Members of the College said : Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas , said: \"Tourism is vital to the Single Market and its four freedoms and a key contributor to the EU's economic, social and cultural way of life. It has also been deeply impacted by the measures needed to contain COVID-19. As our Member States gradually lift restrictive measures, we are putting in place the foundations for rebooting the tourism eco-system and Single Market in a safe, proportionate way that will prevent the resurgence of the virus within the EU, whilst safeguarding our way of life.\" Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton , said: \" Millions of SMEs and family -run businesses working in accommodation, restaurants, passenger transport and travel agencies risk bankruptcies and job losses they urgently need to go back to work. We are helping European tourism get back on track while staying healthy and safe. Today we propose a common European approach to managing what will remain a difficult 2020 summer season, while preparing for a more sustainable and digital tourism ecosystem in the future.\" Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides , said: \" We know how much European citizens are looking forward to summer and to travel. Their huge sacrifices over the past months will make a cautious and gradual reopening possible - for now. But deconfinement and tourism will not be risk free as long as the virus circulates among us. We need to maintain vigilance, physical distancing and rigorous health precautions across the whole tourism and transport ecosystem to prevent further outbreaks as much as possible. We will not allow our efforts to be lost.\" Commissioner for Justice and Consumers, Didier Reynders , said: \" European consumers can be reassured: The Commission will not downgrade their EU rights for reimbursement for cancelled travel. We recommend, however, making vouchers more attractive for those who chose this option. In the meantime, freedom of movement is the right European citizens cherish most. It is important to restore this right as soon as the circumstances allow it .\" Commissioner for Transport, Adina Valean , said: \" We aim to create safe conditions in every mode of transport, to the extent possible, both for people traveling and transport workers. As we re-establish connectivity, these guidelines will provide authorities and stakeholders a standard framework. Our priority is to restore mobility as soon as possible, but only with clear provisions for safety and health. \" BACKGROUND : Europe is home to a vibrant tourism ecosystem. Travel, transport, accommodation, food, recreation or culture, contribute to almost 10% of EU GDP and provide a key source of employment and income in numerous European regions. 267 million Europeans (62% of the population) make at least one private leisure trip per year and 78% of Europeans spend their holidays in their home country or another EU country. The tourism ecosystem has also been one of the most affected by the heavy restrictions on movement and travel imposed in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak. The World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) foresees a 60% to 80% reduction in international arrivals, amounting to losses of between 840 and 1.100 billion in export revenues worldwide. In Europe, the summer is a crucial season for tourism:during an average summer season (June-August) residents of the EU make 385 million tourism trips and spend 190 billion. Today's package follows the pathway set by the Joint European Roadmap published by the Commission on 14 April in cooperation with the European Council. The Roadmap provided a gradual approach to phasing-out containment measures introduced due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The objectives of the first Council meeting was to align the plan for ACT-Accelerator as a key global solution to end the crisis and restore health systems and global growth, concur on the economic rationale and investment case for fully financing the ACT-Accelerator, and mobilise political leadership and international support for global equitable allocation. Ursula von der Leyen , President of the European Commission, said: \" Today's launch of the Facilitation Council brings us closer to our global goal: access to coronavirus vaccines, tests and treatments for everyone who needs them, anywhere. The EU will use all its convening power to help keep the world united against coronavirus. With the chairmanship of Norway and South Africa representing the global North and South, and the expertise of the WHO and our international partners, no country or region will be left behind in this fight. \" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , WHO Director-General, said : \"Nearly 5,000 lives are lost each day due to COVID-19 and the global economy is expected to contract by trillions of dollars this year. The case for investing to end the pandemic has never been stronger. The ACT Accelerator is the best way to ensure equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, but at present is facing financing gap of US$35 billion. Fully financing the ACT Accelerator would shorten the pandemic and pay back this investment rapidly as the global economy recovers .\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \" The only way to defeat COVID-19 is together, globally. The only way forward is solidarity, responsibility and global cooperation. Today, we step up our global leadership to accelerate the development and equitable distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. The Facilitation Council will play an instrumental role in delivering on this goal. \" During its first meeting, the Council has adopted a political statement highlighting global collaboration as key to defeat the virus. It stresses the importance of testing, treatment, vaccination and improved health systems to overcome the pandemic. The statement also mentions the progress made and call for additional resources to deliver on the mission. The Facilitation Council is composed by governments and non-governmental partners (BMGF, Wellcome Trust). It is co-chaired by Norway and South Africa, achieving geographical balance. The Council build on what the ACT-A has achieved in only four month, such as more than 200 vaccine candidates, 1700 clinical trials, and 80 diagnostics being followed, as well as 100 countries surveyed to identify capacity gaps. Next steps Final comments on investment case and ACT-A Plan will be forthcoming on 17 September and then the ACT-A high-level event at UNGA will take place on 30 September. Between 15-30 September, there will be UNGA and G20 meetings and this will act to amplify the call to world leaders. Between 12-18 October, World Bank \/ IMF Annual meetings will take place to explore the scale of economic challenge and initial commitments. From November to March 2021, the G20 Summit and other related meetings will react upon the series of commitments. Ultimately, the ACT-A Advocacy Campaign aims to address major political challenges and secure the more than 29 billion (US$35 billion) financing needs. Background Launched at the end of April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator brings together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, and philanthropists and global health organizations (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , CEPI , FIND , Gavi , The Global Fund , Unitaid , Wellcome , the WHO , the World Bank and Global Financing Facility ). It intends to accelerate the development of universally accessible vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics , and the improvement of the necessary health systems. Knowledge and data sharing are key. The ACT will be in place for 2 years (renewable). No new physical structure will be established, but use will be made of the expertise of existing institutions and partners. Three partnerships on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics define the strategy, identify the resources needed and set the accountability rules. They bring together industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations, following a value chain approach, from research to manufacturing and deployment. These partnerships work as autonomously as possible and are supported by a group of governmental and private non-profit partners. ACT-A's goal is to protect health systems and restore societies and economies by accelerating development, equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of 2 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2021, 245 million courses of therapeutics by mid-2021, and 500 million tests by mid-2021. The European Commission is committed in a global solution to the pandemic. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.

Between 12-18 October, World Bank \/ IMF Annual meetings will take place to explore the scale of economic challenge and initial commitments. From November to March 2021, the G20 Summit and other related meetings will react upon the series of commitments. Ultimately, the ACT-A Advocacy Campaign aims to address major political challenges and secure the more than 29 billion (US$35 billion) financing needs. Background Launched at the end of April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator brings together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, and philanthropists and global health organizations (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , CEPI , FIND , Gavi , The Global Fund , Unitaid , Wellcome , the WHO , the World Bank and Global Financing Facility ). It intends to accelerate the development of universally accessible vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics , and the improvement of the necessary health systems. Knowledge and data sharing are key. The ACT will be in place for 2 years (renewable). No new physical structure will be established, but use will be made of the expertise of existing institutions and partners. Three partnerships on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics define the strategy, identify the resources needed and set the accountability rules. They bring together industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations, following a value chain approach, from research to manufacturing and deployment. These partnerships work as autonomously as possible and are supported by a group of governmental and private non-profit partners. ACT-A's goal is to protect health systems and restore societies and economies by accelerating development, equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of 2 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2021, 245 million courses of therapeutics by mid-2021, and 500 million tests by mid-2021. The European Commission is committed in a global solution to the pandemic. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.

On 28 April, the Commission had already proposed a Banking Package to facilitate bank lending to households and businesses throughout the EU. Today's measures aim to make it easier for capital markets to support European businesses to recover from the crisis. The package proposes targeted changes to capital market rules, which will encourage greater investments in the economy, allow for the rapid re-capitalisation of companies and increase banks' capacity to finance the recovery. Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that works for the people said: \" We are continuing with our efforts to help EU citizens and businesses during the coronavirus crisis and the subsequent recovery. One way of doing so is to help businesses raise capital on public markets. Today's targeted amendments will make it easier for our businesses to get the funding they need and to invest in our economy. Capital markets are vital to the recovery, because public financing alone will not be enough to get our economies back on track. We will present a wider Capital Markets Union Action Plan in September .\" The package contains targeted adjustments to the Prospectus Regulation , MiFID II and securitisation rules . All of the amendments are at the heart of the Capital Markets Union project aimed at better integrating national capital markets and ensuring equal access to investments and funding opportunities across the EU. Targeted amendments to the prospectus regime - EU Recovery Prospectus: Easy to produce Easy to read Easy to scrutinise A prospectus is a document that companies need to disclose to their investors when they issue shares and bonds. The Commission is today proposing to create an \"EU Recovery Prospectus\" a type of short-form prospectus for companies that have a track record in the public market. This temporary prospectus would be easy to produce for companies, easy to read for investors, and easy to scrutinise for national competent authorities. It would cut down the length of prospectuses from hundreds of pages to just 30 pages. This will help companies to raise capital such as shares - instead of going deeper into debt. A second set of targeted amendments to the Prospectus Regulation aims at facilitating fundraising by banks that play an essential role in financing the recovery of the real economy. Targeted amendments to the MiFID II requirements for European firms The Commission is today proposing to make some targeted amendments to MiFID II requirements, in order to reduce some of the administrative burdens that experienced investors face in their business-to-business relationships. Lesser-experienced investors (such as households investing their savings for retirement) will remain just as protected as before. These amendments refer to a number of requirements that were already identified (during the MiFID\/MiFIR public consultation) as being overly burdensome or hindering the development of European markets. The current crisis makes it even more important to alleviate unnecessary burdens and provide opportunities to nascent markets. The Commission therefore proposes to recalibrate requirements to ensure that there is a high level of transparency towards the client, while also ensuring the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for European firms. In parallel, the Commission has today opened a public consultation on amendments to the MiFID II delegated directive to increase the research coverage regime for small and mid-cap issuers and for bonds. In particular, SMEs need a good level of investment research to give them enough visibility to attract new investors. We are today also proposing to amend the MiFID rules affecting energy derivatives markets. This is intended to help the development of euro-denominated energy markets important for the international role of the euro as well as allow European companies to cover their risks, while safeguarding the integrity of commodity markets, especially for agricultural products. Targeted amendments to securitisation rules The Commission is today proposing a package of measures amending the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation . Securitisation is a tool through which banks can bundle loans, turn them into securities, and sell them onto capital markets. The aim of these changes is to facilitate the use of securitisation in Europe's recovery by enabling banks to expand their lending and to free their balance sheets of non-performing exposures. It is helpful to let banks transfer some of the risk of SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) loans to the markets so that they can keep lending to SMEs. In particular, the Commission proposes creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised on-balance-sheet securitisation that would benefit from a prudential treatment reflecting the actual riskiness of these instruments. In addition, the Commission proposes to remove existing regulatory obstacles to the securitisation of non-performing exposures. This can help banks offload non-performing exposures that can be expected to grow because of the coronavirus crisis. Today's changes are based on extensive work and analysis carried out by the European Banking Authority in 2019 and 2020.

In October 2001, the European Commission established the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The Mechanism aims to strengthen cooperation between the EU Member States and 6 Participating States on civil protection to improve prevention, preparedness and response to disasters. When an emergency overwhelms the response capabilities of a country in Europe and beyond, it can request assistance through the Mechanism. The European Commission plays a key role in coordinating the disaster response worldwide, contributing to at least 75% of the transport and\/or operational costs of deployments. Why is this important? Disasters know no borders and can hit one or several countries simultaneously without warning. Having a well-coordinated joint response means that when national authorities are overwhelmed, they have one point of contact, rather than multiple to deal with. A joint approach further helps to pool expertise and capacities of first responders, avoids duplication of relief efforts, and ensures that assistance meets the needs of those affected. By pooling together civil protection capacities and capabilities, it allows for a stronger and more coherent collective response. In addition to the EU Member States, there are currently 6 Participating States to the Mechanism (Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Turkey). Since its inception in 2001, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has responded to over 500 requests for assistance inside and outside the EU. The Mechanism also helps to coordinate disaster preparedness and prevention activities of national authorities and contributes to the exchange of best practices. This facilitates the continuous development of higher common standards enabling teams to better understand different approaches and work interchangeably when a disaster strikes. { \"service\": \"share\", \"icon\": true, \"lang\": \"en\", \"to\": [ \"facebook\", \"twitter\", \"googleplus\", \"linkedin\" ], \"selection\": false, \"via\": \"eu_echo\", \"link\": \" } Print How are we helping? Following a request for assistance through the Mechanism, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) mobilises assistance or expertise. The ERCC monitors events around the globe 24\/7 and ensures rapid deployment of emergency support through a direct link with national civil protection authorities. Specialised teams and equipment, such as forest firefighting planes, search and rescue, and medical teams can be mobilised at short notice for deployments inside and outside Europe. Satellite maps produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service also support civil protection operations. Copernicus provides timely and precise geospatial information that is useful to delineate affected areas and plan disaster relief operations. In developing countries, civil protection assistance typically goes hand in hand with EU humanitarian aid. Experts in both fields work closely together to ensure the most coherent analysis and response, particularly in response to complex emergencies. The Mechanism also intervenes in marine pollution emergencies: the Centre can quickly mobilise oil recovery capacity and expertise from the Participating States and European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) . EU Civil Protection in action Any country in the world, but also the United Nations and its agencies or a relevant international organisation, can call on the EU Civil Protection Mechanism for help. In 2020, the Mechanism was activated more than 100 times. For example, to respond to the coronavirus pandemic; the explosion in Beirut in Lebanon; floods in Ukraine, Niger and Sudan; the earthquake in Croatia; and tropical cyclones in Latin America and Asia. A strong EU response in times of crisis As an additional asset to the Mechanism, the EU established a European reserve of additional capacities (the ' rescEU reserve '). The reserve includes firefighting planes and helicopters, and medical equipment. We are currently developing medical evacuation capacities. During COVID-19, the EU has distributed tens of thousands of protective masks, medical gloves and 30 ventilators coming from strategic rescEU distribution centres currently hosted by 9 EU Member States to countries in need. To ensure a better response to future challenges, a new legislation on EU Civil Protection - in force as of May 2021 - gives the EU additional capacities to respond to new risks in Europe and the world and boosts the rescEU reserve. European Civil Protection Pool EU Member States and Participating States may commit national resources for emergency response to the European Civil Protection Pool (ECPP) . This pool allows for better planning and coordination of response activities at European and national levels which means a faster and reliable EU response to disasters. The Pool constitutes the backbone of the Mechanism. Prevention and preparedness Prevention and preparedness activities mitigate the effects of disasters. A training programme for civil protection experts from EU Member States and Participating States ensures compatibility and complementarity between intervention teams, while large-scale exercises train capacities for specific disasters each year. The EU supports and complements prevention and preparedness efforts of its Member States and Participating States by focusing on areas where a joint European approach is more effective than separate national actions. These include risk assessments to identify the disaster risks across the EU, encouraging research to promote disaster resilience and reinforcing early warning tools.

Once the vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the contract allows Member States to purchase vaccines for 200 million people. They will also have the possibility to purchase vaccines for an additional 200 million people. Member States may also decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries. The Commission has already signed a contract with AstraZeneca and with Sanofi-GSK and it concluded successful exploratory talks with CureVac , BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna . President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \"As the coronavirus continues to spread worryingly across Europe, it is crucial to find a vaccine, and fast. I'm glad that we have been able to find an agreement with Johnson & Johnson to purchase vaccines for 200 million people. This will be our third contract with a pharmaceutical company. Our aim is to provide EU citizens with safe and effective vaccines as soon as they are found.\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"Ensuring a safe and effective vaccine is at the core of our European Vaccine Strategy. Today we have secured our third vaccine agreement, expanding our portfolio of vaccine candidates and therefore our chances to find an efficient remedy against the virus. More agreements will follow, and we remain determined in our search for a successful and safe vaccine to combat this deadly pandemic.\" The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the AdVac technology platform, which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen's recently approved Ebola vaccine and the Zika, RSV, and HIV vaccine candidates. The vaccine candidate is already in phase III of clinical trials. The Commission's decision to support this vaccine is based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply the whole of the EU. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements . Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreement will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with 400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.

More agreements will follow, and we remain determined in our search for a successful and safe vaccine to combat this deadly pandemic.\" The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the AdVac technology platform, which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen's recently approved Ebola vaccine and the Zika, RSV, and HIV vaccine candidates. The vaccine candidate is already in phase III of clinical trials. The Commission's decision to support this vaccine is based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply the whole of the EU. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements . Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreement will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with 400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.

BioNTech-Pfizer is the sixth company with which the Commission has concluded talks, following Sanofi-GSK on 31 July, Johnson & Johnson on 13 August, CureVac on 18 August and Moderna on 24 August. The first contract, signed with AstraZeneca , entered into force on 27 August. The envisaged contract with BioNTech-Pfizer would provide for the possibility for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine, as well as to donate to lower and middle income countries or re-direct to European countries. It is anticipated that the Commission will have a contractual framework in place for the initial purchase of 200 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to purchase up to a further 100 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19. Ursula von der Leyen , President of the European Commission, said: \"I am happy to announce that we have concluded talks with BioNTech-Pfizer for an initial purchase of 200 million doses of future coronavirus vaccines. This is the 6th pharma company with which we have concluded talks or signed an agreement for potential vaccines, in record time. Our chances to develop and deploy a safe and effective vaccine have never been higher, both for Europeans here at home, or for the rest of the world. To defeat coronavirus anywhere, we need to defeat it everywhere.\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"Today's final talks with BioNTech-Pfizer is yet another important step in our efforts to build a sound and diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates. This was the objective of our EU Vaccine Strategy, and we are delivering on it. We are optimistic that among these candidates there will be a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 to help us defeat this pandemic.\" BioNTech is a German company working with US-based Pfizer to develop a new vaccine based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in human biology, transferring the instructions which direct cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease. The exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument , which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies. Background Today's conclusion of the exploratory talks with BioNTech and Pfizer is an important step towards the conclusion of an Advance Purchase Agreement, and therefore towards the implementation of the European Vaccines Strategy , adopted by the Commission on 17 June 2020. This strategy aims to secure for all European citizens high-quality, safe, effective and affordable vaccines within 12 to 18 months. To do so, and together with the Member States, the Commission is agreeing Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers reserving or giving the Member States the right to buy a given number of vaccine doses for a certain price, as and when a vaccine becomes available. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.

Background Today's conclusion of the exploratory talks with BioNTech and Pfizer is an important step towards the conclusion of an Advance Purchase Agreement, and therefore towards the implementation of the European Vaccines Strategy , adopted by the Commission on 17 June 2020. This strategy aims to secure for all European citizens high-quality, safe, effective and affordable vaccines within 12 to 18 months. To do so, and together with the Member States, the Commission is agreeing Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers reserving or giving the Member States the right to buy a given number of vaccine doses for a certain price, as and when a vaccine becomes available. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.

To that end, the Commission has adopted an independently evaluated Social Bond Framework . This Framework is meant to provide investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective. This announcement follows the Council's approval to grant financial support to 16 Member States under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and people in work. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said : \"We are not only investing billions of euros to save jobs in Europe and reduce the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but we are also doing it by issuing social bonds. This will give investors the chance to contribute to our efforts and up to 100 billion will help keep people in jobs in our Member States.\" Commissioner Johannes Hahn , in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \"The decision to issue the EU SURE bonds as social bonds will be a game changer for the global social bonds market. At the same time, it is a clear demonstration of the EU's long-term commitment to sustainable financing. I am very excited about today's announcement and looking forward to the forthcoming EU SURE issuance in the very near future.\" The funds raised will be transferred to the beneficiary Member States in the form of loans to help them cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes and similar measures as a response to the pandemic. Today's Framework demonstrates to the investor community how the funds raised by SURE bond issuance will be used for a clearly identified objective: alleviating the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences across the EU. Investors can therefore be confident that their investments in these bonds will be used to finance targeted social policy measures. At the same time, the Commission's Social Bond Framework will contribute to the further development of the social bond market which is one pillar of the European 'Sustainable Finance' market. In order to guarantee that the funds will be used for social purposes, the Social Bond Framework, underpinned by the SURE Regulation, requires Member States to report on how the borrowed funds have been spent. Under the Framework, Member States are also required to report on the social impact of the EU SURE bonds. Based on the information in these reports, the European Commission will be able to demonstrate to investors that the EU SURE bonds have been used to finance programmes with a positive social impact. By preparing and presenting a Social Bond Framework, the Commission seeks to appeal to investors who want to put their funds to work for Environmental, Social and Corporate governance (ESG) purposes. The Commission's Social Bond Framework has been established in full compliance with the Social Bond Principles (SBP) published by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). It has been independently evaluated by an external evaluator, Sustainalytics. Following today's announcement, the Commission is moving one step closer towards the issuance of the first SURE bonds. The first transaction will follow in the second half of October. Background So far, 16 Member States will receive financial support under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. Financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States. The Commission has today presented a proposal to the Council for a decision to grant 504 million in financial support to Hungary under the SURE instrument. Including Hungary, the Commission has now proposed a total of 87.8 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States. These loans will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the pandemic, in particular for the self-employed. SURE could also finance some health-related measures, in particular at the work place, used to ensure a safe return to normal economic activity. Member States can still submit formal requests for support under SURE, which has an overall firepower of up to 100 billion to help protect jobs and workers affected by the pandemic.

Today's contract with CureVac enlarges the already broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the contracts signed with AstraZeneca , Sanofi-GSK , Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and BioNtech-Pfize r, and the successful exploratory talks with Moderna . This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective. Member States can also decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \" A few days after our contract with BioNTech and Pfizer, I am delighted to announce a new agreement with a promising European company. The Commission has secured to date at least 1.2 billion doses and fulfils its commitment to ensuring equitable access to safe, effective and affordable vaccines not only for EU citizens but also for the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. Most of these vaccine candidates are in an advanced phase of clinical trials, hopefully authorisation will confirm these positive results, after which they will be quickly deployed and help us in overcoming the pandemic. \" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"With growing numbers of COVID patients across the EU, a safe and effective vaccine is more crucial than ever in putting behind us the pandemic. With this fifth vaccine advance purchase agreement, we are further expanding the possibilities that EU citizens and our economies can soon safely return to normality. It is yet another milestone in our EU Vaccines Strategy, and evidence of the benefits of working together in a genuine European Health Union.\" CureVac, a European company based in Germany, signed a 75 million loan agreement with the European Investment Bank on 6 July for the development and large-scale production of vaccines, including CureVac's vaccine candidate against COVID-19. CureVac is pioneering the development of a completely new class of vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA), transported into cells by lipid nanoparticles. The vaccine platform has been developed over the last decade. The basic principle is the use of this molecule as a data carrier for information, with the help of which the body itself can produce its own active substances to combat various diseases. The Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply the whole of the EU. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements . Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen. Once vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with 400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response. On 12 November, the European Union announced the contribution of an additional 100 million in grant funding to support the COVAX Facility.

On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with 400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response. On 12 November, the European Union announced the contribution of an additional 100 million in grant funding to support the COVAX Facility.

The EU agri-food sector is showing resilience in these unprecedented times, following the outbreak of the coronavirus. Still, some markets have been hit hard by the consequences of this public health crisis. Today's package includes measures for private storage aid (PSA) in the dairy and meat sectors, the authorisation of self-organisation market measures by operators in hard hit sectors and flexibility in fruits and vegetables, wine and some other market support programmes . Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski said: \" The consequences of the coronavirus crisis are increasingly being felt in the agri-food sector and this is why we have decided to take swift action, in addition to the measures already taken since the outbreak of the crisis. The measures proposed are, in the present state of market developments, intended to send a signal aimed at stabilising markets and are considered to be the most appropriate for providing stability to future prices and production and thus stable food supplies and food security. Today we are announcing a new and exceptional package of measures to support the most affected agri-food sectors by addressing already observed disturbances as well as future risks. I am confident that these measures will relieve markets, and show concrete results rapidly.\" Exceptional measures announced as a further response to the Coronavirus crisis include: Private storage aid : the Commission proposes to grant private storage aid for dairy (skimmed milk powder, butter, cheese) and meat (beef, sheep and goat meat) products. This scheme will allow the temporary withdrawal of products from the market for a minimum of 2 to 3 months, and a maximum period of 5 to 6 months. This measure will lead to a decrease of available supply on the market and rebalance the market on the long-term. Flexibility for market support programmes : the Commission will introduce flexibility in the implementation of market support programmes for wine, fruits and vegetables, olive oil, apiculture and the EU's school scheme (milk, fruits and vegetables). This will allow the reorientation of funding priorities towards crisis management measures for all the sectors. Exceptional derogation from EU competition rules : applicable to the milk, flowers and potatoes sectors, the Commission will authorise the derogation from certain competition rules under Article 222 of the Common Markets Organisation Regulation , that allows operators to adopt self-organisation market measures. Concretely, these sectors will be allowed to collectively take measures to stabilise the market. For example, the milk sector will be allowed to collectively plan milk production and the flower and potatoes sector will be allowed to withdraw products from the market. Storage by private operators will also be allowed. Such agreements and decisions would only be valid for a period of maximum six months. Consumer price movements will be monitored closely to avoid adverse effects. The Commission aims to have these measures adopted by the end of April. Beforehand Member States will need to be consulted, and vote on these measures. They are therefore subject to change. The full detail of these proposals will be unveiled at the time of their final adoption. The package announced today follows a comprehensive package of other measures adopted early on by the Commission to support the agri-food sector in the current crisis, such as increased amounts for state aid, higher advanced payments, and extended deadlines to submit payment requests. The increased flexibility regarding Common Agricultural Policy rules aims to alleviate the administrative burden on farmers and national administrations.

Veklury was the first medicine authorised at EU level for treatment of COVID-19. As from early August onwards, and in order to meet immediate needs, batches of Veklury will be made available to Member States and the UK, with the coordination and support of the Commission. Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \" In recent weeks, the Commission has been working tirelessly with Gilead to reach an agreement to ensure that stocks of the first treatment authorised against COVID-19 are delivered to the EU. A contract has been signed yesterday, less than a month after the authorisation of Remdesivir, which will allow the delivery of treatments from early August for thousands of patients. The Commission is leaving no stone unturned in its efforts to secure access to safe and efficient treatments, and is supporting the development of vaccines against coronavirus. Yesterday's agreement is another important step forward in our fight to overcome this disease \". The Commission's Emergency Support Instrument will finance the contract, worth a total of 63 million. This will ensure the treatment of approximately 30,000 patients presenting severe COVID-19 symptoms. This will help to cover the current needs over the next few months, while ensuring a fair distribution at EU level, based on an allocation key, taking into account the advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The Commission is now also preparing a joint procurement for further supplies of the medicine, expected to cover additional needs and supplies as from October onwards. Background On 3 July, Remdesivir became the first treatment to be authorised for a conditional marketing authorisation. This authorisation facilitates early access to medicines in public health emergency situations, such as the current pandemic. Remdesivir is a treatment against COVID-19 for adults and adolescents as from age 12 with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen. The application for the marketing authorisation was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 8 June. EMA's recommendation was endorsed by the Member States through the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. While authorised in the EU, the medicine continues to be monitored to ensure safety. Gilead has also been requested to submit the final reports of the Remdesivir studies to the EMA by December 2020 as part of the conditions to be fulfilled to move from a conditional marketing authorisation to a full marketing authorisation. Further data on the effectiveness and safety of the medicine is expected to be submitted by August 2020 in order to finalise this process.

The offers of support from EU Member States via the Mechanism currently include: Ireland: 700 oxygen concentrators; 1 oxygen generator; 365 ventilators; Belgium: 9,000 doses of antiviral medicines Remdesivir; Romania: 80 oxygen concentrators and 75 oxygen cylinders; Luxembourg: 58 ventilators; Portugal: 5,503 vials of Remdesivir; 20,000 litres of oxygen per week. Sweden 120 ventilators. This support has been made in line with the coordinated effort by EU Member States currently underway to pool their resources in responding rapidly to tackle the alarming epidemiological situation in India. More EU support from other Member States is expected to be given in the coming days, including from France and Germany. Janez Lenarcic , Commissioner for Crisis Management said: \" The EU stands in full solidarity with the Indian people and is ready to do our utmost to support them at this critical time. I would like to thank our Member States that came in numerously with generous offers of help, showing that the EU is a trusted partner and a friend at times of need. The reach of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism goes well beyond the EU's borders. Our Emergency Response Coordination Centre is facilitating the logistical arrangements and the EU will cover the brunt of the transport costs. \" Background The objective of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism is to strengthen cooperation between the EU Member States and 6 Participating States in the field of civil protection, with a view to improve prevention, preparedness and response to disasters. When the scale of an emergency overwhelms the response capabilities of a country, it can request assistance via the Mechanism. Through the Mechanism, the European Commission plays a key role in coordinating the response to disasters in Europe and beyond and contributes to at least 75% of the transport and\/or operational costs of deployments. Following a request for assistance through the Mechanism, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre mobilises assistance or expertise. The Centre monitors events around the globe 24\/7 and ensures rapid deployment of emergency support through a direct link with national civil protection authorities. Specialised teams and equipment, such as forest firefighting planes, search and rescue, and medical teams can be mobilised at short notice for deployments inside and outside Europe. Any country in the world, but also the United Nations and its agencies or a relevant international organisation, can call on the EU Civil Protection Mechanism for help. In 2020, the Mechanism was activated more than 90 times. For example, to respond to the coronavirus pandemic; the explosion in Beirut in Lebanon; floods in Ukraine, Niger and Sudan; the earthquake in Croatia; and tropical cyclones in Latin America and Asia. EU and COVAX Team Europe is committed to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and its health, social, economic, humanitarian, security and political impacts. With this approach, the EU is showing leadership, responsibility and solidarity with those most affected by the pandemic. Team Europe remains at the forefront of global efforts to ensure international access to vaccines, with a 2.47 billion contribution to the COVAX initiative.

This is following the positive steps regarding the conclusion of exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK announced on 31 July and with Johnson & Johnson on 13 August. Once the vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission now has agreed the basis for a contractual framework for the purchase of 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option to purchase 100 million more, on behalf of EU Member States. The Commission continues discussing similar agreements with other vaccine manufacturers. Ursula von der Leyen , President of the European Commission, said: \" The European Commission's intense negotiations continue to achieve results. Today's agreement is the first cornerstone in implementing the European Commission's Vaccines Strategy. This strategy will enable us to provide future vaccines to Europeans, as well as our partners elsewhere in the world. \" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"Today, after weeks of negotiations, we have the first EU advance purchase agreement for a vaccine candidate. I would like to thank AstraZeneca for its constructive engagement on this important agreement for our citizens. We will continue to work tirelessly to bring more candidates into a broad EU vaccines portfolio. A safe and effective vaccine remains the surest exit strategy to protect our citizens and the rest of the world from the coronavirus.\" The agreement approved today will be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies. AstraZeneca's vaccine candidate is already in large-scale Phase II\/III Clinical Trials after promising results in Phase I\/II concerning safety and immunogenicity. The decision to support the vaccine proposed by AstraZeneca is based on a sound scientific approach and the technology used (a non-replicative recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccine ChAdOx1), speed at delivery at scale, cost, risk sharing, liability and the production capacity able to supply the whole of the EU, among others. The regulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will use existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. This includes an accelerated procedure for authorisation and flexibility in relation to labelling and packaging. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission would finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements . Funding provided would be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreement will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.

The envisaged contract with Sanofi-GSK* would provide for an option for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine. It is envisaged that, once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission would have a contractual framework in place for the purchase of 300 million doses, on behalf of all EU Member States. The Commission continues intensive discussions with other vaccine manufacturers. President von der Leyen said: \" The European Commission does all in its power to ensure that Europeans have rapid access to a vaccine that is safe and protects them from coronavirus. Today's step with Sanofi-GSK is a first important cornerstone of a much broader European Vaccines Strategy. More will follow soon. We are in advanced discussions with several other companies. While we do not know today which vaccine will work best in the end, Europe is investing in a diversified portfolio of promising vaccines, based on various types of technologies. This increases our chances to obtain rapidly an effective remedy against the virus. A vaccine would be a truly global good. We are committed to help secure access also for more vulnerable countries to find their way out of this crisis. \" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \" A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is the surest exit strategy from the crisis. For that reason, we have been negotiating a united EU approach to secure doses of promising vaccine candidates in recent weeks. Today's announcement of the conclusion of exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK is the first important step in this direction, to provide equal access to the vaccine for our citizens.\" The exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery. The Commission is also ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission would finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements . Funding provided would be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen. Sanofi-GSK's vaccine candidate is planning to seek marketing authorisation from EMA in June 2021, following Phase III clinical trials yielding the induction of a promising immune response.

The envisaged contract with Sanofi-GSK* would provide for an option for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine. It is envisaged that, once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission would have a contractual framework in place for the purchase of 300 million doses, on behalf of all EU Member States. The Commission continues intensive discussions with other vaccine manufacturers. President von der Leyen said: \" The European Commission does all in its power to ensure that Europeans have rapid access to a vaccine that is safe and protects them from coronavirus. Today's step with Sanofi-GSK is a first important cornerstone of a much broader European Vaccines Strategy. More will follow soon. We are in advanced discussions with several other companies. While we do not know today which vaccine will work best in the end, Europe is investing in a diversified portfolio of promising vaccines, based on various types of technologies. This increases our chances to obtain rapidly an effective remedy against the virus. A vaccine would be a truly global good. We are committed to help secure access also for more vulnerable countries to find their way out of this crisis. \" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \" A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is the surest exit strategy from the crisis. For that reason, we have been negotiating a united EU approach to secure doses of promising vaccine candidates in recent weeks. Today's announcement of the conclusion of exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK is the first important step in this direction, to provide equal access to the vaccine for our citizens.\" The exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery. The Commission is also ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time.

This was a dual-tranche transaction, consisting of a 9 billion 5-year bond due on 6 July 2026 and a 6 billion 30-year bond due on 6 July 2051. Both tranches attracted a very strong interest by investors across Europe and the world. The transaction was more than 11 times oversubscribed and with bids exceeding 170 billion. As a result, the Commission has obtained very favourable pricing conditions, building on the successful first NextGenerationEU issuance earlier this month and the excellent performance of the SURE programme. Commissioner in charge of Budget and Administration, Johannes Hahn , said: \"This is the second time the Commission has gone to the markets to borrow under NextGenerationEU and again we have received a strong vote of confidence from our investors. I am glad that the money raised today will help build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe\". This is the second transaction under the NextGenerationEU programme, following the 20 billion 10-year bond that the Commission issued on 15 June 2021 on behalf of the EU. The first bond was the largest-ever institutional bond issuance in Europe, the largest-ever institutional single tranche transaction and the largest amount the EU has raised in a single transaction. Following today's transaction, the Commission has so far raised 35 billion under NextGenerationEU. The funds will now be used for the first payments under the scheme, including under the Recovery and Resilience Facility and various EU budget programmes financed by NextGenerationEU. The first disbursement under NextGenerationEU took place already yesterday. On 28 June, the Commission disbursed 800 million to REACT-EU. This programme finances targeted measures for the green and digital transitions to quickly address the negative consequences of the outbreak, for example, through investments in energy efficiency, urban greening and digitalisation. By the end of 2021, the Commission expects to raise some 80 billion in bonds, to be complemented by short-term EU-Bills, as per the funding plan published in June 2021. The exact amount of both EU-Bonds and EU-Bills will depend on the precise funding needs, and the Commission will revise its initial assessment in the autumn. In this way, the Commission will be able to fund, over the second half of the year, all planned grants and loans to Member States under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, as well as cover the needs of the EU policies that receive NextGenerationEU funding. Background NextGenerationEU is a temporary recovery instrument of some 800 billion in current prices to support Europe's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and help build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe. To finance NextGenerationEU, the European Commission on behalf of the EU will raise from the capital markets up to around 800 billion between now and end-2026. 407.5 billion available for grants (under RRF and other EU budget programmes); 386 billion for loans. This will translate into borrowing volumes of an average of roughly 150 billion per year. Given the volumes, frequency and complexity of the borrowing operations ahead, the Commission will follow the best practices used by large and frequent issuers, and implement a diversified funding strategy . This strategy presents a diverse range of instruments and techniques, going beyond the back-to-back approach that the Commission has used so far to borrow from the markets, including in the framework of the SURE programme. Over the past 40 years, the European Commission has run several lending programmes to support EU Member States and third countries. All of these lending operations were financed on a back-to-back basis, mainly through syndicated bond issuances. Technical section The 5-year bond carries a coupon of 0% and came at a re-offer yield of -0.335% providing a spread of -11 bps to mid-swaps, which is equivalent to +22.0 bps over the five-year Bund due in April 2026. The final order book was in excess of 88 billion, which meant that the bond has been nearly 10 times oversubscribed. The 30-year bond carries a coupon of 0.7% and came at a re-offer yield of 0.732% providing a spread of +22 bps to mid-swaps, which is equivalent to 39.9 bps over the 30-year Bund due in August 2050. The final order book was in excess of 83 billion, which meant that the bond has been nearly 14 times oversubscribed. On a standalone basis, the orderbook of the 30-year tranche was the largest ever in that maturity for a supranational issuer in the euro market. The joint lead managers of this transaction were Credit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, UniCredit and Goldman Sachs. BBVA and Erste bank acted as co-lead managers.

This will allow all key players - Member States, health institutions and economic operators to give priority to the fight against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, forming a key position in the timing of the lifting of confinement measures as Member States return to the road of recovery. The adopted amendment takes into consideration the need for an increased availability of vitally important medical devices across the EU, and at the same time continues to guarantee patient health and safety until the new legislation becomes applicable. Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas , said: \" I welcome the adoption in record time by the European Parliament and the Council of the proposal to postpone by one year the date of application of the Medical Devices Regulation. We are determined to have our medical industries pouring all their energy into what we need them to be doing: helping fight the pandemic. The European Union will do whatever it takes to support our health systems in their hour of need .\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"Yesterday's adoption will allow us all, in this time of crisis, to maintain our focus on the most critical issues and to ensure the continued availability of vitally important medical devices. This is clear proof of our ongoing determination to tackle the pandemic through all possible means, while always maintaining the safety of patients as our utmost objective. I thank the Parliament and Council for the record time approval, cooperation and efficient handling of this urgent proposal.\" The coronavirus crisis increases demand for certain vital medical devices. It is therefore important to avoid any further difficulties or risks of potential shortages or delays in the availability of such devices that could be caused by the limited capacity of authorities or conformity assessment bodies related to the implementation of the Medical Devices Regulation. The adopted amendment therefore postpones the application of the Medical Devices Regulation by one year - until 26 May 2021. The currently applicable rules will continue to guarantee patient health and safety. Background The coronavirus pandemic and the public health crisis resulting from it is putting Member States, together with national authorities, health institutions and economic operators, under extreme pressure. These circumstances demand substantial additional resources, and the need for an increased availability of vitally important medical devices has considerably increased. At the time of adoption of the Medical Devices Regulation none of the above could have been foreseen. The present situation strongly impacts upon the different areas covered by the Medical Devices Regulation. It is therefore highly probable that it would not have been possible for Member States, health institutions, economic operators and other relevant parties to implement and apply the Regulation from its foreseen date of application on 26 May 2020. In order to ensure an effective regulatory framework for medical devices, the present amendment also postpones the date of repeal of the Directive on active implantable medical devices and the Directive on medical devices by one year. The present adoption will not have impact on the date of application of the In Vitro Diagnostics Medical Devices Regulation, which becomes applicable from 26 May 2022. The amendment of the Medical Devices Regulation complements other important measures in the area of medical devices, which the Commission continues to adopt in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The Commission adopted the proposal on 3 April, and this was followed by the support of the European Parliament on 17 April.

The new support is particularly relevant in the context of the current coronavirus pandemic and will provide additional help for the most vulnerable persons in the region and assist hosting countries to better face public health challenges, amongst others. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\/Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell said: \"In the tenth year of the Syrian crisis which has displaced half of the country's population, the European Union continues to stand by the Syrian refugees and neighbouring countries hosting them. Not only to face the most immediate challenges, including the coronavirus pandemic, but also to build up their future. The EU will continue to support UN efforts for a comprehensive political solution to the Syrian conflict, mobilise necessary financial support for Syria and neighbouring countries, as well as provide a unique platform for dialogue with civil society. In this context, the EU will this year host its fourth Brussels Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region.\" Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi commented: \" The European Union is stepping up its assistance to countries hosting Syrian refugees, in particular Jordan and Lebanon but also others, as a signal of solidarity with the most vulnerable populations in difficult circumstances, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The package of close to 240 million puts a particular emphasis on critical sectors for vulnerable populations such as social assistance, health, education and child protection. This will help strengthen the resilience of those already facing difficult situations to better face the multiple challenges linked to the coronavirus. \" The newly adopted assistance package consists of the following actions: 100 million to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable local households and Syrian refugees, as well as to contribute to the establishment of sustainable social safety nets in Lebanon; 57.5 million to strengthen the public education system in Lebanon to deliver inclusive and quality education for vulnerable local and Syrian refugee children in Lebanon; 27.5 million to provide inclusive, equitable and quality education for Syrians in refugee camps in Jordan; 22 million to improve the public health system in Jordan, including prevention and management of diseases, in particular through primary health care; 11 million to empower local and refugee women and improve their access to livelihood opportunities in Jordan; 10.5 million in support to quality and sustainable child protection systems, policy and services for boys, girls and women in Lebanon; 10 million to improve the living and housing conditions of vulnerable returnees and support peacebuilding in western Ninewa in Iraq. The assistance package was adopted by the Operational Board of the Trust Fund, which brings together the European Commission, EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. Observers of the Operational Board include Members of the European Parliament, representatives from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the World Bank, and the Syria Recovery Trust Fund. With this newly adopted package, the Trust Fund has committed over 2 billion in concrete actions in the region since 2015, helping refugees and host countries alike, doubling the target originally set. This approved assistance package is part of already ongoing efforts to support Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries, pledged and provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis since 2014. Background Since its establishment in December 2014, a significant share of the EU's support to help Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis . The Trust Fund reinforces an integrated EU aid response to the crisis and primarily addresses longer-term resilience and needs to enhance the self-reliance of Syrian refugees and, at the same time, contributes to ease the pressure on host communities and the administrations in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The Fund has also underpinned the EU Compacts agreed with Jordan and Lebanon to better assist them in coping with the protracted refugee crisis. With the newly adopted package, the Fund has mobilised over 900 million for Lebanon, over 500 million for both Jordan and Turkey and more than 160 million for Iraq. Overall, more than 2 billion has been mobilised from the EU budget and contributions from 21 EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. The Trust Fund's programmes support basic education and child protection services for refugees, training and higher education, better access to healthcare, improved access to water and wastewater infrastructure, support to resilience, women empowerment and fighting gender based violence, as well as economic opportunities and social stability. The Fund can also support internally displaced persons in Iraq and actions in the Western Balkans.

The Trust Fund reinforces an integrated EU aid response to the crisis and primarily addresses longer-term resilience and needs to enhance the self-reliance of Syrian refugees and, at the same time, contributes to ease the pressure on host communities and the administrations in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The Fund has also underpinned the EU Compacts agreed with Jordan and Lebanon to better assist them in coping with the protracted refugee crisis. With the newly adopted package, the Fund has mobilised over 900 million for Lebanon, over 500 million for both Jordan and Turkey and more than 160 million for Iraq. Overall, more than 2 billion has been mobilised from the EU budget and contributions from 21 EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. The Trust Fund's programmes support basic education and child protection services for refugees, training and higher education, better access to healthcare, improved access to water and wastewater infrastructure, support to resilience, women empowerment and fighting gender based violence, as well as economic opportunities and social stability. The Fund can also support internally displaced persons in Iraq and actions in the Western Balkans.

The contract provides for the initial purchase of 80 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to request up to a further 80 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19. The contract with Moderna will enlarge the already broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the contracts signed with AstraZeneca , Sanofi-GSK , Janssen Pharmaceutica NV , BioNTech-Pfizer and the contract approved with CureVac . This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective. Member States can also decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said : \" I'm very happy to announce today's agreement with the company Moderna to purchase up to 160 million doses of their future vaccine. This is our sixth contract with a vaccine producer, and we are working on yet another one. We are setting up one of the most comprehensive COVID-19 vaccine portfolios in the world, providing Europeans access to the most promising future vaccines under development so far. A safe and effective vaccine can help us end the pandemic, and return gradually to normal life. \" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \" Today's agreement with Moderna is yet another important milestone of our EU Vaccines Strategy. I am happy that we have now concluded six vaccine agreements so far. This is a clear demonstration of the European Health Union in action: a European Union that delivers tangible results for its citizens and a blueprint for our cooperation in the area of health in the future. A safe and effective vaccine is more important than ever in helping to restore normality and overcome this pandemic. No one is safe until everyone is safe.\" Moderna is a U.S. based company pioneering the development of a new class of vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) transported into cells by lipid nanoparticles. The vaccine platform has been developed over the last decade. The basic principle is the use of this molecule as a data carrier, with the help of which the body itself can make proteins and trigger lasting immunity to COVID-19. The Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, and its production capacity in Europe to supply the whole of the EU. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements . Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States on the basis of the Advance Purchase Agreements. Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen. Once vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with 400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response. On 12 November, the European Union announced the contribution of an additional 100 million in grant funding to support the COVAX Facility.

This is the largest-ever institutional bond issuance in Europe, the largest-ever institutional single tranche transaction and the largest amount the EU has raised in a single transaction. The bond has attracted a very strong interest by investors across Europe and the world, thanks to which the Commission has obtained very favourable pricing conditions, similarly to the repeatedly successful issuances under the SURE programme. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \" Today is a truly historic day for our European Union. We successfully conducted the first funding operation for NextGenerationEU. As a strong Union, we are raising money at the markets together and investing in a common recovery from this crisis. It is an investment in our single market. And even more importantly, it is an investment in the future of Europe's next generations as they face the challenges of digitisation and climate change. Money can now start flowing to help reshaping our continent, to build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe. I will now visit every Member State, to see NextGenerationEU impact on the ground .\" Commissioner in charge of Budget and Administration, Johannes Hahn , said: \" Today, we have reached a key milestone in implementing NextGenerationEU. After laying all the foundation at record speed, we have today successfully conducted the first borrowing operation under the Recovery Plan. This is just a very first step of a long journey, bringing over 800 billion in current prices into the EU economy. NextGenerationEU has now become a reality and is set to drive our collective recovery from the pandemic, setting Europe on a green, digital and resilient path.\" The funds will now be used for the first payments under NextGenerationEU, under the Recovery and Resilience Facility and various EU budget programmes. By the end of 2021, the Commission expects to raise some 80 billion in bonds, to be complemented by short-term EU-Bills, as per the funding plan published in June 2021. The exact amount of both EU-Bonds and EU-Bills will depend on the precise funding needs, and the Commission will revise its initial assessment in the autumn. In this way, the Commission will be able to fund, over the second half of the year, all planned grants and loans to Member States under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, as well as cover the needs of the EU policies that receive NextGenerationEU funding. Background NextGenerationEU is a temporary recovery instrument of some 800 billion in current prices to support Europe's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and help build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe. To finance NextGenerationEU, the European Commission on behalf of the EU will raise from the capital markets up to around 800 billion between now and end-2026. 407.5 billion available for grants (under RRF and other EU budget programmes); 386 billion for loans. This will translate into borrowing volumes of an average of roughly 150 billion per year. Given the volumes, frequency and complexity of the borrowing operations ahead, the Commission will follow the best practices used by large and frequent issuers, and implement a diversified funding strategy . This strategy presents a diverse range of instruments and techniques, going beyond the back-to-back approach that the Commission has used so far to borrow from the markets, including in the framework of the SURE programme. Over the past 40 years, the European Commission has run several lending programmes to support EU Member States and third countries. All of these lending operations were financed on a back-to-back basis, mainly through syndicated bond issuances. Technical section The new 10-year bond carries a coupon of 0% and came at a re-offer yield of 0.086% providing a spread of -2 bps to mid-swaps, which is equivalent to 32.3 bps over the 0.00% Bund due 02\/2031. The final order book was in excess of 142 billion, which meant that the bond has been over seven times oversubscribed. The joint lead managers were BNP Paribas, DZ BANK, HSBC, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo and Morgan Stanley. Co-leads were Danske Bank and Santander.

This new pledge brings us closer to achieving COVAX's target to deliver 1.3 billion doses for 92 low and middle income countries by the end of 2021. Team Europe is one of the lead contributors to COVAX with over 2.2 billion, including another 900 million pledged today by Germany. Announcing the new contribution at the G7 virtual leaders' meeting, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \" Last year, as part of our Coronavirus Global Response, we committed to ensuring universal access to vaccines everywhere on Earth, for everyone who would need them. COVAX is best placed to help us reach this goal. This is why we decided to double the European Commission's contribution to COVAX, to 1 billion. With this new financial boost we want to make sure vaccines are soon delivered to low and middle-income countries. Because we will only be safe if the whole world is safe . \" Jutta Urpilainen , Commissioner for International Partnerships, added: \" We are in a race against the virus and COVAX is our best hope that all our partners, in Africa and elsewhere, have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. The EU has been leading efforts in international fora, such as the G20 and G7, to guarantee that collectively we ensure that COVID-19 vaccines become a global public good. This is why today we are doubling our support to COVAX.\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, stressed: \" Humanism and solidarity are essential values for Europe. These values have been our compass since the onset of the pandemic. The EU has invested close to 3 billion to pre-finance the production of safe and effective vaccines, which will benefit not only the EU but citizens across the world. Vaccines produced in Europe are now going all over the world and we as Team Europe are working to share doses secured under our advanced purchase agreements preferably through COVAX with the Western Balkans, Neighborhood and Africa benefitting above all health workers and humanitarian needs.\" The contribution announced today is composed of a new 300 million EU grant and 200 million in guarantees by the European Fund for Sustainable Development plus (EFSD+) that will back a loan by the European Investment Bank. This is subject to the adoption of the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) by the Council and the European Parliament. The EIB loan to be guaranteed by EFSD+ is subject to the approval of the EIB's Board of Directors. These funds will complement a previous 100 million grant and 400 million in guarantees from the EU budget. To date, a total of 191 countries participate in the COVAX Facility, 92 of them low and middle-income economies eligible to get access to COVID-19 vaccines through Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). Most of these are in Africa. Through these contributions, the Commission and its partners will secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for all the participants in the Facility. Vaccines will be procured and delivered to countries by the UNICEF Supply Division and the PAHO's Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines. The fast arrival of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has shown that multilateralism and multi-actor partnerships work to solve the most pressing problems of our time. Background COVAX is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. The COVAX Facility aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021, including at least 1.3 billion doses for low and middle-income country. It will help to develop a diversified portfolio of vaccines, negotiated with different suppliers, and covering different scientific technologies, delivery times and prices. The COVAX Facility is a risk-sharing mechanism: it reduces the risk for manufacturers who invest without being sure about future demand, and it reduces the risk that countries would fail to secure access to a viable vaccine. The European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world, and to promote global health. This is why together with partners it has helped raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action in support of universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery. Team Europe's contribution was as follows: EU Member States (3.1 billion), European Commission (over 1.4 billion) and EIB (almost 2 billion pledged in May and 4.9 billion pledged in June). The EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need. Through its Advanced Purchase Agreements, it requires manufacturers to make their production capacity available to supply all countries and calls for the free flow of vaccines and materials with no export restrictions. For instance, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-GSK, with whom the Commission concluded an Advanced Purchase Agreement in September , will endeavour to provide a significant portion of their vaccine supply through the COVAX facility. Building on the EU Vaccines Strategy, the EU is in the process of setting up vaccine sharing mechanism to allow EU Member States to redirect some of the doses procured under the advanced purchased agreement, preferably through COVAX.

Team Europe's contribution was as follows: EU Member States (3.1 billion), European Commission (over 1.4 billion) and EIB (almost 2 billion pledged in May and 4.9 billion pledged in June). The EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need. Through its Advanced Purchase Agreements, it requires manufacturers to make their production capacity available to supply all countries and calls for the free flow of vaccines and materials with no export restrictions. For instance, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-GSK, with whom the Commission concluded an Advanced Purchase Agreement in September , will endeavour to provide a significant portion of their vaccine supply through the COVAX facility. Building on the EU Vaccines Strategy, the EU is in the process of setting up vaccine sharing mechanism to allow EU Member States to redirect some of the doses procured under the advanced purchased agreement, preferably through COVAX.

Belgium is one of the first countries receiving a pre-financing payment under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). It will help to kick-start the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Belgium's recovery and resilience plan. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the implementation of the investments and reforms outlined in Belgium's recovery and resilience plan. The country is set to receive 5.9 billion in total, fully consisting of grants, over the lifetime of its plan. Today's disbursement follows the recent successful implementation of the first borrowing operations under NextGenerationEU. By the end of the year, the Commission intends to raise up to a total of 80 billion in long-term funding, to be complemented by short-term EU-Bills, to fund the first planned disbursements to Member States under NextGenerationEU. Part of NextGenerationEU, the RRF will provide 723.8 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across Member States. The Belgian plan is part of the unprecedented EU response to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 crisis, fostering the green and digital transitions and strengthening resilience and cohesion in our societies. Supporting transformative investments and reform projects The RRF in Belgium finances investments and reforms that are expected to have a deeply transformative effect on Belgium's economy and society. Here are some of these projects: Securing the green transition: The RRF invests 400 million in climate change adaptation in measures to restore biodiversity and increase resilience towards climate change, to buffer against floods, droughts and heat effects. This includes circular water use projects, investments in a coherent network of protected areas for nature and climate-resilient forests, for the re-meandering of rivers and the creation and restoration of wet nature and valleys. Supporting the digital transition: Belgium's plan has an ambitious skills agenda. This includes investments of 480 million in a more inclusive and future-proof education system across language communities with improved digital and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) skills of pupils and students and access to digital tools and technology. Reinforcing economic and social resilience : the Belgian plan contains measures worth 450 million to improve and expand training to facilitate the integration of vulnerable groups including people with a migrant background, the low-skilled, people with disabilities and to improve access to the labour market for job seekers. Members of the College said President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"This first disbursement is great news for Belgium and the Belgian people. Belgium is already an innovation front-runner, but NextGenerationEU will give the country the resources needed to go fully green and digital. I hope to see many other great digital projects like the one I visited in Brussels a month ago. Success stories made in Belgium, supported by the EU.\" Johannes Hahn , Commissioner for Budget and Administration said: \"After three very successful bond issuances under NextGenerationEU over the past few weeks, and the first payments for other NGEU programmes, I am glad that we have now also reached the disbursement stage for the RRF. Intense cooperation with Belgium and solid preparation within the Commission allowed us to pay out the funds in record time. This shows that with the resources raised, we will be able to swiftly deliver on the pre-financing needs of all Member States, thus giving them the initial boost in implementing the numerous green and digital projects included in their national plans.\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy said: \"The first funds we disbursed today will help Belgium emerge stronger from the crisis. Two thirds of Belgium's plan will support the green and digital transitions. Investments in energy-renovations and forest management will help protect the climate. Schools and rural areas will enjoy improved connectivity while the justice, health and social security systems will see major improvements in efficiency through digitalisation.

With this decision, all the conditions have now been fulfilled for the next multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 to be in place as of 1 January 2021. As a result, 1.074 trillion [in 2018 prices] will become available for beneficiaries of EU funding during the next seven years. President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"With NextGenerationEU and the new long term budget, we will be able to provide European people, businesses, regions and cities with the support they urgently need to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Today is a day of hope for Europe! We will build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe, ready for today's and tomorrow's challenges\".

The EU-Commission will spare no effort to lead Europe's recovery from 1 January onwards.

Once adopted, the package of a total of 1.8 trillion [in 2018 prices] will be the largest package ever financed through the EU budget. With the combined firepower of the long-term budget and NextGenerationEU, the EU will support citizens, companies and regions most affected by the coronavirus crisis. The package will also help rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe, which will be greener, more digital, more resilient and better fit for the current and forthcoming challenges. The European Commission will be able to start committing the funds under the next multiannual financial framework as of 1 January 2021, following the adoption of the relevant sector-specific legislation as well as of the annual budget for 2021 by the European Parliament and the Council. For the Commission to start borrowing under NextGenerationEU, thus making the instrument operational, the ratification of the new Own Resources Decision by all Member States in line with their constitutional requirements is still needed. The Commission relies on the commitment of Member States to proceed as quickly as possible, in the interest of their citizens. Background The Commission put forward its proposal for the EU's next long-term budget on 2 May 2018 . The framework proposal was immediately followed by legislative proposals for the 37 sectoral programmes (e.g. cohesion, agriculture, Erasmus, Horizon Europe, etc). Between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the Commission worked hand in hand with the rotating Presidencies of the Council, and in close collaboration with the European Parliament, to take the negotiations forward. On 27 May 2020, in response to the unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus, the European Commission proposed the temporary recovery instrument NextGenerationEU with a firepower of 750 billion, as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027. On 21 July 2020, EU heads of state or government reached a political agreement on the package . On 10 November 2020, the European Parliament and the Council reached an agreement on the package. On 10 December 2020, EU Member States in the European Council agreed to finalise the adoption of the MFF Regulation and the Own Resources Decision, at the level of the Council.

SURE is a crucial element of the EU's comprehensive strategy to protect citizens and mitigate the severely negative socio-economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. It is one of the three safety nets agreed by the European Council to shield workers, businesses and countries. Once the Council approves these proposals, the financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States. These loans will assist Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, in particular for the self-employed. Following consultations with the Member States that have requested support and after assessing their requests, the Commission proposes to the Council to approve the granting of financial support to: Belgium 7.8 billion Bulgaria 511 million Czechia 2 billion Greece 2.7 billion Spain 21.3 billion Croatia 1 billion Italy 27.4 billion Cyprus 479 million Latvia 192 million Lithuania 602 million Malta 244 million Poland 11.2 billion Romania 4 billion Slovakia 631 million Slovenia 1.1 billion SURE can provide financial support of up to 100 billion in total to all Member States. The proposals put forward by the Commission to the Council for decisions to grant financial support amount to 81.4 billion and cover 15 Member States. Portugal and Hungary have already submitted formal requests which are being assessed. The Commission expects to put forward a proposal to grant support to Portugal and Hungary shortly. Member States which have not yet made formal requests may still do so. Loans provided to Member States under the SURE instrument will be underpinned by a system of voluntary guarantees from Member States. The Commission expects that the process of Member States finalising their guarantee agreements with the Commission will be completed very shortly.

Portugal is one of the first countries receiving a pre-financing payment under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). It will help to kick-start the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the implementation of the investments and reforms outlined in Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. The country is set to receive 16.6 billion in total over the lifetime of its plan (13.9 billion in grants and 2.7 billion in loans). Today's disbursement follows the recent successful implementation of the first borrowing operations under NextGenerationEU. By the end of the year, the Commission intends to raise up to a total of 80 billion in long-term funding, to be complemented by short-term EU-Bills, to fund the first planned disbursements to Member States under NextGenerationEU. Part of NextGenerationEU, the RRF will provide 723.8 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across Member States. The Portuguese plan is part of the unprecedented EU response to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 crisis, fostering the green and digital transitions and strengthening resilience and cohesion in our societies. Supporting transformative investments and reform projects The RRF in Portugal finances investments and reforms that are expected to have a deeply transformative effect on Portugal's economy and society. Here are some of these projects: Securing the green transition: Several projects in Portugal's recovery and resilience plan support Portugal's green transition. This includes a large-scale renovation programme financed with 300 million to increase the energy efficiency of residential buildings. Supporting the digital transition: The Plan also covers measures worth 300 million to modernise the computer systems of the National Health Service and increase the digitalisation of medical records compliant with appropriate security principles. Reinforcing economic and social resilience: The RRF finances the \"Youth Impulse\" project with 130 million that aims to upgrade science facilities in secondary schools and universities to raise enrolment rates in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics courses. This project has a particular focus on women to promote gender equality and counter stereotypes in career choices. Members of the College said President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"Today's disbursement is a landmark moment in the rollout of Portugal's recovery and resilience plan the first NextGenerationEU plan we approved in the EU! This plan was designed in Portugal, with the Portuguese people's best interests at heart. It will make the European Green Deal a reality in the country, digitalise the economy and make it more robust than ever. Now, implementation begins. We will stand by your side each step of the way.\" Johannes Hahn , Commissioner for Budget and Administration, said: \"After three very successful bond issuances under NextGenerationEU over the past few weeks, and the first payments for other NGEU programmes, I am glad that we have now also reached the disbursement stage for the RRF. Intense cooperation with Portugal and solid preparation within the Commission allowed us to pay out the funds in record time. This shows that with the resources raised, we will be able to swiftly deliver on the pre-financing needs of all Member States, thus giving them the initial boost in implementing the numerous green and digital projects included in their national plans.\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \"The first funds we disbursed today will help Portugal emerge stronger from the crisis. Portugal's plan will reform and digitalise the public administration. Investments in energy-renovations and forest management will help protect the climate. The ambitious skills programme will give the opportunity to many Portuguese to acquire new skills. All this is the result of Europe working together.\" For More Information Questions and Answers: European Commission endorses Portugal's 16.6 billion recovery and resilience plan Recovery and Resilience Facility: Questions and Answers Factsheet on Portugal's recovery and resilience plan Council Implementing Decision on Portugal's recovery and resilience plan Commission Staff Working Document: Analysis of the recovery and resilience plan of Portugal Recovery and Resilience Facility Recovery and Resilience Facility Regulation Press release: third NextGenerationEU bond Press release: Commission's first funding plan EU as a borrower websiteYou are here: Home Press corner NextGenerationEU: EC disburses pre-financing to Portugal Available languages: Deutsch English francais portugues Press release 3 August 2021 Brussels NextGenerationEU: European Commission disburses 2.2 billion in pre-financing to Portugal Page contents Top Top Print friendly pdf Related media Press contact The European Commission has today disbursed 2.2 billion to Portugal in pre-financing, equivalent to 13% of the grant and loan component of the country's financial allocation. Portugal is one of the first countries receiving a pre-financing payment under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). It will help to kick-start the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the implementation of the investments and reforms outlined in Portugal's recovery and resilience plan. The country is set to receive 16.6 billion in total over the lifetime of its plan (13.9 billion in grants and 2.7 billion in loans). Today's disbursement follows the recent successful implementation of the first borrowing operations under NextGenerationEU. By the end of the year, the Commission intends to raise up to a total of 80 billion in long-term funding, to be complemented by short-term EU-Bills, to fund the first planned disbursements to Member States under NextGenerationEU. Part of NextGenerationEU, the RRF will provide 723.8 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across Member States. The Portuguese plan is part of the unprecedented EU response to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 crisis, fostering the green and digital transitions and strengthening resilience and cohesion in our societies.

This is an important step towards the EU to disbursing 68.9 billion in grants and 122.6 billion in loans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Italy's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Italy to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF at the heart of NextGenerationEU will provide up to 672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Italian plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market. The Commission assessed Italy's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms set out in Italy's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience. Securing Italy's green and digital transition The Commission's assessment finds that Italy's plan devotes 37% of total expenditure on measures that support climate objectives. The plan includes investments to finance a large-scale renovation programme to increase the energy efficiency of buildings. It also provides for measures to promote the use of renewable energy sources, including hydrogen. The plan places a special emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, with investments in sustainable urban mobility and railway infrastructure. The Commission's assessment finds that Italy's plan devotes 25% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. Measures to support Italy's digital transition include investments to support the digitalisation of businesses and the expansion of ultra-fast broadband networks and 5G connectivity. Investments are also targeted towards the digitalisation of the public administration, with measures planned for the general public administration, health, justice, and education sectors. Reinforcing Italy's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that Italy's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Italy by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and 2020. The plan includes measures to contribute to the sustainability of public finances, increase the resilience of the healthcare sector, improve the effectiveness of active labour market policies, and improve education outcomes. The plan is also expected to boost investment with a view to reduce regional disparities, increase the effectiveness of the public administration and the efficiency of the justice system, improve the business environment and remove barriers to competition. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Italy's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars referred to in the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects The Italian plan proposes projects in six European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects, which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the twin transition. For instance, Italy has proposed to provide 12.1 billion for energy efficiency in residential buildings, 32.1 billion for sustainable mobility, and 13.4 to support the digitalisation of businesses. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The control systems put in place by Italy are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said : President Ursula von der Leyen said: \" Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Italy's 191.5 billion recovery and resilience plan. This unprecedented level of investment, coupled with crucial reforms will help rebuild the Italian economy and prepare it for the future. I am proud that NextGenerationEU will help the Italian people look to the future with confidence and ambition. Now is the time to deliver. We will stand by you every step of the way to ensure that the plan will be an Italian and European success.\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" Italy's plan will give a structural boost to its economic growth and help to reduce social and regional differences. Ambitious reforms of the public administration and justice system including through digitalisation along with improvements to the business environment will do a great deal to remove barriers that are holding up growth. Efforts to reduce tax evasion and make public spending more efficient will make Italy's economy fairer and more sustainable. We also welcome the plan's social aspects, particularly for providing social housing, the measures to benefit southern regions, and its focus on improving education and job opportunities. It will also help to protect the climate by raising energy efficiency of buildings, boosting sustainable transport and promoting renewable energy. We look forward to the plan bringing about real change on the ground once it is put fully into effect .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" After an unprecedented crisis, Italy today has a unique opportunity to build a better future. Italy has presented a plan for reforms and investments that will enable the country to address problems that have held back economic development and social progress for far too long. A more effective public administration, more efficient legal proceedings, increased competition: we are no longer talking about a book of dreams but about key elements in a detailed work programme. At the same time, Italy will carry out crucial investments in sustainable mobility, renewable energy, the digitalisation of businesses and the roll-out of 5G and ultra-broadband, unleashing new opportunities for all parts of the country. If Italy can make a success of NextGenerationEU, it can mark the start of a new chapter of stronger growth and sustainable development. Achieving that success must be the number one priority for the years to come. Europe will be at Italy's side every step of the way .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a decision to provide 68.9 billion in grants and 122.6 billion in loans to Italy under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 24.9 billion to Italy in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Italy. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the recovery and resilience plan, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

The guidance aims to support Member States in effectively using testing tools in the context of their national strategies and during the different stages of the pandemic, including when phasing out confinement measures. The Commission also aims to ensure that high-quality tools are available to assess the performance of the tests. Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"The capacity to perform large-scale testing is key to detecting and slowing down the coronavirus pandemic and is a crucial pre-condition for a gradual return to our normal way of life. The main priority for us all is to fight the virus and protect our citizens from further exposure and infection, and to do so, we need to know where the virus is. In the absence of a vaccine, safe and reliable testing is our best bet to protect our health care workers, the most vulnerable of our citizens and our societies at large. This is a cornerstone of our roadmap towards lifting coronavirus containment measures.\" Mariya Gabriel , Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: \" We have been working hard to analyse the information on the quality assurance of the coronavirus tests and devices that are currently being used. The results show that there is a mismatch between the existing quality and what could be expected to ensure good performance of the tests. The European Commission has therefore developed test performance criteria which aim to improve the overall performance of these tests. This will benefit all European citizens and is a key part for of the exit strategy from the current crises .\" The availability of reliable data over time is key to lifting containment measures. In order to achieve this, there needs to be sufficient monitoring of the progression of the coronavirus pandemic, including through large-scale testing. In its guidelines, the Commission calls on manufacturers to produce \"state of the art\" testing kits. Although the science relating to testing is still evolving rapidly, this obligation is important as the information provided by these test kits is used for crucial public health decisions. Given the importance of tests in the current situation and the rapid development of the pandemic, the Commission is also insisting on pooling resources for the validation of coronavirus tests at EU-level. It is important to centralise the validation and to share the results at EU and international level. In order to ensure the highest possible testing quality, make sure that tests are correctly used and further align the evaluation and validation of test device performance, the Commission is proposing to launch the following actions in the coming weeks: an assessment of common approaches in national strategies; the sharing of information on the performance of tests; the establishment of a network of coronavirus reference laboratories across the EU to facilitate the exchange of information, and the management and distribution of control samples; the drafting of further guidance on performance evaluation and conformity assessment following additional dialogue with the industry and national competent authorities; making available tools for assessment of performance, such as reference materials and common methods for the comparison of devices; the fight against counterfeit devices through international cooperation and cooperation between Member States' authorities; the coordination of supply and demand by EU instruments such as the Clearing House, rescEU and joint procurement; solidarity between Member States by ensuring a fair distribution of available stocks and laboratory equipment focussing on where they are most needed. Background Currently, EU legislation lays down a number of requirements for tests. The manufacturer of a test must prepare a technical file, which demonstrates that the test is safe and performs as intended. There are currently two categories of tests: tests detecting the virus; tests detecting antibodies; these tests detect whether the patient has already been exposed to the virus and therefore produced antibodies. Assessing the performance level of a test can be very challenging as the biological materials necessary for this assessment are not always available.

The guidance aims to support Member States in effectively using testing tools in the context of their national strategies and during the different stages of the pandemic, including when phasing out confinement measures. The Commission also aims to ensure that high-quality tools are available to assess the performance of the tests. Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"The capacity to perform large-scale testing is key to detecting and slowing down the coronavirus pandemic and is a crucial pre-condition for a gradual return to our normal way of life. The main priority for us all is to fight the virus and protect our citizens from further exposure and infection, and to do so, we need to know where the virus is. In the absence of a vaccine, safe and reliable testing is our best bet to protect our health care workers, the most vulnerable of our citizens and our societies at large. This is a cornerstone of our roadmap towards lifting coronavirus containment measures.\" Mariya Gabriel , Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: \" We have been working hard to analyse the information on the quality assurance of the coronavirus tests and devices that are currently being used. The results show that there is a mismatch between the existing quality and what could be expected to ensure good performance of the tests. The European Commission has therefore developed test performance criteria which aim to improve the overall performance of these tests. This will benefit all European citizens and is a key part for of the exit strategy from the current crises .\" The availability of reliable data over time is key to lifting containment measures. In order to achieve this, there needs to be sufficient monitoring of the progression of the coronavirus pandemic, including through large-scale testing. In its guidelines, the Commission calls on manufacturers to produce \"state of the art\" testing kits. Although the science relating to testing is still evolving rapidly, this obligation is important as the information provided by these test kits is used for crucial public health decisions. Given the importance of tests in the current situation and the rapid development of the pandemic, the Commission is also insisting on pooling resources for the validation of coronavirus tests at EU-level. It is important to centralise the validation and to share the results at EU and international level. In order to ensure the highest possible testing quality, make sure that tests are correctly used and further align the evaluation and validation of test device performance, the Commission is proposing to launch the following actions in the coming weeks: an assessment of common approaches in national strategies; the sharing of information on the performance of tests; the establishment of a network of coronavirus reference laboratories across the EU to facilitate the exchange of information, and the management and distribution of control samples; the drafting of further guidance on performance evaluation and conformity assessment following additional dialogue with the industry and national competent authorities; making available tools for assessment of performance, such as reference materials and common methods for the comparison of devices; the fight against counterfeit devices through international cooperation and cooperation between Member States' authorities; the coordination of supply and demand by EU instruments such as the Clearing House, rescEU and joint procurement; solidarity between Member States by ensuring a fair distribution of available stocks and laboratory equipment focussing on where they are most needed. Background Currently, EU legislation lays down a number of requirements for tests. The manufacturer of a test must prepare a technical file, which demonstrates that the test is safe and performs as intended. There are currently two categories of tests: tests detecting the virus; tests detecting antibodies; these tests detect whether the patient has already been exposed to the virus and therefore produced antibodies. Assessing the performance level of a test can be very challenging as the biological materials necessary for this assessment are not always available. Moreover, unified ways to compare tests do not always exist.

The crisis we face because of Coronavirus has both a very significant human dimension, and a potentially major economic impact. It is therefore essential that we act decisively and collectively, to contain the spread of the virus and help patients, and to counter the economic fallout . After the videoconference, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \" Let me be very clear: The Commission is working flat out on both fronts. The European Commission will, in a daily phone conference with the Health Ministers and the Ministers of Internal Affairs, coordinate the necessary measures. Secondly, the Commission will assemble a team of epidemiologists and virologists from different Member States to give us guidelines on the European level. The European Commission is now taking stock of the available protective equipment and respiratory devices as well as their production and distribution capacity. Those are crucial for the entire health sector. On research and development , we will reinforce the European initiative to fund targeted research on the Coronavirus. We have mobilised 140 million of public and private funding for promising research on vaccines, diagnosis and treatment. On the economic front : First and foremost, we must act at the macro-economic level. We will use all the tools at our disposal to make sure the European economy weathers this storm. This requires coordination between Member States, the Commission and the ECB. I am comforted that leaders have called for such a coordinated strategy. The Commission will play its full part with no delay. I am working on the following measures to support Member States in their efforts: We will make sure that state aid can flow to companies that need it; Secondly, we will make full use of the flexibility which exists in the Stability and Growth Pact; I will come with concrete ideas before the Eurogroup on Monday. So on both these fronts, we will clarify the rules of the game for Member States very quickly. Finally, I will bring forward a \" Corona Response Investment Initiative \" directed at the health care systems, SMEs, labour markets and other vulnerable parts of our economies. The investment will be sizable and reach 25 billion quickly. To realise this, I will propose to Council and Parliament this week to release 7.5 billion of investment liquidity. I will set up a Task Force to work with Member States to ensure that the money starts flowing in the coming weeks. Today marks an important step in a coordinated response that the 27 Heads of State and Government, the President of the European Council and the Commission have been calling for. Now it is time for action. \" Corona Response Investment Initiative how will it work? In order to quickly direct 25 billion of European public investment to deal with the fallout of the Coronavirus crisis, the Commission will propose to relinquish this year its obligation to request refunding of unspent pre-financing for European structural and investment funds currently held by Member States. The Member States will be required to use these amounts to speed up their investments under the structural funds. They will use this for the national co-financing they would normally have had to provide themselves in order to receive the next tranches of their structural fund envelopes. In view of the average co-financing rates across Member States, the 7.5 billion will be able to trigger the release and use of some 17.5 - 18 billion of structural funding across the EU. This proposal can be implemented through a modification of the common provision regulation for the structural funds. The Commission will make this proposal to Council and Parliament this week. The national operational programmes would then be adapted, where necessary, to channel the funding towards areas such as short-term work measures, the health sector, labour market measures, and sectors particularly affected in the current circumstances.

As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission is today also announcing a contribution of 400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response. Ursula von der Leyen , President of the European Commission, said: \"Global collaboration is the only way to overcome a global pandemic. Under the Coronavirus Global Response and the Global Goal Unite campaign, we have seen the world come together as one. Almost 16 billion have been pledged so far and the most talented researchers and organisations are pooling their efforts to deliver vaccines, tests and treatments, which will be our universal, common good. Today, the Commission is announcing a 400 million contribution to COVAX for working together in purchasing future vaccines to the benefit of low and middle income countries. I'm confident this will bring us closer to our goal: beating this virus, together.\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"It is only by working together globally, in solidarity, that we can defeat the coronavirus. We need an inclusive international approach and as we are showing today, Team Europe European Commission and EU Member States - is committed to ensuring the success of the COVAX Facility and facilitating access to a vaccine in an equitable manner for all people across the world.\" Jutta Urpilainen , Commissioner for International partnerships, said: \" Only by securing equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine across the world will we end the pandemic and ensure a sustainable recovery; working with our partner countries is crucial so that we can build back better and healthier. \" The COVAX Facility, co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, aims to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world. As part of a EU joint engagement (Commission, Member States and European financial institutions, notably EIB) to mobilise resources for the Coronavirus Global Response, the Commission intends to mobilise up to 400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its underlying objectives as part of a Team Europe effort. The detailed terms and conditions for the EU's participation and contribution will be worked out in the coming days and weeks. Team Europe is ready to put its expertise and resources at work within COVAX to accelerate and scale-up development and manufacturing of a global supply of vaccines for citizens across the world, in poor and rich countries. The EU's participation in COVAX will be complementary to the ongoing EU negotiations with vaccine companies that aim at scaling up manufacturing capacity of vaccine producers, contributing to global efforts. Background: The European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it immediately responded to the WHO's call for action and has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery. As a milestone under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to affordable coronavirus vaccination, treatment and testing, The Global Goal: Unite for our Future campaign was launched by NGO Global Citizen on 28 May under the patronage of President Ursula von der Leyen . On 4 May, the Commission also proposed a cooperation framework to align global efforts and accelerate progress in developing coronavirus vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics and strengthening health systems: the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT)-Accelerator. Three partnerships, based on the three priorities of the Coronavirus Global Response, are at its core. They gather industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations to work together on all steps needed to deliver new tools and solutions, from research to manufacturing and deployment. COVAX is the vaccines pillar of the ACT-Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access for all countries across the world to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. Co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, COVAX was launched at the end of April 2020 at an event co-hosted by the Director-General of the World Health Organization, the President of France, the President of the European Commission, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Since then, the EU has been actively engaged with Gavi, CEPI and other participant countries in the setting up of COVAX governance and financial tools. The final terms of the EU's participation following today's expression of interest still need to be defined. The COVAX Facility aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021, by negotiating with a diversified portfolio of vaccine suppliers covering different scientific technologies, time delivery and prices. The COVAX Facility is an insurance mechanism which will reduce risk for manufacturers, concerned about investing without assured demand, and for countries, concerned about failing to secure access to a viable vaccine.

The funding under Horizon 2020, the EU's research and innovation programme, is part of the Commission's 1.4 billion pledge to the Coronavirus Global Response initiative, launched by President Ursula von der Leyen in May 2020. The 23 projects shortlisted for funding involve 347 research teams from 40 countries, including 34 participants from 16 countries outside of the EU. The funding will enable researchers to address the pandemic and its consequences by strengthening the industrial capacity to manufacture and deploy readily available solutions, develop medical technologies and digital tools, improve understanding of behavioural and socio-economic impacts of the pandemic, and to learn from large groups of patients (cohorts) across Europe. These research actions complement earlier efforts to develop diagnostics, treatments and vaccines . Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"Emergency funding from Horizon 2020 will enable researchers to rapidly develop solutions with and for patients, care workers, hospitals, local communities and companies.

It's encouraging to see the research community mobilise so rapidly and strongly.\" Thierry Breton , Commissioner for Internal Market, added: \" The excellent response to this call shows the wealth of new ideas to tackle coronavirus, including new digital health solutions. Digital solutions and technologies enabled us to stay connected and interact with each other during the confinement. They will also be an essential part of the long-term response to this virus and to increasing our resilience. \" The Commission is currently negotiating grant agreements with the selected beneficiaries. The new projects will cover: Repurposing manufacturing for rapid production of vital medical supplies and equipment needed for testing, treatment and prevention for instance using injection moulding and additive manufacturing (3-D printing), adaptive production and supply chain methods, and repurposing manufacturing as a service network for fast reaction. Developing medical technologies and digital tools to improve detection, surveillance and patients' care for example through the development of new devices for faster, cheaper and easier diagnosis (including remotely) plus new technologies to protect healthcare workers. Analysing behavioural and socio-economic impacts of the responses of government and public health systems, for instance on mental health, including gender-specific aspects in risk factors and the socioeconomic burden, to develop inclusive guidance for policymakers and health authorities and enhance preparedness for future similar events. Learning from large groups of patients (cohorts) by connecting existing cohorts in the EU and beyond to assess their exposure to certain risk factors to better understand the possible causes of disease in order to improve responsiveness to the virus and future public health threats. Enhancing collaboration of existing EU and international cohorts by networking research institutions that are collecting data on patient care to enable studies into patient's characteristics, risk factors, safety and effectiveness of treatments and potential strategies against coronavirus. Background This second emergency request for expressions of interest, launched by the Commission on 19 May 2020 gave researchers just under 4 weeks to prepare collaborative research projects. The research community mobilised rapidly. Research proposals were fast-tracked through evaluation by independent experts, enabling the Commission to shortlist a number of projects of excellent scientific quality and high potential impact. Although funding is conditional on a final Commission decision and the signature of the Horizon 2020 Grant Agreement, the research teams can already start their work. Many of the 23 short-listed projects have an international dimension beyond the EU and associated countries, with 34 organisations involved from 16 countries outside of the EU including countries associated to the Horizon 2020 programme (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland and Turkey) and third countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Columbia, Congo, Gabon, India, Korea, South Africa and the United States). This new special call under Horizon 2020 complements earlier actions to support 18 projects with 48.2 million to develop diagnostics, treatments, vaccines and preparedness for epidemics, as well as the 117 million invested in 8 projects on diagnostics and treatments through the Innovative Medicines Initiative , and measures to support innovative ideas through the European Innovation Council .

These research actions complement earlier efforts to develop diagnostics, treatments and vaccines . Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"Emergency funding from Horizon 2020 will enable researchers to rapidly develop solutions with and for patients, care workers, hospitals, local communities and companies. The results will help them to better cope with and survive coronavirus infections. It's encouraging to see the research community mobilise so rapidly and strongly.\" Thierry Breton , Commissioner for Internal Market, added: \" The excellent response to this call shows the wealth of new ideas to tackle coronavirus, including new digital health solutions. Digital solutions and technologies enabled us to stay connected and interact with each other during the confinement. They will also be an essential part of the long-term response to this virus and to increasing our resilience. \" The Commission is currently negotiating grant agreements with the selected beneficiaries. The new projects will cover: Repurposing manufacturing for rapid production of vital medical supplies and equipment needed for testing, treatment and prevention for instance using injection moulding and additive manufacturing (3-D printing), adaptive production and supply chain methods, and repurposing manufacturing as a service network for fast reaction. Developing medical technologies and digital tools to improve detection, surveillance and patients' care for example through the development of new devices for faster, cheaper and easier diagnosis (including remotely) plus new technologies to protect healthcare workers. Analysing behavioural and socio-economic impacts of the responses of government and public health systems, for instance on mental health, including gender-specific aspects in risk factors and the socioeconomic burden, to develop inclusive guidance for policymakers and health authorities and enhance preparedness for future similar events. Learning from large groups of patients (cohorts) by connecting existing cohorts in the EU and beyond to assess their exposure to certain risk factors to better understand the possible causes of disease in order to improve responsiveness to the virus and future public health threats. Enhancing collaboration of existing EU and international cohorts by networking research institutions that are collecting data on patient care to enable studies into patient's characteristics, risk factors, safety and effectiveness of treatments and potential strategies against coronavirus. Background This second emergency request for expressions of interest, launched by the Commission on 19 May 2020 gave researchers just under 4 weeks to prepare collaborative research projects. The research community mobilised rapidly. Research proposals were fast-tracked through evaluation by independent experts, enabling the Commission to shortlist a number of projects of excellent scientific quality and high potential impact. Although funding is conditional on a final Commission decision and the signature of the Horizon 2020 Grant Agreement, the research teams can already start their work. Many of the 23 short-listed projects have an international dimension beyond the EU and associated countries, with 34 organisations involved from 16 countries outside of the EU including countries associated to the Horizon 2020 programme (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland and Turkey) and third countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Columbia, Congo, Gabon, India, Korea, South Africa and the United States). This new special call under Horizon 2020 complements earlier actions to support 18 projects with 48.2 million to develop diagnostics, treatments, vaccines and preparedness for epidemics, as well as the 117 million invested in 8 projects on diagnostics and treatments through the Innovative Medicines Initiative , and measures to support innovative ideas through the European Innovation Council . It implements Action 3 of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan, a working document resulting from dialogues between the Commission and national institutions.

In addition, over 148 million will be granted to another 36 companies set to contribute to the recovery plan for Europe , bringing the total investment from Horizon 2020, the EU's research and innovation programme, to 314 million in this round. Mariya Gabriel , Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"The enormous talent and breakthrough ideas of innovative European companies give us hope. Our increased support to the European Innovation Council will unlock their potential so that we can better tackle the coronavirus and support our recovery. The EIC responded quickly to the coronavirus crisis and demonstrated the agility and impact of EU funding.\" The selected 36 companies that will contribute to the fight against the coronavirus will work on pioneering projects, such as on expanding the production of bio-decontamination wipes, developing ventilation monitoring systems that provide first aiders with real-time feedback on the quality of the ventilation given to the patient, developing an antibody platform to treat severe cases of infection, and many more. Furthermore, 139 companies tackling the coronavirus that could not receive funding in this round due to budget limitations have received the newly introduced COVID-19 Seal of Excellence , in recognition of the value of their proposal and in order to help them attract support from other funding sources. An additional 36 companies, set to support the recovery plan for Europe, will work across a multitude of sectors and projects, which include for example the development of stronger and taller wind turbine towers made from wood modules, with the potential to massively reduce wind energy costs, an organic fertilizer production system, and a blockchain-based solution for sustainable recycling practices of manufacturers. And, another 679 Seals of Excellence were awarded to high-quality proposals who passed the EIC funding criteria, but could not be funded due to limited budget. A record number of almost 4000 start-ups and small and medium businesses (SMEs) applied to the EIC Accelerator pilot in March, of which over 1400 proposed innovations relevant to the coronavirus outbreak. This is why an extra 150 million was recently allocated to this funding round, bringing the combined total to over 314 million. The start-ups and SMEs selected for support come from 16 countries, including 12 EU Member States, the UK and 3 associated countries. Background Out of the 314 million of EIC funding awarded, 174 million will be in the form of equity investments. Since its introduction in mid-2019, the EIC Accelerator pilot has offered the option of direct equity investments, up to 15 million, in addition to the grant support, up to 2.5 million. More than 10,000 start-ups and SMEs have applied so far with a total financial request for of over 26 billion. Of the 72 companies awarded support today, 46 are due to receive equity support. Equity investments are subject to an in-depth due diligence exercise, and will be managed by the future EIC Fund, which will actively seek out co-investors . EIC supported companies also benefit from a wide range of coaching, mentoring and advisory\/business acceleration services. For the first time these services will be offered to COVID-19 Seal of Excellence companies. The EIC support to breakthrough ideas tackling the coronavirus is part of the joint EU effort to overcome the crisis. On 4 May, the Commission hosted a Coronavirus Global Response pledging event, where 9.8 billion have been raised so far. The Commission pledged 1.4 billion during this pledging event, of which 1 billion comes through Horizon 2020 and is aimed at ensuring collaborative development and universal deployment of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus. In the end of May the Commission announced the next steps in the Coronavirus Global Response, namely the launch of a new campaign with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen, \" Global Goal: Unite For Our Future\", that will culminate in a Global Pledging Summit on 27 June. Furthermore,the Commission has recently put forward its proposal for a major recovery plan for Europe. To ensure the recovery is sustainable, even, inclusive and fair for all Member States, the Commission is proposing to create a new recovery instrument, Next Generation EU, embedded within a powerful, modern and revamped long-term EU budget. As part of the recovery instrument Next Generation EU, a 13.5 billion increase of the Horizon Europe budget is proposed that will be used to provide European support for health and climate-related research and innovation activities, including for breakthrough innovations by startups and SMEs. *For more information New EIC Accelerator projects on coronavirus List of companies selected for EIC funding Enhanced European Innovation Council (EIC) pilot websiteYou are here: Home Press corner Coronavirus: EU grants 314 million to innovative companies Available languages: cestina dansk Deutsch eesti English espanol francais hrvatski italiano latviesu lietuviu magyar Malti Nederlands polski portugues romana slovencina slovenscina suomi svenska Press release 8 June 2020 Brussels Coronavirus: EU grants 314 million to innovative companies to combat the virus and support recovery Page contents Top Top Print friendly pdf Press contact The Commission announced today that it has awarded nearly 166 million, via the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator Pilot , to 36 companies set to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

Our increased support to the European Innovation Council will unlock their potential so that we can better tackle the coronavirus and support our recovery. The EIC responded quickly to the coronavirus crisis and demonstrated the agility and impact of EU funding.\" The selected 36 companies that will contribute to the fight against the coronavirus will work on pioneering projects, such as on expanding the production of bio-decontamination wipes, developing ventilation monitoring systems that provide first aiders with real-time feedback on the quality of the ventilation given to the patient, developing an antibody platform to treat severe cases of infection, and many more. Furthermore, 139 companies tackling the coronavirus that could not receive funding in this round due to budget limitations have received the newly introduced COVID-19 Seal of Excellence , in recognition of the value of their proposal and in order to help them attract support from other funding sources. An additional 36 companies, set to support the recovery plan for Europe, will work across a multitude of sectors and projects, which include for example the development of stronger and taller wind turbine towers made from wood modules, with the potential to massively reduce wind energy costs, an organic fertilizer production system, and a blockchain-based solution for sustainable recycling practices of manufacturers. And, another 679 Seals of Excellence were awarded to high-quality proposals who passed the EIC funding criteria, but could not be funded due to limited budget. A record number of almost 4000 start-ups and small and medium businesses (SMEs) applied to the EIC Accelerator pilot in March, of which over 1400 proposed innovations relevant to the coronavirus outbreak. This is why an extra 150 million was recently allocated to this funding round, bringing the combined total to over 314 million. The start-ups and SMEs selected for support come from 16 countries, including 12 EU Member States, the UK and 3 associated countries. Background Out of the 314 million of EIC funding awarded, 174 million will be in the form of equity investments. Since its introduction in mid-2019, the EIC Accelerator pilot has offered the option of direct equity investments, up to 15 million, in addition to the grant support, up to 2.5 million. More than 10,000 start-ups and SMEs have applied so far with a total financial request for of over 26 billion. Of the 72 companies awarded support today, 46 are due to receive equity support. Equity investments are subject to an in-depth due diligence exercise, and will be managed by the future EIC Fund, which will actively seek out co-investors . EIC supported companies also benefit from a wide range of coaching, mentoring and advisory\/business acceleration services. For the first time these services will be offered to COVID-19 Seal of Excellence companies. The EIC support to breakthrough ideas tackling the coronavirus is part of the joint EU effort to overcome the crisis. On 4 May, the Commission hosted a Coronavirus Global Response pledging event, where 9.8 billion have been raised so far. The Commission pledged 1.4 billion during this pledging event, of which 1 billion comes through Horizon 2020 and is aimed at ensuring collaborative development and universal deployment of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus. In the end of May the Commission announced the next steps in the Coronavirus Global Response, namely the launch of a new campaign with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen, \" Global Goal: Unite For Our Future\", that will culminate in a Global Pledging Summit on 27 June. Furthermore,the Commission has recently put forward its proposal for a major recovery plan for Europe. To ensure the recovery is sustainable, even, inclusive and fair for all Member States, the Commission is proposing to create a new recovery instrument, Next Generation EU, embedded within a powerful, modern and revamped long-term EU budget. As part of the recovery instrument Next Generation EU, a 13.5 billion increase of the Horizon Europe budget is proposed that will be used to provide European support for health and climate-related research and innovation activities, including for breakthrough innovations by startups and SMEs. *For more information New EIC Accelerator projects on coronavirus List of companies selected for EIC funding Enhanced European Innovation Council (EIC) pilot website Print friendly pdf Coronavirus: EU grants 314 million to innovative companies English (47.318 kB - PDF) Download (47.318 kB - PDF) Press contact Johannes BAHRKE Phone +32 2 295 86 15 Mail Marietta GRAMMENOU Phone +32 2 298 35 83 Mail IP\/20\/1007 Share this page: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn E-mail European Commission European Commission website Follow the European Commission Facebook Twitter Other social media European Union EU institutions European Union About the Commission's new web presence Language policy Resources for partners Cookies Privacy policy Legal notice Contact+32 2 295 86 15 +32 2 298 35 83","c31eec6fd05379742fd378a318dd08ebd6bb95d91cac506bbaf7a0332bf5acec":"New control material developed by Commission scientists to help prevent coronavirus test failures European Commission scientists have designed new control material that laboratories can use to check the correct functioning of their coronavirus tests and to avoid false negatives. Mariya Gabriel , Commissioner for Research and Innovation, responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: \" This is EU science in action when it is needed and where it is needed, to support the EU's response to the current crisis . The JRC quickly identified a potential gap in the management of the coronavirus outbreak and immediately set to work to fill that gap. The new control material has the potential to improve the EU's capacity to respond to the virus outbreak and avoid valuable resources being wasted by inefficient tests .\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \" Quick and reliable laboratory testing is fundamental to our strategy against coronavirus. The work of EU scientists to develop test control material will enable the verification of up to 60 million laboratory tests throughout the EU. This is a major achievement by our researchers, which will be crucial for our exit strategy when the time comes to start lifting social distancing measures.\" A recent EU survey identified the lack of positive control materials as one of the top three challenges faced by laboratories for the reliable implementation of coronavirus tests. A positive control material guarantees that laboratory tests are working correctly. It helps to avoid that a test could give a negative result if the person is positive. The JRC-designed control material is a synthetic, non-infectious part of the virus. Today, 3,000 samples of the control material are ready to be dispatched to testing laboratories across the EU. The samples are highly concentrated and only a very small quantity of the material is required to check one test. This means that one sample tube is enough for one laboratory to check up to 20,000 tests. Thus the 3,000 samples that are now ready make it possible to check up to 60 million tests throughout the EU. Further information and guidelines for orders are available here . Find more information on the material here .

As a result, European consumers will be able to save on their household bills, help reach EU-wide energy saving goals and reduce emissions. External power supplies are power adaptors used to convert electricity from household power mains into lower voltages, and are very common in European homes, with an average of ten per household and more than 2 billion in total in the EU. The new EU rules will make these external power supplies more energy efficient, aligning them to the highest standards worldwide. It is expected that electricity savings of over 4 TWh\/year by 2030 will be generated, enough to power the whole of Latvia for a month. This will result in avoiding greenhouse gas emission of more than 1.4 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year from 2030 onwards. External power supplies are used, for example, in consumer electronics (smartphones, loudspeakers, sound systems, televisions), ICT products (modems, routers, laptops, tablets, electronic displays), small kitchen appliances (blenders, juicers), and personal convenience products (shavers, electric toothbrushes). The ecodesign regulation for external power supplies is part of a broader package of measures adopted last year, consisting of 10 ecodesign and 6 energy labelling regulations. The full package is expected to deliver a total of 167 TWh of final energy savings per year by 2030. This is equivalent to the annual energy consumption of Denmark. The cumulative savings correspond to a reduction of over 46 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year from 2030 onwards. More information is available here .

EU legislation already provides public buyers in Member States with flexible solutions for rapidly satisfying urgent needs such as purchasing personal protective equipment, medicines and ventilators, to be supplied to those who need them as quickly as possible. Commissioner Breton , in charge of the Internal Market, said: \"Public buyers are under immense pressure in the current emergency situation to ensure the availability of personal protective equipment such as face masks and protective gloves, of lifesaving ventilators and other medical supplies for all of those working relentlessly in the face of this crisis. I want to help them by fully explaining all the flexibilities and solutions provided by the EU public procurement framework to buy such material fast. The current coronavirus crisis presents an extreme and unforeseeable urgency precisely for such a situation our European rules enable public buyers to buy within a matter of days, even hours, if necessary. I urge all public buyers to fully exploit these flexibilities and to not hesitate and ask for further guidance from the Commission if needed.\" The guidance outlines the options and flexibilities provided by the EU legislation. It provides an overview of the choice of tendering procedures available to public buyers and applicable deadlines. The guidance points out possibilities, which range from considerable shortening of the generally applicable deadlines to procuring without prior publication of tender notices in exceptional circumstances, such as the extreme urgency linked to the fight against the coronavirus. It also provides clarification for example on how in this situation of scarcity of key supplies public buyers could find alternative solutions and ways of engaging with the market.

The EU Humanitarian Air Bridge, part of the Team Europe approach, offers air transport capacity to EU Member States in support of immediate logistical needs of humanitarian actors, including transport of humanitarian supplies and staff to and from third countries and covers 100 % of the transport costs. Through its return flights, the initiative also helps with the transport of humanitarian teams on rotation and assists with the repatriation of EU citizens. While needs remain high in many critical areas; the EU's Humanitarian Air Bridge holds up the delivery of vital assistance during the absence of commercial cargo and passenger flights.

Countries supported include Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Somalia, Guinea Bissau, Iraq and Yemen. The 45 Air Bridge flights have also transported 1,475 medical and humanitarian staff since its launch on 8 May 2020. Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic who has been on several Air Bridge flights said: \" The EU has not backed away from global solidarity during the coronavirus pandemic. We need more cooperation and coordination at the international level to really get the pandemic under control. Our EU Air Bridge flights have made a real difference to countries with fragile health systems. We will continue working both at home in Europe and internationally to support our partners facing this common challenge.\" In addition to providing transport capacities, the EU has also provided diplomatic support to facilitate access for the humanitarian delivery.

The RRF is the key instrument at the heart of NextGenerationEU, the EU's plan for emerging stronger from the current crisis. It will make 672.5 billion in loans and grants available to support reforms and investments undertaken by Member States. It will play a crucial role in mitigating the economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic and making European economies and societies more sustainable, resilient and better prepared for the green and digital transitions. Main elements of agreement The agreement, which requires final approval by the European Parliament and the Council, provides that the scope of the RRF will be structured around six pillars: green transition; digital transformation; smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and jobs; social and territorial cohesion; health and resilience; and policies for the next generation, children and youth, including education and skills. The European Union has committed to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and the European Council last week backed the Commission's proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Member States should therefore prioritise reforms and investments that support the climate transition. The agreement provides that a minimum of 37% of expenditure on investments and reforms contained in each national recovery and resilience plan should support climate objectives. In addition, all investments and reforms must respect the \"do no significant harm\" principle, ensuring that they do not significantly harm the environment. Member States should also ensure a high level of ambition when defining reforms and investments enabling the digital transition as part of their recovery and resilience plans. A minimum of 20% of expenditure on investments and reforms contained in each national plan should support the digital transition. The recovery and resilience plans are also expected to contribute to effectively address the challenges identified in relevant country-specific recommendations under the European Semester, the framework for coordinating economic and social policies across the Union. The agreement envisages a strong role for the European Parliament in the governance of the RRF. A regular \"recovery and resilience dialogue\" will enable the Parliament to invite the Commission to discuss different items related to the Facility. A scoreboard will be established and made publicly available to provide information on progress in the implementation of the RRF and national plans. Member States will need to put in place strong measures to protect the financial interests of the Union, especially to prevent fraud, corruption and conflicts of interest. It was also agreed that 13% of the total amount allocated to Member States will be made available in pre-financing upon the approval of recovery and resilience plans, to ensure that the money starts flowing as soon as possible to support the nascent economic recovery. Members of the College said: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"We have an unprecedented financial package - the EU Budget and our recovery plan NextGenerationEU - to power our economies. The Recovery and Resilience Facility will be right at the heart of NextGenerationEU. I welcome today's agreement as an important step towards financing the investments and reforms we need to support the economic recovery and laying the foundations for a stronger, more resilient Europe.\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People, said: \"The EU's three main institutions have now reached political agreement on the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which paves the way for 672.5 billion in loans and grants. This Facility will support national reforms and investments that will support the recovery and help overhaul of EU economies, making them greener and more digital in an inclusive and socially-fair way. Member States now have the certainty they need to finalise their national plans, so they can access this unprecedented funding. We will support them every step along the way to make the most of this opportunity. Our focus now is to get funds flowing to those who need them most and get the EU's collective recovery fully underway.\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" The Recovery and Resilience Facility opens the way for Europe not only to rebuild its economy after the pandemic but to transform it. I want to thank the German Presidency and the European Parliament's negotiators for helping to bring about this robust agreement. We now have a unique chance to deliver on our environmental commitments, to accelerate the digital transition, to boost skills and address inequality. To make a success of this opportunity, the Commission and national authorities must work hand in hand to approve swiftly and then implement effectively a set of ambitious, credible national plans. As this grim year draws to a close, let's look ahead to 2021 with both optimism and determination .\" Next steps The text of the Regulation will now have to be finalised at technical level. The European Parliament and the Council must then formally approve the text so that the Regulation can enter into force as soon as possible. Once the Regulation is in force, Member States will be able submit their recovery and resilience plans, setting out a coherent package of reforms and investment projects. Background On 10 November 2020, a political agreement was reached between the European Parliament, EU Member States in the Council as well as the Commission on the next long-term EU budget and NextGenerationEU. As a next step, the legal adoption of the MFF package along with the ratification of the Own Resources Decision is now urgently needed. Once adopted, the EU's long-term budget, coupled with the NextGenerationEU initiative, which is a temporary instrument designed to drive the recovery of Europe, will be the largest stimulus package ever financed through the EU budget. A total of 1.8 trillion will help rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe. It will be a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe.

We are in a race against time. The faster we reach our target of having 70% of adults in the European Union vaccinated, the better chances we have of containing the virus. And the good news is: Vaccination is picking up speed across Europe! Member States have received over 126 million doses of vaccines as of yesterday. And I am happy to say that today we have reached 100 million vaccinations in the EU. This is a milestone that we can be proud of. Of these 100 million vaccinations, more than a quarter are second doses which means that we have now more than 27 million people fully vaccinated. This is good news. But as we can see with the announcement by Johnson & Johnson yesterday, there are still many factors that can disrupt the planned delivery schedule of vaccines. It is therefore important to act swiftly, anticipate and adjust whenever possible. We are doing everything in our power to support Europe's vaccination roll-out, also by increasing the supply of vaccines in the coming weeks and months. This is why I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with BioNTech-Pfizer to, once again, speed up the delivery of vaccines. 50 million additional doses of BioNTech-Pfizer vaccines will be delivered in quarter 2 of this year, starting in April. Those 50 million doses were initially foreseen for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now, they are available in quarter 2. This will bring the total doses delivered by BioNTech-Pfizer to 250 million doses in the second quarter. These doses will be distributed pro-rata to the population, among all the Member States. This will substantially help consolidate the roll-out of our vaccination campaigns. I want to thank BioNTech-Pfizer. It has proven to be a reliable partner. It has delivered on its commitments, and it is responsive to our needs. This is to the immediate benefit of EU citizens. But let me also focus on the medium term. To prepare for the future, we are drawing the lessons from the first phase of our answer to the pandemic. It is clear that to defeat the virus decisively, we will need to be prepared for the following: At a certain point in time, we might need booster jabs to reinforce and prolong immunity; and if escape-variants occur, we will need to develop vaccines that are adapted to new variants; and we will need them early and in sufficient quantities. Having this in mind we need to focus on technologies that have proven their worth. mRNA vaccines are a clear case in point. Based on all this, we are now entering into a negotiation with BioNTech-Pfizer for a third contract. This contract will foresee the delivery of 1.8 billion doses of vaccine over the period of 2021 to 2023. And it will entail that not only the production of the vaccines, but also all essential components, will be based in the EU. The negotiations we are launching today and hope to conclude very rapidly are a further important step in Europe's response to the pandemic. Other contracts, with other companies, may follow. We are in this together. And we will win this fight against the pandemic together.

This is an important step towards the EU disbursing 5.9 billion in grants under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Belgium's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Belgium to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF at the heart of NextGenerationEU will provide up to 672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Belgian plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market. The Commission assessed Belgium's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms set out in Belgium's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience. Securing Belgium's green and digital transitions The Commission's assessment finds that Belgium's plan devotes 50% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes investments in measures to support the renovation of public and private buildings across the country to increase their energy efficiency, the deployment of alternative energy technologies such as low-carbon hydrogen production and reforms and investments to accelerate the transition to green mobility. It also provides for important investments to restore biodiversity, tackle the growing problem of droughts and promote the efficient use of resources, recycling, and the circular economy. The Commission finds that Belgium's plan devotes 27% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. This includes measures to digitalise the public administration and justice system, the provision of digital skills training, strengthening Belgium's cybersecurity capacity and developing the legal framework for the deployment of 5G. Reinforcing Belgium's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that Belgium's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Belgium by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures to improve the efficiency of public spending and the fiscal and social sustainability of pensions, promote training and skills development, sustainable transport, the energy transition, research and innovation and digital infrastructure. The plan also provides for reforms and investments intended to reduce regulatory and administrative burdens and improve the business environment. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Belgium's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars referred to in the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects Belgium's plan proposes projects in seven European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the green and digital transition. For instance, Belgium has proposed to provide more than 1 billion to renovate public and private buildings, including social housing, to improve their energy performance. Belgium has also proposed to provide around 900 million to boost the digital, language and technical skills of vulnerable groups, job seekers and young people, to improve social inclusion and facilitate access to the labour market. The Commission's assessment finds that none of the measures included in the plan do any significant harm to the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The control systems put in place by Belgium are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said : President Ursula von der Leyen said: \" Today, the European Commission has decided to give its green light to Belgium's recovery and resilience plan. NextGenerationEU will play a crucial role in financing the investments and reforms necessary to build the future we are committed to. The 5.9 billion available to Belgium will finance measures that will contribute to building a greener, more digital future for all of its citizens. The plan places a particularly strong emphasis on measures that will accelerate Belgium's green transition, with 50% of financing directed towards achieving climate objectives. We will stand by Belgium every step of the way to ensure the vision contained in the plan is fully realised .\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" Belgium's recovery plan will help the country's economy to recover from successive COVID lockdowns and get on a greener and more digital path. Half the plan is devoted to supporting climate goals, including with investments to make buildings more energy efficient, support green mobility and alternative energy technologies. The reform of the widely-used company car tax scheme will also contribute to achieving the climate goals. The plan will support a digitalisation drive in the public administration and judiciary, which will help to cut red tape and create a more business-friendly environment. I particularly support the measures that will encourage schoolchildren and workers to have more digital skills, preparing the Belgian labour market for the future. Last but not least, we welcome measures will address the needs of vulnerable groups, including investment in social housing and early child care. Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" Belgium's plan sets out a programme of reforms and investments that should give a major boost both to the country's competitiveness and to its environmental and social sustainability. Two thirds of the plan's investments support the green or digital transition. The reform of the company car scheme and investments in electric buses, charging stations and cycling lanes will cut emissions and improve air quality. Schools and rural areas will enjoy improved connectivity while the justice, health and social security systems will see major improvements in efficiency through digitalisation. Finally, investments in skills should facilitate social integration of vulnerable groups, reduce the digital divide and enhance career perspectives for young people .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a decision to provide 5.9 billion in grants to Belgium under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 770 million to Belgium in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Belgium. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the recovery and resilience plan, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

The plan will support a digitalisation drive in the public administration and judiciary, which will help to cut red tape and create a more business-friendly environment. I particularly support the measures that will encourage schoolchildren and workers to have more digital skills, preparing the Belgian labour market for the future. Last but not least, we welcome measures will address the needs of vulnerable groups, including investment in social housing and early child care. Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" Belgium's plan sets out a programme of reforms and investments that should give a major boost both to the country's competitiveness and to its environmental and social sustainability. Two thirds of the plan's investments support the green or digital transition. The reform of the company car scheme and investments in electric buses, charging stations and cycling lanes will cut emissions and improve air quality. Schools and rural areas will enjoy improved connectivity while the justice, health and social security systems will see major improvements in efficiency through digitalisation. Finally, investments in skills should facilitate social integration of vulnerable groups, reduce the digital divide and enhance career perspectives for young people .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a decision to provide 5.9 billion in grants to Belgium under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 770 million to Belgium in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Belgium. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the recovery and resilience plan, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

With this new 35 million assistance package the EU seeks to substantially increase access to vaccines in the Eastern Partnership region amid the global vaccine shortage, facilitating the vaccine sharing by the EU Member States and reimbursing the cost. This assistance complements the EU's support to the COVAX initiative, the world's facility to ensure fair and universal access to COVID-19 vaccines, and work towards an equitable and transparent distribution of vaccines over the Eastern Partner countries. It comes in addition to the first package of support worth 40 million, launched in February to immediately strengthen preparedness and local readiness for safe and effective vaccination of the population, in partnership with the World Health Organization. EU support included training of health managers and medical staff involved in the vaccination campaign, key logistical support for the delivery and handling of the vaccines and supplies, vaccination data and safety monitoring, communication and community engagement, as well as support for the development of a digital COVID certificate. Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi said: \" The devastating COVID-19 pandemic has put an unprecedented strain on people, health systems and economies worldwide. The Eastern Partnership is unfortunately no exception. The EU is determined to support our Eastern neighbours to speed up vaccination as this will be decisive for ending the pandemic and launching the socio-economic recovery of the region. We care for our partners. \" Background Today's newly adopted programme is part of Team Europe's global COVID-19 response and builds on the joint efforts with the Member States and the EU cooperation with the WHO to date. It further builds on the first regional action to address the COVID-19 pandemic in the Eastern Partnership last year when the EU and WHO joined forces and launched the 35 million Solidarity for Health Initiative in the Eastern Partnership. The action provided substantial medical supplies across the region, including over 11 million items of personal protective equipment, 12,000 lab kits, over 1,500 ventilators, oxygen concentrators and pulse oximeters, and over 20,000 PCR testing kits. The newly adopted package will support effective deployment of vaccines received by the partner countries directly through the EU Vaccine Sharing Mechanism and indirectly through COVAX and direct procurement from producers of COVID-19 vaccines. Team Europe is one of the lead contributors to COVAX with close to 3 billion for the COVAX Facility, which remains the key global vehicle to ensure fair and equitable access to these vaccines and delivers on international vaccine solidarity. To complement COVAX's efforts, Team Europe is aiming to donate at least 200 million doses to partner countries before the end of the year. A majority is expected to be delivered through COVAX.

This follows the tasking by European leaders in March 2020 to resolutely counter disinformation and reinforce resilience of European societies. The coronavirus pandemic has been accompanied by a massive wave of false or misleading information, including attempts by foreign actors to influence EU citizens and debates. The Joint Communication analyses the immediate response and proposes concrete action that can be quickly set in motion. High Representative\/Vice-President Josep Borrell said: \"Disinformation in times of the coronavirus can kill. We have a duty to protect our citizens by making them aware of false information, and expose the actors responsible for engaging in such practices. In today's technology-driven world, where warriors wield keyboards rather than swords and targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns are a recognised weapon of state and non-state actors, the European Union is increasing its activities and capacities in this fight.\" Vice-President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova said: \"Disinformation waves have hit Europe during the Coronavirus pandemic. They originated from within as well as outside the EU. To fight disinformation, we need to mobilise all relevant players from online platforms to public authorities, and support independent fact checkers and media. While online platforms have taken positive steps during the pandemic, they need to step up their efforts. Our actions are strongly embedded in fundamental rights, in particular freedom of expression and information.\" The crisis has become a test case showing how the EU and its democratic societies deal with the disinformation challenge. The following aspects are key for a stronger and more resilient EU: Understand : First, it is important to distinguish between illegal content and content that is harmful but not illegal. Then, there are blurred boundaries between the various forms of false or misleading content: from disinformation, which is defined as intentional, to misinformation, which can be unintentional. The motivation can range from targeted influence operations by foreign actors to purely economic motives. A calibrated response is needed to each of these challenges. Furthermore, there is a need to provide more data for public scrutiny and improve analytical capacities. Communicate : During the crisis, the EU has been stepping up its work to inform citizens about the risks and to enhance cooperation with other international actors to tackle disinformation. The Commission has been rebutting myths around the coronavirus , which have been viewed more than 7 million times. The European External Action Service, together with the Commission, enhanced strategic communication and public diplomacy in third countries, including the EU's neighbourhood. Foreign actors and certain third countries, in particular Russia and China, have engaged in targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally. For example, the EEAS East Stratcom Task Force detected and exposed more than 550 disinformation narratives from pro-Kremlin sources on the EUvsDisinfo website . Cooperation has been an important cornerstone of the fight against disinformation: With the European Parliament and the Council and between EU institutions and Member States , by using established channels, such as the Rapid Alert System and the EU integrated political crisis response . These channels will be further developed to strengthen capacities, to improve risk analysis and vital reporting in times of crisis. With international partners, including the WHO, the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism, NATO and others. This led to an increased sharing of information, activities and best practices. It should be intensified to better address foreign influence and disinformation. The EU will step up support and assistance to civil society actors, independent media and journalists in third countries as part of the 'Team Europe' package, and enhance support for monitoring violations of press freedom and advocacy for a safer media environment. Finally, many consumers were misled to buy overpriced, ineffective or potentially dangerous products, and platform have removed millions of misleading advertisements. The Commission will continue to cooperate with online platforms and support the Consumer Protection Cooperation network of national authorities to fight these practices that infringe consumer protection law . Transparency : The Commission has closely monitored the actions of online platforms under the Code of Practice on Disinformation . There is a need for additional efforts, increased transparency and greater accountability: Platforms should provide monthly reports that include more detailed data on their actions to promote authoritative content, improve users' awareness, and limit coronavirus disinformation and advertising related to it. They should also step up their cooperation with fact-checkers - in all Members States, for all languages - and researchers, and be more transparent about implementation of their policies to inform users that interact with disinformation . The Commission strongly encourages other relevant stakeholders that are not yet signatories to the Code to participate in this new monitoring programme . B uilding on the work of the newly established European Digital Media Observatory , the EU will further strengthen its support to fact-checkers and researchers. Ensuring freedom of expression and pluralistic democratic debate is central to our disinformation response. The Commission will continue monitoring the impact of emergency measures taken by Member States in the coronavirus context, on EU law and values. The crisis demonstrated the role of free and independent media as an essential service, providing citizens with reliable, fact-checked information, contributing to saving lives. The EU will strengthen its support to independent media and journalists in the EU and around the world. The Commission calls upon Member States to intensify efforts to ensure that journalists can work safely and to make the most of the EU's economic response and recovery package to support media heavily hit by the crisis, while respecting their independence. Empowering citizens, raising citizens awareness and increasing societal resilience implies enabling citizens to participate in the democratic debate by preserving access to information and freedom of expression, promoting citizens' media and information literacy, including critical thinking and digital skills. This can be done through media literacy projects and support to civil society organisations. Next steps The actions proposed today will feed into future EU work on disinformation, notably the European Democracy Action Plan and the Digital Services Act . Background The European Union has been actively tackling disinformation since 2015. Following a decision of the European Council in March 2015 , the East StratCom Task Force in the European External Action Service (EEAS) was set up. In 2016, the Joint Framework on countering hybrid threats was adopted, followed by the Joint Communication on increasing resilience and bolstering capabilities to address hybrid threats in 2018. The Action Plan against Disinformation of December 2018 outlined four pillars for the EU's fight against disinformation: 1) improving the capabilities to detect, analyse and expose disinformation; 2) strengthening coordinated and joint responses, i.a. through the Rapid Alert System; 3) mobilising the private sector to tackle disinformation; 4) raising awareness and improving societal resilience. In October 2018, the Code of Practice was signed by Facebook, Google, Twitter and Mozilla as well as trade associations representing online platforms, the advertising industry, and advertisers as a self-regulatory tool to tackle disinformation. Microsoft joined the Code in 2019. The signatories submitted self-assessments in October 2019. The Commission will publish a comprehensive assessment in the forthcoming weeks. Finally, in a Joint Communication of June 2019 , the Commission and the High Representative concluded that while the European elections of May 2019 were not free from disinformation, the actions taken by the EU have contributed to narrow down the space for third-country influence as well as coordinated campaigns to manipulate public opinion.

The new call for expressions of interest contributes to the Commission's 1.4 billion pledge to the Coronavirus Global Response initiative, launched by President Ursula von der Leyen on 4 May 2020. The new call is the latest addition to a range of EU-funded research and innovation actions to fight the coronavirus. It complements earlier actions to develop diagnostics, treatments and vaccines by strengthening capacity to manufacture and deploying readily available solutions in order to rapidly address the pressing needs. It will also improve understanding of the behavioural and socio-economic impacts of the epidemic. Mariya Gabriel , Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"We are mobilising all means at our disposal to fight this pandemic with testing, treatments and prevention. But to succeed against the coronavirus, we must also understand how it impacts our society and how to best deploy these interventions rapidly. We must explore technological solutions to manufacture medical equipment and supplies faster, to monitor and prevent the spread of the disease, and to better care for patients.\" Thierry Breton , Commissioner for Internal Market, added: \"We are supporting the health authorities, healthcare professionals and the general public in all Member States in tackling the coronavirus crisis. To this end, we are deploying innovative technologies and tools that can quickly be used to prevent, optimally treat, and recover from this pandemic and prepare for its aftermath. These include digital solutions and technologies such as telemedicine, data, AI, robotics, and photonics.\" The projects funded under this call should repurpose manufacturing for rapid production of vital medical supplies and equipment needed for testing, treatment and prevention, as well as develop medical technologies and digital tools to improve detection, surveillance and patients care. New research will learn from large groups of patients (cohorts) across Europe and better understanding of the behavioural and socio-economic impacts of the coronavirus epidemic could help improve treatment and prevention strategies. The deadline for submission is 11 June 2020, while the call will focus on delivering results quickly. Europe, and the world at large, urgently need innovative solutions to contain and mitigate the outbreak, and to better care for patients, survivors, vulnerable groups, frontline health care staff and their communities. This is why the Commission aims to enable research work to start as quickly as possible through shorter timelines for the preparation of expressions of interest and for their evaluation. The new solutions need to be available and affordable for all, in line with the principles of the Coronavirus Global Response. For this purpose, the Commission will include rapid data-sharing clauses in grant agreements, resulting from this new call, to ensure that findings and outcomes can be put to use immediately. Background This new special call under Horizon 2020 complements earlier actions to support 18 projects with 48.2 million to develop diagnostics, treatments, vaccines and preparedness for epidemics, as well as the 117 million invested in 8 projects on diagnostics and treatments through the Innovative Medicines Initiative, and measures to support innovative ideas through the European Innovation Council . It implements Action 3 of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan, a working document resulting from dialogues between the Commission services and national institutions. The new call will cover five areas with the following indicative budgets: Repurposing of manufacturing for vital medical supplies and equipment (23 million) Medical technologies, Digital tools and Artificial Intelligence analytics to improve surveillance and care at high Technology Readiness Levels (56 million) Behavioural, social and economic impacts of the outbreak responses (20 million) Pan-European COVID-19 cohorts (20 million) Collaboration of existing EU and international cohorts of relevance to COVID-19 (3 million) Cohort studies typically observe large groups of individuals, recording their exposure to certain risk factors to find clues as to the possible causes of disease.

We need health equity and global justice, and we know that only by uniting to fight for the world we want can we build back toward a healthier future for all.\" BACKGROUND The Global Goal: Unite for our Future campaign was launched on 28 May under the patronage of President Ursula von der Leyen . The campaign, supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, focuses on addressing the pandemic's impact on the most vulnerable communities, ensuring equitable access to affordable coronavirus technologies and strengthening health systems everywhere. Pledges announced on 27 June will support the following organisations: Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Therapeutics Accelerator UNITAID WHO's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund , powered by the UN Foundation The International and Regional Response Network The Global Goal: Unite for our Future campaign is supported by Foundation Partners Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, and Corporate Partners Citi, Procter & Gamble, SAP, Verizon and Vodafone. The campaign is a milestone under the Coronavirus Global Response , the global action for universal access to affordable coronavirus vaccination, treatment and testing. It is the Commission's response to the global call for action launched by the World Health Organization with governments and partners on 24 April 2020, for access to coronavirus vaccines everywhere, for everyone who needs them. To help protect people everywhere, the Commission has recently presented an EU Vaccines Strategy to speed up the development, manufacturing and deployment of coronavirus vaccines. With this strategy, the Commission will support efforts to accelerate the development and availability of safe and effective vaccines in a timeframe between 12 and 18 months, if not earlier. Delivering on this complex undertaking requires running clinical trials in parallel with investing in production capacity to be able to produce millions, or even billions, of doses of a successful vaccine. The Commission is fully mobilised to support the efforts of vaccine developers in their endeavour. In addition, as a way to enhance vaccine multilateralism and avoid harmful competition between countries, President von der Leyen has proposed to explore, with our international partners, the creation of an inclusive international vaccine procurement mechanism. For this to work, a significant number of high-income countries would need to join an international buyers' group. They would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies, while at the same time enabling advance reservations for low- and middle-income countries. This would accelerate the development of vaccines and improve access to them across the world for all who need it.

It provides guidance to national authorities, labour inspectorates, and social partners to guarantee the rights, health and safety of seasonal workers, and to ensure that seasonal workers are aware of their rights. Cross-border seasonal workers enjoy a broad set of rights, but given the temporary nature of their work, they can be more vulnerable to precarious working and living conditions. The coronavirus pandemic has given more visibility to these conditions, and in some cases exacerbated them. In some cases such problems can increase the risk of COVID-19 clusters. Nicolas Schmit , the Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: \" Each year, hundreds of thousands of seasonal workers help to underpin hugely important sectors of the EU's economy, such as food and agriculture. The coronavirus pandemic has shone a light on the challenging living and working conditions they face. This has to be addressed. Our guidelines are a wake-up call to Member States and companies to ensure they are fulfilling their duties to protect indispensable, yet vulnerable, workers.\" While the Commission monitors the proper application of Union rules in relation to seasonal workers, the responsibility for their proper application belongs to national authorities. Thus, appropriate actions are needed as a matter of urgency. The guidelines cover a range of aspects, such as: the right of seasonal workers to work in an EU Member State regardless of whether they are EU nationals or come from countries outside the EU suitable living and working conditions, including physical distancing and appropriate hygiene measures clear communication to workers of their rights undeclared work social security aspects National action The Guidelines call on national authorities and social partners to make a renewed effort in fulfilling their role of ensuring the proper application and enforcement of the rules. They include concrete recommendations and suggestions on activities to be undertaken at national or EU level, such as: Calling on Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure decent working and living conditions for seasonal workers Calling on Member States to raise awareness on Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) requirements affecting seasonal workers, helping employers implement the relevant legal requirements and providing clear information to workers in a language they understand Inviting Member States to provide practical guidance to smaller companies Asking Member States to strengthen field inspections to ensure to the proper application of the OSH rules for seasonal workers The Commission will continue to work with Member States, social partners, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and the European Labour Authority (ELA) on this important issue. EU action The Commission has planned a number of actions to boost the protection of seasonal workers' rights, including: A study collecting data on intra-EU seasonal work and identifying the main challenges, including in relation to sub-contracting; A survey on high-risk occupations, including seasonal workers, carried out by the EU-OSHA in close collaboration with the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee; An awareness-raising campaign targeting sectors more exposed to seasonal work, coordinated by ELA; A hearing with European social partners on seasonal workers; A comparative analysis study in different Member States by the network of legal experts on free movement and the coordination of social security ( MoveS ); Support to Member States through the European Platform tackling undeclared work and the #EU4FairWork4 campaign , to foster better awareness of rights and obligations among workers and employers. Background The Guidelines presented today recall the rights of seasonal workers regardless of their status: whether they are EU citizens or third-country nationals, including those working regularly abroad on their own accord, or are posted for example through temporary work and recruitment agencies. It is essential that seasonal workers and their employers have all the information they need both about the protection they enjoy as well as the obligations they need to fulfil. More than 17.6 million EU citizens live or work in a Member States other than that of their nationality. Certain sectors of the European economy, in particular the agri-food and tourism sectors, depend on the support of seasonal workers from EU and non-EU countries for specific periods of the year. The Commission estimates that the average of active seasonal workers in the EU per year is between several hundred thousand and a million. While the Commission monitors the proper application of Union and national law rules in relation to seasonal workers in the EU, the responsibility for the proper application of these rules belongs to national authorities. In order to protect seasonal workers, Member States are invited to step up the enforcement of existing EU and national law and strengthen the field inspections in this respect, including with the support of the European Labour Authority (ELA). These guidelines complement the Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak , published on 30 March 2020, and respond to a call of the European Parliament in its resolution of 19 June 2020 on the protection of cross-border and seasonal workers.

The Commission will use a diversified funding strategy to raise up to around 800 billion in current prices until 2026. This approach, which will be in line with the best practices of sovereign issuers, will enable the Commission to raise the needed volumes in a smooth and efficient way. This will also attract investors to Europe and strengthen the international role of the euro. Johannes Hahn , Commissioner in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \"NextGenerationEU is a game changer for European capital markets. Today, we are unveiling the engine that will pump the fuel to power NextGenerationEU. The funding strategy will operationalise the NextGenerationEU borrowing, so we will have all necessary tools in place to kick-start the social and economic recovery and promote our green, digital and resilient growth. The message is clear: as soon as the Commission has been legally enabled to borrow, we are ready to get going!\" Borrowing to finance the recovery NextGenerationEU at the heart of the EU's response to the coronavirus pandemic will be funded by borrowing on the capital markets. We will raise up to around 800 billion between now and end-2026. This will translate into borrowing volumes of on average roughly 150 billion per year, which will make the EU one of the largest issuers in euro. All borrowing will be repaid by 2058. While the Commission has been borrowing before to support EU Member States and third countries the volumes, frequency and complexity of the NextGenerationEU borrowing have called for a fundamental change in the approach to capital markets. A diversified funding strategy will respond to these new funding needs. It will enable the Commission to mobilise all funds when required on the most advantageous terms for the EU Member States and their citizens. Diversified funding strategy: a snapshot A diversified funding strategy combines the use of different funding instruments and funding techniques with an open and transparent communication to the market participants. The Commission's diversified funding strategy would combine: Annual decision on borrowing volumes and 6-monthly communication on the funding plan's key parameters, to offer transparency and predictability to investors and other stakeholders; Structured and transparent relationships with banks supporting the issuance programme (via a Primary Dealer Network); Multiple funding instruments (medium and long-term bonds, some of which will be issued as NextGenerationEU green bonds, and EU-Bills) to maintain flexibility in terms of market access and to manage liquidity needs and the maturity profile; A combination of auctions and syndications, to ensure cost efficient access to the necessary funding on advantageous terms. The borrowing operations will be embedded in a robust governance framework, which will ensure coherent and consistent execution. In its work, the Commission will continue to coordinate with other issuers, including the EU Member States and supranationals. The added value of a diversified funding strategy The diversified funding strategy will help the Commission to achieve two main objectives: address the large funding needs of NextGenerationEU and obtain the desired low cost and low execution risk in the interest of all Member States and their citizens: By using a wide range of maturities and instruments and by making funding operations more predictable, the Commission will ensure a larger market absorption capacity. The ability to auction debt will make the funding operations even more efficient. This will help address the large funding needs. By allowing flexibility to decide when to execute funding operations and which funding techniques or instruments to use, the Commission will obtain the desired low cost and low execution risk in the interest of all Member States . Next steps Following today's package, the Commission will proceed with a series of steps to operationalise the diversified funding strategy. Among them: Setting up a Primary Dealer Network. In line with practices of comparable issuers, the Commission will set up a Primary Dealer Network to facilitate the efficient execution of auctions and syndicated transactions, support liquidity in the secondary markets, and ensure the placement of our debt with the widest possible investor base. The application form and the General Terms and Conditions for participation will be published shortly. Publish the first annual Borrowing Decision (and accompanying Financing Decision) and first NextGenerationEU funding plan. To ensure transparent communication with the markets, the Commission will adopt its first annual borrowing decision and communicate the information related to its first funding plan before the start of the NextGenerationEU borrowing, expected this summer (timing being dependent on the approval of the Own Resources Decision by all Member States which will empower the Commission to borrow for NextGenerationEU). The borrowing operations can then start as soon as the Own Resources Decision will enter into force. Funding plans will then be updated semi-annually. Background NextGenerationEU NextGenerationEU is at the heart of the EU response to the coronavirus crisis and aims to support the economic recovery and build a greener, more digital and more resilient future. The EU agreed this instrument as part of an over 2 trillion (in current prices) or 1.8 trillion (in 2018 prices) stimulus package, which also comprises the 2021-2027 long-term budget. The centrepiece of NextGenerationEU is the Recovery and Resilience Facility - an instrument to offer grants and loans to support reforms and investments in the EU Member States with a total value of 723.8 billion in current prices. In addition, NextGenerationEU will reinforce several EU programmes. To finance NextGenerationEU, the EU will borrow on the capital markets. Repayment will take place over a long-time horizon, until 2058. This will avoid immediate pressure on Member States' national finances and enable EU Member States to focus their efforts on the recovery. To help repay the borrowing, the EU will look into introducing new own resources (or sources of revenue) to the EU budget, on top of the already existing ones. The EU as a borrower The European Commission, on behalf of the EU, is a well-established participant in the capital markets. Over a period of 40 years, the European Commission has run several lending programmes to support EU Member States and third countries. Last year, the Commission also started borrowing for SURE the up to 100 billion instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in employment. So far, 3\/4ths of the EU SURE funds have been raised in six very successful issuances, which has made it possible to finance loans to Member States on very advantageous terms. All of these lending operations were financed on a back-to-back basis, mainly through syndicated bond issuances.

This will also attract investors to Europe and strengthen the international role of the euro. Johannes Hahn , Commissioner in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \"NextGenerationEU is a game changer for European capital markets. Today, we are unveiling the engine that will pump the fuel to power NextGenerationEU. The funding strategy will operationalise the NextGenerationEU borrowing, so we will have all necessary tools in place to kick-start the social and economic recovery and promote our green, digital and resilient growth. The message is clear: as soon as the Commission has been legally enabled to borrow, we are ready to get going!\" Borrowing to finance the recovery NextGenerationEU at the heart of the EU's response to the coronavirus pandemic will be funded by borrowing on the capital markets. We will raise up to around 800 billion between now and end-2026. This will translate into borrowing volumes of on average roughly 150 billion per year, which will make the EU one of the largest issuers in euro. All borrowing will be repaid by 2058. While the Commission has been borrowing before to support EU Member States and third countries the volumes, frequency and complexity of the NextGenerationEU borrowing have called for a fundamental change in the approach to capital markets. A diversified funding strategy will respond to these new funding needs. It will enable the Commission to mobilise all funds when required on the most advantageous terms for the EU Member States and their citizens. Diversified funding strategy: a snapshot A diversified funding strategy combines the use of different funding instruments and funding techniques with an open and transparent communication to the market participants. The Commission's diversified funding strategy would combine: Annual decision on borrowing volumes and 6-monthly communication on the funding plan's key parameters, to offer transparency and predictability to investors and other stakeholders; Structured and transparent relationships with banks supporting the issuance programme (via a Primary Dealer Network); Multiple funding instruments (medium and long-term bonds, some of which will be issued as NextGenerationEU green bonds, and EU-Bills) to maintain flexibility in terms of market access and to manage liquidity needs and the maturity profile; A combination of auctions and syndications, to ensure cost efficient access to the necessary funding on advantageous terms. The borrowing operations will be embedded in a robust governance framework, which will ensure coherent and consistent execution. In its work, the Commission will continue to coordinate with other issuers, including the EU Member States and supranationals. The added value of a diversified funding strategy The diversified funding strategy will help the Commission to achieve two main objectives: address the large funding needs of NextGenerationEU and obtain the desired low cost and low execution risk in the interest of all Member States and their citizens: By using a wide range of maturities and instruments and by making funding operations more predictable, the Commission will ensure a larger market absorption capacity. The ability to auction debt will make the funding operations even more efficient. This will help address the large funding needs. By allowing flexibility to decide when to execute funding operations and which funding techniques or instruments to use, the Commission will obtain the desired low cost and low execution risk in the interest of all Member States . Next steps Following today's package, the Commission will proceed with a series of steps to operationalise the diversified funding strategy. Among them: Setting up a Primary Dealer Network. In line with practices of comparable issuers, the Commission will set up a Primary Dealer Network to facilitate the efficient execution of auctions and syndicated transactions, support liquidity in the secondary markets, and ensure the placement of our debt with the widest possible investor base. The application form and the General Terms and Conditions for participation will be published shortly. Publish the first annual Borrowing Decision (and accompanying Financing Decision) and first NextGenerationEU funding plan. To ensure transparent communication with the markets, the Commission will adopt its first annual borrowing decision and communicate the information related to its first funding plan before the start of the NextGenerationEU borrowing, expected this summer (timing being dependent on the approval of the Own Resources Decision by all Member States which will empower the Commission to borrow for NextGenerationEU). The borrowing operations can then start as soon as the Own Resources Decision will enter into force. Funding plans will then be updated semi-annually. Background NextGenerationEU NextGenerationEU is at the heart of the EU response to the coronavirus crisis and aims to support the economic recovery and build a greener, more digital and more resilient future. The EU agreed this instrument as part of an over 2 trillion (in current prices) or 1.8 trillion (in 2018 prices) stimulus package, which also comprises the 2021-2027 long-term budget. The centrepiece of NextGenerationEU is the Recovery and Resilience Facility - an instrument to offer grants and loans to support reforms and investments in the EU Member States with a total value of 723.8 billion in current prices. In addition, NextGenerationEU will reinforce several EU programmes. To finance NextGenerationEU, the EU will borrow on the capital markets. Repayment will take place over a long-time horizon, until 2058. This will avoid immediate pressure on Member States' national finances and enable EU Member States to focus their efforts on the recovery. To help repay the borrowing, the EU will look into introducing new own resources (or sources of revenue) to the EU budget, on top of the already existing ones. The EU as a borrower The European Commission, on behalf of the EU, is a well-established participant in the capital markets. Over a period of 40 years, the European Commission has run several lending programmes to support EU Member States and third countries. Last year, the Commission also started borrowing for SURE the up to 100 billion instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in employment. So far, 3\/4ths of the EU SURE funds have been raised in six very successful issuances, which has made it possible to finance loans to Member States on very advantageous terms. All of these lending operations were financed on a back-to-back basis, mainly through syndicated bond issuances.

Once endorsed by the Council, it will allow Member States to undertake measures to deal adequately with the crisis, while departing from the budgetary requirements that would normally apply under the European fiscal framework. The proposal represents an important step in fulfilling the Commission's commitment to use all economic policy tools at its disposal to support Member States' in protecting their citizens and mitigating the pandemic's severely negative socio-economic consequences. President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"Today we propose maximum flexibility for our rules which will allow our national governments to support everybody - their healthcare systems, staff as well as the people so severly affected by the crisis. I want to make sure that we respond to the human as well as socio-economic dimension of the Coronavirus pandemic in the best way possible.\" The coronavirus pandemic is a major shock for the European and global economies. Member States have already adopted or are adopting budgetary measures to increase the capacity of their health systems and provide relief to those citizens and sectors that are particularly impacted.

The Commission calls on the Council to endorse its proposal as quickly as possible. The Commission stands ready to take further action as the situation evolves. Background The Commission and the Council have already clarified that the coronavirus pandemic qualifies as an \"unusual event outside the control of government\". The Commission believes that more far-reaching flexibility under the SGP is required to protect European citizens and businesses from the consequences of this crisis and to support the economy following the pandemic. Therefore, the Commission decided to propose the activation of the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission's strategy to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic includes using the full flexibility of our fiscal and state-aid frameworks, mobilising the EU budget to allow the EIB Group to provide short-term liquidity to SMEs and directing 37 billion to the fight against coronavirus under the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative. Today's proposal follows the Commission's adoption a Temporary Framework for State-aid to enable Member States to ensure that sufficient liquidity remains available to businesses of all types and to preserve the continuity of economic activity during and after the coronavirus pandemic.

In a Communication adopted today, it calls on Member States to accelerate the roll-out of vaccination across the EU: by March 2021, at least 80% of people over the age of 80, and 80% of health and social care professionals in every Member State should be vaccinated. And by summer 2021, Member States should have vaccinated a minimum of 70% of the adult population. The Commission also calls on Member States to continue to apply physical distancing, limit social contacts, fight disinformation, coordinate travel restrictions, ramp up testing, and increase contact tracing and genome sequencing to face up to the risk from new variants of the virus. As recent weeks have seen an upward trend in case numbers, more needs to be done to support healthcare systems and to address \"COVID-fatigue\" in the coming months, from accelerating vaccination across the board, helping our partners in the Western Balkans, the Southern and Eastern neighbourhood and in Africa. Today's Communication sets out key actions for Member States, the Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which will help reduce risks and keep the virus under control: Speeding up the roll-out of vaccination across the EU By March 2021 , at least 80% of people over the age of 80 , and 80% of health and social care professionals in every Member State, should be vaccinated . By summer 2021 , Member States should have vaccinated 70% of the entire adult population . The Commission, Member States and the EMA will work with companies to use the EU's potential for increased vaccine manufacturing capacity to the fullest. The Commission is working with Member States on vaccination certificates, in full compliance with EU data protection law, which can support the continuity of care. A common approach is to be agreed by the end of January 2021 to allow Member States' certificates to be rapidly useable in health systems across the EU and beyond. Testing and genome sequencing Member States should update their testing strategies to account for new variants and expand the use of rapid antigen tests . Member States should urgently increase genome sequencing to at least 5% and preferably 10% of positive test results . At present, many Member States are testing under 1% of samples, which is not enough to identify the progression of the variants or detect any new ones. Preserving the Single Market and free movement while stepping up mitigation measures Measures should be applied to further reduce the risk of transmission linked to the means of travel, such as hygiene and distancing measures in vehicles and terminuses. All non-essential travel should be strongly discouraged until the epidemiological situation has considerably improved. Proportionate travel restrictions, including testing of travellers, should be maintained for those travelling from areas with a higher incidence of variants of concern. Ensuring European leadership and international solidarity To ensure early access to vaccines, the Commission is to set up a Team Europe mechanism to structure the provision of vaccines shared by Member States with partner countries. This should allow for sharing with partner countries access to some of the 2.3 billion doses secured through the EU's Vaccines Strategy, paying special attention to the Western Balkans, our Eastern and Southern neighbourhood and Africa. The European Commission and Member States should continue supporting COVAX, including through early access to vaccines. Team Europe has already mobilised 853 million in support of COVAX , making the EU one of COVAX's biggest donors. Members of the College said: President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen , said: \" Vaccination is essential to get out of this crisis. We have already secured enough vaccines for the entire population of the European Union. Now we need to accelerate the delivery and speed up vaccination. Our aim is to have 70% of our adult population vaccinated by summer. That could be a turning point in our fight against this virus. However, we will only end this pandemic when everyone in the world has access to vaccines. We will step up our efforts to help secure vaccines for our neighbours and partners worldwide .\" Vice-President Margaritis Schinas , responsible for Promoting our European Way of Life, said: \"The emergence of new variants of the virus and substantial rises in cases leave us no room for complacency. Now more than ever must come a renewed determination for Europe to act together with unity, coordination and vigilance. Our proposals today aim to protect more lives and livelihoods later and relieve the burden on already stretched health care systems and workers. This is how the EU will come out of the crisis. The end of the pandemic is in sight though not yet in reach.\" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said : \" Working together with unity, solidary and determination, we can soon start to see the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Now in particular, we need swift and coordinated action against the new variants of the virus. Vaccinations will still take time until they reach all Europeans and until then we must take immediate, coordinated and proactive steps together. Vaccinations must accelerate across the EU and testing and sequencing must be increased this is show we can ensure that we leave this crisis behind us as soon as possible.\" Background Today's Communication builds on the ' Staying safe from COVID-19 during winter ' Communication of 2 December 2020.
