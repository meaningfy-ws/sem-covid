to help protect people everywhere, the European Commission is presenting a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of vaccines against COVID-19. An effective and safe vaccine against the virus is our best bet to achieve a permanent solution to the pandemic. Time is of the essence. Every month gained in finding such a vaccine saves lives, livelihoods and billions of euros. Today's strategy proposes a joint EU approach and builds on the mandate received from EU health ministers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThis is a moment for science and solidarity. Nothing is certain, but I am confident that we can mobilise the resources to find a vaccine to beat this virus once and for all. We must be ready to manufacture and deploy such a vaccine across Europe and the world. This vaccine will be a breakthrough in the fight against the coronavirus, and a testament to what partners can achieve when we put our minds, research and resources together. The European Union will do all in its power to ensure that all peoples of this world have access to a vaccine, irrespective of where they live.\u201d \n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides said: \u201cWorking together will increase our chances of securing access to a safe and effective vaccine at the scale we need and as quickly as possible. It will ensure fair and equitable access for all across the EU and globally, thus offering the best opportunity of finding a permanent exit strategy from the COVID-19 crisis. This is the EU at its best: pooling resources, joining efforts, bringing tangible results to the everyday lives of people. No one is safe until everyone is safe and we will leave no stones unturned in our efforts to protect EU and global citizens.\u201d\n\nVaccine development is a complex and lengthy process. With today's strategy, the Commission will support efforts to accelerate the development and availability of safe and effective vaccines in a timeframe between 12 and 18 months, if not earlier. Delivering on this complex undertaking requires running clinical trials in parallel with investing in production capacity to be able to produce millions, or even billions, of doses of a successful vaccine. The Commission is fully mobilised to support the efforts of vaccine developers in their endeavour.\n\nThis is not a European challenge, but a global one. The European Union will not be safe until the entire world has access to a vaccine, and as such, the EU and its Member States have both a responsibility and an interest to make a vaccine universally available.\n\nAn important step towards joint action between Member States has already been taken in the formation of an inclusive vaccine Alliance by France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The EU Vaccine Strategy will implement a joint approach going forward.\n\nThe strategy has the following objectives:\n\n\tEnsuring the quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines.\n\tSecuring swift access to vaccines for Member States and their populations while leading the global solidarity effort.\n\tEnsuring equitable access to an affordable vaccine as early as possible.\n\n\nThe EU strategy rests on two pillars:\n\n\tSecuring the production of vaccines in the EU and sufficient supplies for its Member States through Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers via the Emergency Support Instrument. Additional financing and other forms of support can be made available on top of such agreements.\n\tAdapting the EU's regulatory framework to the current urgency and making use of existing regulatory flexibility to accelerate the development, authorisation and availability of vaccines while maintaining the standards for vaccine quality, safety and efficacy.\n\n\nAdvance Purchase Agreements\n\nIn order to support companies in the swift development and production of a vaccine, the Commission will enter into agreements with individual vaccine producers on behalf of the Member States. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission will finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers. This will take the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided will be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nThe related funding will come from a significant part of the \u20ac2.7 billion Emergency Support Instrument. Additional support will be available through loans from the European Investment Bank.\n\nFinancing criteria \n\nWhen taking the financing decision on what vaccines to support, the following non-exhaustive criteria will be taken into account, including: soundness of scientific approach and technology used, speed of delivery at scale, cost, risk sharing, liability, coverage of different technologies, early engagement with EU regulators, global solidarity, and capacity to supply through development of production capacity within the EU.\n\nThere is always a risk that supported candidates fail during clinical trials. This Strategy is therefore similar to an insurance policy, by transferring some of the risks from industry to public authorities in return for assuring Member States of equitable and affordable access to a vaccine, should one become available.\n\nA flexible and robust regulatory process\n\nRegulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will make the greatest use of existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. This includes an accelerated procedure for authorisation, flexibility in relation to labelling and packaging, and a proposal to provide temporary derogations from certain provisions of the GMO legislation to speed up clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines containing genetically modified organisms.\n\nCompanies with a promising vaccine candidate, already in or close to starting clinical trials, are invited to contact the Commission at EC-VACCINES@ec.europa.eu.\n\nGlobal solidarity \n\nThe EU is contributing to the global effort for universal testing, treatment and vaccination by mobilising resources through international pledging and by joining forces with countries and global health organisations through the Access To Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator collaborative framework. The Global Coronavirus Response pledging campaign raised \u20ac9.8 billion by the end of May 2020. A second step is underway in partnership with Global Citizen and other governmental and non-governmental partners, culminating in a global pledging summit on 27 June.\n\nThe European Commission is committed to the principle of universal, equitable and affordable access to vaccines, especially for the most vulnerable countries. It is ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world.\n\nMore information\n\nPresident von der Leyen's video message is available in English, French, German, and sign language.\u00a0\n\nCommunication on the EU Strategy for COVID-19 vaccines\n\nCoronavirus Vaccines Strategy Factsheet\n\nWebsite on the Commission's Coronavirus Response\n\nCoronavirus Global Response Website\n\nCoronavirus Global Response Factsheet\n\n","073e22ec2b44a5f2f6289f09dc954ecd6ca6cbb4a4b33ffd88c3c150572569c0":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Commission, in cooperation with the President of the European Council, has put forward a European roadmap to phase-out the containment measures due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nWhile we are still in firefighting mode, the necessary extraordinary measures taken by Member States and the EU are working. They have slowed down the spread of the virus and saved thousands of lives. However, these measures and the corresponding uncertainty come at a dramatic cost to people, society and the economy, and cannot last indefinitely.\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cSaving lives and protecting Europeans from the coronavirus is our number one priority. At the same time, it is time to look ahead and to focus on protecting livelihoods. Even though conditions in the Member States still vary widely, all Europeans rightly ask themselves when and in what order the confinement measures can be lifted. Responsible planning on the ground, wisely balancing the interests of protection of public health with those of the functioning of our societies, needs a solid foundation. That's why the Commission has drawn up a catalogue of guidelines, criteria and measures that provide a basis for thoughtful action. The strength of Europe lies in its social and economic balance. Together we learn from each other and help our European Union out of this crisis.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food safety Stella Kyriakides said: \u201cReturning to normality after the corona lockdowns will require a carefully coordinated and European approach between Member States, based on science and in the spirit of solidarity. It is crucial that our healthcare systems have the capacity to treat increases in new cases, that essential medicines and equipment are available and that we have large-scale testing and tracing capacity in place. We know that this road will be long and gradual and that the consequences of this unprecedented health crisis will be long lasting. Until effective treatments and a vaccine are found, we will have to learn to live with this virus. But Europe will be back on its feet, together and united. This is the only way.\u201d\n\nWhile recognising the specificities of each country, the European roadmap establishes the following key principles:\n\n\tTiming is essential. Deciding that the time has cometo begin to relax confinement should be based on these criteria:\n\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Epidemiological criteria showing that the spread of the disease has significantly decreased and stabilised for a sustained period.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Sufficient health system capacity, for example taking into account the occupation rate for intensive care units, the availability of health care workers and medical material.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Appropriate monitoring capacity, including large-scale testing capacity to quickly detect and isolate infected individuals, as well as tracking and tracing capacity.\n\n\tWe need a European approach. While timing and modalities for lifting containment measures differ between Member States, we need a common framework that is based on:\n\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Science with public health at its centre, while acknowledging that ending restrictive measures involves balancing public health benefits with social and economic impacts.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Coordination between Member States, to avoid negative effects. This is a matter of common European interest.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Respect and solidarity. This is essentialfor both health and socio-economic aspects. At a minimum, Member States should notify each other and the Commission in due time before they lift measures and take into account their views.\n\n\tPhasing-out confinement requires accompanying measures, including: \n\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Gathering harmonised data and developing a robust system of reporting and contact tracing, including with digital tools that fully respect data privacy;\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Expanding testing capacity and harmonising testing methodologies. The Commission \u2013 in consultation with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control \u2013 has adopted Guidelines today on different coronavirus tests and their performance;\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Increasing the capacity and resilience of national health care systems, in particular to address the predicted rise in infections after lifting restrictive measures;\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Continuing to reinforce medical and personal protective equipment capacities.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Developing safe and effective treatments and medicines, as well as developing and fast-tracking the introduction of a vaccine to put an end to the coronavirus.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Commission's roadmap lists concrete recommendations Member States should consider when planning to lift containment measures:\n\n\tActionshould be gradual: measures should be lifted in different steps, with sufficient time left between them to measure the impact.\n\n\n\tGeneral measures should progressively be replaced by targeted ones. For example, protecting the most vulnerable groups for longer; facilitating the gradual return of necessary economic activities; intensifying regular cleaning and disinfection of transport hubs, shops and workplaces; replacing general states of emergencies with targeted government interventions to ensure transparency and democratic accountability.\n\n\n\tInternal border controls should be lifted in a coordinated manner. Travel restrictions and border controls should be removed once the border regions' epidemiological situation converges sufficiently. External border should be reopened in a second stage and take account of the spread of the virus outside the EU.\n\n\n\tThe re-start of economic activity should be phased-in: there are several models that can be implemented, e.g. jobs suitable for teleworking, economic importance, shifts of workers, etc. The entire population should not return to the workplace at the same time.\n\n\n\tGatherings of people should be progressively permitted, taking into account the specificities of different categories of activity, such as:\n\n\n\tSchools and universities;\n\tCommercial activity (retail) with possible gradation;\n\tSocial activity measures (restaurants, cafes) with possible gradation;\n\tMass gatherings\n\n\n\tEfforts to prevent the spread of the virus should be sustained, with awareness campaigns to encourage the population to keep up the strong hygiene practices and social distancing.\n\tAction should be continuously monitored and preparedness developed for returning to stricter containment measures as necessary.\n\n\nWhile confinement measures are gradually lifted, there is a need to strategically plan the recovery, revitalising the economy and getting back on a path of sustainable growth. This includes enabling the twin transition towards a greener and digital society, and drawing all lessons from the current crisis for the EU's preparedness and resilience. The Commission will develop a Recovery plan, based on a revamped proposal for the next long-term EU budget (Multiannual Financial Framework) and the updated Commission Work Programme for 2020.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Commission, in cooperation with the President of the European Council, has developed the present roadmap responding to the call of the European Council of 26 Marchfor a coordinated exit strategy. It takes into account the expertise of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the panel of scientific experts advising the Commission on the coronavirus. Evidently, any such reflection is based on the scientific knowledge available today, and should be revised as further evidence appears and measuring methods are harmonised.\n\nIn parallel, the Commission continues to mobilise funding to foster research on the development of vaccine, treatments and medicines. The Commission is also working with the European Medicines Agency to streamline regulatory steps, from clinical trials to marketing authorisations. It will also foster international cooperation as a priority.\n\nFurthermore, to help Member States acquire the necessary equipment as rapidly as possible, including tests, the Commission has set up a \u2018Clearing house for medical equipment', launched joint procurement actions and emergency stockpiling via RescEU and proposed to support national health systems with the Emergency Support Instrument.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nLink to the Joint Roadmap\n\nFactsheet: A Joint European Roadmap towards lifting coronavirus containment measures\n\nWebsite on the Commission's coronavirus response\n\n\u00a0\n\n","0a3650bef3282d09d971dd92dc01570b7ecbdb67a4bdd0ff1c8cf8443a06b937":null,"0b2c998fcb1fca84b67271bf8ab2b32614258403935d01f51a880fbc68093dae":null,"0b4197ab0e9875d2a1233acac36c1a80502d9f4586ada7ace28815268a38f2c7":null,"0bf7cd2f53d9da4af5e67f3eab992f5edbd48e0ccd7d55f584c599c5827de355":null,"0d580fdff6508880ffd5df9f52fe6ecdec31ac22d6979b70f5683460e81fb9d1":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Thursday, 26 March 2020, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen and the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, participated in the extraordinary G20 Leaders' videoconference called by Saudi Arabia that currently holds the G20 Presidency.\n\nAgainst the backdrop that Europe currently is at the epicentre of the global COVID-19 crisis, the two Presidents thanked all G20 leaders for the solidarity shown to the European Union and its Member States most affected by the crisis.\n\nThey also underlined that the European Union is committed to international cooperation in tackling this pandemic and will continue to assist vulnerable countries and communities around the world, especially in Africa.\n\nThe Presidents of the Commission and the Council stressed that unprecedented events call for unprecedented action and that fast, massive and coordinated global action is necessary on the health and economic fronts to save lives and avoid a further economic crisis.\n\nThe G20 has a pivotal role in ensuring such global coordination.\n\nThe Presidents insisted that G20 countries should coordinate their macroeconomic policies, mobilising all instruments available, to mitigate the economic downturn, support workers and companies most affected.\n\nPresident von der Leyen and President Michel also stressed that in order to limit the economic impact on our economies \u2013 and to maintain our ability to manufacture and provide the necessary protective and medical equipment, it is imperative that we keep trade flows and supply chains open.\n\nThe EU called on G20 members to assist each other in repatriating citizens stranded abroad who wish to return home.\n\nThe European Union thanked the G20 Presidency for its focus on global coordination towards enhancing our collective pandemic preparedness and welcomed the fact that the G20 asked the WHO, working closely together with relevant organisations, to come up quickly with a global initiative on pandemic preparedness and response. In this context, Europe stands ready to set up an international online pledging event to ensure adequate funding to develop and deploy a vaccine against COVID-19.\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n","0dc4fea05de54a484f0f7ec231e948c312c04aa26a8e4e221667b311f139c6e5":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of today, Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovenia will become new host countries for rescEU medical supplies. In addition, a second medical reserve will be hosted by Germany \u2013 already a rescEU host country. In total, there are now nine countries hosting the common European stockpiles of medical equipment.\n\nSupplies now include:\n\n\tmore than 65 million medical masks and 15 million FFP2 and FFP3 masks;\n\tmore than 280 million pairs of medical gloves;\n\tclose to 20 million medical gowns and aprons;\n\tSeveral thousand oxygen concentrators and ventilators.\n\n\nThis common European stock of lifesaving medical equipment is distributed across Europe at times of medical emergencies, for example when national health systems are overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. It has already delivered essential medical supplies to Croatia, Czechia, France, Italy, Lithuania, Spain, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia.\n\n\u201dThe coronavirus remains a profound health challenge in 2021 and we know from last year that we can never let our guard down. With the four additional rescEU medical reserves in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Slovenia, the EU ensures that vulnerable groups and health workers receive equipment necessary for protecting and maintaining robust health systems across the continent,\u201d said Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d.\n\nHow the rescEU medical reserve works\n\nThe rescEU medical reserve includes different types of medical equipment, such as protective masks or medical ventilators used in intensive care. The reserve is hosted by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and the Netherlands who are responsible for procurement. The European Commission finances 100% of the assets including storage and transport.\n\nThe Emergency Response Coordination Centre coordinates the distribution of the supplies, ensuring it goes where it is needed most, based on the needs expressed by countries requesting EU assistance under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nBackground\n\nThe strategic medical capacity is part of the wider rescEU reserve, including other capacities such as aerial firefighting means and medical evacuation capacities. The rescEU reserve constitutes the \u201clast resort\u201d layer of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which can be activated for all types of natural and man-made hazards. EU Member States, Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey participate in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nFor More Information\n\nFactsheet: rescEU\n\nFactsheet: EU Civil Protection Mechanism\n\n","125c27dea0c380f1a77e2383fb99554156e21e3fcdfeef61f942b2956483caba":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission has granted a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for the COVID\u201119 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca, the third COVID-19 vaccine authorised in the EU.\n\nThis authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States.\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cSecuring safe vaccines for Europeans is our utmost priority. With the AstraZeneca vaccine now authorized, 400 million additional doses will be available in Europe. I expect the company to deliver these doses as agreed, so that Europeans can be vaccinated as soon as possible. We will continue doing all we can to secure more vaccines for Europeans, our neighbours and our partners worldwide.\u201d \n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cWith this newly authorised vaccine, our portfolio continues to take shape. Our EU Vaccines Strategy has always aimed to have a vaccine portfolio that is broad and diverse, with different technologies used, to maximise our chances of providing safe and effective vaccines to citizens as soon as possible. The European Medicines Agency's authorisation today is another step towards delivering on this promise. The Commission continues to work around the clock to secure more vaccines for Europe and our international partners. We are leaving no stone unturned in our fight against this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine will be given to adults aged 18 years and older for preventing COVID-19. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. People vaccinated will receive two injections of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nAccording to EMA, most of the participants in the studies were between 18 and 55 years old. There are not yet enough results in older participants (over 55 years old) to provide a figure for how well the vaccine will work in this group. However, protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines; as there is reliable information on safety in this population, EMA's scientific experts considered that the vaccine can be used in older adults. More information is expected from ongoing studies, which include a higher proportion of elderly participants.\n\nOn the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional marketing authorisation.\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is based on an adenovirus, a harmless virus which delivers the \u2018instructions' from the virus that causes COVID-19.This allows the body's own cells to make the protein unique to the COVID-19 virus. The person's immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by COVID-19.\n\nNext steps\n\nAccording to the contract signed with the European Commission on 27 August 2020, AstraZeneca will deliver the total amount of 400 million doses throughout 2021. These will add to the 600 million doses of the vaccine by BioNTech-Pfizer and the 160 million doses of the vaccine by Moderna.\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nA conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However it also ensures that this COVID-19 vaccine meets the EU standards, as for all other vaccines and medicines.\n\nOnce a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. CMAs are foreseen in the EU legislation specifically for public health emergencies and is considered the most appropriate regulatory mechanism in this pandemic for granting access to all EU citizens and for underpinning mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nAstraZeneca submitted an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA on 11 January 2021. However, assessment already started beforehand. EMA had started assessing non-clinical data from laboratory studies in October 2020 and updated its rolling review end of December 2020 on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.\n\nThe European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional marketing authorisation.\n\nFor More Information\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nQuestions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nEU's legislation on medicinal products\n\nEMA and COVID-19 vaccines\n\nFactsheet: How vaccines work\n\nFactsheet: Health benefits of vaccines\n\nFactsheet: Authorisation process\n\nFactsheet: Long-term safety\n\nEU's current portfolio\n\n","14b67d01335b562dc4481ae8fc8c5c06066609bc41c90e5c55ea597bf32084aa":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the global response to the coronavirus outbreak, the European Commission stands by Eastern partner countries and has reallocated \u20ac140 million for the most immediate needs in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine. In addition, the Commission will also redirect the use of existing instruments worth up to \u20ac700 million to help mitigate the socio-economic impact of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nCommissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi said: \u201cThese are very difficult times not only for the EU, but for our partner countries as well. We are doing all we can to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on human lives and livelihoods. We are responding both to the immediate needs of the health systems, as well as longer term needs to the most vulnerable groups in society and small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the economies in the six countries.\u201d \n\nResponding to immediate needs\n\nAt the request of the partner countries, the Commission will respond to immediate needs by supporting the supply of medical devices and personal equipment, such as ventilators, laboratory kits, masks, goggles, gowns, and safety suits. The European Commission is working with the World Health Organisation (WHO), and is deploying \u20ac30 million to ensure these necessary supplies are jointly purchased and effectively distributed to the health systems of the six countries in the coming weeks. In addition, the funds will support national health administrations to train medical and laboratory staff and carry out awareness raising measures to the wider population.\n\nThe Commission has also made available more than \u20ac11.3 million in small grants to civil society organisations. These funds are already responding to immediate needs, through the ongoing regional \u201cRapid Response Mechanism\u201d, such as supporting local schools with distance learning. By the summer, and as part of this package, the Commission will launch the \u201cEastern Partnership Solidarity Programme\u201d which will target the most affected parts of the populations through civil society support and notably sub-grants to smaller, local organisations.\n\nMitigating the socio-economic impact of the outbreak\n\nThe Commission is working closely with International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and relevant financing institutions from EU Member States as TEAM EUROPE providing a coordinated European response for the real economy, including SMEs, in particular through:\n\n- Launching of a new support programme of \u20ac100 million to help SMEs, including self-employed and others to easily access credit and boost their businesses after the crisis;\n\n- Facilitating, simplifying, accelerating, and reinforcing \u20ac200 million worth of existing credit lines and grants to SMEs in local currency including through its EU4Business Initiative;\n\n- In addition, in the current crisis the EU has mobilised its major de-risking instrument the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), worth a total of \u20ac1.55 billion, with \u20ac500 million being made available for the EU's neighbourhood. This will rapidly provide liquidity in the EU's neighbourhood, including through working capital, trade finance, or moratoria on debt service. This support is in addition to the ongoing macro financial assistance support to partners, including Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.\n\nThe Commission also stands ready to provide assistance through TAIEX, its peer to peer instrument, by using EU Member States expertise, experience and examples of good practices on assessing emergency preparedness response scheme and health systems.\n\nThe outbreak of coronavirus has accelerated the spread of myths and disinformation around it, coming from various sources both within and outside of the European Union.

Efforts include increasing production by existing manufacturers, facilitating imports and activating alternative ways of producing equipment.\n\nUpon the urgent request of the Commission, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), in collaboration with all their members, have agreed to immediately make available a number of European standards for certain medical devices and personal protective equipment. This action will help both EU and third-country companies willing to manufacture these items to swiftly start production and place products on the internal market more easily while ensuring a high degree of safety.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton said: \u201cWe need to act collectively with urgency, solidarity, and audacity. I am encouraging manufacturers to increase and diversify production, building on positive examples such as textile and shoe manufacturers starting to produce masks and gowns. I will do everything possible to support their efforts. I am pleased to announce that following contacts with the Commission, CEN\/CENELEC has agreed to make freely available the standards needed for such companies to be able to produce masks and other protective equipment.\u201d\n\nToday's agreement has immediate effect. The 11 standards developed by CEN and potentially 3 additional ones developed jointly with ISO that are made available cover common filtering masks, medical gloves and protective clothing.\n\nThis initiative complements the Commission\u00a0Recommendation on the conformity assessment and market surveillance procedures, which provides guidance to national bodies on allowing non CE-marked personal protection equipment\u00a0that comply with the necessary health and safety standards to enter the EU market within the context of the Coronavirus.\n\nHow the free access to these standards helps increasing production\n\nProviding free access to the national adoptions of these European standards helps both EU and third-country companies which are reconverting their production lines to manufacture quickly these critical items for preventing the coronavirus pandemic. The use of the standards will enable companies that use them to access the market for such fundamental medical and protection equipment quicker and to provide those in need with such medical equipment.\n\nNormally, standards must be purchased and used in line with the intellectual property right rules, as the copyright of the standards lies with the organisations, which have developed the standards. The derogation from this business model is a strong European response, based on a sense of social responsibility and solidarity, to address the shortage problem of protective equipment deriving from the Covid-19 epidemics.\n\nThe standards are available for free download from the websites of CEN national members.\n\nBackground \n\nEuropean standards are an essential pillar of a fully functioning internal market. They reduce costs, promote innovation, ensure interoperability between different devices and services, and help companies to access markets.\n\nTo support EU product legislation, the Commission can request the development of European harmonised standards to facilitate compliance by manufacturers of the relevant requirements. Once agreed and referenced in the Official Journal of the European Union, these harmonised standards become part of EU law and allow companies an easy and direct access to the internal market for their products, while ensuring a high degree of safety for consumer.\n\nEuropean legislation for medical devices and personal protection equipment does also rely on harmonised standards. In our common effort to face the corona virus outbreak, the Commission and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) have agreed to make a number of harmonised standards for important protective equipment like face masks and single-use gloves freely available to those companies that are willing to start producing these items.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information \n\nList of available standards:\n\n\tEN 149:2009 Respiratory protective devices \u2013 Filtering half masks to protect against particles - Requirements, testing, marking (commonly referred to as \u2018FFP masks'\n\tEN 14683:2019 EN Medical face masks - Requirements and test method\n\tEN 166:2001 Personal eye-protection \u2013 Specifications\n\tEN 14126:2003 Protective clothing - Performance requirements and tests methods for protective clothing against infective agents\n\tEN 14605:2009 Protective clothing against liquid chemicals - performance requirements for clothing with liquid-tight (Type 3) or spray-tight (Type 4) connections, including items providing protection to parts of the body only\n\tEN 13795-1:2019 Surgical clothing and drapes - Requirements and test methods - Part 1: Surgical drapes and gowns\n\tEN 13795-2:2019 Surgical drapes, gowns and clean air suits, used as medical devices for patients, clinical staff and equipment - Part 2: Test methods\n\tEN 455-1:2000 Medical gloves for single use - Part 1: Requirements and testing for freedom from holes (MDD)\n\tEN 455-2:2015 Medical gloves for single use - Part 2: Requirements and testing for physical properties (MMD)\n\tEN 455-3:2015 Medical gloves for single use - Part 3: Requirements and testing for biological evaluation (MDD)\n\tEN 455-4:2009 EN Medical gloves for single use - Part 4: Requirements and testing for shelf life determination (MDD)\n\n\nIn addition, possibly:\n\n\tEN ISO 374-5:2017 Protective gloves against dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms - Part 5: Terminology and performance requirements for micro-organisms risks\n\tEN ISO 13688:2013 Protective clothing - General requirements\n\tEN ISO 10993-1:2009 Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process\n\n\nEuropean Standards\n\nEuropean Committee for Standardisation\n\nEuropean Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation\n\n","168ef5e5a20d52be3092190a335930811650f6b5bd57e3e3da8cc91edeef8f70":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission is providing \u20ac64.7 million in humanitarian aid for countries in the southern Africa region to help support people in need dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, extreme weather conditions such as persistent drought in the region and other crises.\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d,\u00a0Commissioner for Crisis Management, said: \u201cThe EU is helping to provide life-saving assistance to impoverished households suffering from crop and livestock losses due to drought. The aid package will also strengthen the preparation and response to the coronavirus pandemic for countries in the region. In parallel, the EU is helping communities better prepare for natural hazards and reduce their impact.\u201d\n\nFunding from this aid package will go for humanitarian projects in Angola (\u20ac3 million), Botswana (\u20ac1.95 million), Comoros (\u20ac500,000), Eswatini (\u20ac2.4 million), Lesotho (\u20ac4.8 million), Madagascar (\u20ac7.3 million), Malawi (\u20ac7.1 million), Mauritius (\u20ac250,000), Mozambique (\u20ac14.6 million), Namibia (\u20ac2 million), Zambia (\u20ac5 million) and Zimbabwe (\u20ac14.2 million). A further \u20ac1.6 million is allocated to regional disaster preparedness actions.\n\nFunding will target:\n\n\tfood assistance to vulnerable households and helping farmers in the affected areas restore their means of subsistence;\n\tcoronavirus prevention and preparedness actions to support local health systems and facilitate access to health care, protective equipment, sanitation and hygiene;\n\tdisaster preparedness projects that also cover new needs brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.

In many places, the current growing season is exceptionally hot and dry, while in several other parts of the region, erratic rains risk undermining harvests in 2020. In some countries, this burden comes on top of already-crippling economic woes.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is likely to compound already significant humanitarian needs in the region.\n\nFor more information\n\nFactsheet: Southern Africa and Indian Ocean\n\n","1aecc808816f3afc48d32a4f74643d05dba90897000619e4b30478704338880a":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Commission has issued new practical advice to ensure that mobile workers within the EU, in particular those in critical occupations to fight the coronavirus pandemic, can reach their workplace. This includes but is not limited to those working in the health care and food sectors, and other essential services like childcare, elderly care, and critical staff for utilities. Together with the Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU also issued today, this responds to requests made by EU leaders\u00a0on 26 March and seeks to address practical concerns of citizens and companies affected by the measures taken to limit the spread of the coronavirus, as well as of national authorities implementing the measures.\n\nWhile it is understandable that Member States have introduced internal border controls to limit the spread of the coronavirus, it is imperative that critical workers are able to reach their destination without delay.\n\nNicolas Schmit, the Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: \u201cThousands of women and men working hard to keep us safe, healthy and with food on the table need to cross EU borders to go to work. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that they are not hindered in their movement, while taking every precaution to avoid further spread of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines published today identify a range of workers that exercise critical occupations, and for which continued free movement in the EU is deemed essential. The list provided in these guidelines is not exhaustive. Examples include health associate professionals, child and elderly care workers, scientists in health-related industries, those needed to install critical medical devices, firefighters and police officers, transport workers, as well as persons working in the food sector. The Commission urges Member States to establish specific burden free and fast procedures to ensure a smooth passage for such frontier workers, including proportionate health screening.\n\nBeyond these specific categories of workers, the guidelines also clarify that Member States should allow frontier workers in general to continue crossing borders if work in the sector concerned is still allowed in the host Member State.Member States should treat cross border workers and national workers in the same manner.\n\nAs regards seasonal workers, particularly in the agricultural sector, Member States are asked to exchange information on their different needs at technical level and to establish specific procedures to ensure a smooth passage for such workers, in order to respond to labour shortages as a result of the crisis. Seasonal workers in agriculture perform in certain circumstances critical harvesting, planting and tending functions. In such a situation, Member States should treat those persons as critical workers and communicate to the employers the necessity to provide for adequate health and safety protection.\n\nThese guidelines complement the recently adopted Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services as well as the Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU which were also presented today.\n\nThe Commission will continue to identify the best practices with Member States which can be extended to all Member States for allowing workers to exercise their crucial occupations without undue hindrance.\n\nBackground\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to the introduction of unprecedented measures across EU Member States, including reintroduced checks at the internal borders.\n\nFrontier workers, posted workers as well as seasonal workers live in one EU country but work in another. Many of them are crucial for their host Member States, for instance for the health care system, the provision of other essential services including the setting up and maintenance of medical equipment and infrastructure, or ensuring the supply of necessity goods. A coordinated approach at EU level is therefore key.\n\nOn 26 March, the Heads of State or government stated: \u201cWe will urgently address, with the assistance of the Commission, the remaining problems concerning EU citizens blocked at internal EU borders and prevented from returning to their home countries and cross-border and seasonal workers who have to be able to continue essential activities while avoiding further spread of the virus.\u201d These guidelines presented today are the Commission's immediate response to this call, alongside the Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU which include the repatriation of EU citizens.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommunication of 27 March presenting \u201cGuidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers\u201d\n\nCoronavirus website\n\n","1cdcaeea59b001d1eedb7833096b2e0516a68b6457c23d2d61b2c455e148c9ff":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its continuing efforts to protect citizens and to coordinate the response to COVID-19, the Commission has taken immediate steps to protect the availability of supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), by requiring that exports of such equipment outside of the European Union are subject to an export authorisation by Member States.\n\nCommissioner for Trade Phil Hogan, said: \u201cThe challenges presented by the spread of COVID-19 justify the urgency of this action. No effort is being spared by the Commission to offer concrete help to our citizens and all those who take care of them.\u201d\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment covers equipment such as masks, protective spectacles and visors, face shields, mouth-nose protection and protective garments. There are vital needs for protective equipment within the Union with regard to hospitals, patients, field workers, civil protection authorities.\n\nThis implementing act, adopted by urgency procedure and published today, provides for authorisations for exports to third countries. \u00a0It will be valid for a six-week period, during which Member States will be consulted on the potential adaptations and scope of the current measure and future steps. \n\nA unified European response overcomes a situation where Member States take individual approaches affecting the circulation of such equipment within the single market as well as to third countries, and reinforces European solidarity. Certain first-mover Member States have already indicated acceptance of the Commission's requests to amend their national measures to ensure that vital equipment is available to those who need it most, throughout the EU.\n\nThe Commission will assist Member States in setting up the relevant mechanisms to ensure a smooth and coordinated implementation of the regulation, having regard to factors such as international engagements, the evolution of urgent needs within and outside the EU, and the integration of production and supply chains with such third countries.\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n","1de52295934cc6c9a7949d9288366c0db0154052f1857c6ce647f5dc9c760a54":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the coming days, 1.5 million medical masks will be delivered to 17 Member States and the UK to protect healthcare workers against coronavirus. This latest EU mask delivery is part of a new Commission funded purchase of 10 million masks via the Emergency Support Instrument\u00a0to provide direct support to Member States to mitigate the immediate consequences of the pandemic and anticipate the needs related to the exit and recovery.\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said: \u201cWe are doing everything we can to support Member States in getting protective equipment to health workers on the frontline. They are Europe's modern day heroes. This is EU solidarity in action to help respond to the needs of European health systems and \u20ac3 billion has been mobilised from the EU budget to directly support national efforts. We remain steadfast in our commitment: together we can win this fight.\u201d\n\nThe masks will be delivered to Member States and regions in need in weekly instalments of 1.5 million masks over the coming six weeks.\n\nThese deliveries take place on top of the hundreds of thousands of masks already provided from the rescEU reserve of medical equipment in the past weeks, as well as assistance mobilised via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, on 24 April, the Commission decided to mobilise, under the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI), \u20ac320 million for Emergency Support actions, of which \u20ac100 million are for essential health-related products that will be procured in the coming months.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Commission is mobilising \u20ac3 billion from the EU budget to directly support Member States' health care systems, of which \u20ac2.7 billion will be channelled through the Emergency Support Instrument and \u20ac300 million through the rescEU medical equipment capacity. Additional contributions are possible, including from Member States.\n\nThe Emergency Support Instrument allows direct support to EU Member States in their efforts to address the pandemic through measures that can deliver greater impact if taken at EU level. It does not replace existing instruments (joint procurement, rescEU, etc.) but complements them.\n\nThis will allow the Commission to support a wide range of initiatives, including:\n\n\tpurchasing medical equipment such as ventilators and masks;\n\tcoordinating and financially supporting the transport of patients to EU Member States with spare hospital capacity;\n\tcontributing to increase the rollout and testing across the EU;\n\tsupporting the deployment of vaccines, some of which might be the result of significant support under other EU initiatives.\n\n\nThanks to this tool, the EU can deploy targeted actions preventing and mitigating the immediate acute consequences in one or more Member States and to support in a coordinated manner the needs related to the exit and recovery from the corona crisis in the medium to long term.\n\nThe Commission will thus be providing a holistic EU response throughout the corona crisis.\n\nTo implement the support, the Commission continues to work closely with national health authorities, international organisations and with the non-governmental sector.\n\nFor more information\n\nFactsheet: EU Medical and Health Support\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n","1fac5fb4117385e7ea3e811c75e537f9e2ece1eb329dab9cf9a0972008994bce":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, as part of the EU's global response to the coronavirus outbreak, the EU - through its Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) - has adopted a new assistance package to protect migrants, stabilise local communities and respond to COVID-19 in North Africa. This package includes \u20ac80 million in new funds as well as \u20ac30 million reallocated from non-contracted actions under the EUTF.\n\nIn line with the Joint Communication on the global EU response to COVID-19, this new funding will also strengthen the immediate response capacity, reinforce the health systems and services in the North African partner countries, mitigate the socio-economic impact of the crisis, as well as allow for the continuation of actions to protect refugees and migrants and stabilise local communities.\n\nCommissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, said: \u201cWith today's substantial and targeted assistance package we are responding to the urgent needs to fight the COVID-19 crisis and address the needs of some of the most vulnerable groups in North Africa, in particular refugees, migrants and displaced persons. In Libya, while the armed conflict continues, the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa has already supported over 200,000 beneficiaries with hygiene kits and medical assistance and over 1.7 million people have now better access to basic services in local communities, thanks to the renovation of health centres.\u201d\n\nSupport to Libya\n\nLibya remains the biggest beneficiary under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, with \u20ac455 million in programmes, with the majority going to protection of migrants and refugees and community stabilisation, alongside actions for border management.\n\nAs part of the EU's comprehensive approach and support on migration in Libya, three new programmes adopted today will improve the resilience of both Libyans and migrants for the health challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic:\n\n\tA \u20ac30.2 million protection programme will provide protection services to migrants and vulnerable groups, such as health assistance to treat tuberculosis, non-food items, emergency cash assistance and emergency evacuations outside of Libya (when travel restrictions are lifted);\n\tA specific \u20ac20 million COVID-19 programme will strengthen immediate response to the virus, including personal protective equipment and training for health staff; the strengthening of laboratory capacities and intensive care response. It will also reinforce the health system and services in the country in the medium term;\n\tA \u20ac25 million community stabilisation programme to continue to improve the living conditions in the Libyan municipalities, in particular in the South, by enhancing access to basic and social services.\n\n\nIn order to fund these essential new actions, \u20ac30 million has been re-allocated from existing Border Management programmes in Libya, which will now amount to \u20ac57.2 million. While Border Management in Libya remains a priority in order to continue to save lives at sea, the reallocation of funding reflects the need to adapt existing actions to the changing security situation on the ground. The revised Border Management programme will strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and Port Security's capacity for search and rescue activities and prevention of migrant smuggling, support the maintenance of boats, provide further training as well as support the establishment of the Libyan Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre.\n\nSupport to Tunisia\n\nIn Tunisia, two new programmes will strengthen support to migrants and the most vulnerable groups, who may be particularly hard hit by the current crisis:\n\n\tA \u20ac9.3 million governance and protection programme to provide protection services to vulnerable migrants, improve access to health services as well as to continue to support migration governance and to the Tunisian-led service for the reintegration of returnees hosted by the \u2018Office des Tunisiens \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger' (OTE);\n\tA \u20ac5 million skills mobility programme built on two bilateral mobility agreements in place between France and Tunisia for young professionals and seasonal workers, based on the principle of circular mobility and for workers to gain needed skills in the country of origin.\n\n\nRegional COVID-19 response\n\nA new \u20ac10 million COVID-19 fast track emergency response programme has also been adopted to support the most vulnerable populations in North Africa tackling their emergency needs as well as the social and economic consequences of the crisis in order to contribute to the national efforts already in place.\n\nOther regional initiatives\n\nA \u20ac3.7 million regional child protection programme, with a focus on Libya and Egypt, has been adopted to improve the protection and expand access to sustainable solutions for unaccompanied and separated children and youth along the Central Mediterranean Route.\n\n\u20ac6.5 million was also adopted to fund a Technical Cooperation Facility to ensure effective monitoring and evaluations of all the actions implemented under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund of Africa.\n\nBackground\n\nThe EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa was established in 2015 to address the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration and to contribute to better migration management. The Trust Fund covers three windows: the Sahel and Lake Chad, the Horn of Africa, and the North of Africa.\n\nToday's assistance package brings the total funding mobilised through the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa to nearly \u20ac888 million since its launch in 2015. The new funding was approved by the Operational Committee of the Trust Fund, which brings together the European Commission, the EU Member States, the United Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland. Observers of the Operational Committee include partner countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia as well as Members of the European Parliament.\n\nThe Trust Fund is also reorienting ongoing interventions in key sectors in Libya to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Reallocation of existing actions in Libya allowed implementing partners to provide personal protective equipment, hygiene kits, training to medical staff as well as awareness campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus among vulnerable groups.\n\nEU Institutions, EU Member States and other donors have so far allocated resources amounting to \u20ac5 billion to the EUTF.\n\nWith today's adoption, the EUTF now funds 246 programmes totalling close to \u20ac4.8 billion. The funding is divided between three regions as follows: Sahel\/Lake Chad, \u20ac2 billion (104 programmes); Horn of Africa, \u20ac1.79 billion (99 programmes); North of Africa, \u20ac888 million (39 programmes).\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa website\n\nFactsheet the EU support on migration in North Africa\n\nFactsheet the EU support on migration in Libya\n\nFactsheet the EU support on migration in Tunisia\n\n","2013db5a7c5e67e4b4ba16eef2ad17129e8557077ca1d2c9f193c7a04774fd4b":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEU Members States, supported by the Commission, have developed an EU toolbox for the use of mobile applications for contact tracing and warning\u00a0in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This is part of a common coordinated approach to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures, as set out in a Commission Recommendation last week.\n\nSince the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Member States, backed by the Commission, have been assessing the effectiveness, security, privacy, and data protection aspects of digital solutions to address the crisis. Contact tracing apps, if fully compliant with EU rules and well coordinated, can play a key role in all phases of crisis management, especially when time will be ripe to gradually lift social distancing measures. They can complement existing manual contact tracing and help interrupt the transmission chain of the virus.The toolbox is accompanied by guidance on data protection for such mobile apps, which is also published today.\n\nWelcoming the toolbox, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton said: \u201cContact tracing apps to limit the spread of coronavirus can be useful, especially as part of Member States' exit strategies. However, strong privacy safeguards are a pre-requisite for the uptake of these apps, and therefore their usefulness. While we should be innovative and make the best use of technology in fighting the pandemic, we will not compromise on our values and privacy requirements.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides added: \u201cDigital tools will be crucial to protect our citizens as we gradually lift confinement measures. Mobile apps can warn us of infection risks and support health authorities with contact tracing, which is essential to break transmission chains. We need to be diligent, creative, and flexible in our approaches to opening up our societies again. We need to continue to flatten the curve \u2013 and keep it down. Without safe and compliant digital technologies, our approach will not be efficient.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nA common approach for voluntary and privacy-compliant tracing apps\n\nToday's announcement is the first iteration of a common EU toolbox, developed urgently and collaboratively by the e-Health Network with the support of the European Commission. It provides a practical guide for Member States in the implementation of contact tracing and warning apps. The toolbox sets out the essential requirements for these apps:\n\n\tThey should be fully compliant with the EU data protection and privacy rules, as put forward by the guidance presented today following consultation with the European Data Protection Board.\n\tThey should be implemented in close coordination with, and approved by, public health authorities.\n\tThey should be installed voluntarily, and dismantled as soon as no longer needed.\n\tThey should aim to exploit the latest privacy-enhancing technological solutions. Likely to be based on Bluetooth proximity technology, they do not enable tracking of people's locations.\n\tThey should be based on anonymised data: They can alert people who have been in proximity for a certain duration to an infected person to get tested or self-isolate, without revealing the identity of the people infected.\n\tThey should be interoperable across the EU so that citizens are protected even when they cross borders.\n\tThey should be anchored in accepted epidemiological guidance, and reflect best practice on cybersecurity, and accessibility.\n\tThey should be secure and effective.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile allowing for easier, quicker and more efficient tracing than traditional systems based on interviews with infected patients, manual tracing will continue to cover citizens who could be more vulnerable to infection but are less likely to have a smartphone, such as elderly or disabled persons.\n\nA common approach to other functionalities, in particular on information and symptom tracking, may be developed in future iterations of the toolbox.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe toolbox reflects the latest best practices in the use of mobile contact tracing and warning apps to tackling the crisis. It is part of an ongoing process where Member States work together to devise and refine in the coming weeks and months the use of this and other practical tools. This first version will be further enriched in light of the experiences of Member States.\n\nMember States should report on their actions by 31 May 2020 and make the measures accessible to other Member States and the Commission for peer review. The Commission will assess the progress made and publish periodic reports starting in June 2020 and throughout the crisis, recommending action or the phasing out of measures that seem no longer necessary.\n\nFor more information\n\nEU toolbox on mobile applications to support contact tracing in the EU's fight against COVID-19\n\nCommission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis\n\nGuidance to ensure full data protection standards of apps fighting the pandemic\n\nCommission coronavirus response page\n\nDigital technologies in response to coronavirus\n\n\u00a0\n\n* Update on 30\/04\/2020 12:45\n\n\n\n","21ac6e84cc928e94c251b2b1e720af243ba9dece7dcf93290b05189abfddd963":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union has announced today it will contribute an additional \u20ac100 million in grant funding to support the COVAX Facility to secure access to the future COVID-19 vaccine in low and middle-income countries. The funds will complement the \u20ac400 million in guarantees the EU already committed for COVAX, making the Union one of the leading donors. With this new contribution, the EU is further stepping up investment in support of the global recovery.\n\nAt the virtual Paris Peace Forum, where world leaders and international organizations are discussing the global response and the recovery from the pandemic, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cIn the midst of the wrecking COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that a global recovery will only be possible if safe and effective vaccines are available to all who need it. The EU is increasing its support to the COVAX Facility to this end and I am proud that Team Europe is a leading contributor to COVAX. Together, we can make the global recovery happen.\"\n\nJutta\u00a0Urpilainen, Commissioner for International Partnerships, said:\u00a0\u201cThe EU is demonstrating we are serious about our commitments to leave no one behind and make the COVID-19 vaccine a global public good. With this additional \u20ac100 million in grant funding, the EU join forces with international partners, in a spirit of solidarity and multilateralism, and will help secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for those who need it the most in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific countries.\u201d \n\nStella\u00a0Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said:\u00a0\u201cOf all the lessons we have learned this year, the clearest is that there is strength in solidarity. COVAX is an example of this. With this additional contribution we are one step closer to the objective of funding the purchase of 2 billion vaccines for the most vulnerable populations in 92 low and middle-income countries. But more support will be required next year to produce and distribute a safe and efficacious vaccine across the world as soon as it becomes available. We will not relent in this effort.\u201d\n\nThe proposed allocation of \u20ac100 million from the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) general reserve will adopt the form of a grant contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as administrator of COVAX Facility, the world's facility for universal and fair access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nTo date, a total of 184 countries participate in the COVAX Facility, being 92 of them low and middle-income economies eligible to get access to COVID-19 vaccines through Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). Through this grant, the Commission and its partners will secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for all the participants in the Facility, including African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.\n\nThis grant support will strategically complement the \u20ac400 million of bank guarantees the EU will make available to Gavi through the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the framework of the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), raising the total EU contribution for COVAX to \u20ac500 million.*\n\nSeveral EU Member States are contributing as well to COVAX and its underlying objectives, highlighting another example of the power of Team Europe, that is mobilising more than \u20ac870 million for COVAX, including the \u20ac100 million in EU grant and \u20ac400 million in guarantees. The figure also includes new contributions announced today by France (\u20ac100 million), Spain (\u20ac50 million) and Finland (\u20ac2 million).\n\nVaccines will be procured and delivered to countries by UNICEF Supply Division and the PAHO's Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines.\n\nBackground\n\nCOVAX is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.\n\nThe COVAX Facility aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. It will help to develop a diversified portfolio of vaccines, negotiated with different suppliers, and covering different scientific technologies, delivery times and prices. The COVAX Facility is a risk-sharing mechanism: it reduces the risk for manufacturers who invest without being sure about future demand, and it reduces the risk that countries would fail to secure access to a viable vaccine.\n\nThe European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home, and to promote global health. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the\u00a0Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0Team Europe's contribution was as follows: EU Member States (\u20ac3.1 billion), European Commission (over \u20ac1.4 billion) and EIB (almost \u20ac2 billion pledged in May and \u20ac4.9 billion pledged in June).\n\nThe EU's participation in COVAX will be complementary with the ongoing EU negotiations with vaccine companies launched under the EU Vaccines Strategy. The EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need. Through its Advanced Purchase Agreements, it requires manufacturers to make their production capacity available to supply all countries and calls for the free flow of vaccines and materials with no export restrictions. For instance, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-GSK, with whom the Commission concluded an Advanced Purchase Agreement in September,\u00a0will endeavour to provide a significant portion of their vaccine supply through the COVAX facility.\n\nWorld leaders and international organizations are participating in this virtual third edition of The Paris Peace Forum, initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron to revive collective governance, international cooperation and multilateralism at a time of growing challenges and when international norms and institutions are being challenged. Discussions this year, under the overarching theme \u2018Bouncing back to a better planet', will focus on improving the global governance of health and promoting green financing.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU global response to coronavirus\n\n*Updated on 16\/11\/2020 at 10:20\n\n","22288dda5cce5997643beaba3d99138f3e97e8dc608b21efa08d1c4c5f32e683":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission approved a fourth contract with pharmaceutical companies BioNTech and Pfizer, which provides for the initial purchase of 200 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to request up to a further 100 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19. Member States can decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nToday's contract with the BioNTech-Pfizer alliance builds upon the broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the already signed a contracts with AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, and the concluded successful exploratory talks with CureVac and Moderna. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u00a0\u201cIn the wake of Monday's promising announcement by BioNTech and Pfizer on the prospects for their vaccine, I'm very happy to announce today's agreement with the European company BioNTech and Pfizer to purchase 300 million doses of the vaccine. With this fourth contract we are now consolidating an extremely solid vaccine candidate portfolio, most of them in advanced trials phase. Once authorised, they will be quickly deployed and bring us closer to a sustainable solution of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cA safe and effective vaccine is the only lasting exit strategy from the pandemic, and is at the centre of our European Vaccine Strategy. Today's agreement follows the encouraging first indications from the clinical trial results and is further evidence of our commitment to putting more Europe in the area of health. It is a very telling example of what the EU can achieve when working together, as a Union, and a case in point of what a future European Health Union will be able to deliver.\u201d\n\nBioNTech is a German company working with US-based Pfizer to develop a new vaccine based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in\u00a0 biology, transferring instructions from DNA to cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions make harmless fragments of the virus which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease.\n\nThe Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the companies' experience in vaccine development and their production capacity to supply the whole of the EU.\n\nBackground\n\nIn June, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and BioNTech concluded a \u20ac100 million debt financing agreement to allow the company to expand its manufacturing capacity in order to supply their vaccine quickly worldwide. The financing is backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments and also benefits from InnovFin Risk Sharing for Corporate Research backed by Horizon 2020.*\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.\n\nOnce vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nOverview of the Commission's Response\n\n*Updated on 12 November 2020 at 17:05.\u00a0\n\n","23872f1589fce0150d9b647073d069e221a8c1449b2db199b8c7a2748f4a006b":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus response: EU dispatches additional rescEU masks to Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia\u00a0\n\nThis week, more batches of FFP2 and FFP3 protective masks are being distributed to Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia from rescEU - the common European reserve of medical equipment set up this year to help countries affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\u201dWe are delivering more masks from the\u00a0rescEU reserve of medical equipment\u00a0to\u00a0help the national authorities\u00a0in their response to COVID-19.

This will allow \u20ac197 million of new investments by the concession operator to go ahead, while limiting distortions of competition. The Istrian Y motorway is a 145 km long motorway linking the Istrian region with the rest of Croatia. The motorway is operated under a concession agreement from 1995, which was awarded to the company Bina-Istra until 2034. In June 2020, Croatia notified to the Commission a prolongation of the concession agreement until 2039. The prolongation will allow Bina-Istra to finance the construction of a second carriageway (one more lane in each direction) between Vranja Interchange and the U\u010dka tunnel\/Kvarner portal - an 8km stretch on the north-eastern side of the motorway. The aid takes the form of a prolongation of the concession. This will allow the \u20ac197 million investment, which will mainly be used to construct a new 5.63 km-long second tube to the U\u010dka tunnel, which is necessary to meet the minimum safety requirements, as well as several new viaducts, underpasses and overpasses. Bina-Istra will also renew the Kvarner rest area. \u00a0The Commission examined the measure under EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest (SGEI) and EU public procurement rules, notably the EU Directive on the award of concession contracts (Directive 2014\/23\/EU), according to which companies can be compensated for the extra cost of providing a public service on certain conditions. The Commission found that, under the Croatian plan to extend the Istrian Y motorway concession agreement, all compatibility conditions are fulfilled. The prolongation of the concession is proportionate to the amount needed to finance the required works and Bina-Istra is not overcompensated. The Commission concluded that the measure will promote growth and unlock investment, without unduly distorting competition and trade between Member States in line with EU State aid and public procurement rules. On this basis, the Commission approved under EU State aid rules the Croatian support through the prolongation of the Istrian Y motorway concession. The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.56832 in the State aid register on the Commission's competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. \u00a0(For more information: Arianna Podesta\u00a0\u2013 Tel.: +32 229 87024; Giulia Astuti \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 55344)\n\n\u00a0\n\nMergers: Commission clears acquisition of joint control over One Tap Buy by the Softbank Group and the Mizuho Financial Group\n\nThe European Commission has approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the acquisition of joint control over One Tap BUY Co., Ltd. (\u201cOTB\u201d) by SoftBank Corp. and Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. (\u201cMizuho\u201d), all three of Japan. OTB, which is currently solely controlled by SoftBank, provides a mobile trading brokerage application that allows investors residing in Japan to trade securities on the go. SoftBank is involved in advanced telecommunications, internet services, Internet of Things, robotics and clean energy technology providers. Mizuho offers financial and strategic services, including banking, securities, trust and asset management, credit card, private banking and venture capital. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns given that the JV has noactual or foreseen activities within the European Economic Area. The transaction was examined under the simplified merger review procedure.

The joint venture will provide e-identification services within Czechia. \u010cS, \u010cSOB and KB provide banking services. The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would raise no competition concerns, since the joint venture has negligible foreseen activities within the European Economic Area.

This authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States.\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cWe are providing more COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans. With the Moderna vaccine, the second one now authorised in the EU, we will have a further 160 million doses. And more vaccines will come. Europe has secured up to two billion doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines. We'll have more than enough safe and effective vaccines for protecting all Europeans.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cWe are all in this together and united. This is why we have negotiated the broadest vaccine portfolio in the world for all our Member States. Today we are authorising a second safe and effective vaccine from Moderna, which together with BioNTech-Pfizer, will ensure that 460 million doses will be rolled out with increasing speed in the EU, and more will come. Member States have to ensure that the pace of vaccinations follows suit. Our efforts will not stop until vaccines are available for everyone in the EU.\u201d\n\nModerna submitted on 30 November 2020 an application for marketing authorisation to EMA, which had already started a rolling review of the data in November. Thanks to this rolling review, EMA has been assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine as data has become available. EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has thoroughly assessed the data and recommended by consensus that a formal conditional marketing authorisation is granted. A conditional marketing authorisation is one of EU's regulatory mechanisms for facilitating early access to medicines that fulfil an unmet medical need, including in emergency situations such as the current pandemic.\n\nOn the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional market authorisation.\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in\u00a0biology, transferring instructions from DNA to the cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions produce harmless fragments of the virus, which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce a spike protein, a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences \u2014 antibodies and T cells \u2014 against it.\n\nNext steps*\n\nModerna, with whom the Commission signed a contract on 25 November, will deliver the total amount of 160 million doses between the first and the fourth quarters of 2021. It will add to the 300 million doses of the vaccine distributed by BioNTech\/Pfizer, the first vaccine to have been authorised in the EU on 21 December 2020. \n\nBackground\n\nA conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However, once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks.\n\nModerna submitted on 30 November 2020 an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA. EMA has already been assessing data on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality and results from laboratory studies and clinical trials in the context of a rolling review. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.\n\nThe European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional market authorisation.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nQuestions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nEU's legislation on medicinal products\n\nEMA and COVID-19 vaccines\n\nFactsheet: How vaccines work\n\nFactsheet: Health benefits of vaccines\n\nFactsheet: Authorisation process\n\nFactsheet: Long-term safety\n\nEU's current portfolio\n\n* Updated on 11 January 2021 at 12:05.\u00a0\n\n","2663d49d7a91d3171859bb45abfb9ece01a5cfc8f738bde94f5d102074db0d25":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, as an immediate action under the HERA Incubator, the new European bio-defence preparedness plan against COVID-19 variants, the Commission is introducing a measure to speed up the authorisation of adapted COVID-19 vaccines. It will make provisions in the relevant EU legislation to allow companies to focus on gathering the necessary evidence in time and enable the authorisation of adapted vaccines with a smaller set of additional data submitted to the European Medicines Agency.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cThe HERA Incubator is to strengthen and accelerate the EU response to variants. We are enabling EMA to fast-track regulatory approval of updated vaccines to tackle new variants. Faster approval means more vaccines in circulation and more Europeans protected from the virus.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella\u00a0Kyriakides\u00a0said:\u00a0\u201cWe need to be prepared to adapt vaccines as quickly as possible to respond to new and potentially vaccine-resistant variants. Today we propose fast and flexible solutions to fast-track approvals, without compromising on safety and efficacy. With the HERA Incubator, our goal is to anticipate and be one step ahead.\u201d\n\nAdaptations to active substances of an authorised COVID-19 vaccine may be required to ensure the vaccine's effectiveness against mutations or variants of a virus. Building on the approach for adaptations of human influenza \u2013 flu \u2013 vaccines, the changes to the Variation Regulation specify which provisions apply to adaptations of the active substance of authorised COVID-19 vaccines. These changes will ensure the streamlined handling of any variation to an authorised vaccine and extend the coverage of the new provisions to all coronaviruses.\n\nThe amendment provides a regulatory framework for the handling of changes to the marketing authorisation after the initial marketing authorisation.\n\nNext Steps\n\nAs for any delegated regulation, the measure will now go to the European Parliament and Council for scrutiny before entering into force.\n\nBackground\n\nThe new European bio-defence preparedness plan against COVID-19 variants called \u201cHERA Incubator\u201d is working with researchers, biotech companies, manufacturers and public authorities in the EU and globally to detect new variants, provide incentives to develop new and adapted vaccines, speed up the approval process for these vaccines, and ensure scaling up of manufacturing capacities.\n\nSpeeding up the regulatory approval of adapted vaccines is one of the key actions of the HERA Incubator to boost preparedness, develop vaccines for the variants and increase industrial production.\n\nTaking action now is important as new variants continue to emerge and challenges with scaling up vaccine production are arising. The HERA Incubator will also serve as a blueprint for the EU's long-term preparedness for health emergencies.\n\nFor More Information \n\nCommission delegated regulation on the examination of variations to the terms of marketing authorisation for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products\n\nEuropean Medicines Agency guidance on regulatory requirements for vaccines intended to provide protection against variant strain(s) of SARS-CoV-2\n\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council: HERA Incubator: Anticipating together the threat of COVID-19 variants\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Coronavirus response\n\n","2884adff0444fda0cadf701f680ee176a410f74b4885324986cb366704a9d45a":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has disbursed a total of \u20ac17 billion to Italy, Spain and Poland in the first instalment of financial support to Member States under the SURE instrument. As part of today's operations, Italy has received \u20ac10 billion, Spain \u20ac6 billion, and Poland \u20ac1 billion. Once all SURE disbursements have been completed, Italy will receive a total of \u20ac27.4 billion, Spain \u20ac21.3 billion and Poland \u20ac11.2 billion.\n\nThis support, in the form of loans granted on favourable terms, will assist these Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, in particular for the self-employed.\n\nThe SURE instrument can provide up to \u20ac100 billion in financial support to all Member States. The Council has so far approved \u20ac87.9 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States, based on the Commission's proposals. The next disbursements will take place over the course of the months ahead, following the respective bond issuances.\n\nThe disbursements follow last week's inaugural social bond issuance by the Commission, marked by very strong investor interest, to finance the instrument.\n\nMembers of the College said: \n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThe first disbursements under the SURE instrument are important milestones in our push to preserve jobs and livelihoods. They clearly demonstrate Europe's solidarity with citizens in Spain, Italy and Poland affected by this unprecedented crisis. We remain committed to protecting people and jobs across Europe. SURE will play an important role in achieving this objective.\u201d\n\nJohannes Hahn, Commissioner in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cWith the Sure instrument we have managed to live up to our citizens' expectation regarding quick delivery of support in times of crisis.\u00a0 I am glad to see that citizens and enterprises in Spain, Italy, Poland will be the first to benefit. 17 Member States have already declared their interest in receiving support from SURE and we will follow-up on this still this year.

This is only the beginning. As Europe prepares to face a difficult winter, let's remember that last week's SURE Social Bonds issuance was more than a successful market operation - it was a huge vote of confidence in the European Union's recovery plan and in our common economic future.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nOn 21 October, the European Commission issued a \u20ac17 billion inaugural social bond under the SURE instrument. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac10 billion due for repayment in October 2030 and \u20ac7 billion due for repayment in 2040. There was very strong investor interest in this highly rated instrument, and the bonds were more than 13 times oversubscribed, resulting in favourable pricing terms. The terms on which the Commission borrows are passed on directly to the Member States receiving the loans.\n\nThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.\n\nFor more information\n\nSURE Regulation\n\nFactsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes SURE\n\nCoronavirus response\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\n","28ea89b6ba8ee9366abfbaf5dc60516b8e85bce605c3ef875ee2dc7ac5cf54e2":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has adopted a\u00a0Temporary Framework to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. Together with many other support measures that can be used by Member States under the existing State aid rules, the Temporary Framework enables Member States to ensure that sufficient liquidity remains available to businesses of all types and to preserve the continuity of economic activity during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nExecutive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is severe. We need to act fast to manage the impact as much as we can. And we need to act in a coordinated manner. This new Temporary Framework enables Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nThe State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, based on Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, recognises that the entire EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. To remedy that, the Temporary Framework provides for five types of aid:\n\n(i)\u00a0 Direct grants, selective tax advantages and advance payments: Member States will be able to set up schemes to grant up to \u20ac800,000 to a company to address its urgent liquidity needs.\n\n(ii)\u00a0 State guarantees for loans taken by companies from banks: Member States will be able to provide State guarantees to ensure banks keep providing loans to the customers who need them.\n\n(iii) Subsidised public loans to companies: Member States will be able to grant loans with favourable interest rates to companies. These loans can help businesses cover immediate working capital and investment needs.\n\n(iv) Safeguards for banks that channel State aid to the real economy: Some Member States plan to build on banks' existing lending capacities, and use them as a channel for support to businesses \u2013 in particular to small and medium-sized companies. The Framework makes clear that such aid is considered as direct aid to the banks' customers, not to the banks themselves, and gives guidance on how to ensure minimal distortion of competition between banks.\n\n(v) Short-term export credit insurance: The Framework introduces additional flexibility on how to demonstrate that certain countries are not-marketable risks, thereby enabling short-term export credit insurance to be provided by the State where needed.\n\nGiven the limited size of the EU budget, the main response will come from Member States' national budgets. The Temporary Framework will help target support to the economy, while limiting negative consequences to the level playing field in the Single Market.\n\nThe Temporary Framework therefore includes a number of safeguards. For example, It links the subsidised loans or guarantees to businesses to the scale of their economic activity, by reference to their wage bill, turnover, or liquidity needs, and to the use of the public support for working or investment capital. The aid should therefore help businesses to weather the downturn and to prepare a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe Temporary Framework complements the many other possibilities already available to Member States to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, in line with EU State aid rules. On 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak setting out these possibilities. For example, Member States can make generally applicable changes in favour of businesses (e.g. deferring taxes, or subsidising short-time work across all sectors), which fall outside State Aid rules. They can also grant compensation to companies for damage suffered due to and directly caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. This can be useful to support particularly impacted sectors, such as transport, tourism, hospitality and retail.\n\nThe Framework will be in place until the end of December 2020. With a view to ensuring legal certainty, the Commission will assess before that date if it needs to be extended.\n\nBackground\n\nState aid rules enable Member States to take swift and effective action to support citizens and companies, in particular SMEs, facing economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe Temporary Framework adopted today complements the ample possibilities for Member States to design measures in line with existing EU State aid rules, as set out in the Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak of 13 March 2020. In particular, they can adopt measures that fall outside the scope of State aid control, such as national funds granted to health services or other public services to tackle the Covid-19. Member States can also immediately act through public support measures that are available to all companies such as wage subsidies, suspension of payments of corporate and value added taxes or social contributions. In addition, Member States can grant financial support directly to consumers, for example for cancelled services or tickets that are not reimbursed by the operators concerned.\n\nIn addition, EU State aid rules enable Member States to help companies cope with liquidity shortages and needing urgent rescue aid. Article 107(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enables Member States to compensate companies for the damage directly caused by exceptional occurrences, such as those caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, including measures in sectors such as aviation and tourism.\n\nThe Commission had adopted a Temporary Framework in 2008, in response to the global financial crisis.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommunication from the Commission - Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n","2904e39ecdb51fc23c7ecc20111c3b785a63e808c3766af5465e6cf134265013":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has adopted a\u00a0third amendment to extend the scope of the State aid Temporary Framework adopted on 19 March 2020 to support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. The Temporary Framework was first amended on 3 April 2020 to increase possibilities for public support to research, testing and production of products relevant to fight the coronavirus outbreak, to protect jobs and to further support the economy. On 8 May 2020, the Commission adopted a second amendment extending the scope of the Temporary Framework to recapitalisation and subordinated debt measures.\n\nExecutive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said \u201cMicro, small and start-up companies are crucial for the economic recovery of the Union. They have been particularly affected by the liquidity shortage caused by the coronavirus outbreak, and face greater difficulties to access financing. Today, we have extended the Temporary Framework to enable Member States to support these companies further. We have also introduced conditions that provide incentives for private investors to participate alongside the State in recapitalisations, thus reducing the need for State aid and the risk of distortions to competition. Finally, we recall that State aid shall not be granted on the condition of the relocation of production or of another activity of the beneficiary from elsewhere in our Union \u2013 because the Single Market is our greatest asset. We continue to work closely with Member States to help European businesses weather this crisis and bounce back strongly, whilst maintaining a level playing field to the benefit of all European consumers and businesses.\u201d\n\nSupport to support micro and small companies including start-ups\n\nThe main purpose of the Temporary Framework is to provide targeted support to otherwise viable companies that have entered into financial difficulty as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Therefore, companies that were already in difficulty before 31 December 2019 are not eligible for aid under the Temporary Framework, but may benefit from aid under existing State aid rules, in particular the Rescue and Restructuring Guidelines. These Guidelines set clear conditions according to which such companies must define sound restructuring plans that will allow them to achieve long-term viability.\n\nAt the same time, micro and small companies (i.e. undertakings with less than 50 employees and less than EUR 10 million of annual turnover and\/or annual balance sheet total)have been particularly affected by the liquidity shortage caused by the economic impact of the current coronavirus outbreak, exacerbating their existing difficulties to access financing compared to larger enterprises. If left unaddressed, these difficulties could lead to a large number of bankruptcies of micro and small companies, causing serious disturbances for the entire EU economy.\n\nToday's amendment extends the Temporary Framework to enable Member States to provide public support under the Temporary Framework to all micro and small companies, even if they were already in financial difficulty on 31 December 2019.\n\nThis will apply, unless such companies are in insolvency proceedings, have received rescue aid that has not been repaid, or are subject to a restructuring plan under State aid rules. Given their limited size and involvement in cross-border transactions, temporary State aid to micro and small companies is less likely to distort competition in the Internal Market than State aid to larger companies.\n\nThis amendment also effectively increases the possibilities to support start-up companies, the vast majority of which fall within the micro and small companies cluster, especially innovative ones which may be loss-making in their high-growth phase, which are crucial for the economic recovery of the Union.\n\nThe Commission recalls further that all small and medium-sized enterprises that were in existence for less than three years on 31\u00a0December 2019 could already benefit from the aid measures laid down in the Temporary Framework provided they are not in insolvency proceedings or have received rescue aid that has not been repaid or are subject to a restructuring plan under State aid rules.\n\nIncentives for private investors to participate in coronavirus-related recapitalisation aid measures\n\nThe Commission has also adapted the conditions for recapitalisation measures under the Temporary Framework for those cases where private investors contribute to the capital increase of companies together with the State.\n\nThese changes will encourage capital injections with significant private participation in companies, limiting the need for State aid and the risk of competition distortions. In particular, if the State decides to grant recapitalisation aid, but private investors contribute to the capital increase in a significant manner (in principle at least 30% of the new equity injected) at the same conditions as the State, the acquisition ban and the cap on the remuneration of the management are limited to three years. Furthermore, the dividend ban is lifted for the holders of the new shares as well as for existing shares, provided that the holders of those existing shares are altogether diluted to below 10% in the company.\n\nThis will increase the incentives for companies to seek market as well as State contributions to their capital needs, whilst maintaining safeguards to preserve effective competition in the Single Market.\n\nFurthermore, in line with the principle of neutrality towards public or private ownership of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, today's amendment will also enable companies with an existing State shareholding to raise capital from their shareholders similar to private companies. Where the conditions above as regards the participation of private investors in the capital increase are met and the State is an existing shareholder (i.e. was a shareholder already before the granting of recapitalisation aid) investing pro rata to its existing shareholding, the Commission does not consider it necessary to impose specific conditions as regards the State's exit.\n\nProtection of the Single Market and ensuring a level playing field \n\nWith the amendment, the Commission has clarified that aid should not be conditioned on the relocation of the production activity or of another activity of the beneficiary from another country within the European Economic Area (EEA) to the territory of the Member State granting the aid, since such a condition would be particularly harmful for the internal market.\n\nBackground\n\nOn 19 March 2020, the Commission adopted a new State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, based on Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Temporary Framework was amended on 3 April and 8 May 2020. The Temporary Framework recognises that the entire EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. It enables Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy, while limiting negative consequences to the level playing field in the Single Market.\n\nOn 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak setting out these possibilities.

The new contract also provides for the possibility to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nToday's contract with Moderna builds upon the broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the already signed contracts with BioNTech\/Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Curevac and Moderna. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe has access to 2.6 billion doses, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective.\n\nThe Commission has granted conditional marketing authorisation for the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer on 21 December 2020, Moderna on 6 January 2021 and AstraZeneca on 29 January 2021.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said:  \u201cToday, we are securing 300 million additional doses of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Moderna, which is already used for vaccination in the European Union. This brings us closer to our major objective: ensure that all Europeans have access to safe and effective vaccines as quickly as possible. With a portfolio of up to 2.6 billion doses, we will be able to provide vaccines not just to our citizens, but to our neighbours and partners as well.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cWith this new contract with Moderna, we are adding another 300 million doses of an authorised safe and effective vaccine. It marks another step towards our objective of providing swift access to safe and effective vaccinations to citizens in Europe and beyond over the course of this year. The contract is important not only for the short term needs of the EU, but also for our future work to limit the rapid spread of new variants.\u201d\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in\u00a0biology, transferring instructions from DNA to the cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions produce harmless fragments of the virus, which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce a spike protein, a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences \u2014 antibodies and T cells \u2014 against it.\n\nThe Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the companies' experience in vaccine development and their production capacity to supply the whole of the EU, as well as their capacity to potentially develop a vaccine against coronavirus variants.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.\n\nOnce vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission has adopted further actions to reinforce preparedness and response measures across the EU, a strategy on staying safe from COVID-19 during winter offering further support to Member States in the deployment of vaccines and a new Communication on a united front the beat COVID-19. The Commission has also adopted a plan to prepare Europe for the increased threat of variants and the possibility of them being resistant to existing vaccines.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\nMore Information\n\nSafe COVID-19 Vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nOverview of the Commission's Response\n\n","294b4d993e16f560fd72752c70424cebcce61f013cbf9ff5b5281b9ebdf6b649":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission is today calling on Member States to ensure that Europeans have access to essential medicines during the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic has highlighted significant challenges in ensuring the supply of the critical medicines needed and the impact such an outbreak can have on the supply chain of medicines in the EU. The Commission guidelines focus on the rational supply, allocation and use of vital medicines to treat coronavirus patients as well as medicines which may be at risk of shortage due to the pandemic. The proposed actions should allow for a more coordinated approach across the EU, preserving the integrity of the Single Market whilst protecting public health.\n\nCommissioner Stella Kyriakides, in charge of Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cThis unprecedented health crisis is putting our health care systems under enormous strain \u2013 with stocks of essential medicines in many European hospitals at risk of running low. We cannot afford to have shortages of life-saving medicines at such a critical moment. Today, we are presenting concrete actions to Member States to proactively prevent shortages and ensure that our hospitals have the essential medicines needed to save lives. I call on the solidarity and responsibility of the EU pharmaceutical industry to increase the production of medicines needed to treat seriously ill coronavirus patients.\u201d\n\nThe Commission guidelines on the optimal and rational use of medicines stress the need for national authorities to:\n\n\tShow solidarity through the lifting of export bans and restrictions, ensuring that essential medicines are available in hospitals and pharmacies and that national stockpiling is avoided. National authorities should also fight misinformation that could lead to unnecessary stockpiling due to panic buying.\n\tEnsure supply by increasing and reorganising production through the monitoring of stocks and production capacities, the coordination of joint efforts by industry and implementing demand support and procurement initiatives to encourage supply. Where Member States need to support industry increasing their manufacturing capacity through fiscal incentives and state aid and implement regulatory flexibility, the Commission stands ready to provide guidance and legal certainty.\n\tPromote the optimal use of medicines in hospitals, in particular by adapting existing hospital protocols or establishing new validated protocols to prevent the overuse of medicines, as well as providing the possibility to extend the expiry dates of medicines.\n\tOptimise sales in community pharmacies to avoid hoarding through the introduction of restrictions on sales for medicines at risk of shortages and temporarily considering the limitation of online sales of essential medicines.\n\n\nOver the past weeks, the Commission, with the support of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has been gathering data on current challenges with a view to monitor, assess and identify medicines at risk of shortages. This includes monitoring overall demand from Member States, as well as the impact of third country export bans.\n\nThe risk of shortages is due primarily to the increase in demand for medicines to treat coronavirus patients in hospitals. Stockpiling by citizens, an increased demand for experimental medicines for coronavirus, the introduction of protectionist measures within and outside the EU such as export bans and national stockpiling, as well as transportation barriers between countries, also play a role.\n\nAdditionally, Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager in charge of competition policy, is putting forward a temporary framework explaining when and how firms can obtain guidance or written comfort that cooperation to avoid shortages of essential scarce products and services is in line with competition rules.\n\nUseful links\n\nDedicated Commission webpage on the EU's response to the COVID-19 outbreak\n\n","2c8a29c45d627e24d77a589cf33ac20396e101b70864acdf11e91e008b8252f1":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday the Commission invited Schengen Member States and Schengen Associated States to extend the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for another 30 days, until 15 June. While some EU and Schengen Associated States are taking preliminary steps towards easing the measures for fighting the spread of the pandemic, the situation remains fragile both in Europe and worldwide. This calls for continued measures at the external borders to reduce the risk of the disease spreading through travel to the EU. The lifting of travel restrictions should be phased: as underlined in the Joint European Roadmap on lifting containment measures, internal border controls will need to start being lifted gradually and in a coordinated manner before restrictions at the external borders can be relaxed in a second stage.\n\nVice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \u201cThe overall objective of limiting the spread of coronavirus via reduced social interaction remains. Despite progress in many European countries, the situation worldwide is very fragile. It is imperative that any action taken is gradual, with different measures being lifted in different phases.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson underlined: \u201cWe need a phased and coordinated approach. Restoring the normal functioning of the Schengen area of free movement is our first objective as soon as the health situation allows it. Restrictions on free movement and internal border controls will need to be lifted gradually before we can remove restrictions at the external borders and guarantee access to the EU for non-EU residents for non-essential travel.\u201d\n\nThe travel restriction, as well as the invitation to extend it, applies to the \u2018EU+ area', which includes all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) \u2013 30 countries in total. The Commission calls for a continued coordinated approach to the prolongation, as action at the external borders can only be effective if implemented by all EU and Schengen States at all borders, with the same end date and in a uniform manner.\n\nThe Commission will continue to assist Member States in implementing the restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, including through regular videoconference meetings with Home Affairs Ministers. Any further prolongation of the travel restriction beyond 15 June 2020 would need to be assessed again, based on the evolution of the epidemiological situation.\n\nBackground \n\nThe Commission invited Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days. On 8 April, the Commission called for prolonging the travel restriction until 15 May. All EU Member States (except Ireland) and non-EU Schengen countries have since taken national decisions to implement and prolong this travel restriction.\n\nTo assist Member States, the Commission presented on 30 March 2020 guidance on how to implement the temporary travel restriction, facilitate repatriations from across the world, and deal with those compelled to stay in the EU longer than they are authorised to as a result of travel restrictions.\n\nThe travel restriction does not apply to EU citizens, citizens of non-EU Schengen countries and their family members, and non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in the EU for the purpose of returning home. In addition, to limit to the minimum the impact of the restriction on the functioning of our societies, Member States should not apply the restrictions to specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need. Essential staff, such as doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, researchers and experts helping to cope with the coronavirus, as well as persons carrying goods, frontier workers and seasonal agricultural workers, should also continue to be allowed to enter the EU.\n\nFor More Information \n\nCommunication on the second assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 8 May 2020\n\nQ&A for people travelling to and from the EU during the pandemic\n\nCommunication on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 16 March 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission invites Member States to prolong restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 May, 8 April 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission presents practical guidance on implementing the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 30 March 2020\n\n","2d2cd399203e3a1f59951e73c7754808790e1c35306c97af52af707c3e227191":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the EU's global response to the coronavirus outbreak, the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis has mobilised an additional \u20ac55 million for refugees from Syria and vulnerable persons in Jordan and Lebanon to fight the pandemic. It will provide critical and targeted support in key areas such as health, water, sanitation and hygiene. The newly adopted package brings the total assistance mobilised through the EU Trust Fund to over \u20ac2.2 billion since 2015, doubling the target originally set.\n\nHigh Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\/Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell, said: \u201cJordan and Lebanon are showing huge resilience and solidarity in hosting Syrian refugees. It is our duty to continue supporting them, especially in the current coronavirus pandemic situation. The EU will host the fourth Brussels Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region on 30 June in direct support of the UN efforts for a comprehensive political solution to the Syrian conflict and to mobilise necessary financial support for Syria and neighbouring countries. The Conference will also continue to provide a unique platform for dialogue with civil society organisations from the region.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, commented: \u201cOur continued commitment to support Syrian refugees and partner countries like Jordan and Lebanon hosting them remains unwavering. We are responding today to the urgent needs in fighting the COVID-19 crisis with a substantial and targeted assistance package. Despite the European Union's continued strong solidarity with partner countries, the needs of the Syrian refugees continue to be important and cannot be neglected. In this regard, the 2020 Brussels IV Conference will provide an opportunity for the international community to mobilise the necessary financial assistance.\u201d\n\nJordan and Lebanon are the countries hosting the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. Today's additional support package focuses on health and water, sanitation and hygiene services:\n\nJordan - \u20ac20.1 million in total:\n\n\t\u20ac11 million to contribute to the coronavirus national response plan, in particular for procurement of medical equipment\n\t\u20ac4 million to support essential water and sanitation services and hygiene kits in refugee camps and for vulnerable host communities\n\t\u20ac3.6 million to strengthen ongoing health and social protection to Palestine Refugees from Syria and hosting communities\n\t\u20ac1.5 million to support further equipping three emergency departments in hospitals to face the pandemic\n\n\nLebanon - \u20ac34.6 million in total:\n\n\t\u20ac10 million to ensure safe municipal water distribution for Syrian refugees and host population\n\t\u20ac10 million to cover the medical management of mild cases in light of the pandemic\n\t\u20ac6 million to provide critical hygiene kits, as well as infection prevention and control kits in informal settlements and for vulnerable Lebanese\n\t\u20ac5 million to the Lebanese Red Cross as the front line responder to the coronavirus\n\t\u20ac3.6 million to strengthen ongoing health and social protection support for Palestine Refugees from Syria and hosting communities\n\n\nThe assistance package was adopted by the Operational Board of the Trust Fund, which brings together the European Commission, the EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. Observers of the Operational Board include Members of the European Parliament, representatives from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the World Bank, and the Syria Recovery Trust Fund.\n\nThe Trust Fund is also reorienting ongoing interventions in key sectors in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Since the beginning of the outbreak and thanks to the Trust Fund's flexibility, the EU and contributing countries have been able to provide personal protective equipment, hygiene kits, infection prevention trainings, health education and awareness campaigns, and essential protection services to women facing gender based violence.\n\nBackground\n\nSince its establishment in December 2014, a significant share of the EU's support to help Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis. The Trust Fund reinforces an integrated EU response to the crisis and primarily addresses longer-term resilience and needs to enhance the self-reliance of Syrian refugees. At the same time, it contributes to ease the pressure on host communities and the administrations in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The Trust Fund has also underpinned the EU Compacts agreed with Jordan and Lebanon to better assist them in coping with the protracted refugee crisis. With the newly adopted package, it has mobilised over \u20ac900 million for Lebanon, over \u20ac500 million for both Jordan and Turkey and more than \u20ac160 million for Iraq. Overall, more than \u20ac2.2 billion have been mobilised from the EU budget and contributions from 21 EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.\n\nThe Trust Fund's programmes support basic education and child protection services for refugees, training and higher education, better access to healthcare, improved access to water and wastewater infrastructure, support to resilience, women empowerment and fighting gender based violence, as well as economic opportunities and social stability. The Fund can also support internally displaced persons in Iraq and actions in the Western Balkans.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis\n\nFactsheet: EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis\n\n","311da5078bd9e0d3911f5d6b9adacad6ab4e39783a77dc278d8b4e4503231d3a":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the pharmaceutical company Novavax with a view to purchasing its potential vaccine against COVID-19.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. The scheme is open to small, medium-sized and large enterprises of all sectors. Aid will be granted in the form of direct grants to enhance and accelerate research and the production of products directly relevant to coronavirus. These include medicinal products including vaccines, hospital and medical equipment including ventilators, protective clothing and equipment as well as diagnostic tools. In particular (i) the R&D part of the scheme covers fundamental research, industrial research and experimental development projects; (ii) the investment part of the scheme will cover 80% of the eligible costs that companies have to bear to create production capacities to manufacture coronavirus relevant products. The Commission found that the Luxembourg scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. To support quick action, companies may also benefit from a bonus when their investment is concluded within two months after the granting of the aid. The Commission therefore concluded that the aid scheme will contribute to the achievement of a common objective of crucial importance, is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to fight the health crisis in line with Article 107(3)(c) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThere is a global consensus on the importance of enhancing and accelerating coronavirus related research and the production of relevant products to address the current emergency health crisis. The \u20ac30 million Luxembourg scheme we approve today will provide incentives to companies to direct their activities to research and production of certain products, which are most crucial in the current circumstances. It is a clear sign that we continue to work closely with all Member States to find solutions to fight the pandemic in line with EU rules.\u201d The full press release is available online.

The Temporary Framework was first amended on 3 April 2020, which increased possibilities for public support to research, testing and production of products relevant to fight the coronavirus outbreak, to protect jobs and to further support the economy. In total, the Commission has adopted 43 decisions approving 53 national measures in relation to the coronavirus outbreak. The Commission is now proposing to extend further the scope of the Temporary Framework by enabling Member States to provide recapitalisations to companies in need. The Commission is consulting Member States on the possibility of providing public support in the form of equity or hybrid capital instruments to these severely affected companies, provided that it is the most appropriate means of support and subject to clear conditions. The proposed broadening of the scope of the Temporary Framework to aid in the form of recapitalisations complements the possibility of Member States to purchase existing shares of companies at market price or pari passu with private shareholders, which in principle falls outside the scope of EU State aid control. This can in particular be important for interventions by Member States to prevent hostile takeovers of strategic companies by foreign purchasers. It therefore complements the tools available to Member States as set out in the Commission's guidelines to ensure a strong EU-wide approach to foreign investment screening in a time of public health crisis and related economic vulnerability. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cOur shared priority faced with the coronavirus crisis is protecting the health of all European citizens. At the same time, the emergency measures are putting a strain on many companies that face a reduction in equity, with negative consequences on their ability to finance their activities. Following the amendment of last week, we will further extend the State aid Temporary Framework to enable Member States to recapitalise companies when necessary and appropriate. We will make sure that taxpayers are sufficiently remunerated for their investment, and companies that receive capital support are subject to controls and governance provisions that limit possible distortions to competition in the Single Market. We continue working with Member States to make sure that the European economy can weather this storm, and bounce back even stronger.\u201d The full Statement is available online.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. The scheme allows for the provision of aid in the form of: (i)\u00a0Direct grants, repayable advances and guarantees with a maximum of \u20ac800 000; (ii)\u00a0State guarantees for loans subject to safeguards for banks to channel State aid to the real economy; (iii) Subsidised public loans to companies, with favourable interest rates. The measure allows aid to be granted by COFAG (COVID-19 Finanzierungsagentur des Bundes GmbH).COFAG is a special purpose vehicle to grant liquidity assistance measures. The measure is targeted at all undertakings and applies to the whole territory of Austria. Aid is granted under the measure either directly or, if it concerns guarantees on loans or subsidised public loans, through credit institutions and other financial institutions as financial intermediaries. The Commission found that the measure is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission therefore concluded that it is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cWe approved a \u20ac15 billion Austrian scheme for grants and guarantees on loans for companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

The schemes were approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. Under the two schemes, the public support will take the form of zero-interest loans and loans with subsidised interest rates, respectively. The schemes aim at enhancing access to liquidity by those companies which are most severely affected by the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, thus ensuring the continuation of their activities. The Commission found that the Croatian measures are in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The measure also involves safeguards to ensure that the aid is channelled effectively to the beneficiaries in need. The Commission therefore concluded that the Croatian measures are necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThese \u20ac1 billion Croatian schemes will enable Croatia to support those companies most affected by the coronavirus outbreak through the provision of loans with zero or very low interest rates.

Trade credit insurance protects companies supplying goods and services against the risk of non-payment by their clients. Given the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the risk of insurers not being willing to maintain their insurance coverage has become higher. The German scheme ensures that trade credit insurance continues to be available to all companies, avoiding the need for buyers of goods or services to pay in advance, therefore reducing their immediate liquidity needs. The Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, and in particular Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which enables the Commission to approve State aid measures implemented by Member States to remedy a serious disturbance in their economy. The Commission found that the scheme notified by Germany is compatible with the principles set out in the EU Treaty and is well targeted to remedy a serious disturbance of the German economy. The Commission therefore concluded that the measure will contribute to managing the economic impact of the coronavirus in Germany and beyond. It is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the general principles set out in the Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020.

After a successful pilot phase, the system goes live today with the first wave of national apps now linked through this service: Germany's Corona-Warn-App, Ireland's COVID tracker, and Italy's immuni. Together, these apps have been downloaded by around 30 million people, which corresponds to two-thirds of all app downloads in the EU.\n\nThierry Breton, Commissioner for Single Market, said: \u201cMany Member States have launched voluntary contact tracing and warning apps, and the Commission has supported them in make these apps safely interact with each other. Free movement is an integral part of the Single Market \u2013 the gateway is facilitating this while helping save lives.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, added: \u201cCoronavirus tracing and warning apps can effectively complement other measures like increased testing and manual contact tracing. With cases on the rise again, they can play an important role to help us break the transmission chains. When working across borders these apps are even more powerful tools. Our gateway system going live today is an important step in our work, and I would call on citizens to make use of such apps, to help protecting each other.\u201d\n\nJens Spahn, Germany's Federal Minister of Health, said: \u201cEverywhere in Europe, infections are on the rise again. Right now, national warning apps are making a real difference. Because every infection chain that, thanks to an app, is broken more quickly helps to contain the pandemic. With the new gateway service, we are connecting apps across Europe. Like this, contacts can also be warned during or following a trip abroad.\u201d\n\nIn the fight against coronavirus, most Member States have decided to launch a contact tracing and warning app. In total, 20 apps which are based on decentralised systems can be interoperable through the gateway service. They can be linked to the gateway after following a protocol that foresees several tests and checks, and an update has to be issued for each app. The second group of apps will be linked next week. Then, Czechia's eRou\u0161ka, Denmark's smitte stop, Latvia's Apturi COVID and Spain's Radar Covid are expected to join, while further apps will be linked to the system in November. The overview of participating Member States is available on a dedicated webpage.\n\nThe gateway ensures that apps work seamlessly cross-borders. Thus, users will only need to install one app and when they travel to another participating European country they will still benefit from contact tracing and receiving alerts, be it in their home country or abroad. The gateway server keeps the amount of data exchanged to a minimum. It will efficiently receive and pass on arbitrary identifiers between national apps. No other information than arbitrary keys, generated by the apps, will be handled by the gateway: the information is pseudonymised, encrypted, kept to the minimium, and only stored as long as necessary to trace back infections. It does not allow the identification of individual persons, nor to track location or movement of devices.\n\nThe setup of the gateway follows the agreement by Member States on technical specifications to ensure a safe exchange of information between the backend servers of national contact tracing and warning apps based on a decentralised architecture. The system was developed and set up in less than two months by T-Systems and SAP, and will be operated from the Commission's data centre in Luxembourg.\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nContact tracing apps, if fully compliant with EU rules and well-coordinated, can play a key role in all phases of crisis management. They can complement existing manual contact tracing and help interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Thereby, they can contribute to saving lives.\n\nSince the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Member States, backed by the Commission, have been assessing the effectiveness, security, privacy, and data protection aspects of digital solutions to address the crisis. They have developed an\u00a0EU toolbox\u00a0for contact tracing and warning apps, which was accompanied by guidance on data protection. This was part of a common coordinated approach to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures, as\u00a0set out in a Commission Recommendation. To ensure tracing and warning apps work cross-border, Member States, with the support of the Commission agreed on interoperability guidelines in May, on a set of technical specifications in June, and the Commission adopted an Implementing Decision to provide a legal basis for the gateway service. In September, the system was tested in a pilot phase.\n\nFor more information\n\nCoronavirus: EU interoperability gateway for contact tracing and warning apps \u2013 Questions and Answers\n\nDedicated webpage on the EU interoperability gateway service\n\nVideo clip\n\nFactsheet\n\nInfographic\n\neHealth Network documents\n\nGuidance to ensure full data protection standards of apps fighting the pandemic\n\nECDC guidance on mobile applications in support of contact tracing for COVID-19\n\nCommission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis\n\n","356939f7f3083c6780ffe9ae3ce5fbb2898dc43272aaa4971e19238ffc7b8da5":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus intensifies, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has been activated following a request for assistance from France to provide consular support to EU citizens in Wuhan, China.\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management, said: \u201cThe EU does not forget its citizens in need, wherever they are in the world. Two aircraft will be mobilised through our EU Civil Protection Mechanism to repatriate EU citizens from the Wuhan area to Europe. Our EU Emergency Response Coordination Centre is working 24\/7 and is in constant contact with Member States, the EU Delegations in the region and the Chinese embassy in Brussels. Further EU support can be mobilised if requested.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner responsible for Health and Food Security, said: \u201cWe stand ready to support Member States and ensure a strong and coordinated EU response to the developing situation of the coronavirus, outside and within the Union. We will continue to monitor the situation closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and remain in close contact with our Member States.\u201d\n\nThe EU will co-finance the transport costs of the aircraft. The first aircraft is scheduled to depart from France tomorrow morning, while the second one will leave later in the week. EU citizens present in the region and who wish to be repatriated can still request it, no matter their nationality.\n\nInitial numbers indicate that around 250 French citizens will be transported in the first aircraft and over 100 EU citizens from other countries will join the second aircraft. This is a first request for assistance and others may follow in the coming days.\n\nAt this stage, only healthy or asymptomatic citizens will be authorised to travel. The EU Emergency Response Centre is in constant contact with Member States' governments in order to coordinate the arrivals and subsequent possible quarantine periods.\u00a0\n\nThe European Commission is in regular contact with Member States, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organisation on all aspects of the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBackground \n\nThe EU Civil Protection Mechanism strengthens cooperation between Member States\/Participating States in the field of civil protection, with a view to improving prevention, preparedness and response to disasters. Through the Mechanism, the European Commission plays a key role in coordinating the response to disasters in Europe and beyond.\n\nWhen the scale of an emergency overwhelms the response capabilities of a country, it can request assistance via the Mechanism. Once activated, the Mechanism coordinates assistance made available by its Member States\/Participating States through spontaneous offers. In addition, the EU has created the European Civil Protection Pool to have a critical number of readily available civil protection capacities allowing for a stronger and coherent collective response.\n\nTo date, all EU Member States participate in the Mechanism, as well as Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Turkey. Since its inception in 2001, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has responded to more than 300 requests for assistance inside and outside the EU.\n\nFor More Information\n\nEU Civil Protection Mechanism\n\n","35808b2e6ee521af839860e55bd81a73a641d99363f52a55c2b624b4f9e75f2e":null,"38521d21f1c78abfa15cc1058762e7121d56007bd3460f8218d451f47acca3e2":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood afternoon to all of you,\n\nFirst of all, I want to express my full sympathy for those who are suffering from the Coronavirus. And I want to thank the medical staff who is treating them and doing an outstanding job not only in Europe but all over the world.\n\nAs you know, the Coronavirus has brought governments and health systems throughout Europe to work at all different levels to contain this virus. And so does the Commission, with the support from our agency, the ECDC, and in very close cooperation with the WHO.\n\nYou have witnessed that from the very beginning of the outbreak of the Coronavirus, the European Union has acted. We have for example activated our alert system immediately. We have an ongoing risk assessment that is being carried out in close coordination with all the Member States.\n\nI think very important is our European Health Security Committee that is coordinating all these different national measures, so that we have a very comprehensive approach to contain the virus.\n\nWe have informed you on a regular basis over the last weeks about the support that the Commission provides to the national authorities, in very close cooperation with the agencies.\n\nECDC has announced today that the risk level has risen to moderate to high for people in the European Union. In other words, the virus continues to spread.\n\nWe all know that there are many, many different actions that are needed to address the Coronavirus. They are very multifaceted, they are very manifold. And since eight weeks, we are working intensively on these different work strands. The Commission has been addressing all these work strands.\n\nWe have a situation that is very complex and it requires on the one side, very swift action and on the other side, a strong coordination at all the levels and all the different sectors \u2013 not only on the European level but of course on the national level. And then, a very comprehensive and coherent approach towards the topic from all 27 Member States and the European Union.\n\nThis is why today we are launching the corona response team. This corona response team brings together all the different strands of action that have been in place since many, many weeks \u2013 you have witnessed their outstanding work \u2013, but also brings in place in the corona response team the new work streams, the emerging work streams.\n\nThe corona response team has basically three main pillars. The first pillar is the medical field. It includes topics from prevention and procurement. There are relief measures, information and foresight. It is always in close cooperation with ECDC and our European Medicines Agency. The second big and important column is the pillar that covers mobility, from transport to travel advice and also to the Schengen-related questions. The third pillar covers the economy. It is looking in-depth at various business sectors \u2013 such as tourism or transport, trade, but of course, it is also looking at the value chains and at the broader macro-economic picture we have.\n\nTo bundle this, we also have in parallel launched today a website on the corona response team where all the information we have gathered over all the weeks \u2013 and that comes on a daily basis \u2013 is collected and bundled so that there is a direct access to the very complex, wide-reaching work the corona response team is doing. There are other topics that are presented on the website and worked on in the corona response team, as for example news, press releases, calendars, social media, statistics, which are important on a daily basis from all the different questions that occur in this scenario, [as well as] the general information, like access to studies or links to others, the role and responsibilities, again, if you have different questions that have to be addressed.\n\nAllow me now to introduce the five Commissioners, who will be working together on all these different topics. It is Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, who is in charge of crisis management. It is Stella Kyriakides, who is charge of all the health issues. It is Ylva Johansson, who in charge of border-related issues. It is Adina V\u0103lean, who is in charge of mobility. And Paolo Gentiloni, who is dealing with the macroeconomic aspects.\n\nAnd I would like to invite the different Commissioners now to present their aspects for the day, because this is a situation, where on a daily basis we have actual topics and news we want to work on.\n\n","3ac95a59ae13602736caa0cbded513e5e1da306d4a3ab5c08dee2d5afc5bff79":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tEIB debt instrument will support BioNTech's global development of BNT162 for prevention of COVID-19 infection as well as scale-up of manufacturing capacity in Europe as part of the company's global development and supply strategy\n\tThe project benefits from Horizon 2020 InnovFin and the European Fund for Strategic Investments, joint instruments of the European Commission and the EIB\n\n\nThe European Investment Bank (EIB) and BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTX, BioNTech) today concluded a \u20ac100\u00a0million debt financing agreement to support the development of BNT162, the company's COVID-19 vaccine programme. The deal will also allow the company to expand its manufacturing capacity\u00a0in order to supply the vaccine fast worldwide in response to the pandemic. This will be done at the company's own risk while the clinical studies are ongoing. BioNTech became the first European company to enter clinical testing, having started a clinical trial in Germany in April and a further clinical trial in the United States at the beginning of May. BioNTech's development programme for BNT162 is one of the broadest development programmes globally, with four vaccine candidates being tested in parallel.\n\nmRNA vaccines consist of genetic material, called messenger RNA, that provides instructions for a human cell to make a target protein, or immunogen, which activates the body's immune response against the respective virus. The goal of a vaccine is to stimulate the immune system to generate protective, long-lasting antibody and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and prevent subsequent infection upon exposure to the virus. mRNA vaccines are a potent new developmental class of vaccines with potential for high versatility and favourable safety properties. BioNTech was able to bring the first vaccine candidates from concept into clinical testing in less than three months. Safety, speed and flexibility are of the utmost importance in reacting to the current pandemic.\n\nThe EIB debt investment will be disbursed in two tranches of \u20ac50\u00a0million each, following completion of pre-defined milestones. It is backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments, the financial heart of the Investment Plan for Europe, in which the EIB and the European Commission partner to kick-off investment for EU priority projects. It also benefits from InnovFin Risk Sharing for Corporate Research backed by Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cAs part of our efforts to counter the spread of the coronavirus, we have embarked decisively on the worldwide race to find an effective and safe vaccine as quickly as possible. For this purpose we recently launched the Coronavirus Global Response initiative, while at the same time we mobilised significant funding through Horizon 2020 for research projects aimed at developing a prophylactic and a therapeutic vaccine. I am very pleased that today, together with the European Investment Bank, we are extending our support to BioNTech, which is yet another concrete step towards our goal of getting a vaccine and ensuring access to it for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only way to end the dramatic situation the world has been facing since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic is to come up with a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d said Ambroise Fayolle, EIB Vice-President in charge of innovation. \u201cIn recent years the EIB has become a unique player in supporting highly innovative venture-stage biotech and medtech companies in their research and development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics solutions, and we are doing everything we can to step up our support in the current crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe investments we have made to develop our vaccine platform over the past 12 years have been instrumental in enabling us to develop our COVID-19 vaccine programme rapidly in response to the global health crisis,\u201d said Sierk Poetting, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer of BioNTech. \u201cThis funding commitment by the EIB will further support the next stage of our COVID-19 scale-up activities as we expand our production capacity to enable global supply.\u201d\n\nBioNTech already entered into a \u20ac50 million venture debt agreement under the European Growth Finance Facility for its personalised cancer immunotherapy programme in December 2019. The financing was part of broader EIB activities in the life sciences sector. Some 50 European companies in the life sciences industry have received a total of \u20ac1.3\u00a0billion, backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments, over the last four years.\n\nBackground information\n\nAbout the European Investment Bank\n\nThe European Investment Bank is the long-term lending institution of the European Union owned by its Member States. It makes long-term finance available for sound investments in order to contribute towards EU policy goals. The EIB also supports investments outside the EU.\n\nAbout BioNTech \n\nBiopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) is a next generation immunotherapy company pioneering novel therapies for cancer and other serious diseases. The company exploits a wide array of computational discovery and therapeutic drug platforms for the rapid development of novel biopharmaceuticals. Based on its deep expertise in mRNA vaccine development and in-house manufacturing capabilities, BioNTech and its collaborators are developing multiple mRNA vaccine candidates for a range of infectious diseases alongside its diverse oncology pipeline.\n\nAbout the Investment Plan for Europe\n\nThe Investment Plan for Europeis one of the EU's key actions to boost investment in Europe, thereby creating jobs and fostering growth. To this end, smarter use is made of new and existing financial resources. The EIB Group is playing a vital role in this investment plan. With guarantees from the European Fund for Strategic Investments, the EIB and the European Investment Fund are able to take on a higher share of project risk, encouraging private investors to participate in the projects. To date, the projects and agreements approved under EFSI are expected to mobilise around \u20ac486 billion of investments and to benefit around 1.2 million small and medium-sized companies throughout the EU.\n\nInnovFin - EU Finance for Innovators\n\nUnder Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation programme for 2014-2020, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank Group (EIB and EIF) launched a new generation of financial instruments and advisory services in 2014 to help innovative firms access finance more easily. Until 2020, \u201cInnovFin \u2013 EU Finance for Innovators\u201d is offering a range of tailored products which provides financing in support of research and innovation by small, medium-sized and large companies and the promoters of research infrastructure.\n\n","3dae872d091faa8e2eafdac796e9a0908bba8ab7d3cebe42692dfed0ee84c4be":null,"3f42d9bbd40dd93642c966e02f0508115bf1be5bdcb3cbb17b729c49ae581e6b":null,"3f6215e809bee89a0380ea31d568a49f6bece018ba1234501480a5b9a38a0a92":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU is providing an additional \u20ac105.5 million to countries in the Horn of Africa as the coronavirus pandemic risks worsening the humanitarian situation across the region where many continue to suffer from armed conflict, displacement, and recurrent droughts and floods. Furthermore, a large-scale infestation of locusts threatens food security and livelihoods of many vulnerable people in the region.\n\nCommissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d said: \u201cThe EU remains committed to help address humanitarian needs in countries in the Horn of Africa, all the more so in these challenging times. EU aid will support communities at risk of hunger and strengthen measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. A global pandemic requires a global response.\u201d\n\nFunding from this aid package gos to humanitarian projects in Djibouti (\u20ac500,000), Ethiopia (\u20ac42 million), Kenya (\u20ac15 million) and Somalia (\u20ac48 million). It will help:\n\n\tsupport the health facilities in the provision of basic services, epidemics control and prepare them to face the coronavirus pandemic.\n\tprovide food assistance to people in need, such as by supporting farmers to get seeds and fodder for their livestock; provide treatment for acute malnutrition, especially for young children\n\taddress the basic needs of refugees and internally displaced people, such as protection, shelter, food, access to health and nutrition care and clean water, and education for children.\n\n\nThe EU's humanitarian aid forms part of the broader EU support in the region, which includes longer-term development cooperation.\n\nBackground:\n\nWith some 25 million people already at risk of food shortages in the region, the looming desert locust upsurge is an additional threat to food security and livelihoods, especially for the most vulnerable communities. Their food access is at risk of being further cut down by rising food prices. The situation is further aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic, as prevention and control measures can also, as an indirect consequence, place additional challenges to the delivery of humanitarian aid and to reaching people in need.\n\nEU humanitarian projects in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia addressing food shortages and loss of livelihoods caused by locust swarms are being allocated \u20ac22 million from this aid package. Furthermore, earlier in 2020, the EU already mobilised \u20ac11 million in humanitarian and development funding to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to help it address the locust outbreak in the region and provide support to affected pastoralists and farmers.\n\nA share of the funding announced today will also contribute to the Team Europe's response to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, EU humanitarian aid will be provided to the World Health Organization's global coronavirus response in partnership with health authorities in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia to scale up operational readiness for early detection and response to the pandemic.\n\n","3f8e8fd64c2a6a4bc362da6720e232a46ebbc30f25c89510a4bd367b1e56e5cf":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus: Commission proposes to extend 2020 European Capitals of Culture into 2021\n\nDue to the effects of the coronavirus crisis, the Commission has decided to give Rijeka (Croatia) and Galway (Ireland) the possibility to extend their year as 2020 European Capitals of Culture until 30 April 2021. Those cities have been severely hit, impeding them to implement their European Capital of Culture initiatives. The Commission also proposes to postpone the year in which Novi Sad (Serbia) is due to host a European Capital of Culture from 2021 to 2022 and the year in which Timisoara (Romania) and Elefsina (Greece) will hold the title from 2021 to 2023. Margaritis Schinas, Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, said: \u201cRijeka and Galway deserve a fair chance to bounce back and showcase their resilience and creativity. Opening hearts and minds, welcoming diverse audiences and artists has always been the lifeblood of the European Capitals of Culture. And it shall remain so. I am confident that for Novi Sad, Timisoara and Elefsina, additional time will allow weathering the current downturn in the cultural and tourism sectors and mobilising relevant investment, including through solidarity at European level.\u201d Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"Culture has been badly hit by the pandemic and European Capitals of Culture are no exception. Despite the energy, enthusiasm and professionalism of their teams and partners, Rijeka and Galway were unable to roll out their 2020 European Capital of Culture programmes as planned. I hope that both cities will make the most of the possibility offered to them to prolong their special year. I am sure that Timisoara, Elefsina and Novi Sad, the European Capitals of Culture next in line, will benefit from extra time to prepare their ambitious programmes.\u201d The Commission's proposal now passes to the European Parliament and the Council for consideration and final adoption.

The EIF's guarantee to RBBH is provided under the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility, as part of its coronavirus economic support package. This tool helps provide working capital to European SMEs for the recovery. Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal market, said: \u201cSmall and medium-sized enterprises are heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic. We reacted very quickly to provide them with immediate liquidity. Thanks to this rapid action, the coronavirus measure under the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility is already available in more than 20 European countries.

The measure was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework. The recapitalisation measure is part of a larger recapitalisation package, which also foresees a significant participation of private investors, including the conversion of outstanding privately-held debt instruments into equity. SAS is a major network airline operating in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. In the second quarter of 2020, SAS suffered substantial losses due to the coronavirus outbreak and the travel restrictions that Denmark, Sweden and other countries had to impose to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The Commission found that measure notified by Denmark and Sweden is in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission concluded that the recapitalisation measure will contribute to manage the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in Denmark and Sweden: the measure aims at restoring the balance sheet position and liquidity of SAS in the exceptional situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic, while maintaining the necessary safeguards to limit competition distortions. It is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the two Member States, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the general principles as set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measure under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cSAS plays a key role for the connectivity and economy of Scandinavian countries. As many other companies active in the aviation sector, SAS has been severely hit by the current crisis. With this measure, Denmark and Sweden will contribute up to \u20ac1 billion to SAS's recapitalisation and help the airline weather the current crisis. At the same time, the Member States will be sufficiently remunerated for the risk taxpayers assume, and the support will come with strings attached to limit distortions of competition. I welcome the participation by private investors to the plan, as it limits the need for State aid, while contributing to the recovery of companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d A full press release is available online.

The Commission found that the transaction, as originally notified, would have raised competition concerns in the EEA market for account-to-account core infrastructure services (\u201cA2A CIS\u201d) in relation to managed solutions. The Commission was concerned that the proposed acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices and less choice in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services. To address the Commission's concerns, Mastercard and Nets offered to transfer to a suitable purchaser a global license to distribute, supply, sell, develop, modify, upgrade or otherwise use Nets' Realtime 24\/7 technology, with which the target business currently competes in A2A CIS tenders. The transfer also includes all necessary personnel and services, such as consultancy services and transitional support services, including access to all necessary components and capabilities to provide managed services based on Nets' Realtime 24\/7 technology. The proposed commitments fully address the Commission's competition concerns, as they will increase competition in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services in the EEA, by allowing a new player to effectively and credibly compete in this space. The Commission therefore concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, no longer raises competition concerns in the EEA. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, responsible for competition policy, said: \u201cCompanies and citizens seek competitive and innovative payment solutions for their banking transactions. This merger, as originally notified, would have significantly reduced competition in the market for account-to-account core infrastructure services and undermined the development of new real-time payment solutions, which are becoming increasingly important. Today's decision ensures that effective competition is preserved and facilitates the emergence of a new provider of real-time payment infrastructure services in the European Economic Area.\u201d\u00a0 A full press release is available online.

Both Gehe and Alliance Healthcare are mainly active in pharmaceutical wholesaling in Germany and supply retail pharmacies in Germany. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns, either at national level or at\u00a0 regional level in the catchment areas around distribution warehouses across Germany. This is because there will be a sufficient number of credible competitors available at national level and in each catchment area and the companies will face additional competitive pressure from direct sales of manufacturers after the transaction.

Whether it be boosting preparedness in Europe, in China or elsewhere, the international community must work together.\u00a0Europe is here to play a leading role,\u201d\u00a0said Ursula\u00a0von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission.\n\nJanez\u00a0Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management, and European Emergency Response Coordinator\u00a0said:\u00a0\u201cWith\u00a0more than 2,600 lives lost already, there is no option but to prepare at all levels. Our new aid package will support the World Health Organisation and target funding to ensure countries with weaker health systems are\u00a0not left behind. Our goal is to contain the outbreak at a global level\u201d.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSupport to Member States\n\nFollowing the developments in Italy, the Commission is stepping up its support to Member States in the context of the on-going work on preparedness, contingency and response planning.\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety said: \u201cIn view of the rapidly evolving situation, we stand ready to increase our assistance. In this vein, a joint expert mission of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organisation will depart to Italy this week to support the Italian authorities.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\u00a0\n\nNew\u00a0EU funding will help detect and diagnose the disease, care for infected people and prevent further transmission at this critical time.\n\nOut of the\u00a0\u20ac232\u00a0million aid package:\n\n- \u20ac114 million\u00a0will support the World Health Organization (WHO), in particular the\u00a0global preparedness and response global plan.

We must avoid further disruption of already fragile economies and additional uncertainty for citizens who have made huge sacrifices. They expect this from us after so many months living with COVID-19.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, said: \u201cOur right to move freely in the EU has been heavily impacted by the pandemic. For the many citizens who rely on frictionless travel every day, the cacophony of national rules in the EU is overwhelming. We want to simplify things. We are proposing straightforward criteria, applicable without discrimination, which are easy to follow by Member States and allow to inform Europeans properly.\u201d \n\nCommissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said: \u201cSince March, the Commission has developed and delivered a solid foundation of internal and external border control recommendations for Member States to follow. Today's measures builds on this track record so that we can fully benefit from our Schengen area. That is why we want a clear \u2018green, orange, red' system and not a kaleidoscope of individual measures\u201d. \n\nCommon criteria \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThere is currently a wide discrepancy between national criteria for introducing measures that restrict free movement in the European Union. The Commission is proposing that each Member State takes into account the following criteria when putting in place any restrictive measures:\n\n\tThe total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases per 100 000 people in a given area in a 14-day period;\n\tThe percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests carried out in given area during a seven-day period;\n\tThe number of COVID-19 tests carried out per 100 000 people in a given area during a seven-day period.\n\n\nMember States should provide this data on a weekly basis to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Member States should also provide this data at the regional level to ensure that any measures can be targeted to those regions where they are strictly necessary.\n\nOn the basis that the Member State of departure has a weekly testing rate of more than 250 per 100 000 people, the Commission is proposing that Member States should not restrict free movement of people travelling from another Member State where:\n\n\tThe total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases in a given area is equal to less than 50 per 100 000 people during a 14-day period, OR,\n\tThe percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests in a given area is less than 3%.\n\n\nA common colour code\n\nBased on the data provided by Member States, the Commission proposes that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publishes a map of EU and EEA countries, updated weekly, with a common colour code to support Member States and travellers. The Commission proposes the following:\n\n\tGreen for an area where the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is less than 25 during a 14-day period AND the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is less than 3%;\n\tOrange for an area where the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is less than 50 during a 14-day period BUT the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is 3% or more OR the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is between 25 and 150 BUT the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is less than 3%;\n\tRed for an area where the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is more than 50 during a 14-day period AND the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is 3% or more OR the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is more than 150 per 100 000 people during a 14-day period;\n\tGrey if there is insufficient information available to assess the criteria proposed by the Commission OR the number of COVID-19 tests carried out per 100 000 people is less than 250.\n\n\nA common approach for travellers from high-risk areas\n\nThe Commission proposes a common approach amongst Member States when dealing with travellers coming from \u2018high-risk' zones. Member States should not refuse the entry of persons travelling from other Member States. Member States that introduce restrictions to free movement based on their own decision-making processes, could require:\n\n\tpersons travelling from an area classified as \u2018red' or \u2018grey' to either undergo quarantine OR undergo a COVID-19 test after arrival \u2013 COVID-19 testing being the preferred option;*\n\n\nWhere justified, Member States could consider recommending that persons travelling from an area classified as \u2018orange' undergo at least a COVID-19 test prior to departure or upon arrival. Member States could require persons arriving from an area classified as \u2018red', \u2018orange' or \u2018grey' to submit passenger locator forms, notably those arriving by airplane, in accordance with data protection requirements. Travellers with an essential function or need \u2013 such as workers exercising critical occupations, frontier and posted workers, students or journalists performing their duties - should not be required to undergo quarantine.\n\nClear and timely information to the public \n\nThe Commission proposes that Member States provide details of upcoming restrictions to free movement or the lifting of travel restrictions to Member States and the Commission on a weekly basis. Changes should be notified a week before entering into force.\n\nInformation should also be made available on the \u2018Re-open EU' web platform, with a link to the weekly-published map by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nCitizens and businesses need predictability. Member States must make all efforts to minimise the social and economic impact of travel restrictions. This should include the provision of information to the public in in a clear, comprehensive and timely manner.\n\nBackground\n\nThe right of European citizens to move and reside freely within the European Union is one of the most cherished achievements of the European Union, as well as an important driver of our economy. Any restrictions to the fundamental right of free movement within the EU should only be put in place where strictly necessary and be coordinated, proportionate and non-discriminatory to address public health risks. \u00a0To limit the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on free movement. A well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, safeguard the health of citizens as well as maintain free movement within the Union, under safe conditions. This is important for the millions of citizens who rely on frictionless cross-border travel every day, and crucial for our efforts to start safely re-building the economy.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Commission's proposal for a Recommendation will be discussed by the Council with the aim of an adoption in the coming weeks.\n\nMore information\n\nProposal for a Council Recommendation on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nRe-open EU\n\n","423ca5cb89149ce41a92b141d5739b6559052af9cec0ee95918f7fcc0072ff7a":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission has today adopted a banking package to help facilitate bank lending to households and businesses throughout the European Union. The aim of this package is to ensure that banks can continue to lend money to support the economy and help mitigate the significant economic impact of the Coronavirus. It includes an Interpretative Communication on the EU's accounting and prudential frameworks, as well as targeted \u201cquick fix\u201d amendments to EU banking rules.\n\nThe rules put in place following the financial crisis have ensured that banks in the EU are now more resilient and better prepared to deal with shocks to the economy. Today's Communication recalls that EU rules allow banks and their supervisors to act in a flexible, but responsible, manner during economic crises to support citizens and firms, particularly small and medium-sized companies. Today's Regulation also implements some targeted changes to maximise the capacity of credit institutions to lend and to absorb losses related to the Coronavirus pandemic, while still ensuring their continued resilience.\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People said: \u201cWe are supporting households and businesses as much as we can to deal with the economic fallout of the Coronavirus. The banking sector can do a lot to help here. We are using the full flexibility of the EU's banking rules and proposing targeted legislative changes to enable banks to keep the liquidity taps turned on, so that households and companies can get the financing they need. I will soon also be launching roundtable discussions bringing together consumer and business groups with the financial sector so that we can address the most urgent needs of our citizens and companies.\u201d\n\nThe Commission will engage with the European financial sector to explore how it can develop best practices that could further support citizens and businesses. The EU's response to this crisis must be coordinated in order to avoid national fragmentation and to ensure a level playing field.\n\nTargeted amendments to banking rules\n\nThe Commission proposed today a few targeted \u201cquick fix\u201d amendments to the EU's banking prudential rules (the Capital Requirements Regulation) in order to maximise the ability of banks to lend and absorb losses related to Coronavirus. The Commission proposes exceptional temporary measures to alleviate the immediate impact of Coronavirus-related developments, by adapting the timeline of the application of international accounting standards on banks' capital, by treating more favourably public guarantees granted during this crisis, by postponing the date of application of the leverage ratio buffer and by modifying the way of excluding certain exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio. The Commission also proposes to advance the date of application of several agreed measures that incentivise banks to finance employees, SMEs and infrastructure projects.\n\nInterpretative Communication\n\nToday's Communication confirms the recent statements on using flexibility within accounting and prudential rules, such as those made by the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank, amongst others. The Commission encourages banks and supervisory authorities to make use of the flexibility in the EU's accounting and prudential frameworks. For example, the Communication confirms \u2013 and welcomes \u2013 the flexibility available in EU rules when it comes to public and private moratoria on loan repayments (EBA guidelines of 2 April). The Communication also highlights areas where banks are invited to act responsibly, for example by refraining from making dividend distributions to shareholders or adopting a conservative approach to the payment of variable remuneration. Today's Communication also recalls how banks can help businesses and citizens through digital services, including contactless and digital payments. \n\n\nFor more information\n\nCommission Interpretative Communication on the application of the accounting and prudential frameworks to facilitate EU bank lending (Supporting businesses and households amid COVID-19)\n\nProposal to amend Regulation (EU) No\u00a0575\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms\n\nRegulation (EU) No\u00a0575\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No\u00a0648\/2012 Text with EEA relevance\n\nQuestions and Answers: Coronavirus response: Banking Package to facilitate bank lending- Supporting households and businesses in the EU\n\n","4260d4c621ffcbe1d78a579093b37e172aea0913fb09bef2fe2b4bfec55d91be":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission has today proposed modifications to its budget for 2020 to make \u20ac11.5 billion for crisis repair and recovery available already in 2020. Once available, the funds will go to help the regions most in need, support businesses and those in need outside EU borders.\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn in charge of the budget said: \u201cFor our path to recovery it will be crucial that additional funds will be made available and reach businesses and citizens as soon as possible and still in this year\u201d.\n\nThe proposal is a technical follow-up of the major recovery plan that the Commission put forward last week, consisting of a new recovery instrument, Next Generation EU, embedded within a powerful, modern and revamped long-term EU budget. As part of the plan, the Commission has proposed to raise \u20ac750 billion on the markets and channel them to the EU recovery. To make this possible, the Commission proposed to temporarily lift the Own Resources Ceiling of its long-term budget (the maximum amount of funds that the Union can request from Member States to cover its financial obligations) and the ceiling on the actual spending (MFF payment ceiling). To achieve that, the Commission proposed to amend the Own Resources Decision \u2013 the legal text which sets the conditions to fund the EU budget. This requires a unanimous decision of all Member States and approval according to national constitutional requirements.\n\nTo bridge the period until ratification of the amended Own Resources Decision, and make much needed funding available to workers, businesses and Member States already in 2020, the Commission proposed last week to adjust the current 2014-2020 long-term budget in order to allow for higher spending still in 2020. Today's proposal comes on top, making sure that the additional 11.5 billion for REACT-EU, the Solvency Support Instrument and European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) will become available as early as possible this year.\n\nBackground\n\nOn 27 May, the European Commission has put forward its proposal for a major recovery plan. To ensure the recovery is sustainable, even, inclusive and fair for all Member States, the European Commission proposed to create a new recovery instrument, Next Generation EU, embedded within a powerful, modern and revamped long-term EU budget. Next Generation EU of \u20ac750 billion as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027 will bring the total financial firepower of the EU budget to \u20ac1.85 trillion.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nEU Budget Communication: \u201cThe EU budget powering the recovery plan for Europe\u201d\n\nWebsite for the MFF proposals\n\nWebsite on the Commission's coronavirus response\n\nIP: Europe's moment: Repair and prepare for the next generation\n\nQ&A on the MFF and Next Generation EU\n\nFactsheet 1The EU budget powering the Recovery Plan for Europe\n\nFactsheet 2 Key instruments supporting the Recovery Plan for Europe\n\nFactsheet 3 Financing the Recovery Plan for Europe\n\nDraft amending budget 6\n\n\u00a0\n\n","451c2f8c8828869ea1823f0a22ac479b4029c806cb6cfe568cd7127bbf79a280":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has disbursed \u20ac14 billion to nine Member States in the fourth instalment of financial support to Member States under the SURE instrument. This is the first disbursement in 2021. As part of today's operations, Belgium has received \u20ac2 billion, Cyprus \u20ac229 million, Hungary \u20ac304 million, Latvia \u20ac72 million, Poland \u20ac4.28 billion, Slovenia \u20ac913 million, Spain \u20ac1.03 billion, Greece \u20ac728 million and Italy \u20ac4.45 billion. All nine Member States had already received financial support under SURE in 2020, under one of the first three issuances and disbursement operations that took place in 2020.\n\nThese loans will assist Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help Member States cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures that they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, including for the self-employed. Today's disbursements follow the issuance of the fourth social bond under the EU SURE instrument, which attracted a considerable interest by investors. The notable oversubscription was translated into favourable pricing terms, which the Commission is directly passing on to the benefitting Member States.\n\nFollowing today's disbursements, 15 Member States have received a total of \u20ac53.5 billion under the SURE instrument. Once all SURE disbursements have been completed, Belgium will have received \u20ac7.8 billion, Cyprus \u20ac479 million, Hungary \u20ac504 million, Latvia \u20ac192 million, Poland \u20ac11.2 billion, Slovenia \u20ac1.1 billion, Spain \u20ac21.3 billion, Greece \u20ac2.7 billion and Italy \u20ac27.4 billion.\n\nAn overview of the amounts disbursed so far and the different maturities of the bonds are available online here. A breakdown of the \u20ac90.3 billion that have been authorised for 18 Member States so far is here. Member States can still submit requests to receive financial support under SURE which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion.\n\nMembers of the College said: \n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cUnder the SURE programme, the EU has mobilised up to \u20ac100 billion in loans for EU Member States to save jobs and keep people in work. The funds are regularly making their way to our Member States, helping them financially to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201dFollowing the fourth successful bond issuance under SURE, we have now disbursed more than half of the funds foreseen under this instrument. The 15 Member States benefitting from the initial four disbursements are now better equipped to alleviate the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic. We will proceed with a speedy implementation of the rest of the programme in order to provide all authorised funds for the 18 Member States that have so far requested financial support under this instrument\u201d.\n\nPaolo\u00a0Gentiloni,\u00a0Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cToday, the European Commission pays out a further \u20ac14 billion to support workers in nine hard-hit EU countries. The pandemic continues to weigh on our economies and while we know there is light at the end of this tunnel, we don't yet know how much longer until we reach it. That's why SURE and the European solidarity it represents are so important.\u201d\n\nBackground \n\nOn 26 January, the European Commission issued the fourth social bond under the EU SURE instrument and the first one for 2021, for a total value of \u20ac14 billion. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac10 billion due for repayment in June 2028 and \u20ac4 billion due for repayment in November 2050.\n\nThere was high demand among investors \u2013 the bonds were over 8 and 12 times oversubscribed, respectively, which once again enabled the Commission to obtain very good pricing conditions. More concretely, the 7-year bond was priced at a negative yield of -0.497%. This means that for every \u20ac105 that Member States get, they pay back \u20ac100 when the bond matures. The 30-year bond was priced on the slightly positive territory, at 0.134%, which is an excellent result for this maturity. These are being passed on directly to the EU Member States.\n\nThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.\n\nFor More Information\n\nPress release on the fourth bond issuance\n\nSURE Regulation\n\nFactsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes SURE\n\nCoronavirus response\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\n","4554cae59c3feaa0ee03aa3005b8eeb5a5f5dd97d485e110dcb084655c39dd99":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team of European doctors and nurses from Romania and Norway, deployed through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, is being immediately dispatched to Milan and\u00a0 Bergamo to help Italian medical staff working to battle the coronavirus.

The platform, part of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan, marks another milestone in the EU's efforts to support researchers in Europe and around the world in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. \n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201cLaunching the European COVID-19 Data Platform is an important concrete measure for stronger cooperation in fighting the coronavirus. Building on our dedicated support for open science and open access over the years, now is the time to step up our efforts and stand united with our researchers. Through our joint efforts, we will better understand, diagnose and eventually overpower the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe new platform will provide an open, trusted, and scalable European and global environment where researchers can store and share datasets, such as DNA sequences, protein structures, data from pre-clinical research and clinical trials, as well as epidemiological data. It is the result of a joint effort by the European Commission, the European Bioinformatics Institute of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI), the Elixir infrastructure and the\u00a0COMPARE project, as well as the EU Member States and other partners.\n\nRapid open sharing of data greatly accelerates research and discovery, allowing for an effective response to the coronavirus emergency. The European COVID-19 Data Platform is in line with the principles established in the Statement on Data Sharing in Public Health Emergency and accentuates the Commission's commitment to open research data and Open Science, which aims at making science more ef\ufb01cient, reliable, and responsive to societal challenges. In this context, the platform is also a priority pilot, aimed at realising the objectives of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and builds upon established networks between EMBL-EBI and national public health data infrastructures.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nERAvsCorona Action Plan \n\nOn 7 April 2020, research and innovation Ministers from all 27 EU Member States supported 10 priority actions of the ERAvsCorona Action Plan. Building on the overall objectives and the tools of the European Research Area (ERA), the Action Plan covers short-term actions based on close coordination, cooperation, data sharing and joint funding efforts between the Commission and the Member States. It is centred around the key principles of the European Research Area, which will now be used to achieve towards their maximum effect to help researchers and EU Member States succeed in their fight against the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nIn addition to the European COVID-19 Data Platform launched today, the other actions focus on coordinating of funding, extending large EU-wide clinical trials, increasing support to innovative companies and supporting a pan-European Hackathon in the end of April to mobilise European innovators and the civil society. The joint plan listing priority actions will be regularly updated in a co-creative manner between the Commission services and national governments in the coming months.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThe EU is taking strong action to fight the pandemic. The Commission is also committing hundreds of millions of euros in research and innovation measures to develop vaccines, new treatments, diagnostic tests and medical systems to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nBuilding on long-term investments made before the coronavirus outbreak (through FP7 & Horizon 2020), including on surveillance and preparedness, the EU has rapidly mobilised \u20ac48.2 million for 18 shortlisted research projects that are now working on rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, new treatments, new vaccines as well as on epidemiology and modelling to improve preparedness and response to outbreaks. The projects involve 151 research teams from around the world. \n\nIn addition, the EU has mobilised public and private funding of up to \u20ac90 million through the Innovative Medicines Initiative, and offered up to \u20ac80 million of financial support to the innovative company CureVac to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the coronavirus.\n\nMoreover, a recent European Innovation Council Accelerator call of \u20ac164 million has attracted a significant number of start-ups and SMEs with innovations that could also help tackle the pandemic. At the same time over 50 ongoing or completed European Research Council projects are contributing to the response to the coronavirus pandemic by providing insights from several different scientific fields (virology, epidemiology, immunology, public health, medical devices, social behaviour, crisis management). \n\nTo strengthen global cooperation, the EU is coordinating international initiatives under the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Diseases Preparedness (GloPID-R), which brings together 29 funding bodies from 5 continents and the WHO. It is also contributing \u20ac20 million to the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI). Finally, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) is funding three calls of up to \u20ac28 million from Horizon 2020 to support research on the coronavirus and strengthen research capacities in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nMore Information*\n\nEuropean COVID-19 Data Platform\n\nERAvsCorona Action Plan\n\nEUvsVirus Hackathon website\n\nCoronavirus Research and Innovation initiatives\n\nPress release: Coronavirus: EU global response to fight the pandemic\n\nCOVID response Seal of Excellence\n\n\n\n<p class=\"media-copyright\">@ add copyrigth here 2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n* Updated on 21\/04\/2020 15:45\n\n","48ebde3356d071c5e97f260ef68249fca350e3a0eaaecfe6bf5eade387b3a883":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Commission is launching \u2018Re-open EU', a web platform to support a safe relaunch of travelling and tourism across Europe. It will provide real-time information on borders and available means of transport and tourism services in Member States. Re-open EU will also include practical information provided by Member States on travel restrictions, public health and safety measures such as on physical distancing or wearing of facemasks, as well as other useful information on EU and national tourism offers. This will allow Europeans to take responsible and well-informed decisions on how to manage continuing risks related to Coronavirus while planning their holidays and travels during this summer and beyond.\n\nThierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, said: \u201cAfter weeks of confinement, EU internal borders are reopening. The Re-open EU website we are launching today will provide travellers with easy access to information to help them confidently make their travel plans and stay safe during their trip. It will also help small restaurant and hotel owners, as well as towns across Europe, draw inspiration from innovative solutions developed by others.\u201d\n\nMariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, and responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: \u201cEurope's vast and rich cultural heritage is one of our major assets. But with no possibility to travel and with most venues closed these past months, culture and tourism have been hit hard. The Re-open EU platform provides up to date, essential information so that we can start exploring Europe safely again\u201d. \n\nThe Re-open EU platform is part of the Commission's Tourism and Transport package of 13 May 2020, launched to rebuild confidence among travellers in the EU and help European tourism resume safely, in line the necessary health precautions. The new platform, which also comes with a mobile friendly version (a web-based app), acts as a key point of reference for anyone travelling in the EU as it centralises up-to-date information from the Commission and the Member States in one place. It will allow people to browse country-specific information, updates and advice for each EU Member State through an interactive map. It will be easily accessible via app or website, and be available in the 24 official EU languages.\n\nFurthermore, the platform includes information on patronage voucher schemes that allow consumers to show support for their favourite hotels or restaurants by buying vouchers for a future stay or meal once they reopen, to help the European hospitality industry as restrictions are lifted and borders reopen. Patronage vouchers help businesses to overcome cash-flow bottlenecks, with services provided later. The amount paid by the customer goes directly to the service provider. By setting up the dedicated page, the Commission intends to help better link participating businesses and interested customers, especially when travelling abroad.\n\nFinally, Europe's digital cultural platform, Europeana, is launching Discovering Europe, a collection of art works and photographs of some of Europe's most iconic landmarks. Furthermore, a dedicated tourism hub will be created on Europeana Pro to help cultural heritage professionals discover initiatives supporting tourism throughout the EU.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Commission package on tourism and transport in 2020 and beyond, adopted on 13 May 2020, announced the publication of a dedicated website to provide travellers with all relevant information to travel safely in the EU.\u00a0The Commission also announced its intention to build on the momentum of patronage voucher schemes and work with national authorities, local tourism organisations and businesses to multiply and scale up such initiatives.\n\nMinisters responsible for tourism first discussed the launch of a dedicated Re-open EU platform during their 20 May video conference and broadly welcomed the initiative. Developed by the Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), Re-open EU offers real-time information covering some 30 indicators on transport, public health and tourism, provided by Member States and supplemented by data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).\n\nOn 11 June 2020, the Commission presented its recommendations for a partial and gradual lifting of travel restrictions to the EU after 30 June and called on Member States to remove restrictions to free movement and lift internal border controls by 15 June, considering the improving health situation in the EU and the implementation of physical distancing and other health-related measures by Member States.\n\nThrough Re-open EU, the Commission also provides relevant information on tourism offers in different Member States, including EU actions such as European Capitals of Smart Tourism, European Destinations of Excellence (EDEN) and the European Capitals of Culture.\n\nFor more information\n\nRe-Open EU website\n\nEuropeana \n\nDiscovering Europe\n\nEuropeana Pro\n\nTourism and Transport package\n\nCommunication on the third assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU\n\nEuropean Consumer Centres - help and advice for consumers in Europe\n\nEuropean Commission Corona Response website\n\n","49aca7824c2c41140fb5b334910fe00245aec49bebafc5164a65b70ca234aef0":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has today welcomed the agreement between the European Parliament and EU Member States in the Council on Europe's next long-term budget and NextGenerationEU, the temporary recovery instrument. Once adopted, the package of a total of \u20ac1.8 trillion will be the largest package ever financed through the EU budget. It will help rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe, which will be greener, more digital, more resilient and better fit for the current and forthcoming challenges.\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cI welcome today's agreement on our Recovery Plan and the next Multiannual Financial Framework. We now need to move forward with finalising the agreement on the next long-term budget and NextGenerationEU by the end of the year. Help is needed for citizens and business badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Our recovery plan will help us turn the challenge of the pandemic into an opportunity for a recovery led by the green and digital transition\u201d.\n\nEuropean Commissioner Johannes Hahn in charge of the budget, who worked to facilitate the deal since the beginning of the mandate, said: \u201cToday's agreement will allow to reinforce specific programmes under the long-term budget for 2021-2027 (including Horizon Europe, Erasmus+, EU4Health). All in all, the EU long-term budget together with NextGenerationEU will amount to more than \u20ac1.8 trillion. It will play an essential role to support the recovery and make sure traditional beneficiaries of EU funds receive the sufficient means to continue their work during these very challenging times for all\u201d.\n\nMain elements of today's compromise include: \n\n\tMore than 50% of the amount will support modernisation through policies that include research and innovation, via Horizon Europe; fair climate and digital transitions, via the Just Transition Fund and the Digital Europe Programme; preparedness, recovery and resilience, via the Recovery and Resilience Facility, rescEU and a new health programme, EU4Health.\n\tTraditional policies such as cohesion and common agricultural policy also continue to receive significant financial support, so much necessary to ensure stability in times of crisis and their modernisation that should contribute to the recovery and the green and digital transitions.\n\t30% of the EU funds will be spent to fight climate change, the highest share ever of the largest European budget ever. The package also pays a specific attention to biodiversity protection and gender equality.\n\tThe budget will have strengthened flexibility mechanisms to guarantee it has the capacity to address unforeseen needs. This is making it a budget fit not only for today's realities but also for tomorrow's uncertainties. \n\tAs proposed in May 2020 and agreed by EU leaders on 21 July 2020, to finance the recovery, the EU will borrow on the markets at more favourable costs than many Member States and redistribute the amounts.\n\tA clear roadmap towards new own resources to help repay the borrowing. The Commission has committed to put forward proposals on a carbon border adjustment mechanism and on a digital levy by June 2021, with a view to their introduction at the latest by 1 January 2023. The Commission will also review the EU Emissions Trading System in spring 2021, including its possible extension to aviation and maritime. It will propose an own resource based on the Emissions Trading System by June 2021. In addition, the Commission will propose additional new own resources, which could include a Financial Transaction Tax and a financial contribution linked to the corporate sector or a new common corporate tax base. The Commission will work to make a proposal by June 2024.\n\tIn terms of EU budget protection, now, for the first time, the EU will have a specific mechanism to protect its budget against breaches of the rule of law as agreed on 5 November. At the same time, final beneficiaries of EU funding in the Member State concerned will not be negatively affected by this mechanism.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNext steps \n\nThe MFF Regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement endorsed today must now be formally adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, in line with their respective roles and procedures.\n\nIn parallel, work must continue towards a final adoption of all other elements of the package, including the sectoral legislation and the Own Resources Decision.\n\nIn the case of the Own Resources Decision, which will enable the Commission to borrow, ratification by all Member States in line with their constitutional requirements is also needed. The European Parliament, at the September plenary, has already provided its positive opinion on this piece of legislation. The adoption by the Council is the next step.\n\nIn parallel, negotiations on the annual budget for 2021 have to take place. The 21-day conciliation period, during which the European Parliament and the Council should reach an agreement, runs between 17 November and 7 December this year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Commission remains fully committed to accompany the process.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground \n\nThe Commission put forward its proposal for the EU's next long-term budget on 2 May 2018. The framework proposal was immediately followed by legislative proposals for the 37 sectoral programmes (e.g. cohesion, agriculture, Erasmus, Horizon Europe, etc). Between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the Commission worked hand in hand with the rotating Presidencies of the Council, and in close collaboration with the European Parliament, to take the negotiations forward.\n\nOn 27 May 2020, in response to the unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus, the European Commission proposed the temporary recovery instrument NextGenerationEU of \u20ac750 billion, as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027.\n\nOn 21 July 2020, EU heads of state or government reached a political agreement on the package. Since then, the European Parliament and the Council, and with the participation of the European Commission, held 11 trilateral political trilogues on the deal with the aim of fine-tuning the final parameters of the deal.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information\n\nFactsheet\u00a0\n\nMFF website\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\n","4b3d5007d5e2876ace48e2149c17f2dc830731e39f28535e488b0732cd86e788":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus: EU mobilises help for Italy, Croatia and neighbouring countries\n\nFollowing requests for assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the EU is coordinating and co-financing the delivery of aid shipments in the EU and in neighbouring countries.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020, as amended on 3 April 2020. The scheme will be managed and implemented by the State-owned Specialised Financing Company, Finnvera Plc. Under the scheme, the public support will take the form of: (i) \u00a0State guarantees on new investment and working capital loans; or (ii) subsidised investment and working capital loans with favourable interest rates. The scheme aims at providing liquidity to companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak, thus enabling them to continue their activities, start investments and maintain employment. The Commission concluded that the measures are necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201cThe \u20ac2 billion scheme will enable Finland to grant loans at favourable terms and to provide public guarantees on loans to companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak. It will help businesses cover their immediate investment and working capital needs, and support them to continue their activities and maintain employment during and after the crisis. We continue to work closely with all Member States to ensure that national support measures can be put in place in a timely, coordinated and effective way, in line with EU rules.\u201d The full press release is available online.

As part of the Team Europe global package, these funds contribute to the recovery from the pandemic and also support the transition towards democracy and medium-term development objectives.\n\nCommissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen, said: \"With this budget support, the EU is contributing to mitigate the most urgent budgetary needs of The Gambian Government in the context of the pandemic. As The Gambia's key partner, the European Union encourages the Government to strengthen democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and to take the lead in building the necessary national consensus around the future direction of the democratic transition, with a new Constitution at its core.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic constitutes an unprecedented global health and economic crisis with detrimental and long-lasting socio-economic impacts. This budget support serves to support The Gambia in tackling its economic and fiscal impact, including loss of government revenue, unforeseen additional expenses and the consequences of global disruptions to supply chains. This will contribute to The Gambia's ongoing efforts to strengthen the democratic transition initiated in 2017.\n\nChannelled to the National Treasury of The Gambia, the EU funds will be used in accordance with The Gambia's own Public Financial Management systems and policy priorities. By providing fiscal space to address the pandemic and to continue financing basic public services such as healthcare and education, these funds will support The Gambia's resilience to the crisis.\n\nThis funding also directly supports the long-term efforts to achieve debt sustainability. In addition, the EU will provide technical assistance and capacity building in areas such as public financial management and statistical development.\n\nBackground\n\nSince the democratic transition, the EU has provided to The Gambia \u20ac365 million in development funds during the period 2016-2020 and \u20ac38.95 million from the EU Emergency Trust Fund from 2015 to 2019.\n\nThe EU is committed to assist in strengthening the democratic and economic governance in The Gambia as well as its resilience capacity.

In these sombre times for so many European workers and companies, I am proud that the Commission is helping to bring hope and support.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground \n\nOn 10 November, the European Commission issued social bonds for the second time under the EU SURE instrument, for a total value of \u20ac14 billion. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac8 billion due for repayment in November 2025 and \u20ac6 billion due for repayment in November 2050. The issuance has received an overwhelming response in the capital markets and the bonds were 13 and 11.5 times oversubscribed, respectively for the 5- and 30-year tranche, resulting in favourable pricing terms for both bonds. The terms on which the Commission borrows are passed on directly to the beneficiary Member States.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor more information\n\nSURE Regulation\n\nFactsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs\n\nQuestions and answers: Commission proposes SURE\n\nCoronavirus response\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\n","5516912597ec83b57d6bb89793ebcbabbfac55c10c61b78fd3ba6d0ae0808161":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a request for assistance from Czechia, the EU is immediately sending a first batch of 30 ventilators from rescEU - the common European reserve of medical equipment set up earlier this year to help countries affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPresident von der Leyen said: \u201cCzechia is facing one of the most difficult situations in Europe right now. The number of coronavirus cases is rising rapidly. And it needs medical equipment to treat patients in hospitals. We do not leave our European friends alone in these hard times. The European Commission is mobilising medical material through our Civil Protection Mechanism. I just called the Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 to tell him that we are dispatching rapidly to Czechia a set of 30 ventilators from our RescEU reserve. We created this reserve in record time in spring, to stockpile essential medical material that we can send to European countries in need. And we are in touch with other EU countries, to mobilise more ventilators for the Czech Republic. We are in this together.\u201d\n\n\u201dWe have been working around the clock to avoid a repetition of the situation experienced at the end of February, when whole EU was overwhelmed in the fight against the pandemic. We created the rescEU medical reserve so no Member State is left alone when dealing with the same challenge. After already delivering protective face masks across Europe, this will be the first time the European Commission is dispatching ventilators from the EU level reserve,\u201d said Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d.\n\nThe EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre is in constant contact with authorities in Czech and more EU assistance can be channelled in the coming days via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, coming from Member States. In order to give Member States time to assess their response capacity and taking into account the gravity of the situation in the Czech Republic, the EU has proactively initiated the rescEU deployment of medical reserve.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThe rescEU capacity can include different types of medical equipment, such as protective masks or medical ventilators used in intensive care, and is constantly replenished. The reserve is hosted by several Member States who are responsible for procuring the equipment. The European Commission finances 100% of the assets, including storage and transport. Currently 6 EU countries host rescEU: Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Sweden and Romania.\n\nThe strategic medical capacity is part of the wider rescEU reserve, including other capacities such as aerial firefighting means and medical evacuation capacities. The rescEU reserve constitutes the last resort layer of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which can be activated for all type of natural and man-made hazards. EU Member States, the UK (during the transition period), Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey participate in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nThe Emergency Response Coordination Centre then manages the distribution of the equipment to ensure it goes where it is needed most, based on the needs expressed by countries requesting EU assistance under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nEarlier on in the outbreak, via the Civil Protection Mechanism, the Commission mobilised European Medical Teams for Italy composed of nurses and doctors, helped dispatch disinfectants, masks and ventilators across Europe, as well as repatriating more than 80,000 EU citizens on EU funded flights.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor more information\n\nRescEU\n\nEuropean Civil Protection Mechanism\n\n","553b36ae9ccede45b5394f0c0d5e95ebc5823e9efc1d7ab01b112e4efd14eb41":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU Humanitarian Air Bridge is operating three flights to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), carrying on board humanitarian workers and essential supplies to help the country tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA first flight to DRC is leaving today with Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, European Commissioner for Crisis Management on board, together with Philippe Goffin, Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs and of Defense, and Jean-Yves Le Drian, French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs. In Kinshasa, they will meet the President of the DRC, H.E. F\u00e9lix Tshisekedias well as humanitarian organisations and civil society in the capital and in Goma.\n\nCommissioner Lenar\u010di\u010d said: \u201cThese new EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights to the DRC bring emergency aid to help those most in need. Defeating coronavirus in the long term means working together, in particular with African nations who are our key partners. We are delivering 40 tons of humanitarian cargo in total on board the three flights to the DRC. It is in our common interest to work in solidarity.\u201d \n\nCommissioner Lenar\u010di\u010d also stated that, in 2020, the EU is supporting the most vulnerable in the DRC with a total of \u20ac40.83 million in humanitarian funding.\n\nThe cargo of the three EU humanitarian air bridge flights to the DRC includes:\n\n\twater purifiers, nutrition support, and general medical supplies;\n\tother supplies, such as laboratory equipment, masks, gloves and personal protective equipment are also intended to support the coronavirus response in the DRC, complementing efforts by the DRC Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO), and in line with the country's COVID-19 Response Plan.\n\n\nThe flights are fully EU funded, and are part of a joint effort between the European Union, Belgium, France, and humanitarian aid organisations, and in cooperation with the DRC authorities.\n\nSince the beginning of May, the EU has organised four other Humanitarian Air Bridge flights - three to the Central African Republic and one to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe. Other flights are in the pipeline, including further flights to Africa, but also to other regions with high humanitarian needs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nTeam Europe support \n\nThe EU Humanitarian Air Bridge operations form part of the EU's global response to the coronavirus pandemic within the Team Europe approach. Team Europe's support to the whole African continent in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic amounts to \u20ac3.25 billion, reaffirming the EU's leading partner to African countries. This funding is helping countries strengthen their health system, support their economies in these challenging times, train health staff and reinforce social support systems.\n\nEU humanitarian and development aid support in the DRC\n\nHumanitarian needs in the DRC are among the highest in the world. While battling the coronavirus pandemic, the country continues to grapple with Ebola (the 11th Ebola virus disease outbreak declared on 01 June 2020, just as the 10th one was dwindling), a measles outbreak, and cholera. The EU's 2020 humanitarian funding in the DRC includes recently announced EU humanitarian assistance in reaction to the coronavirus pandemic: \u20ac4.5 million is allocated to coronavirus infection prevention and control measures, and access to quality health care, water, sanitation and hygiene. An additional \u20ac2.78 million has been channeled to the World Health Organization (WHO) to support early detection and response, and expertise on the ground.\n\nThrough its development aid, the EU is also, among other sectors, supporting the health care system in the DRC through a multi-year programme (2014-2020) with an overall budget of \u20ac222 million. It aims at improving both the accessibility and quality of health services through support to health centres and hospitals, to local health supervision authorities, and the medicines supply system.\n\nFor more information \n\nFactsheets:\n\nEU Humanitarian Air Bridge\n\nEU humanitarian aid in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nEU response to the Ebola epidemic in the DRC\n\n","56e3ad6b9b304e58e953b3411c0a7ee0ee96964e25b4963e0e203ff17829c824":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the EU's global coronavirus response, an EU Humanitarian Air Bridge operation consisting of two flights to Venezuela has concluded after delivering a total of 82.5 tonnes of life-saving material to supply humanitarian partners in the field. The first flight departed on 19 August from Madrid, Spain to Caracas, Venezuela, while the second flight followed on 21 August.\n\nThese EU-funded flights are part of the ongoing Humanitarian Air Bridge operations to critical areas of the world.\n\n\u201cThe EU continues to stand by the people in need in Venezuela, especially in the current worldwide health crisis. Tackling the pandemic globally is in the interest of all. The EU Humanitarian Air Bridge flights deliver medical equipment and other essential supplies to protect healthcare and frontline humanitarian aid workers. To ensure aid continues to reach those most in need, it is imperative that humanitarian workers have full and safe access to do their essential job of saving lives,\u201d said Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management.\u00a0\n\nIn a \u00b4Team Europe\u00b4 effort, the EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to Venezuela has been operated jointly by the EU, Spain and Portugal and coordinated with the competent Venezuelan authorities. The flights are entirely funded by the EU, whereas the cargo is made available by the humanitarian organisations using the flight, coordinated by the R\u00e9seau Logistique Humanitaire \u2013 a European humanitarian organisations' network.\n\nThe 82.5 tonnes of cargo consist mostly of life-saving medical equipment such as personal protection gear, medicines, as well as water purification equipment and family hygiene kits. The equipment will be used in health facilities and some items will also be directly distributed to the most affected families. More than 500.000 Venezuelans will benefit from this aid, including children, women, and health professionals.\n\nBackground\n\nBefore the Coronavirus pandemic reached Venezuela in March 2020, the country was already suffering the humanitarian impact of the ongoing political, economic and social crisis. In 2018, inflation in Venezuela exceeded one million percent. This multifaceted crisis has affected the country's healthcare system and caused a lack of basic medication as well as the migration of around one third of its professional medical staff. The result is a growing number of people lacking regular health services and treatment for chronic illnesses and emergency medical care. More than five million Venezuelans (about 10 percent of the population) have left the country since 2015.\n\nEU humanitarian aid in Venezuela\n\nSince 2018, the European Union has allocated EUR 154 million in emergency humanitarian aid, to assist Venezuelans in need inside the country, and those hosted in neighbouring countries.\n\nThe aid focuses on addressing the most pressing needs of the affected population, targeting the most vulnerable groups such as, children under five years of age, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, the elderly, school children and indigenous groups.\n\nProjects focus on delivering vital healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene, education in emergencies, protection of the most vulnerable population groups, and nutritional and food support. Assistance is also provided to support humanitarian coordination and to improve local capacities for emergency response.\n\nFor More Information\n\nFactsheet: EU Humanitarian Air Bridge\n\nFactsheet: Venezuela\n\n\u00a0\n\n","56e6716c53a76c3c827390a00fccd0f62ecf5b83cfb66794f51e51419b0635f2":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is putting healthcare systems across the EU under unprecedented and increasing pressure. To support and encourage cross-border healthcare cooperation between national, regional and local authorities, the Commission has today issued\u00a0practical guidance to Member States. Cooperation across borders can help ease the pressure on overburdened hospitals by transferring patients suffering from coronavirus for treatment in Member States where hospital places are available. The Commission will also support Member States or non-governmental organisations to send qualified teams of medical personnel to offer assistance across borders.\n\nVice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \u201cEU unity and solidarity are vital in the fight against Coronavirus. Cooperating across borders can make the difference in saving lives by alleviating overstretched health care capacities in Member States. Faced with the greatest crisis in generations, we will leave no stone unturned in our collective response.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Stella Kyriakides, responsible for Health and Food Safety said: \u201cWe can only overcome the coronavirus crisis together. Life-saving cooperation between Member States is key. EU solidarity has been tangible over the past weeks with Member States treating patients from their neighbours, even when stretched themselves. This is the EU at its best, and with our guidance today, we want to encourage more cross-border treatment of patients, more deployment of healthcare staff from EU countries with extra capacity, to where it is needed most. Solidarity saves lives.\u201d\n\nToday's guidelines set out a more coordinated approach to cross-border cooperation on emergency healthcare. The guidelines also outline additional support and assistance to be provided by the Commission to Member States health authorities, in particular by:\n\n\tCoordinating requests for cross-border healthcare assistance through the Health Security Committee, chaired by the Commission, and the EU Early Warning and Response System. Such requests could cover for instance intensive care places, treatment and transfer of patients or qualified teams of medical personnel. The Commission will closely monitor these requests and the assistance available in the Member States.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tSupporting health authorities requesting assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The Mechanism allows the Commission to coordinate and co-fund the emergency cross border transport of patients and qualified teams of medical personnel.\n\tSetting out arrangements for patient mobility across borders and clarifying the steps to be taken for the reimbursement of healthcare costs of cross-border treatment in compliance with the Social Security Coordination Regulations.\n\tEncouraging the deployment of qualified teams of medical personnel across borders. The Commission also encourages local, regional and national health authorities to use existing bi-lateral and regional agreements and clarify the mutual recognition of professional medical qualifications.\n\tOperating a Clinical Management Support System to support healthcare professionals to share knowledge and expertise. The system provides a Web conferencing platform that allow clinicians to exchange knowledge, discuss, and share clinical cases across the EU.*\n\n\nIn addition, regarding financial assistance for cross-border healthcare cooperation, the Commission has also extended the Solidarity Fund to cover public health emergencies. Moreover, health expenditure is eligible under the Structural Funds and further flexibility to shift funds was already provided as part of the co-ordinated economic response to the coronavirus outbreak. Finally, additional support will be available through the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) presented yesterday.\n\nMore Information\n\nDedicated Commission webpage on the EU's response to the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\u00a0* Clinicians and healthcare professionals interested in receiving more information and for joining the system can contact\u00a0SANTE-COVID-CLINICIANS-NETWORK@ec.europa.eu\n\n","59c2bc5de8d0b11ace6f5067e9a1e9f434177385f441521d8c631064a377a348":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission has proposed to make \u20ac75 million from the EU budget available to help Member States repatriate EU nationals and to increase the budget of the RescEU medical stockpile.\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of the EU budget, said: \u201cToday's measure is yet another illustration of how the EU budget can add value when and where needed the most. It is also an illustration of European solidarity and cooperation at its best.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, said: \u201cThe safe return of our citizens is a priority. We are doing all we can to ensure they are reunited with their families as soon as possible during these difficult times. I would like to thank Member States for their efforts during this process. Our Emergency Response Coordination Centre continues working 24\/7 with Member States in order to meet their requests.\u201d\n\nRepatriation flights\n\nThanks to repatriation flights organised through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism and co-financed by the EU, 2,312 people have been already repatriated to Europe from China, Japan, the U.S., Morocco, Tunisia, Georgia, the Philippines and Cabo Verde since the beginning of the outbreak. More than 80 further repatriation flights are planned in the coming days.\n\nUnder the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, the EU contributes to the costs of repatriation flights that carry nationals of more than one Member State, based on a principle of solidarity.\n\nRescEU stockpile\n\nThis European Commission proposal will increase the total budget of the first ever rescEU stockpile of medical equipment (ventilators, protective masks and essential medical gear) to \u20ac80 million.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Commission is putting forward a draft amending budget \u2013 a proposal to reorganise part of the EU spending for the year in line with the latest priorities \u2013 to secure funding for these operations.\n\nThe draft amending budget also foresees:\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20ac350 million of migration management assistance to Greece, to add to the extra \u20ac350 million emergency assistance already being deployed, in line with the commitment of President von der Leyen during her visit to Greece;\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20ac3.6\u00a0million for the the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to enhance the capacity to identify, assess and communicate threats to human health from communicable diseases, and in particular to increase the expert capacity in the light of the coronavirus crisis;\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20ac100 million to help Albania recover from the devastating earthquake on 26 November 2019, part of the \u20ac115 million Commission pledge and thetotal pledge of \u20ac1.15 billion;\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20ac3.3\u00a0million additional funding for the European Public Prosecutors' Office (EPPO) to boost its 2020 budget.

The contract will allow the purchase of a vaccine against COVID-19 for all the Member States of the EU as well as the donation to lower and middle income countries or the re-direction to other European countries.\n\nThrough the contract, all Member States will be able to purchase 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option for further 100 million doses, to be distributed on a population-based pro-rata basis.\n\nThe Commission continues discussing similar agreements with other vaccine manufacturers and has concluded successful exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK on 31 July, Johnson & Johnson on 13 August, CureVac on 18 August and Moderna on 24 August.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \u201cThe Commission is working non-stop to provide EU citizens with a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 as quickly as possible. The entry into force of the contract with AstraZeneca is an important step forward in this respect. I am looking forward to enriching our portfolio of potential vaccines thanks to contracts with other pharmaceutical companies and engaging with international partners for universal and equitable access to vaccination.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cOur negotiations have now delivered clear results: a first contract signed delivering on our commitment to ensure a diversified vaccine portfolio to protect the public health of our citizens. Today's signature - made possible by the important groundwork\u00a0 undertaken by France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands - will ensure that doses of a vaccine which, if proven effective and safe, will be delivered across Member States. We expect to announce additional agreements with other vaccine manufacturers very swiftly. \u201c\n\nAstraZeneca and the University of Oxford joined forces to develop and distribute the University's potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection.\n\nAstraZeneca's vaccine candidate is already in large-scale Phase II\/III Clinical Trials after promising results in Phase I\/II concerning safety and immunogenicity.\n\nToday's contract is based on the Advanced Purchase Agreement approved on 14 August with AstraZeneca, which will be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument. The \u201cInclusive Vaccine Alliance\u201d countries (Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands) who started negotiations with AstraZeneca asked the Commission to take over through an agreement signed on behalf of all Member States.\n\nThe decision to support the vaccine proposed by AstraZeneca is based on a sound scientific approach and the technology used (a non-replicative recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccine ChAdOx1), speed at delivery at scale, cost, risk sharing, liability and the production capacity able to supply the whole of the EU, among others.\n\nThe regulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will use existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19, while maintaining the standards for vaccine quality, safety and efficacy.\n\nThe necessary safety requirements and specific assessment by the European Medicines Agency as part of the EU market authorisation procedure guarantee that citizens' rights will remain fully protected.\n\nIn order to compensate for such high risks taken by manufacturers, the Advanced Purchase Agreements provide for Member States to indemnify the manufacturer for liabilities incurred under certain conditions. Liability still remains with the companies.\n\nBackground\n\nToday's contract with AstraZeneca is an important step in the implementation of the European Vaccines Strategy, adopted by the Commission on 17 June 2020.\u00a0 This strategy aims to secure for all European citizens high-quality, safe, effective and affordable vaccines within 12 to 18 months.\n\nTo do so, and together with the Member States, the Commission is agreeing Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers reserving or giving the Member States the right to buy a given number of vaccine doses for a certain price, as and when a vaccine becomes available.\n\nAdvanced Purchase Agreements are financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\n\nMore Information:\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nCommissioner Kyriakides signs the agreement\n\n\u00a0\n\n","64c375b6e11c9272869f1f490a679a57d95c1d287436af81efcdd4378229af93":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Commission registered \u20ac7.4 billion, equivalent to $8 billion, in pledges from donors worldwide during the Coronavirus Global Response pledging event. This includes a pledge of \u20ac1.4 billion by the Commission. This almost reaches the initial target of \u20ac7.5 billion and is a solid starting point for the worldwide pledging marathon, which begins today. The aim is to gather significant funding to ensure the collaborative development and universal deployment of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cToday the world showed extraordinary unity for the common good. Governments and global health organisations joined forces against coronavirus. With such commitment, we are on track for developing, producing and deploying a vaccine for all. However, this is only the beginning. We need to sustain the effort and to stand ready to contribute more. The pledging marathon will continue. After governments, civil society and people worldwide need to join in, in a global mobilisation of hope and resolve.\u201d\n\nThe pledging event was co-convened by the European Union, Canada, France, Germany, Italy (also incoming G20 presidency), Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (also holding the G20 presidency), Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. The initiative is a response to the call from the World Health Organization (WHO) and a group of health actors for a global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global access to new coronavirus essential health technologies. The Coronavirus Global Response Initiative is comprised of three partnerships for testing, treating and preventing underpinned by health systems strengthening.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAn ongoing pledging marathon\n\nToday is an extraordinary achievement but also the start of a process to mobilise more resources. The initial target of \u20ac7.5 billion will not be enough to ensure the distribution of coronavirus health technologies worldwide, as this involves significant costs in terms of production, procurement and distribution.\n\nTo help reach the objectives of the Coronavirus Global Response, the European Commission is committing \u20ac1 billion in grants and \u20ac400 million in guarantees on loans through reprioritisation of Horizon 2020 (\u20ac1 billion), RescEU (\u20ac80 million), the Emergency Support Instrument (\u20ac150 million) and\u00a0external instruments (\u20ac170 million).\n\n\u20ac100 million will be donated to CEPI and \u20ac158 million to the World Health Organization. EU-funded calls for proposals and subsequent projects under Horizon 2020 will be aligned with the objectives of the three partnerships and subject to open access to data. Funding under RescEU will go towards the procurement, stockpiling and distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\n\nDonors are invited to continue pledging to the Coronavirus Global Response. They can choose which priority to donate to \u2013 Test, Treat or Prevent. They can also donate to the horizontal work stream of the Coronavirus Global Response, aiming to help health systems in the world cope with the pandemic.\n\nThe Commission will soon announce the breakdown of the amount raised today and how much will go to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and health systems strengthening related to COVID-19.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA cooperation framework to align global efforts\n\nA universal and affordable Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT-Accelerator) was the main objective of the 24 April call to action from global health partners. For this, significant funding is needed, as well as a solid collaborative structure, with a clarity of purpose to ensure that the donated money is put to good use and to avoid fragmentation of efforts.\n\nBased on discussions with public and private sector partners as well as non-profit organisations, the European Commission proposes a collaborative framework for the ACT-accelerator global response. This framework is designed as a coordination structure to steer and oversee progress made globally in accelerating work on developing vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics with universal access as well as strengthening health systems as required for meeting these three priorities.\n\nThis collaboration framework is intended to be time-bound (2 years, renewable) and build on existing organisations without creating any new structures. In the European Commission's view, it would bring together partners like the WHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and some of the initial convenor countries\u00a0 as well as many recognised global health actors such as CEPI, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund or UNITAID.\n\nThe core of the framework would be three partnerships based on the three priorities of the Coronavirus Global Response. They gather industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations, with a \u201cwhole-value-chain\u201d approach: from research to manufacturing and deployment. The three partnerships would work as autonomously as possible, with a transversal work stream on enhancing the capacity of health systems and knowledge and data sharing.\n\nThe Commission registers and keeps track of pledges up until end of May but will not receive any payments into its accounts. Funds go directly to the recipients. Recipients will, however, not decide alone on the use of the donation, but deploy it in concertation with the partnership.The commitment is for all new vaccines, diagnostics and treatments against coronavirus to be made available globally for an affordable price, regardless of where they were developed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNext steps\n\nThe global response must also include civil society, and the global community of citizens. For that reason, the European Commission is joining forces with NGOs such as Global Citizen and other partners.\n\nThe Global Vaccines Summit that Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will organise on 4 June will mobilise additional funding to protect the next generation with vaccines. As the world relies on Gavi's work for making vaccination available everywhere, the success of Gavi's replenishment will be crucial to the success of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nThe Coronavirus Global Response builds on the commitment made by G20 leaders on 26 March.\n\nGrounded in a vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of the coronavirus, an initial group of global health actors launched a call to action for global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global access to new coronavirus essential health technologies.\n\nOn 24 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) and an initial group of health actors launched a collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global Access to COVID-19 Tools \u2013 the ACT Accelerator. Together, they issued a call to action.\n\nThe European Commission responded to this call by joining forces with global partners to host a pledging event \u2013 the Coronavirus Global Response Initiative \u2013 as of 4 May 2020.\n\nFunding, including the EU contribution, pledged since 30 January 2020 \u2013 the date when the WHO declared coronavirus a global health emergency \u2013 will be counted as part of the Coronavirus Global Response funding target with the commitment that these will contribute to and align with the ACT-Accelerator framework.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor More Information\n\nCoronavirus Global Response website\n\nQuestions and Answers: the Coronavirus Global Response\n\nFactsheet \u2013 The Coronavirus Global Response\n\nThe Commission's Coronavirus Response\n\n","652fa5efba4ef327d869bde717851d3b604c92b5ae5f6929d4e3c2311f7d8c65":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has reached an agreement with BioNTech-Pfizer for the supply of four million more doses of COVID-19 vaccines for Member States in the next two weeks in order to tackle coronavirus hotspots and to facilitate free border movement.\n\nThe President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cTo tackle aggressive variants of the virus and to improve the situation in hotspots, quick and decisive action is necessary. I'm happy to announce today an agreement with BioNTech-Pfizer, who will offer to Member States to make available a total of four million doses of vaccines before the end of March which will be supplied in addition to the planned dose deliveries. This will help Member States in their efforts to keep the spread of new variants under control. Through their targeted use where they are most needed, in particular in border regions, these doses will also help ensure or restore free movement of goods and people. These are key for the functioning of health systems and the Single Market.\u201d \n\nThe Commission is following closely the evolution of the epidemiological situation in Member States. Despite the current reduction in the number of deaths across the EU, due to vaccination of the elderly and most vulnerable people, the Commission is concerned by the development of a series of COVID-19 hotspots across the EU. This is caused, in particular, by the spread of new variants, which are more contagious. The BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine has proven highly effective against all currently known variants of the COVID-19 virus. Regions like Tyrol in Austria, Nice and Moselle in France, Bolzano in Italy and some parts of Bavaria and Saxony in Germany but also in many other Member States have seen numbers of infections and hospitalisations rise steeply over the past weeks, leading Member States to adopt stringent measures and even in certain cases to impose new border controls.\n\nIn order to support Member States in their efforts to respond to these developments, the Commission has negotiated with BioNTech-Pfizer the possibility for Member States to order supplementary vaccines doses. The increase of dose deliveries in March is a result of the successful expansion of manufacturing capacities in Europe which was completed by mid-February.\n\nFour million doses in total will be made available for purchase to Member States, pro-rata to their population. All of these doses will be delivered before the end of March. These doses come on top of the schedule of deliveries currently agreed between Member States and BioNTech-Pfizer.\n\n","6da0d6e4330274702be73b3f6a6607926187e88019d2aa518fa98bb652dd6ded":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission has today extended until end of June the transparency and authorisation mechanism for COVID-19 vaccine exports. This follows persistent delays in some of the deliveries of vaccines to the EU.\n\nExecutive Vice-President and Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said: \u201cThe first weeks of the application of this instrument have shown that the trade disruption feared by many did not take place. Since the measure was introduced, shipments were authorised to more than 30 countries. This confirms that even during a very critical health situation, the EU has made a considerable effort to be a reliable and responsible trading partner.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides said: \u201cWe expect companies with which we have signed a contract to fulfil their obligations towards EU citizens. The EU exports very significant volumes of COVID-19 vaccines, true to our commitment to global solidarity. Yet, not all companies are honouring their agreements with the EU despite having received a down payment to enable sufficient production. We will insist that compliance is ensured and we will continue to work with companies to ramp up production in Europe as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nEU number one supplier of COVID-19 vaccines to the world\n\nThe EU continues to be the leading provider of vaccines around the world. Six weeks into the existence of this mechanism, 249 export requests to 31 different countries* have been granted for a total of 34,090,267 doses, as they did not threaten the contractual engagements between the EU and the vaccine producers. Only one export request was not granted. The main export destinations include the United Kingdom (with approximately 9.1 million doses), Canada (3.9 million), Mexico (3.1 million), Japan (2.7 million), Saudi Arabia (1.4 million), Hong Kong (1.3 million), Singapore (1 million), United States (1 million), Chile (0.9 million) and Malaysia (0.8 million).\n\nThe export authorisation mechanism\n\nThis export authorisation mechanism only applies to exports from companies with which the EU has concluded Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs). These APAs commit the vaccine producers to deliver to EU Member States a pre-agreed number of vaccines. The mechanism provides for authorisations of exports of COVID-19 vaccines outside the EU.\n\nInitially put in place on 30 January 2021, and with a timeframe lasting until the 12 of March 2021, the new regulation extends the duration of this mechanism until the end of June 2021. The new regulation also simplifies the procedure by allowing the grouping of exports to different final recipients in the same country in one single request. It also provides clarity by identifying the customs codes for the active substances covered by the measure.\n\nThis measure is targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary. It is fully consistent with the EU's international commitments under the World Trade Organization and the G20, and is in line with what the EU has proposed in the context of the WTO Trade and Health Initiative. Committed to international solidarity, the EU excluded from this mechanism vaccine supplies for humanitarian aid or those supplies destined to countries under the COVAX Facility, as well as shipments to our neighbourhood.**\n\nAbout the EU's vaccine strategy\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs). Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that are actually purchased by Member States. The APA is therefore a de-risk investment upfront against a binding commitment from the company to pre-produce, even before it gets marketing authorisation. This should allow for a quick and steady delivery as soon as the authorisation has been granted.\n\nThe Commission has so far signed APAs with six companies (AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, BioNtech-Pfizer, CureVac, and Moderna), securing access to up to 2.6 billion doses. Negotiations are advanced with two additional companies. The four contracts with the companies whose vaccines have been granted conditional marketing authorisation amount to more than 1.6 billion doses.\n\nFor More Information\n\nFactsheet\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nCommission Implementing Regulation and Annex\n\nPress release for the initial adoption of the mechanism\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, Macao, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States and Uruguay.\n\n**Countries excluded from the measure: countries and economies close to the EU, such as the EFTA countries or the Western Balkans, which are engaged in a process of deep integration with the Union, but also countries and territories that depend on the EU for supplies: Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Faeroe Islands, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Norway, North Macedonia, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Vatican City, the overseas countries, territories listed in Annex II of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, and exports to B\u00fcsingen, Heligoland, Livigno, Ceuta and Melilla, and the 92 low and middle income countries in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment list: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Egypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Kiribati, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Micronesia, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar\/Burma, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Vietnam, West Bank and Gaza, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.***\n\n*** List updated on 12 March 2021 at 13:00.\u00a0\n\n","6e22c795d93323c3152e1abfded36d29a1f20ddf2c70c85dba746aa5c22a4ef5":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission issued a \u20ac17 billion inaugural social bond under the EU SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac10 billion due for repayment in October 2030 and \u20ac7 billion due for repayment in 2040. There was very strong investor interest in this highly rated instrument, and the bonds were more than 13 times oversubscribed, resulting in favourable pricing terms for both bonds.\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cFor the first time in history, the Commission is issuing social bonds on the market, to raise money that will help keep people in jobs. This unprecedented step matches the extraordinary times we are living in. We are sparing no efforts to safeguard livelihoods in Europe. I'm glad that countries hit badly by the crisis will receive support under SURE rapidly.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commissioner Johannes Hahn in charge of Budget and Administration said: \u201cWith this operation, the European Commission has made a first step towards entering the major league in global debt capital markets. The strong investor interest and the favourable conditions under which the bond was placed are further proof of the great interest in EU bonds. The \u201csocial bond\u201d character of the issuance has helped to attract investors who wish to help EU Member States in supporting employment through these difficult times.\u201d\n\nBoth bonds were issued on attractive terms, reflecting the high level of interest. The 10-year bond was priced at 3 basis points above mid-swaps. The 20-year bond was priced at 14 basis points over mid-swaps. The final new issue premiums have been estimated at 1 bps and 2 bps for the 10-year and 20-year tranches respectively, both values being extremely limited given the amounts printed.\n\nThese represent attractive pricing conditions for the Commission's largest ever bond issuance and a favourable debut for the SURE programme. The terms on which the Commission borrows are passed on directly to the Member States receiving the loans. (See here for more details on the pricing of the transaction).\n\nThe banks that supported the European Commission with this transaction (\u201cjoint bookrunners\u201d) were Barclays (IRL), BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Nomura and UniCredit.\n\nThe funds raised will be transferred to the beneficiary Member States in the form of loans to help them cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes and similar measures as a response to the pandemic.\n\nIn that context, the Commission announced earlier this month that it would issue the entire EU SURE bond of up to \u20ac100 billion as social bonds, and adopted an independently evaluated Social Bond Framework.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackground on SURE\n\nSo far, 17 Member States will receive financial support under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. Financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States.\n\nThese loans will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the pandemic, in particular for the self-employed. SURE could also finance some health-related measures, in particular at the work place, used to ensure a safe return to normal economic activity.\n\nMember States can still submit formal requests for support under SURE, which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion to help protect jobs and workers affected by the pandemic. The Commission has already proposed a total of \u20ac87.8 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States.\n\nBackground on the EU borrowing\n\n\tThe EU was established by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and is 0% risk weighed as an issuer (Basel III). The EU's borrowings are direct and unconditional obligations of the EU, guaranteed by the EU Member States through the EU budget. The European Commission is empowered by the EU Treaty to borrow on the international capital markets, on behalf of the European Union.\n\tThe EU borrows exclusively in Euros for on-lending in Euros to sovereign borrowers. The EU currently operates four loan programmes: The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (\"EFSM\"), the Balance of Payments facility (\"BoP\"), the Macro-Financial Assistance (\"MFA\") and the Support to mitigate Unemployment Risk in an Emergency (SURE), recently adopted by the Council on 19 May 2020.\n\tThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE will benefit from a social bond label.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFurther details on the issuance:\n\n\tAhead of the transaction, the EU sent a Request for Proposal (RfP) to 20 banks on 9 October 2020 informing them of its intention to raise significant amounts in the market.\n\tThe formal mandate for a dual tranche issue was announced on Monday, 19 October at 13:25 CET.\n\tBooks were opened on Tuesday, 20 October 2020 in the morning at 08:55 CET and closed at 10:00 CET.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor more information\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nTechnical press release\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n","6e27c2f42f05a619236d9c25a93511c74a8049264b167502935fa2c96dc69bd8":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak is having a major impact on the international and European aviation industry. The situation is deteriorating on a daily basis. Traffic is expected to decline further in the coming weeks.\n\nIn order to help ease the impact of the outbreak, the European Commission will put forward targeted legislation to temporarily alleviate airlines from their airport slot usage obligations under EU law.\n\nThis measure will help both the European industry and the environment. It releases pressure on the whole aviation industry and in particular on smaller airlines. It also decreases emissions by avoiding so-called \u2018ghost flights' where airlines fly almost empty aircraft to keep their slots.\n\nCommissioner for Transport Adina V\u0103lean said: \u201cThe temporary measure will allow airlines to adjust their capacity in view of the falling demand caused by the outbreak. Without such a measure, airlines would have to continue to operate flights, even if largely empty, to guarantee their current slots at EU airports, with a negative impact \u2013 both economic and environmental. Given the urgency, the Commission will in due course present a legislative proposal and calls on the European Parliament and the Council to swiftly adopt this measure in co-decision procedure.\u201d\n\nNext steps:\u00a0The Commission will shortly adopt a proposal to amend the EU Slot Regulation. This amendment will then need to be approved by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.\n\nBackground:\u00a0An airport slot is the right of an aircraft to take off or land at a congested airport at a certain time of day. Under the EU Airport Slots Regulation (EEC 95\/93), airlines are subject to a \u2018use it or lose it' rule, and are required to operate 80% of their allocated slots, or face losing their right to the slot in future seasons.\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n","6f7b5c48577b676dfe245c235f95d908de88065835d3af3502227eb167af578c":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday the Commission recommends to Schengen Member States and Schengen Associated States to lift internal border controls by 15 June 2020 and to prolong the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU until 30 June 2020; and sets out an approach to progressively lifting the restriction afterwards.\n\nGiven that the health situation in certain third countries remains critical, the Commission does not propose a general lifting of the travel restriction at this stage. The restriction should be lifted for countries selected together by Member States, based on a set of principles and objective criteria including the health situation, the ability to apply containment measures during travel, and reciprocity considerations, taking into account data from relevant sources such as ECDC and WHO.\n\nFor countries towards which the restriction remains in place, the Commission proposes to enlarge the categories of permitted travellers to include, for instance, international students. The Commission is also issuing guidance to Member States to ensure that the resumption of visa operations abroad is well coordinated with the gradual lifting of the travel restrictions.\n\nCommissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson,said: \u201cFollowing the lifting of all internal border checks inside the Union, we are proposing a clear and flexible approach towards removing restrictions on travel to the EU starting on 1 July. International travel is key for tourism and business, and for family and friends reconnecting. While we will all have to remain careful, the time has come to make concrete preparations for lifting restrictions with countries whose health situation is similar to the EU's and for resuming visa operations.\u201d \n\nGradually removing restrictions on travel to the EU\n\nActions at the EU's external borders must be coordinated and uniform to be effective. As travellers entering the EU can move freely from one country to another, it is crucial that Member States coordinate their decisions on lifting travel restrictions. This is why Member States should agree on a common list of non-EU countries for which travel restrictions can be lifted as of 1 July, to be reviewed on a regular basis. To this end, the Commission proposes:\n\n\tObjective criteria: The decision to lift restrictions for a specific country should be based on the epidemiological situation and coronavirus response in that country, the ability to apply containment measures during travel, and whether or not that country has lifted travel restrictions towards the EU. Restrictions should be lifted first with countries whose epidemiological situation is similar to the EU average and where sufficient capabilities to deal with the virus are in place. Restrictions should remain in place for countries whose situation is worse than in the EU. The Commission proposes a detailed checklist to help Member States reach a common assessment. Decisions on lifting travel restrictions would concern non-EU nationals residing in a specific country (not its nationals).\n\tCommon and coordinated approach: The Commission proposes a coordination mechanism whereby it would support Member States and Schengen Associated States at technical level and facilitate the preparation of a list of countries for which travel restrictions could be lifted. Decisions on lifting restrictions should then be prepared with Member States under the EU's integrated political crisis response mechanism. Member States should adopt such decisions in a coordinated manner and ensure uniform application across the EU. This will be a dynamic process and the integrated political crisis response mechanism would need to coordinate further updates.\n\tFlexibility: It will be possible to reintroduce travel restrictions for a specific country if the criteria are no longer met. In addition, Member States can still refuse entry to a non-EU traveller presenting a threat to public health, even coming from a country for which restrictions were lifted.\n\n\nIn line with the proposed checklist, the Commission also recommends to lift travel restrictions for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia as of 1 July, given that their epidemiological situation is similar or better than that of the EU. This also follows on the Commission's readiness to closely associate the Western Balkans region with the implementation of the roadmap towards lifting containment measures.\n\nWhere the travel restrictions continue to apply, Member States should ensure that those travelling to study are exempted, together with highly skilled non-EU workers if their employment is necessary from an economic perspective and the work cannot be postponed or performed abroad. EU citizens and citizens of Schengen Associated States and non-EU nationals legally residing in the EU, as well as their family members, should also be exempt from the travel restriction regardless of whether or not they are returning home, as was the case until now.\n\nIn the roadmap on lifting containment measures presented on 15 April, the Commission indicated that travel restrictions within the EU would need to start being lifted gradually before restrictions at the external borders can be relaxed in a second stage. This is now well under way, with several Member States having already lifted restrictions within the EU and others planning to do so as of 15 June 2020. The Commission strongly encourages the remaining Member States to finalise the process of removing restrictions to free movement and lifting internal border controls within the EU by 15 June 2020.\n\nResuming visa operations\n\nMost Member States decided to suspend or reduce the processing of visa applications as part of pandemic-related measures. Travellers will need to be able to access visa services again and Member States should synchronise the resumption of visa operations with the lifting of travel restrictions. This is why today the Commission presents guidance for a phased and coordinated return of visa operations to normal.\n\nA harmonised approach is best achieved through consulates simultaneously resuming operations in each location and through full implementation of EU visa rules, together with good communication towards the public. The guidance also covers hygiene measures and precautions for receiving visa applicants.\n\nFinally, if a Member State requires health checks, these should take place at the time of travel or shortly before, rather than when applying for a visa; and should apply to all travellers from a given location irrespective of their nationality or visa status.\u00a0\n\nBackground \n\nThe Commission invited Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days, subsequently extending it twiceuntil 15 June.\n\nThe travel restriction, as well as today's invitation to prolong it until 30 June, applies to all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) \u2013 30 countries in total. All these countries implement it through national law.\n\nNationals of 105 countries are required to obtain a visa before travelling to the EU. Visa applications can usually be submitted at Member States' consulates in almost all non-EU countries around the world. The EU's visa policy for short stays is applied fully by 26 Schengen Member States and, in normal times, results in 15 million visas being issued each year.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommunication on the third assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 11 June 2020\n\nChecklist to be used for the possible lifting of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 11 June 2020\n\nGuidance for a phased and coordinated resumption of visa operations, 11 June 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission invites Member States to extend restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 June, 8 May 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission invites Member States to prolong restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 May, 8 April 2020\n\nPress release - Coronavirus: Commission presents practical guidance on implementing the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 30 March 2020\n\nCommunication on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 16 March 2020\n\n\u00a0\n\n","7048376c33c84aacd6cd6afc3b30c9d0c66daf2cf1e889437bd7a35d9dbab3be":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has disbursed \u20ac13 billion to six EU Member States in the sixth instalment of financial support under the SURE instrument. This is the third disbursement in 2021.

This is the first time that Ireland has received funding under the instrument. The other five EU countries have already benefitted from loans under SURE.\n\nThese loans will assist Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help Member States cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures that they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, including for the self-employed. Today's disbursements follow the issuance of the sixth social bond under the EU SURE instrument, which attracted a considerable interest by investors.\n\nSo far, 17 EU Member States have received a total of \u20ac75.5 billion under the SURE instrument in back-to-back loans. An overview of the amounts disbursed up to date and the different maturities of the bonds are available online here.\n\nOverall, the Commission has proposed that 19 EU countries will receive \u20ac94.3 billion in financial support under SURE. This figure includes the additional \u20ac3.7 billion proposed by the Commission today for six Member States. The full amounts per Member State are online here. Member States can still submit requests to receive financial support under SURE which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion.\n\nTo address Member States' pending requests for 2021, the Commission will seek from the market further \u20ac13-\u20ac15 billion in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nLater this year, the Commission is due to also launch the borrowing under NextGenerationEU, the recovery instrument of \u20ac750 billion to help build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe.\n\nMembers of the College said\n\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThe crisis is tough on many workers, who fear for their jobs. This is why we have created SURE, to mobilise \u20ac100 billion in loans to finance short-time work schemes across the EU. Today we are disbursing a new tranche of \u20ac13 billion under SURE, supporting workers and companies in six Member States. This helps protect jobs and enables economies to recover faster from the crisis.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cWe are well in track to help business and people coping with these hard times. We have already delivered three fourths of the money committed for the SURE programme. Additional money will follow soon the second quarter.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Paolo\u00a0Gentiloni,\u00a0Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cAs the effects of the pandemic continue to weigh on our economies, today the Commission is disbursing further significant financial support to six countries, including Ireland for the first time. This is a crucial contribution to national efforts to support workers through these difficult times. I'm proud of the European success story that is SURE.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nOn 23 March 2021, the European Commission issued the sixth social bond under the EU SURE.\n\nThe issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac8 billion due for repayment in March 2026 and \u20ac5 billion due for repayment in May 2046.\n\nThe bonds attracted a strong demand from a wide range of investors, which ensured good pricing conditions that the Commission is directly passing on to the beneficiary Member States.\n\nThe bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label.

As soon as the health situation allows, people should be able to catch up with friends and family, in their own EU country or across borders, with all the safety and precautionary measures needed in place. \n\nThe package also aims to help the EU tourism sector recover from the pandemic, by supporting businesses and ensuring that Europe continues to be the number one destination for visitors.\n\nThe Commission's Tourism and Transport package includes:\n\n\tAn overall strategy towards recovery in 2020 and beyond;\n\tA common approach to restoring free movement and lifting restrictions at EU internal borders in a gradual and coordinated way;\n\tA framework\u00a0to support the gradual re-establishment of transport whilst ensuring the safety of passengers and personnel;\n\tA recommendation\u00a0which aims to make travel vouchers an attractive alternative to cash reimbursement for consumers;\n\tCriteria for restoring tourism activities safely and gradually and for developing health protocols for hospitality establishments such as hotels.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor tourists and travellers\n\nThe Commission is looking to give people the ability, confidence and safety to travel again with the following measures:\n\n\tSafely restoring freedom of movement and lifting internal border controls: \n\n\nFree movement and cross-border travel are key to tourism. As Member States manage to reduce the circulation of the virus, blanket restrictions to free movement should be replaced by more targeted measures. If a generalised lifting of restrictions is not justified by the health situation, the Commission proposes a phased and coordinated approach that starts by lifting restrictions between areas or Member States with sufficiently similar epidemiological situations. The approach must also be flexible, including the possibility to reintroduce certain measures if the epidemiological situation requires. Member States should act on the basis of the following 3 criteria:\n\n\tepidemiological, notably focusing on areas where situation is improving, based on guidance by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and using the regional map developed by the ECDC;\n\tthe ability to apply containment measures throughout the whole journey including at border crossings, including additional safeguards and measures where physical distancing may be difficult to ensure and\n\teconomic and social considerations, initially prioritising cross-border movement in key areas of activity and including personal reasons.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe principle of non-discrimination is of particular importance: when a Member State decides to allow travel into its territory or to specific regions and areas within its territory, it should do so in a non-discriminatory manner \u2013 allowing travel from all areas, regions or countries in the EU with similar epidemiological conditions. In the same vein, any restrictions must be lifted without discrimination, to all EU citizens and to all residents of that Member State regardless of their nationality, and should be applied to all parts of the Union in a similar epidemiological situation.\n\n\tRestoring transport services across the EU while protecting the health of transport workers and passengers: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe guidelines present general principles for the safe and gradual restoration of passenger transport by air, rail, road and waterways. The guidelines put forth a series of recommendations, such as the need to limit contact between passengers and transport workers, and passengers themselves, reducing, where feasible, the density of passengers.\n\nThe guidelines also include indications on the use of personal protective equipment such as face masks and on adequate protocols in case passengers present coronavirus symptoms. The guidelines also make recommendations for each mode of transport and call for coordination among Member States in light of re-establishment of gradual connections between them.\n\n\tSafely resuming tourism services: \n\n\nThe Commission sets out a common framework providing criteria to safely and gradually restore tourism activities and developing health protocols for hotels and other forms of accommodation, to protect the health of both guests and employees. These criteria include epidemiological evidence; sufficient health system capacity being in place for local people and tourists; robust surveillance and monitoring and testing capacity and contact tracing. These guidelines will allow people to safely stay at hotels, camping sites, Bed&Breakfasts or other holiday accommodation establishments, eat and drink at restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9s and go to beaches and other leisure outdoor areas.\n\n\tEnsuring cross-border interoperability of tracing apps: \n\n\nMember States, with the support of the Commission, agreed on\u00a0guidelines to ensure cross-border interoperability between tracing apps so that citizens can be warned of a potential infection with coronavirus also when they travel in the EU. This will guide developers working with national health authorities. Such tracing apps must be voluntary, transparent, temporary, cybersecure, using anonymised data, should rely on Bluetooth technology and be inter-operable across borders as well as across operating systems. Interoperability is crucial: EU citizens must be able to receive alerts of a possible infection in a secure and protected way, wherever they are in the EU, and whatever app they are using. The Commission is supporting Member States in finding the right solution, in line with the principles set out in the EU toolboxand the Commission guidance on data protection.\n\n\tMaking vouchers a more attractive option for consumers:\n\n\nUnder EU rules, travellers have the right to choose between vouchers or cash reimbursement for cancelled transport tickets (plane, train, bus\/coach, and ferries) or package travel. While reaffirming this right, the Commission's recommendation aims to ensure that vouchers become a viable and more attractive alternative to reimbursement for cancelled trips in the context of the current pandemic, which has also put heavy financial strains on travel operators. The voluntary vouchers should be protected against insolvency of the issuer, with a minimum validity period of 12 months, and be refundable after at most one year, if not redeemed. They should also provide passengers sufficient flexibility, should allow the passengers to travel on the same route under the same service conditions or the travellers to book a package travel contract with the same type of services or of equivalent quality. They should also be transferable to another traveller.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor tourism businesses\n\nThe Commission aims to support Europe's tourism sector by:\n\n\tEnsuring liquidity for tourism businesses, in particular SMEs, through:\n\n\no\u00a0\u00a0Flexibility\u00a0under State aid rules allowing Member States to introduce schemes, such as guarantee schemes for vouchers and further liquidity schemes, to support companies in the transport and travel sectors and to ensure that reimbursement claims caused by the coronavirus pandemic are satisfied. The schemes for vouchers can be approved by the Commission very rapidly, upon notification by the Member State concerned.\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 EU funding: EU\u00a0continues providing immediate liquidity to businesses affected by the crisis through the Coronavirus Response Instrument Initiative, under shared management with Member States. In addition, the Commission has made available up to \u20ac8 billion in financing for 100,000 small businesses hit by the crisis, with the European Investment\u00a0\u00a0Fund.\n\n\tSaving jobs with up to \u20ac100 billion in financial relief from the SURE programme: \n\n\nThe SURE programme helps Member States cover the costs of national short-time work schemes and similar measures allowing companies to safeguard jobs. The Commission also supports partnerships between employment services, social partners and companies to facilitate reskilling, especially for seasonal workers.\n\n\tConnecting citizens to local tourism offer, promoting local attractions and tourism and Europe as a safe tourist destination:\n\n\nThe Commission will work with Member States to promote a patronage voucher system under which customers can support their favourite hotels or restaurants. The Commission will also promote pan-European communication campaigns featuring Europe as a number one tourist destination.\u00a0 \n\nTo complement short-term measures, the Commission will continue to work with Member States to promote sustainable tourism in line with the European Green Deal and encourage a digital transformation of tourism services to offer more choice, better allocation of resources and new ways of managing travel and tourist flows.\n\nThe Commission will organise a European tourism convention with EU institutions, the industry, regions, cities and other stakeholders to jointly build the future of a sustainable, innovative and resilient European tourism ecosystem \u2013 the \u2018European Agenda for Tourism 2050'.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nVice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \"Tourism is vital to the Single Market and its four freedoms and a key contributor to the EU's economic, social and cultural way of life. It has also been deeply impacted by the measures needed to contain COVID-19. As our Member States gradually lift restrictive measures, we are putting in place the foundations for rebooting the tourism eco-system and Single Market in a safe, proportionate way that will prevent the resurgence of the virus within the EU, whilst safeguarding our way of life.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, said: \u201cMillions of SMEs and family -run businesses working in accommodation, restaurants, passenger transport and travel agencies risk bankruptcies and job losses \u2013 they urgently need to go back to work. We are helping European tourism get back on track while staying healthy and safe. Today we propose a common European approach to managing what will remain a difficult 2020 summer season, while preparing for a more sustainable and digital tourism ecosystem in the future.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said: \u201cWe know how much European citizens are looking forward to summer and to travel. Their huge sacrifices over the past months will make a cautious and gradual reopening possible - for now. But deconfinement and tourism will not be risk free as long as the virus circulates among us. We need to maintain vigilance, physical distancing and rigorous health precautions across the whole tourism and transport ecosystem to prevent further outbreaks as much as possible. We will not allow our efforts to be lost.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Justice and Consumers, Didier Reynders, said: \u201cEuropean consumers can be reassured: The Commission will not downgrade their EU rights for reimbursement for cancelled travel. We recommend, however, making vouchers more attractive for those who chose this option. In the meantime, freedom of movement is the right European citizens cherish most. It is important to restore this right as soon as the circumstances allow it.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Transport, Adina V\u0103lean, said: \u201cWe aim to create safe conditions in every mode of transport, to the extent possible, both for people traveling and transport workers. As we re-establish connectivity, these guidelines will provide authorities and\u00a0 stakeholders a standard framework. Our priority is to restore mobility as soon as possible, but only with clear provisions for safety and health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nEurope is home to a vibrant tourism ecosystem. Travel, transport, accommodation, food, recreation or culture, contribute to almost 10% of EU GDP and provide a key source of employment and income in numerous European regions. 267 million Europeans (62% of the population) make at least one private leisure trip per year and 78% of Europeans spend their holidays in their home country or another EU country.\n\nThe tourism ecosystem has also been one of the most affected by the heavy restrictions on movement and travel imposed in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak. The World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) foresees a 60% to 80% reduction in international arrivals, amounting to losses of between \u20ac840 and \u20ac1.100 billion in export revenues worldwide. In Europe, the summer is a crucial season for tourism:during an average summer season (June-August) residents of the EU make 385 million tourism trips and spend \u20ac190 billion.\u00a0\n\nToday's package follows the pathway set by the Joint European Roadmap published by the Commission on 14 April in cooperation with the European Council. The Roadmap provided a gradual approach to phasing-out containment measures introduced due to the coronavirus outbreak. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION :\n\nQuestions & Answers on Tourism and Travel Package\n\nQuestions & Answers on Tracing Apps\n\nFactsheet: The EU helps reboot Europe's Tourism \n\nFactsheet: Travel and tourism in Europe: A practical guidance for travelers and companies\n\nCommunication on tourism and transport in 2020 and beyond \n\nCommunication on a phased and coordinated approach to free movement\n\nCommunication: Guidelines on transport and connectivity\n\nCommunication: Guidelines on tourism services and hospitality establishments\n\nRecommendation on vouchers\n\n*Updated on 13\/05\/2020 at 15:25 \u00a0\n\n","72d78db8a2d763bd09c7673886a53b9eb89916fb64eb939b4d851b9bf13bf418":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has set up an EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to transport humanitarian workers and emergency supplies for the coronavirus response to some of most critical areas around the world.\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Commissioner for Crisis Management, is travelling today to Bangui on the first flight and will meet H.E. Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra, President of the Central African Republic, as well as humanitarian organisations.\n\nCommissioner Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d said: \u201cLeaving any area of the world unprotected today leaves us all unprotected tomorrow. As part of our global response, the EU will open a dedicated Humanitarian Air Bridge to get aid into areas which lack supplies due to the difficulties of global transit. This can be a lifeline for some of the most vulnerable communities worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe first EU flight, operated in cooperation with France,is departing from Lyon and will transport around 60 humanitarian workers from various NGOs and 13 tonnes of humanitarian cargo. Two subsequent humanitarian cargo flights will follow in the coming days to transport a further 27 tonnes of humanitarian supplies in total. On their return leg, the Air Bridge flights will also bring back EU citizens and other passengers from the Central African Republic in a repatriation effort.\n\nMore EU humanitarian flights are being scheduled for the coming weeks, prioritising African countries where the pandemic has the potential to worsen many existing humanitarian crises.\n\nHow the Humanitarian Air Bridge works\n\n\tIn a joint effort between the Commission and Member States, the Commission funds air transport of Member States' flights to and from the proposed destinations, where possible combined with ongoing repatriation flights, also including humanitarian workers on rotation.\n\tHumanitarian staff from national administrations, NGOs or UN Agencies can benefit from the facility.\n\tThe Commission finances 100% of the transport costs, whereas the EU partners remain responsible for the procurement of the humanitarian material.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe Global EU response to Coronavirus follows a Team Europe approach. It draws on contributions from all EU institutions and combines the resources mobilised by EU Member States and financial institutions, to address the humanitarian, health, and other consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAs part of its long-standing solidarity with the people in need in the Central African Republic, through its humanitarian aid, the EU is also supporting 15 new projects in 2020 with a total funding of \u20ac15.2 million. This funding is going towards providing life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people. Since 2014, the Central African Republic received more than \u20ac770 million in humanitarianassistance from the EU and its Member States.\n\nIn addition to humanitarian aid, the EU has mobilised over \u20ac30 million for the coronavirus response via its different instruments, including the B\u00eakou Trust Fund. This funding will help in addressing immediate needs in the Central African Republic in the health, water and sanitation sectors as well as supporting the State budget with an early budget support payment.\n\nFor More Information \n\nEU Coronavirus response: crisis management and solidarity\n\nFactsheet: EU Humanitarian Aid in the Central African Republic\n\n","72ec8adbd87ac5a7d6b0aa0f0efce3eee0b0e2c09ef33c9b9b6a3159ce1dde77":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Director General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, launched and co-hosted the first meeting of the High Level Facilitation Council, leading the work of the global collaborative framework Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (the ACT-A) to speed up the development and deployment of vaccines, tests and treatments against COVID-19, as well as to improve health systems.\n\nThe objectives of the first Council meeting was to align the plan for ACT-Accelerator as a key global solution to end the crisis and restore health systems and global growth, concur on the economic rationale and investment case for fully financing the ACT-Accelerator, and mobilise political leadership and international support for global equitable allocation.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \u201cToday's launch of the Facilitation Council brings us closer to our global goal: access to coronavirus vaccines, tests and treatments for everyone who needs them, anywhere. The EU will use all its convening power to help keep the world united against coronavirus. With the chairmanship of Norway and South Africa representing the global North and South, and the expertise of the WHO and our international partners, no country or region will be left behind in this fight.\u201d \n\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said: \u201cNearly 5,000 lives are lost each day due to COVID-19 and the global economy is expected to contract by trillions of dollars this year. The case for investing to end the pandemic has never been stronger. The ACT Accelerator is the best way to ensure equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, but at present is facing financing gap of US$35 billion. Fully financing the ACT Accelerator would shorten the pandemic and pay back this investment rapidly as the global economy recovers.\u201d \u00a0\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cThe only way to defeat COVID-19 is together, globally. The only way forward is solidarity, responsibility and global cooperation. Today, we step up our global leadership to accelerate the development and equitable distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. The Facilitation Council will play an instrumental role in delivering on this goal.\u201d\n\nDuring its first meeting, the Council has adopted a political statement highlighting global collaboration as key to defeat the virus. It stresses the importance of testing, treatment, vaccination and improved health systems to overcome the pandemic. The statement also mentions the progress made and call for additional resources to deliver on the mission.\n\nThe Facilitation Council is composed by governments and non-governmental partners (BMGF, Wellcome Trust). It is co-chaired by Norway and South Africa, achieving geographical balance. The Council build on what the ACT-A has achieved in only four month, such as more than 200 vaccine candidates, 1700 clinical trials, and 80 diagnostics being followed, as well as 100 countries surveyed to identify capacity gaps.\n\nNext steps\n\nFinal comments on investment case and ACT-A Plan will be forthcoming on 17 September and then the ACT-A high-level event at UNGA will take place on 30 September.\n\nBetween 15-30 September, there will be UNGA and G20 meetings and this will act to amplify the call to world leaders. Between 12-18 October, World Bank \/ IMF Annual meetings will take place to explore the scale of economic challenge and initial commitments. From November to March 2021, the G20 Summit and other related meetings will react upon the series of commitments.\n\nUltimately, the ACT-A Advocacy Campaign aims to address major political challenges and secure the more than \u20ac29 billion (US$35 billion) financing needs.\n\nBackground\n\nLaunched at the end of April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator brings together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, and philanthropists and global health organizations (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI, FIND, Gavi, The Global Fund, Unitaid, Wellcome, the WHO,\u00a0the World Bank\u00a0and Global Financing Facility). It intends to accelerate the development of universally accessible vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and the improvement of the necessary health systems. Knowledge and data sharing are key. The ACT will be in place for 2 years (renewable). No new physical structure will be established, but use will be made of the expertise of existing institutions and partners.\n\nThree partnerships on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics define the strategy, identify the resources needed and set the accountability rules. They bring together industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations, following a value chain approach, from research to manufacturing and deployment. These partnerships work as autonomously as possible and are supported by a group of governmental and private non-profit partners.\n\nACT-A's goal is to protect health systems and restore societies and economies by accelerating development, equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of 2 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2021, 245 million courses of therapeutics by mid-2021, and 500 million tests by mid-2021.\n\nThe European Commission is committed in a global solution to the pandemic. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n","73ef9773c6132fe8ae1bde86ad8ecd3f8a828de61db552fecb39a645f41c01c4":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrexit: The EU institutions mark the UK's withdrawal from the EU \n\nThe United Kingdom will leave the European Union at midnight tonight (00:00 CET).

It has launched an emergency request for expressions of interest for research projects that will advance our understanding of the novel Coronavirus epidemic and contribute to more efficient clinical management of patients infected with the virus, as well as improve public health preparedness and response. Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"We are working to mitigate the consequences of a potential larger spread of the Coronavirus outbreak in the EU. Thanks to emergency research funding from Horizon 2020, we will know more about the disease. I am proud that following the progress made during the last years, our supercomputer centres stand ready to help researchers in their work to develop new treatment and vaccines. We will be able to protect the public better, and to deal more effectively with the current and any future outbreaks.\u201d Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, added: \u201cWe need to see a multifaceted, whole-of-government response to the Coronavirus and research is an essential part of this. We need to know more about the virus to better target our prevention measures and to ensure better care for our citizens \u2013 this is precisely the aim of the Horizon 2020 emergency research funding announced today\u201d. The funding is expected to support 2 to 4 research projects. Applicants have until 12 February to respond and grant agreements should be signed very quickly, in view of enabling research work to start as soon as possible.\u00a0 The Commission is also working closely with the World Health Organization and other international actors to ensure an efficient and coordinated response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Today's report also provides an overview of recent tax reforms at EU and Member State level. It shows that there is evidence that multinational enterprises continue to engage in aggressive tax planning in order to decrease their tax burden. Each year, billions of euros in tax revenue are also lost in the EU because of international tax evasion by individuals. The report finds that taxation is more than just about raising revenue but also plays a central role in shaping a fairer society. While the EU is faring relatively well compared to other parts of the world, there is significant income and wealth inequality in our societies. The overall structure of the tax system plays a role in addressing this, as well as boosting employment. The right tax policies can also play a role in supporting the green transition. For example, in 2019, in all but two Member States, the nominal marginal tax rates on diesel for private road usage are lower than those for unleaded petrol, even though diesel has a higher carbon content and greater negative impact on ambient air quality. New elements of this year's edition include discussions on tax competition, the sustainability of tax systems in a changing world, and the design and distribution of the overall tax mix. The report also presents the main indicators used by the European Commission to analyse tax policies in the context of the European Semester and substantiates the tax policy priorities of the Commission's Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy in this field.Download the report here.

The wine sector is among the hardest hit agri-food sectors, due to rapid changes in demand and the closure of restaurants and bars across the EU, which was not compensated by home consumption.\n\nThese new measures include the temporary authorisation for operators to self-organise market measures, the increase of the European Union's contribution for wine national support programmes, and the introduction of advance payments for crisis distillation and storage.\n\nAgriculture and Rural Development Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski said: \u201cThe wine sector has been among the sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus crisis and the related lockdown measures taken across the EU. The first package of market-specific measures adopted by the Commission has already provided significant support. Nonetheless, the uncertainties surrounding the scale of the crisis at EU and global level, and a close monitoring of the market has led us to propose a new package of measures for the wine sector. I am confident that these measures will provide rapidly concrete results for the EU wine sector and soon provide stability.\u201d\n\nThe exceptional measures include:\n\n\tTemporary derogation from the European Union's competition rules: Article 222 of the\u00a0Common Markets Organisation Regulation\u00a0(CMO) allows the Commission to adopt temporary derogations from certain EU competition rules in situations of severe market imbalances. The Commission has now adopted such a derogation for the wine sector, allowing operators to self-organise and implement market measures at their level to stabilise their sector and in the respect of the functioning of the internal market for a maximum period of 6 months. For example, they will be allowed to plan joint promotion activities, to organise storage by private operators and to commonly plan production.\n\tIncrease of the European Union's contribution: the European Union's contribution for all measures of the national support programmes will increase by 10% and reach 70%. A previous exceptional measure had already increased it from 50% to 60%. This will provide financial relief to beneficiaries.\n\tAdvanced payments for crisis distillation and storage: the Commission will allow Member States to provide advanced payments to operators for on-going distillation and crisis storage operations. These advances can cover up to 100% of costs and will allow Member States to fully utilise their national support programme funds for this year.\n\n\nIn addition to these support measures for the wine sector, the fruit and vegetable sector will also benefit from an increase of the EU's contribution (from 50% to 70%) for programmes managed by producer organisations. This will provide further flexibility to producer organisations in the implementation of their programmes.\n\nThese measures complement the recently adopted package, which benefited the wine sector through the flexibility provided under market support programmes. This included for instance an increased flexibility of tools to control production potential, the so-called green harvesting tool, and the possibility to include temporary new measures such as the opening of distillation of wine in case of crisis or an aid to crisis storage of wine.\n\nIn addition, the Commission has recently launched two calls for proposals for promotion programmes that aim to support the sectors most affected by the crisis, including the wine sector. The two calls will be opened until 27 August 2020.\u00a0\n\nFor more information\n\nSupporting the agriculture and food sectors amid coronavirus\n\nEU response amid coronavirus\n\nCommon Agricultural Policy's market measures\n\nWine in the EU\n\nFruits and vegetables\n\nCommission Implementing Regulation\n\n","76b6117c1391f701e5130608e041481dc8dc209f99bd6cbb7b2b54240051be06":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has today adopted a Capital Markets Recovery Package, as part of the Commission's overall coronavirus recovery strategy. On 28 April, the Commission had already proposed a Banking Package to facilitate bank lending to households and businesses throughout the EU. Today's measures aim to make it easier for capital markets to support European businesses to recover from the crisis. \u00a0The package proposes targeted changes to capital market rules, which will encourage greater investments in the economy, allow for the rapid re-capitalisation of companies and increase banks' capacity to finance the recovery.\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that works for the people said: \u201cWe are continuing with our efforts to help EU citizens and businesses during the coronavirus crisis and the subsequent recovery. One way of doing so is to help businesses raise capital on public markets. Today's targeted amendments will make it easier for our businesses to get the funding they need and to invest in our economy. Capital markets are vital to the recovery, because public financing alone will not be enough to get our economies back on track. We will present a wider Capital Markets Union Action Plan in September.\u201d\n\nThe package contains targeted adjustments to the Prospectus Regulation, MiFID II and securitisation rules. All of the amendments are at the heart of the Capital Markets Union project aimed at better integrating national capital markets and ensuring equal access to investments and funding opportunities across the EU.\n\nTargeted amendments to the prospectus regime - EU Recovery Prospectus: Easy to produce \u2013 Easy to read \u2013 Easy to scrutinise\n\nA prospectus is a document that companies need to disclose to their investors when they issue shares and bonds. The Commission is today proposing to create an \u201cEU Recovery Prospectus\u201d \u2013 a type of short-form prospectus \u2013 for companies that have a track record in the public market. This temporary prospectus would be easy to produce for companies, easy to read for investors, and easy to scrutinise for national competent authorities. It would cut down the length of prospectuses from hundreds of pages to just 30 pages. This will help companies to raise capital \u2013 such as shares - instead of going deeper into debt. A second set of targeted amendments to the Prospectus Regulation aims at facilitating fundraising by banks that play an essential role in financing the recovery of the real economy.\n\nTargeted amendments to the MiFID II requirements for European firms\n\nThe Commission is today proposing to make some targeted amendments to MiFID II requirements, in order to reduce some of the administrative burdens that experienced investors face in their business-to-business relationships. Lesser-experienced investors (such as households investing their savings for retirement) will remain just as protected as before. These amendments refer to a number of requirements that were already identified (during the MiFID\/MiFIR public consultation) as being overly burdensome or hindering the development of European markets. The current crisis makes it even more important to alleviate unnecessary burdens and provide opportunities to nascent markets. The Commission therefore proposes to recalibrate requirements to ensure that there is a high level of transparency towards the client, while also ensuring the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for European firms.\u00a0In parallel, the Commission has today opened a public consultation on amendments to the MiFID II delegated directive to increase the research coverage regime for small and mid-cap issuers and for bonds. In particular, SMEs need a good level of investment research to give them enough visibility to attract new investors. \u00a0We are today also proposing to amend the MiFID rules affecting energy derivatives markets. This is intended to help the development of euro-denominated energy markets \u2013 important for the international role of the euro \u2013 as well as allow European companies to cover their risks, while safeguarding the integrity of commodity markets, especially for agricultural products.\n\nTargeted amendments to securitisation rules\n\nThe Commission is today proposing a package of measures amending the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation. Securitisation is a tool through which banks can bundle loans, turn them into securities, and sell them onto capital markets. The aim of these changes is to facilitate the use of securitisation in Europe's recovery by enabling banks to expand their lending and to free their balance sheets of non-performing exposures. It is helpful to let banks transfer some of the risk of SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) loans to the markets so that they can keep lending to SMEs. In particular, the Commission proposes creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised on-balance-sheet securitisation that would benefit from a prudential treatment reflecting the actual riskiness of these instruments. In addition, the Commission proposes to remove existing regulatory obstacles to the securitisation of non-performing exposures. This can help banks offload non-performing exposures that can be expected to grow because of the coronavirus crisis. Today's changes are based on extensive work and analysis carried out by the European Banking Authority in 2019 and 2020.\n\nFor more information\n\nLink to today's package\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\n","77a4ef93fa31388fa8eba75a809085c650ea5f78cc7243d6462668dacb928d3b":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission has granted a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for the COVID\u201119 vaccine developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, and the fourth COVID-19 vaccine authorised in the EU.\n\nThis authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States.\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \"The Janssen vaccine is the fourth authorised vaccine of the EU's portfolio and will help us enhance the vaccination campaign in the second quarter of 2021. It only requires a single dose, which takes us another step closer to achieving our collective goal of vaccinating 70% of the adult population by the end of summer.\"\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \"Our portfolio now contains four safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines that we are working tirelessly to deliver to citizens in Europe and beyond as soon as possible. A single dose vaccine can make a difference in the speed of rollout. The entry on the market of the Janssen vaccine ensures that we have access to a total of up to 1.8 billion doses of approved vaccines from different technology platforms \u2013 this is key to ensuring access to vaccinations for Europe and our international partners. We will continue to work tirelessly to support vaccine producers and ensure they deliver doses, as agreed in our contracts.\"\n\nThe Janssen vaccine will be given in one dose to adults aged 18 years and older for preventing COVID-19. The vaccine is based on an adenovirus, a harmless virus which delivers the \u2018instructions' from the virus that causes COVID-19. This allows the body's own cells to make the protein unique to the COVID-19 virus. The person's immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by COVID-19. The adenovirus in the vaccine cannot reproduce and does not cause disease.\n\nOn the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional marketing authorisation.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Commission approved the contract with Janssen on 8 October 2020. With the conditional market authorisation, Janssen will be able to deliver 200 million of their single dose COVID-19 vaccine to the EU starting in the second quarter of 2021. The contract allows Member States to purchase an additional 200 million doses. This will add to the total amount of 600 of the vaccine by BioNTech\/Pfizer and the 460 million doses of the vaccine by Moderna, as well as the 400 million by AstraZeneca. \n\nBackground\n\nA conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However, it also ensures that this COVID-19 vaccine meets the EU standards, as for all other vaccines and medicines.\n\nOnce a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. CMAs are foreseen in the EU legislation specifically for public health emergencies and is considered the most appropriate regulatory mechanism in this pandemic for granting access to all EU citizens and for underpinning mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nJanssen submitted an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA on 16 February 2021. Such a short time for evaluation is only possible because EMA has already reviewed some data during a rolling review. During this phase, EMA assessed quality data and data from laboratory studies which looked at how well the vaccine triggers the production of antibodies and immune cells that target SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). The Agency also looked at clinical safety data on the viral vector used in the vaccine. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.\n\nThe European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional marketing authorisation.\n\nFor More Information\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nQuestions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nSafe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nEU's legislation on medicinal products\n\nEMA and COVID-19 vaccines\n\nFactsheet: How vaccines work\n\nFactsheet: Health benefits of vaccines\n\nFactsheet: Authorisation process\n\nFactsheet: Long-term safety\n\nEU's current portfolio\n\n","7d16c7269ab56bb4903f035165de8157d1da3066896aa0a77ec7b05e36406478":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission approved a third contract with a pharmaceutical company, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.\n\nOnce the vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the contract allows Member States to purchase vaccines for 200 million people. They will also have the possibility to purchase vaccines for an additional 200 million people.\n\nMember States may also decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nThe Commission has already signed a contract with AstraZeneca and with Sanofi-GSK and it concluded successful exploratory talks with CureVac, BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cAs the coronavirus continues to spread worryingly across Europe, it is crucial to find a vaccine, and fast. I'm glad that we have been able to find an agreement with Johnson & Johnson to purchase vaccines for 200 million people. This will be our third contract with a pharmaceutical company. Our aim is to provide EU citizens with safe and effective vaccines as soon as they are found.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cEnsuring a safe and effective vaccine is at the core of our European Vaccine Strategy. Today we have secured our third vaccine agreement, expanding our portfolio of vaccine candidates and therefore our chances to find an efficient remedy against the virus. More agreements will follow, and we remain determined in our search for a successful and safe vaccine to combat this deadly pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the AdVac\u00ae technology platform, which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen's recently approved Ebola vaccine and the Zika, RSV, and HIV vaccine candidates. The vaccine candidate is already in phase III of clinical trials.\n\nThe Commission's decision to support this vaccine is based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply the whole of the EU.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreement will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n","7d7ea74c3cc4594ffb21b46e9f073e9026ed2b9e8a9a6210fd043ad27fad489e":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission has put forward its proposal for a major recovery plan. To ensure the recovery is sustainable, even, inclusive and fair for all Member States, the European Commission is proposing to create a new recovery instrument, Next Generation EU, embedded within a powerful, modern and revamped long-term EU budget. The Commission has also unveiled its adjusted Work Programme for 2020, which will prioritise the actions needed to propel Europe's recovery and resilience.\n\nThe coronavirus has shaken Europe and the world to its core, testing healthcare and welfare systems, our societies and economies and our way of living and working together. To protect lives and livelihoods, repair the Single Market, as well as to build a lasting and prosperous recovery, the European Commission is proposing to harness the full potential of the EU budget. Next Generation EU of \u20ac750 billion as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027 will bring the total financial firepower of the EU budget to \u20ac1.85 trillion.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cThe recovery plan turns the immense challenge we face into an opportunity, not only by supporting the recovery but also by investing in our future: the European Green Deal and digitalization will boost jobs and growth, the resilience of our societies and the health of our environment. This is Europe's moment. Our willingness to act must live up to the challenges we are all facing. With Next Generation EU we are providing an ambitious answer.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of the EU budget, said: \u201cOur common budget is at the heart of Europe's recovery plan. The additional firepower of Next Generation EU and the reinforced multiannual financial framework will give us the power of solidarity to support Member States and the economy. Together, Europe will arise more competitive, resilient and sovereign.\u201d\n\nVice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, in charge of interinstitutional relations and foresight, said: \u201cThe recovery will need strong policy direction. The adapted Work Programme, reflecting the new reality, shows that we will focus all our actions on overcoming the crisis, jumpstarting our economy and putting the European Union firmly on a resilient, sustainable and fair recovery path. It will help us rebound stronger.\u201d\n\nINVESTING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION \n\nComplementing national efforts, the EU budget is uniquely placed to power a fair socio-economic recovery, repair and revitalise the Single Market, to guarantee a level playing field, and support the urgent investments, in particular in the green and digital transitions, which hold the key to Europe's future prosperity and resilience.\n\nNext Generation EU will raise money by temporarily lifting the own resources ceiling to 2.00% of EU Gross National Income, allowing the Commission to use its strong credit rating to borrow \u20ac750 billion on the financial markets. This additional funding will be channelled through EU programmes and repaid over a long period of time throughout future EU budgets \u2013 not before 2028 and not after 2058. To help do this in a fair and shared way, the Commission proposes a number of new own resources. In addition, in order to make funds available as soon as possible to respond to the most pressing needs, the Commission proposes to amend the current multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 to make an additional \u20ac11.5 billion in funding available already in 2020.\n\nThe money raised for Next Generation EU will be invested across three pillars:\n\n1. Support to Member States with investments and reforms:\n\n\tA\u00a0new Recovery and Resilience Facility of \u20ac560 billion will offer financial support for investments and reforms, including in relation to the green and digital transitions and the resilience of national economies, linking these to the EU priorities. This facility will be embedded in the European Semester. It will be equipped with a grant facility of up to \u20ac310 billion and will be able to make up to \u20ac250 billion available in loans. Support will be available to all Member States but concentrated on the most affected and where resilience needs are the greatest.\n\tA\u00a0\u20ac55 billion top-up of the current cohesion policy programmes between now and 2022 under the new REACT-EU initiative to be allocated based on the severity of the socio-economic impacts of the crisis, including the level of youth unemployment and the relative prosperity of Member States.\u00a0\n\tA proposal to strenghten the Just Transition Fund up to \u20ac40 billion, toassist Member States in accelerating the transition towards climate neutrality.\n\tA \u20ac15 billion reinforcement for theEuropean Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to support rural areas in making the structural changes necessary in line with the European Green Deal and achieving the ambitious targets in line with the new biodiversity and Farm to Fork\u00a0strategies.\n\n\n2. Kick-starting the EU economy by incentivising private investments:\n\n\tA new Solvency Support Instrument will mobilise private resources to urgently support viable European companies in the sectors, regions and countries most affected. It can be operational from 2020 and will have a budget of \u20ac31 billion, aiming to unlock \u20ac300 billion in solvency support for companies from all economic sectors and prepare them for a cleaner, digital and resilient future.\n\tUpgrade InvestEU, Europe's flagship investment programme, to a level of \u20ac15.3 billion to mobilise private investment in projects across the Union.\n\tA new Strategic Investment Facility built into InvestEU\u2013 to generate investments of up to \u20ac150 billion in boosting the resilience of strategic sectors, notably those linked to the green and digital transition, and key value chains in the internal market, thanks to a contribution of \u20ac15 billion from Next Generation EU.\n\n\n3. Addressing the lessons of the crisis:\n\n\tA new Health Programme, EU4Health, to strengthen health security and prepare for future health crises with a budget of \u20ac9.4 billion.\n\tA \u20ac2 billion reinforcement of rescEU, the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism, which will be expanded and strenghetend to equip the Union to prepare for and respond to future crises.\n\tAn\u00a0amount of EUR\u20ac94.4 billion forHorizon Europe, which will be reinforced to fund vital research in health, resilience and the green and digital transitions.\n\tSupporting Europe's global partners through an additional \u20ac16.5 billion for external action, including humanitarian aid.\n\tOther EU programmes will be strengthened to align the future financial framework fully with recovery needs and strategic priorities. Other instruments will be reinforced to make the EU budget more flexible and responsive.\n\n\nReaching a rapid political agreement on Next Generation EUand the overall EU budget for 2021-2027 at the level of the European Council by July is necessary to give new dynamism to the recovery and equip the EU with a powerful tool to get the economy back on its feet and build for the future.\n\nTHE POLICY FUNDAMENTALS OF THE RECOVERY\n\nRelaunching the economy does not mean going back to the status quo before the crisis, but bouncing forward. We must repair the short-term damage from the crisis in a way that also invests in our long-term future. All of the money raised through Next Generation EU will be channelled through EU programmes in the revamped long-term EU budget:\n\nThe European Green Deal as the EU's recovery strategy:\n\n\tA massive renovation wave of our buildings and infrastructure and a more circular economy, bringing local jobs;\n\tRolling out renewable energy projects, especially wind, solar and kick-starting a clean hydrogen economy in Europe;\n\tCleaner transport and logistics,\u00a0including the installation of one million charging points for electric vehicles and a boost for rail travel and clean mobility in our cities and regions;\n\tStrengthening the Just Transition Fund to support re-skilling, helping businesses create new economic opportunities.\n\n\nStrengthening the Single Market and adapting it to the digital age:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\tInvesting in more and better connectivity, especially in the rapid deployment of 5G networks;\n\tA stronger industrial and technological presence in strategic sectors, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, supercomputing and cloud;\n\tBuilding a real data economy as a motor for innovation and job creation;\n\tIncreased cyber resilience.\n\n\nA fair and inclusive recovery for all:\n\n\tThe short-term European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme (SURE) will provide \u20ac100 billion to support workers and businesses;\n\tA Skills Agenda for Europe and a Digital Education Action Plan will ensure digital skills for all EU citizens;\n\tFair minimum wages and binding pay transparency measures will help vulnerable workers, particularly women;\n\tThe European Commission is stepping up the fight against tax evasion and this will help Member States generate revenue.\n\n\nBUILDING A MORE RESILIENT EU\n\nEurope must enhance its strategic autonomy in a number of specific areas, including in strategic value chains and reinforced screening of foreign direct investment. To increase crisis preparedness and crisis management, the Commission will reinforce the European Medicines Agency and give a stronger role to the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) in coordinating medical responses in crises.\n\nThe recovery must unequivocally be based on fundamental rights and full respect of the rule of law. Any emergency measures must be limited in time and be strictly proportionate. The Commission's assessment will be included in the first report under the rule of law mechanism.\n\nWe can and must learn the lessons from this crisis, but this can only be done by involving our citizens, communities and cities. The Conference on the Future of Europe will play an important role in further strengthening Europe's democratic foundations in the post-coronavirus crisis world.\n\nRESPONSIBLE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP\n\nThe EU is committed in leading international efforts towards a truly global recovery, notably though joint coordination with the United Nations, the G20 and G7, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or the International Labour Organisation. The EU will continue working particularly closely with its immediate neighbourhood in the East and South and its partners in Africa.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Joint Statement of the Members of the European Council adopted on 26 March 2020 called on the European Commission to develop a coordinated exit strategy, a comprehensive recovery plan and unprecedented investment to allow a normal functioning of our societies and economies and get to sustainable growth, integrating inter alia the green transition and the digital transformation. On the basis of this mandate, on 15 April the Presidents of the Commission and the Council presented, as a first step, a Joint European Roadmap towards lifting Covid-19 containment measures. The package presented today, based on a revamped proposal for the next long-term EU budget and the updated Commission Work Programme for 2020, addresses the second part of the mandate, namely the need for a comprehensive recovery plan.\n\nThe EU has already delivered a coordinated and powerful collective response to cushion the economic blow of the coronavirus crisis. We have relaxed our fiscal and state aid frameworks to give Member States room to act. We are using every available euro in the EU budget to support the healthcare sector, workers and businesses, and mobilising finance from the markets to help save jobs.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nRecovery Plan Communication: \u201cEurope's moment: Repair and Prepare for the Next Generation\u201d\n\nEU Budget Communication: \u201cThe EU budget powering the recovery plan for Europe\u201d\n\nStaff working document\n\nWebsite for the MFF proposals\n\nWebsite for the adjusted Commission Work Programme 2020\n\nWebsite on the Commission's coronavirus response\n\nQ&A on the MFF and Next Generation EU \n\n\nFactsheet 1\u00a0The EU budget powering the Recovery Plan for Europe\u00a0\n\nFactsheet 2 Key instruments supporting the Recovery Plan for Europe\u00a0\n\nFactsheet 3 Financing the Recovery Plan for Europe\u00a0\n\nFactsheet 4 Adjusted Commission Work Programme 2020\n\nSpeech of President von der Leyen in European Parliament\n\n","7d876ebef31dff2d78209e5fdb5e135c0610e69fa7d2b7c7e5d28f8e1a0e04c7":null,"802d9718b1ae007f1ceb52a375c2b9e1bcbadbb8c580fde88e5a241651782a15":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of its cooperation with the Sahel, the European Union announced today funding of \u20ac92 million to strengthen the response of Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger and Chad to the spread of the coronavirus. The aim is to provide quality health care to the populations and reduce the economic and social impact of the pandemic.\n \nHigh Representative\/Vice-President Josep Borrell said: \u00ab Today we reiterate our commitment to step up our mobilisation of support for the Sahel in its fight against the pandemic. Beyond a short-term response to the urgent needs of the populations, our aim is also to reduce as of now the economic and social impact of the pandemic, which threatens to disproportionately affect Africa in general and the Sahel in particular.'\n \nJutta Urpilainen, Commissioner for International Partnerships, said: The European Union is continuing to mobilise as \u2018Team Europe' to reinforce the efforts made by the authorities of the G5 Sahel countries to address the coronavirus crisis. The implementation of these funds in a transparent and inclusive manner will help to improve health care and the socio-economic situation, which the pandemic has made still more fragile.'\n \nThese \u20ac92 million are part of our overall response and consist of \u20ac26 million for Burkina Faso, \u20ac12 million for Mauritania, \u20ac38 million for Niger and \u20ac16.92 million for Chad. Against a backdrop of fiscal pressures compounded by multiple crises \u2013 security, food, socio-economic and health \u2013 this EU budgetary support will assist these countries in implementing their pandemic response plans, while leaving the necessary fiscal space to continue key reforms in other sectors, without pushing up their debt levels.\n \nThese funds will also contribute more broadly to limiting the impact of the crisis on the economies of these countries and on the most vulnerable households. The European Union will continue to monitor closely the implementation of national development policies and the reforms adopted to ensure macroeconomic stability, sound public financial management and transparency.\n \nBackground\n \nThe Sahel is a priority country for the European Union. Since 2014, the G5 Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad) have benefited from \u20ac4.6 billion of European development funds. The European Union deploys a wide range of instruments (in particular, political, development, humanitarian and security) in line with its global and integrated approach, with a view to contributing to long-term stability and development.\n \nThe EU's global response to the coronavirus takes a \u2018Team Europe' approach based on contributions from all the EU institutions, and combines resources mobilised by the Member States and financial institutions to address the humanitarian, health and other consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. \u2018Team Europe's global response amounts to \u20ac36.8 billion. In this context, the EU has mobilised \u20ac449 million for the five Sahel countries.\n \nFor more information \n\n \nEU global response to COVID-19\n\n","80dc8718e83a50f18ffe5745589160f0758fb548f8f7daf6dd6b8b6d938316fc":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission has today concluded exploratory talks with BioNTech-Pfizer to purchase a potential vaccine against COVID-19. BioNTech-Pfizer is the sixth company with which the Commission has concluded talks, following Sanofi-GSK on 31 July, Johnson & Johnson on 13 August, CureVac on 18 August and Moderna on 24 August. The first contract, signed with AstraZeneca, entered into force on 27 August.\n\nThe envisaged contract with BioNTech-Pfizer would provide for the possibility for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine, as well as to donate to lower and middle income countries or re-direct to European countries. It is anticipated that the Commission will have a contractual framework in place for the initial purchase of 200 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to purchase up to a further 100 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \u201cI am happy to announce that we have concluded talks with BioNTech-Pfizer for an initial purchase of 200 million doses of future coronavirus vaccines. This is the 6th pharma company with which we have concluded talks or signed an agreement for potential vaccines, in record time. Our chances to develop and deploy a safe and effective vaccine have never been higher, both for Europeans here at home, or for the rest of the world. To defeat coronavirus anywhere, we need to defeat it everywhere.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cToday's final talks with BioNTech-Pfizer is yet another important step in our efforts to build a sound and diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates. This was the objective of our EU Vaccine Strategy, and we are delivering on it. We are optimistic that among these candidates there will be a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 to help us defeat this pandemic.\u201d\n\nBioNTech is a German company working with US-based Pfizer to develop a new vaccine based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in human biology, transferring the instructions which direct cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease.\n\nThe exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nToday's conclusion of the exploratory talks with BioNTech and Pfizer is an important step towards the conclusion of an Advance Purchase Agreement, and therefore towards the implementation of the European Vaccines Strategy, adopted by the Commission on 17 June 2020.\u00a0 This strategy aims to secure for all European citizens high-quality, safe, effective and affordable vaccines within 12 to 18 months. To do so, and together with the Member States, the Commission is agreeing Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers reserving or giving the Member States the right to buy a given number of vaccine doses for a certain price, as and when a vaccine becomes available.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.\n\nThis is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n","8105dbc2a58bcd7e72a839f9b982b086744854e5ad74eb49a96cb85f4df73b61":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Commission presented guidelines to Member States on health-related border management measures in the context of the COVID-19 emergency. The aim is to protect citizens' health, ensure the right treatment of people who do have to travel, and make sure essential goods and services remain available. Commissioners Kyriakides and Johansson have presented the guidelines to EU ministers of Health and of Home Affairs at their first joint video meeting starting at 11am this morning. \u00a0\n\nPresident von der Leyen said: \u201cOur measures to contain the\u00a0Coronavirus outbreak will be effective only if we coordinate on the European level. We have to take exceptional measures to protect the health of our citizens. But let's make sure goods and essential services continue to flow in our internal market. This is the only way to prevent shortages of medical equipment or food. It's not only an economic issue: our single market is a key instrument of European solidarity. I am in discussion with all Member States so that we confront this challenge together, as a Union.\u201d\n\nThe\u00a0guidelines set out principles for an integrated approach to an effective border management to protect health while preserving the integrity of the internal market.\n\nProtecting people's health\n\nPeople identified as at risk of spreading\u00a0COVID-19 should have access to appropriate health care, either in the country of arrival or in the country of departure, and this should be coordinated between the two.\n\nIt is possible to submit everyone entering the national territory to health checks without formal introduction of internal border controls. The difference between normal health checks and border controls is the possibility to deny entry to individual persons. People who are sick should not be denied entry but given access to healthcare.\n\nMember States may reintroduce internal border controls for reasons of public policy, which, in extremely critical situations, may include public health. Such border controls should be organised to prevent the emergence of large gatherings (e.g. queues), which risk increasing the spread of the virus. Member States should coordinate to carry out health screening on one side of the border only.\n\nAll border controls should be applied in a proportionate manner and with due regard to people's health. Member States must always admit their own citizens and residents, and should facilitate transit of other EU citizens and residents that are returning home. However, they can take measures such as requiring a period of self-isolation, if they impose the same requirements on their own nationals.\n\nMember States should facilitate the crossing of frontier workers, in particular but not only those working in the health care and food sector, and other essential services (e.g. child care, elderly care, critical staff for utilities).\n\nEnsuring the flow of essential goods and services\n\nFree circulation of goods is crucial to maintain availability of goods. This is particularly crucial for essential goods such as food supplies including livestock, vital medical and protective equipment and supplies. More generally, control measures should not cause serious disruption of supply chains, essential services of general interest and of national economies and the EU economy as a whole. Member States should designate priority lanes for freight transport (e.g. via \u2018green lanes').\n\nIn the same vein, safe movement for transport workers, including truck and train drivers, pilots and aircrew is a key factor to ensure adequate movement of goods and essential staff.\n\nNo additional certifications should be imposed on goods legally circulating within the EU single market. According to the European Food Safety Authority, there is no evidence that food is a source or a transmission source of COVID-19.\n\nFor More Information \n\nGuidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services\n\n\u00a0\n\n#coronavirus\n\n\n\n","813da81ec62af3c3902b5287a0c26eb8536bbcafa8e06286a94b47507e73ef0d":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission has today decided to approve requests from Member States and the UK to temporarily waive customs duties and VAT on the import of medical devices, and protective equipment, from third countries in order to help in the fight against coronavirus.

The aim is to preserve EU companies and critical assets, notably in areas such as health, medical research, biotechnology and infrastructures that are essential for our security and public order, without undermining the EU's general openness to foreign investment.\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cIf we want Europe to emerge from this crisis as strong as we entered it, then we must take precautionary measures now. As in any crisis, when our industrial and corporate assets can be under stress, we need to protect our security and economic sovereignty. We have the tools to deal with this situation under European and national law and I want to urge Member States to make full use of them. The EU is and will remain an open market for foreign direct investment. But this openness is not unconditional.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCommissioner for Trade Phil Hogan said: \u201cWe are facing an unprecedented public health crisis with deep consequences for the European economy. In the EU, we are and wish to remain open to foreign investment. In the current circumstances, we need to temper this openness with appropriate controls. We need to know who invests and for what purpose. The EU and its Member States have the right legal tools for that. Today's guidelines call upon Member States to use these tools to the fullest extent and will bring additional clarity on how to use our investment screening framework to prevent a sell-off of strategic EU assets in the current crisis.\u201d\u00a0\n\nUnder existing EU rules, Member States are empowered to screen foreign direct investments (FDI) from non-EU countries on grounds of security or public order. Protection of public health is recognised as an overriding reason in the general interest. As a result, Member States can impose mitigating measures (such as supply commitments to meet national and EU vital needs) or prevent a foreign investor from acquiring or taking control over a company. National FDI screening mechanisms are currently in place in 14 Member States. With the EU foreign investment screening regulation in force since last year, the EU is well equipped to coordinate control of foreign acquisitions done at the Member States' level.\n\nIssuing its guidelines, the Commission calls upon Member States that already have an existing screening mechanism in place to make full use of tools available to them under EU and national law to prevent capital flows from non-EU countries that could undermine Europe's security or public order.\n\nThe Commission also calls on the remaining Member States to set up a fully-fledged screening mechanism and in the meantime to consider all options, in compliance with EU law and international obligations, to address potential cases where the acquisition or control by a foreign investor of a particular business, infrastructure or technology would create a risk to security or public order in the EU.\n\nThe Commission also encourages cooperation between Member States, as it comes to FDI screening cases where foreign investment could have an effect on the EU single market.\u00a0 Foreign acquisitions taking place now already fall under the EU FDI screening regulation, and could be reviewed under the cooperation mechanism established by the regulation, which will be fully operational as from October 2020.\n\nOn capital movements, the guidelines also recall under which specific circumstances free movement of capital, notably from third countries, linked to acquisitions of stakes may be restricted.\n\nThe Commission will also continue to follow closely developments on the ground and stands ready to discuss and ensure coordination on any foreign investment case with a larger European impact. Protection of the EU strategic assets will also be the subject of discussions between President\u00a0von der Leyen and EU leaders in tomorrow's European Council videoconference.\n\nBackground\n\nThe EU FDI Screening Regulation was adopted in March 2019. It puts in place for the first time an EU-level mechanism to coordinate the screening of foreign investments likely to affect the security and public order of the Union and its Member States. This mechanism is based on an obligation to exchange information between Member States and the Commission, as well as on the possibility for the Commission and Member States to issue opinions and comments on specific transactions. The application of this mechanism will start on 11 October 2020. The Commission and Member States are already cooperating with a view to adapt national screening mechanisms and ensure a full and swift implementation of the Regulation at EU and national levels.\n\nFor more information\n\nGuidelines on FDI screening\n\nFDI screening framework: Regulation, Press release, Factsheet\n\n","83e249269aaa269c70c4ec97cad235a1472c14b9da70b39cee5469eb12ea78c8":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission announces that it will issue its forthcoming EU SURE bonds of up to \u20ac100 billion as social bonds. To that end, the Commission has adopted an independently evaluated Social Bond Framework. This Framework is meant to provide investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.\n\nThis announcement follows the Council's approval to grant financial support to 16 Member States under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and people in work.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cWe are not only investing billions of euros to save jobs in Europe and reduce the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but we are also doing it by issuing social bonds. This will give investors the chance to contribute to our efforts and up to \u20ac100 billion will help keep people in jobs in our Member States.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Johannes Hahn, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: \u201cThe decision to issue the EU SURE bonds as social bonds will be a game changer for the global social bonds market. At the same time, it is a clear demonstration of the EU's long-term commitment to sustainable financing. I am very excited about today's announcement and looking forward to the forthcoming EU SURE issuance in the very near future.\u201d\n\nThe funds raised will be transferred to the beneficiary Member States in the form of loans to help them cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes and similar measures as a response to the pandemic.\n\nToday's Framework demonstrates to the investor community how the funds raised by SURE bond issuance will be used for a clearly identified objective: alleviating the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences across the EU. Investors can therefore be confident that their investments in these bonds will be used to finance targeted social policy measures. At the same time, the Commission's Social Bond Framework will contribute to the further development of the social bond market which is one pillar of the European \u2018Sustainable Finance' market.\n\nIn order to guarantee that the funds will be used for social purposes, the Social Bond Framework, underpinned by the SURE Regulation, requires Member States to report on how the borrowed funds have been spent. Under the Framework, Member States are also required to report on the social impact of the EU SURE bonds. Based on the information in these reports, the European Commission will be able to demonstrate to investors that the EU SURE bonds have been used to finance programmes with a positive social impact.\n\nBy preparing and presenting a Social Bond Framework, the Commission seeks to appeal to investors who want to put their funds to work for Environmental, Social and Corporate governance (ESG) purposes. The Commission's Social Bond Framework has been established in full compliance with the Social Bond Principles (SBP) published by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). It has been independently evaluated by an external evaluator, Sustainalytics.\n\nFollowing today's announcement, the Commission is moving one step closer towards the issuance of the first SURE bonds. The first transaction will follow in the second half of October.\n\nBackground\n\nSo far, 16 Member States will receive financial support under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. Financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States. The Commission has today presented a proposal to the Council for a decision to grant \u20ac504 million in financial support to Hungary under the SURE instrument. Including Hungary, the Commission has now proposed a total of \u20ac87.8 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States.\n\nThese loans will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the pandemic, in particular for the self-employed. SURE could also finance some health-related measures, in particular at the work place, used to ensure a safe return to normal economic activity.\n\nMember States can still submit formal requests for support under SURE, which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion to help protect jobs and workers affected by the pandemic.\n\nFor more information\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nSocial Bond Framework\n\nSURE website\n\nEU as a borrower website\n\nProposal for a Council Implementing Decision for Hungary\n\n\u00a0\n\n","8583a1f5bc19144192361abb8ad5c1b37eca9bc4e1fc3ea92cd40d47ac9b785e":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the EU's global coronavirus response, an EU Humanitarian Air Bridge operation consisting of three flights to Lima, Peru this week is delivering a total of more than 4 tonnes of life-saving materials to humanitarian organisations active in the country.

Of this funding, \u20ac605 million have been directed to humanitarian support towards South America, including \u20ac265 for Colombia and \u20ac109 for Venezuela.\n\nBackground \n\nSouth America is exposed to multiple, often combined, natural hazards. Climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of these weather-related disasters and has been hampering the resilience of the most vulnerable communities. Moreover, the region is confronted with one of the largest population displacement movements of its history: more than 5.2 million Venezuelans have sought refuge in neighbouring South American countries.\n\nThe coronavirus hit large parts of the continent with pre-existing vulnerabilities such as lack of access to basic services, vulnerable livelihoods and poor sanitary conditions. Health facilities and funerary services have become quickly overwhelmed, particularly in Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil and the Pacific coast of Colombia. The pandemic has particularly impacted the tri-border area of the Amazon between Brazil, Colombia and Peru and threatens to infect remote indigenous communities in the rainforest.\n\nFor More Information \n\nFactsheet: EU Humanitarian Air Bridge\n\nFactsheet: EU Humanitarian in South America\n\n","85c581854259989d57b633950aa668302d0245ba9ea0b5cb18a43a1a36481f88":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission approved a fifth contract with the European pharmaceutical company CureVac, which provides for the initial purchase of 225 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, plus an option to request up to a further 180 million doses, to be supplied once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19.\n\nToday's contract with CureVac enlarges the already broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the contracts signed with AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and BioNtech-Pfizer, and the successful exploratory talks with Moderna. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective. Member States can also decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u00a0\u201cA few days after our contract with BioNTech and Pfizer, I am delighted to announce a new agreement with a promising European company. The Commission has secured to date at least 1.2 billion doses and fulfils its commitment to ensuring equitable access to safe, effective and affordable vaccines not only for EU citizens but also for the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. Most of these vaccine candidates are in an advanced phase of clinical trials, hopefully authorisation will confirm these positive results, after which they will be quickly deployed and help us in overcoming the pandemic.\u201d\n\nStella\u00a0Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said:\u00a0\u201cWith growing numbers of COVID patients across the EU, a safe and effective vaccine is more crucial than ever in putting behind us the pandemic. With this fifth vaccine advance purchase agreement, we are further expanding the possibilities that EU citizens and our economies can soon safely return to normality. It is yet another milestone in our EU Vaccines Strategy, and evidence of the benefits of working together in a genuine European Health Union.\u201d\n\nCureVac, a European company based in Germany, signed a \u20ac75 million loan agreement with the European Investment Bank on 6 July for the development and large-scale production of vaccines, including CureVac's vaccine candidate against COVID-19. CureVac is pioneering the development of a completely new class of vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA), transported into cells by lipid nanoparticles. The vaccine platform has been developed over the last decade. The basic principle is the use of this molecule as a data carrier for information, with the help of which the body itself can produce its own active substances to combat various diseases.\n\nThe Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply the whole of the EU.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.\n\nOnce vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies.\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response. On 12 November, the European Union announced the contribution of an additional \u20ac100 million in grant funding to support the COVAX Facility.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\nOverview of the Commission's Response\n\n","867ab927a6e6887c01027d316b4aa8f90e8c85566178a1ca91869be127a67322":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Commission recommends steps and measures to develop a common EU approach for the use of mobile applications and mobile data in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Digital tools can play an important role in the gradual lifting of containment measure, when the time will be ripe for that, if they are compliant with EU rules and well coordinated. The Recommendation sets out a process towards the adoption with the Member States of a toolbox, focusing on two dimensions: \n\n\ta pan-European coordinated approach for the use of mobile applications for empowering citizens to take effective and more targeted social distancing measures and for warning, preventing and contact tracing; and\n\ta common approach for modelling and predicting the evolution of the virus through anonymised and aggregated mobile location data. \n\n\nThe Recommendation sets out key principles for the use of these apps and data as regards data security and the respect of EU fundamental rights such as privacy and data protection.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton said: \u201cDigital technologies, mobile applications and mobility data have enormous potential to help understand how the virus spreads and to respond effectively. With this Recommendation, we put in motion a European coordinated approach for the use of such apps and data, without compromising on our EU privacy and data protection rules, and avoiding the fragmentation of the internal market. Europe is stronger when it acts united.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, added: \u201cWe all must work together now to get through this unprecedented crisis. The Commission is supporting the Member States in their efforts to fight the virus and we will continue to do so when it comes to an exit strategy and to recovery. In all this, we will continue to ensure full respect of Europeans' fundamental rights. Europe's data protection rules are the strongest in the world and they are fit also for this crisis, providing for exceptions and flexibility. We work closely with data protection authorities and will come forward with guidance on the privacy implications soon.\u201d\n\nA common coordinated approach for the use of tracing apps\n\nSince the outbreak of the pandemic, the Commission has strongly supported Member States in their efforts to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. Commission services have been looking into the effectiveness of apps solutions to address the crisis as well as their impact on data protection. Centrepiece of today's Recommendation is the proposal for a joint toolbox towards a common coordinated approach for the use of smartphone apps that fully respect EU data protection standards.It will consist of:\n\n\tspecifications to ensure the effectiveness of mobile information, warning and tracing applications from a medical and technical point of view;\n\tmeasures to avoid proliferation of incompatible applications, support requirements for interoperability and promotion of common solutions;\n\tgovernance mechanisms to be applied by public health authorities and in cooperation with the European Centre for Disease Control;\n\tthe identification of good practices and mechanisms for exchange of information on the functioning of the applications; and\n\tsharing data with relevant epidemiological public bodies, including aggregated data to ECDC.\n\n\nTo support Member States, the Commission will provide guidance including on data protection and privacy implications. The Commission is in close contact with the European Data Protection Board for an overview of the processing of personal data at national level in the context of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nA common approach for predicting and modelling the spread\n\nThe toolbox will also focus on developing a common approach for modelling and predicting the evolution of the virus through anonymous and aggregated mobile location data. The aim is to analyse mobility patterns including the impact of confinement measures on the intensity of contacts, and hence the risks of contamination. This will be an important and proportionate input for tools modelling the spread of the virus, and provide insights for the development of strategies for opening up societies again.\n\nThe Commission already started the discussion with mobile phone operators on 23 March 2020 with the aim to cover all Member States. The data will be fully anonymised and transmitted to the Joint Research Centre (JRC) for processing and modelling. It will not be shared with third parties and only be stored as long as the crisis is ongoing.\n\nNext steps\n\nMember States, together with the Commission, shall develop a toolbox towards a pan-European approach for mobile applications in association with the European Data Protection Board by 15 April 2020. To support Member States, the Commission will provide guidance including on data protection and privacy implications.Member States should report on the actions they have taken by 31 May 2020, and make the measures accessible to other Member States and the Commission for peer review. The Commission will assess the progress made and publish periodic reports starting in June 2020 and throughout the crisis, recommending action and\/or the phasing out of measures that are no longer necessary.\n\nFor more information\n\nCommission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis\n\nCommission Coronavirus response page\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n","86e3ff777ea4834742f8a7ee691a2fb1a4700f4b9cec956ff92e9c8d6dc14524":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission is taking swift action and proposes additional exceptional measures to further support agricultural and food markets most affected. The EU agri-food sector is showing resilience in these unprecedented times, following the outbreak of the coronavirus. Still, some markets have been hit hard by the consequences of this public health crisis.\n\nToday's package includes measures for private storage aid (PSA) in the dairy and meat sectors, the authorisation of self-organisation market measures by operators in hard hit sectors and flexibility in fruits and vegetables, wine and some other market support programmes.\n\nAgriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski said: \u201dThe consequences of the coronavirus crisis are increasingly being felt in the agri-food sector and this is why we have decided to take swift action, in addition to the measures already taken since the outbreak of the crisis. The measures proposed are, in the present state of market developments, intended to send a signal aimed at stabilising markets and are considered to be the most appropriate for providing stability to future prices and production and thus stable food supplies and food security. Today we are announcing a new and exceptional package of measures to support the most affected agri-food sectors by addressing already observed disturbances as well as future risks. I am confident that these measures will relieve markets, and show concrete results rapidly.\u201d\n\nExceptional measures announced as a further response to the Coronavirus crisis include:\n\n\tPrivate storage aid: the Commission proposes to grant private storage aid for dairy (skimmed milk powder, butter, cheese) and meat (beef, sheep and goat meat) products. This scheme will allow the temporary withdrawal of products from the market for a minimum of 2 to 3 months, and a maximum period of 5 to 6 months. This measure will lead to a decrease of available supply on the market and rebalance the market on the long-term.\n\tFlexibility for market support programmes: the Commission will introduce flexibility in the implementation of market support programmes for wine, fruits and vegetables, olive oil, apiculture and the EU's school scheme (milk, fruits and vegetables). This will allow the reorientation of funding priorities towards crisis management measures for all the sectors.\n\tExceptional derogation from EU competition rules: applicable to the milk, flowers and potatoes sectors, the Commission will authorise the derogation from certain competition rules under Article 222 of the Common Markets Organisation Regulation, that allows operators to adopt self-organisation market measures. Concretely, these sectors will be allowed to collectively take measures to stabilise the market. For example, the milk sector will be allowed to collectively plan milk production and the flower and potatoes sector will be allowed to withdraw products from the market. Storage by private operators will also be allowed. Such agreements and decisions would only be valid for a period of maximum six months. Consumer price movements will be monitored closely to avoid adverse effects.\n\n\nThe Commission aims to have these measures adopted by the end of April. Beforehand Member States will need to be consulted, and vote on these measures. They are therefore subject to change. The full detail of these proposals will be unveiled at the time of their final adoption.\n\nThe package announced today follows a comprehensive package of other measures adopted early on by the Commission to support the agri-food sector in the current crisis, such as increased amounts for state aid, higher advanced payments, and extended deadlines to submit payment requests. The increased flexibility regarding Common Agricultural Policy rules aims to alleviate the administrative burden on farmers and national administrations.\n\nFor more information\n\nSupporting the agriculture and food sectors amid coronavirus\n\nEU response amid coronavirus\n\nCommon Agricultural Policy's market measures\n\n","8743e0905419cedc21146eeecf7de1242aa6e650fc5600eee773e263a06bbd99":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission approved the first decisions under REACT-EU (Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe) involving a modification of four operational programmes for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the Netherlands and Austria that will increase the funding available for investments by nearly \u20ac262 million from REACT-EU. The Netherlands and Austria thus become the first EU countries to make use of REACT-EU.\n\nCommissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira said: \u201cThe resources under REACT-EU are of crucial importance for the recovery of the economy. I call on Member States to complete their internal procedures for the approval of the Own Resources Decision so that we can start borrowing. Meanwhile, we are working fast forward to approve the programming decisions for this funding. I encourage all Member States to move as quickly as possible with their submissions so that additional funding can start flowing for a green, digital and cohesive recovery.\u201d\n\nIn the Netherlands, the three amendments increase the EU co-financing rate and facilitate investments in the green and digital transition contributing to the resilience of the regional economy in North, East and South Netherlands. This is in accordance with the REACT-EU objectives and with the 2020 country specific recommendations.\n\n\tIn North Netherlands, the programme will support future-oriented investments in innovation, making companies more resilient and innovative. The investments will contribute to the societal transitions related to a circular economy, renewable energy, digitalisation and health.\n\tIn East Netherlands, the programme will support further development and the market introduction of innovative technologies and processes, as well as investments that reinforce the innovation eco-system. Areas for investment for the green transition will include, for example, sustainable energy, the circular economy and the sustainable use of materials. The programme will also support digitalisation in innovation projects, including in the health sector.\n\tIn South Netherlands, the programme will support innovation projects that contribute to a green, digital and robust recovery of the regional economy. The investments aim at bringing innovations to the market within five societal transitions: energy, raw materials, climate, agriculture and food, and health transition.\n\n\nIn Austria, the amendment of the ERDF Operational Programme for Growth and Jobs supports research and innovation capacities, provides investment support for enterprises (in which innovative, green and digital projects will have a high share), and sustains increasing the energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThese resources \u2013 part of NextGenerationEU \u2013 continue and extend the crisis response and repair measures delivered through the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative packages, acting as a bridge to the long-term recovery plan.

Measures will focus on supporting labour market resilience, jobs, SMEs and low-income families, as well as setting future-proof foundations for the green and digital transitions and a sustainable socio-economic recovery.\n\nThese additional resources should be used for projects that foster crisis repair capacities in the context of the coronavirus crisis, as well as investments in operations contributing to preparing a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy.\n\nREACT-EU entered into force on 24 December 2020 and can finance expenditure retroactively from 1 February 2020 until 31 December 2023.\n\nThe financial resources come from NextGenerationEU and are dependent on the completion of Member States' internal approval procedures of the Own Resources Decision, which will allow the Commission to start borrowing on the capital markets.\n\nFor More Information\n\nREACT-EU\n\nREACT-EU: Q&A\n\nNextGenerationEU\n\nCoronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII)\u00a0and\u00a0Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+)\n\n","8789590e16c075966b799c883040ad0dcbd96ccbae06a723142692d34f64d96a":null,"87a06aad750a75412fd790bef48973daa94bba6af23dea7c028b13f348ec22a3":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, the European Commission has signed a contract with the pharmaceutical company Gilead to secure treatment doses of Veklury, the brand name for Remdesivir. Veklury was the first medicine authorised at EU level for treatment of COVID-19. As from early August onwards, and in order to meet immediate needs, batches of Veklury will be made available to Member States and the UK, with the coordination and support of the Commission.\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cIn recent weeks, the Commission has been working tirelessly with Gilead to reach an agreement to ensure that stocks of the first treatment authorised against COVID-19 are delivered to the EU. A contract has been signed yesterday, less than a month after the authorisation of Remdesivir, which will allow the delivery of treatments from early August for thousands of patients. The Commission is leaving no stone unturned in its efforts to secure access to safe and efficient treatments, and is supporting the development of vaccines against coronavirus. Yesterday's agreement is another important step forward in our fight to overcome this disease\u201d.\n\nThe Commission's Emergency Support Instrument will finance the contract, worth a total of \u20ac63 million. This will ensure the treatment of approximately 30,000 patients presenting severe COVID-19 symptoms. This will help to cover the current needs over the next few months, while ensuring a fair distribution at EU level, based on an allocation key, taking into account the advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nThe Commission is now also preparing a joint procurement for further supplies of the medicine, expected to cover additional needs and supplies as from October onwards.\u00a0\n\nBackground\n\nOn 3 July, Remdesivir became the first treatment to be authorised for a conditional marketing authorisation. This authorisation facilitates early access to medicines in public health emergency situations, such as the current pandemic.\n\nRemdesivir is a treatment against COVID-19 for adults and adolescents as from age 12 with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen. The application for the marketing authorisation was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 8 June. EMA's recommendation was endorsed by the Member States through the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use.\n\nWhile authorised in the EU, the medicine continues to be monitored to ensure safety. Gilead has also been requested to submit the final reports of the Remdesivir studies to the EMA by December 2020 as part of the conditions to be fulfilled to move from a conditional marketing authorisation to a full marketing authorisation.

This package aims to address the immediate health and resulting humanitarian needs of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as help with the social and economic recovery.\n\nIn addition to the reinforced support, the Commission is in its contribution ahead of the EU-Western Balkans' leaders meeting of 6 May 2020 also outlining the broad parameters of longer-term support to be presented later this year in the form of an Economic and Investment Plan for the region.\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cWe have a special responsibility to assist in this pandemic our partners in the Western Balkans, as their future clearly lies in European Union. The EU is mobilising a substantial financial package, confirming the strong solidarity. Together we will overcome this crisis and recover. And beyond that, we will continue to support the region, including with the reforms needed on their EU path, as the recovery will only work effectively if the countries keep delivering on their commitments.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, commented: \u201cThe European Union acted quickly and comprehensively to support the Western Balkans in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, with unparalleled financial assistance as well as access to many of the EU's initiatives. And our work will continue as we prepare an Economic and Investment Plan for the region, to tackle the hard socio-economic impact of the crisis, to modernise the economies in the region, support the reforms and start closing the development gap, thus bringing concrete benefits to the people faster.\u201d \n\nEU support to the Western Balkans in tackling the coronavirus \n\nThe EU financial support package of more than \u20ac3.3 billion includes reallocations from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance of \u20ac38 million of immediate support for the health sector, in particular through delivering essential supplies to save lives, such as personal protective equipment, masks and ventilators; \u20ac389 million to address social and economic recovery needs and a \u20ac455 million economic reactivation package, in close cooperation with the International Financial Institutions. It also includes a proposal for \u20ac750 million of Macro-Financial Assistance and a \u20ac1.7 billion package of assistance from the European Investment Bank.\n\nThe EU is also providing immediate humanitarian assistance to vulnerable refugees and migrants amounting to \u20ac4.5 million and \u20ac8 million to address pressing needs in migrant camps across the region.\n\nAs a result of the coronavirus outbreak, the Western Balkans have also activated the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) and have already started to receive assistance through delivery of equipment and repatriation of citizens from the UCPM Member States and Participating States. Furthermore, given their European perspective, the EU is treating the Western Balkans as privileged partners by granting them access to many initiatives and instruments reserved for EU Member States. This includes for instance joint procurement of medical equipment, exempting the region from the EU's export authorisation scheme for personal protective equipment, ensuring the fast flow of essential goods across land borders through \u201cgreen lanes\u201d, and the EU supply of testing material to ensure the correct functioning of coronavirus tests in the Western Balkans. The region is also associated to the work of relevant health bodies.\n\nLooking ahead - an economic and investment plan for recovery \n\nThe Western Balkans will require continued support to address the impact of the pandemic once the immediate crisis is over. The European Commission will later in the year come forward with an Economic and Investment Plan for the region, to spur the long-term recovery, boost economic growth and support reforms required to move forward on the EU path.\n\nIt will also include a substantial investment package for the region. For the 2021-2027 period, the Commission has proposed a total envelope for the Pre-Accession Instrument III of \u20ac14.5 billion, of which the lion's share is destined for the Western Balkans. The Commission foresees a doubling in the provision of grants through the Western Balkans Investment Framework and substantially increasing the financial guarantees to support public and private investment in the region through a dedicated Guarantee Instrument under the Western Balkans Investment Framework.\n\nThe Green transition and the Digital transformation will play a central role in relaunching and modernising the economies of the Western Balkans. Investing in clean and digital technologies and capacities, together with a circular economy, will help create jobs and growth. Support will also be provided to improve the competitiveness of the economies of the Western Balkans, to better connect them within the region and with the EU, and to help make the Western Balkans fit for the digital age. A strong focus will be put on the transport and energy links, which are crucial for the economic development of the region and the EU alike.\n\nTackling fundamental reforms \n\nThe recovery from the current crisis will only work if the partners keep delivering on their reform commitments and produce tangible results in their implementation. This is also key to realising their European perspective. In addition to continued economic reforms, this requires a stronger focus on the rule of law, the functioning of democratic institutions and public administration.\n\nBackground\n\nEU heads of State and Government and those of the Western Balkans will gather on 6 May 2020 for an EU-Western Balkans' leaders meeting to tackle common challenges. Initially foreseen as a summit in Zagreb, the meeting will due to the COVID-19 pandemic now take place via videoconference. Today proposals are the Commission's contribution ahead of this meeting.\n\nThe EU's global response to the coronavirus pandemic follows a \u2018Team Europe' approach; combining resources from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Together with our partners, we are making sure that the substantial EU funding already allocated to the Western Balkans is targeted to help them address the impact of the pandemic.In parallel, some EU Member States are also providing bilateral support, whether financial or donations of supplies.\n\nFor More Information\n\nLink to Communication\n\nFactsheet on EU response to the coronavirus pandemic in the Western Balkans\n\nFactsheet EU Western-Balkans relations\n\nFactographs for partners: \n\nAlbania\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nKosovo\n\nMontenegro\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nSerbia\n\n","8923874e207809d4d111d564e198561913a24c8571cd5d902aa1ef5596d8359d":null,"8cd92392b95e6ebea2513148fdab74af2f76205e9b3ebfc4c483587522b260a7":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the European Commission has reached a first agreement with the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to purchase a potential vaccine against COVID-19 as well as to donate to lower and middle income countries or re-direct to other European countries.

Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will use existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. This includes an accelerated procedure for authorisation and flexibility in relation to labelling and packaging.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission would finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements.

It is envisaged that, once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission would have a contractual framework in place for the purchase of 300 million doses, on behalf of all EU Member States. The Commission continues intensive discussions with other vaccine manufacturers.\n\nPresident von der Leyen said: \u201cThe European Commission does all in its power to ensure that Europeans have rapid access to a vaccine that is safe and protects them from coronavirus. Today's step with\u00a0Sanofi-GSK is a first important cornerstone of a much broader European Vaccines Strategy. More will follow soon. We are in advanced discussions with several other companies. While we do not know today which vaccine will work best in the end, Europe is investing in a diversified portfolio of promising vaccines, based on various types of technologies. This increases our chances to obtain rapidly an effective remedy against the virus. A vaccine would be a truly global good. We are committed to help secure access also for more vulnerable countries to find their way out of this crisis.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cA safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is the surest exit strategy from the crisis. For that reason, we have been negotiating a united EU approach to secure doses of promising vaccine candidates in recent weeks. Today's announcement of the conclusion of exploratory talks with\u00a0Sanofi-GSK is the first important step in this direction, to provide equal access to the vaccine for our citizens.\u201d\n\nThe exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.\n\nThis is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0\n\nThe Commission is also ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world.\n\nBackground\n\nThe European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission would finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided would be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.\n\nSince the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen.\n\nSanofi-GSK's vaccine candidate is planning to seek marketing authorisation from EMA in June 2021, following Phase III clinical trials yielding the induction of a promising immune response.\n\nMore Information\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nEU Coronavirus Response\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Updated on 31\/07\/2020 at 19:00\n\n","935f5d6b5d9defdccd0932eb2281020965a980d6677b7110fb07e3c936b5591d":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission has adopted a proposal for a \u20ac3 billion macro-financial assistance (MFA) package to ten enlargement and neighbourhood partners to help them to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The proposal comes on top of the \u2018Team Europe' strategy, the EU's robust and targeted response to support partner countries' efforts in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. It represents an important demonstration of the EU's solidarity with these countries at a time of unprecedented crisis.\n\nThe proposal, following a preliminary assessment of financing needs, provides for the MFA funds to be distributed as follows: the Republic of Albania (\u20ac180 million), Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u20ac250 million), Georgia (\u20ac150 million), the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (\u20ac200 million), Kosovo (\u20ac100 million), the Republic of Moldova (\u20ac100 million), Montenegro (\u20ac60 million), the Republic of North Macedonia (\u20ac160 million), the Republic of Tunisia (\u20ac600 million) and Ukraine (\u20ac1.2 billion).\n\nValdis\u00a0Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People said: \u201cSupporting our neighbours is essential during this time of crisis to keep the entire region stable. As part of the EU's global response to the coronavirus pandemic, we need to help our neighbouring countries to cushion the worst of its economic impact. These \u2018crisis MFA programmes' will assist 10 countries in ensuring macro-economic stability and protecting their people and companies during the crisis.\u201d\n\nPaolo\u00a0Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201cEuropean solidarity must not stop at the borders of our Union. Because in this global crisis, we stand or fall together. Today the European Commission is taking a decisive step to help ten of our neighbours in their fight against the Coronavirus. I call on the European Parliament and the Council to swiftly agree this important package.\u201d\n\nThe MFA funds will be made available for 12 months in the form of loans on highly favourable terms to help these countries cover their immediate, urgent financing needs. Together with the International Monetary Fund's support, the funds can contribute to enhancing macroeconomic stability and creating space to allow resources to be allocated towards protecting citizens and mitigating the coronavirus pandemic's negative socio-economic consequences. This instrument also remains available for other eligible countries experiencing balance-of-payments difficulties.\n\nThe Commission's proposal is subject to adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Given the urgent need for this support, the Commission counts on the cooperation of the co-legislators to ensure swift adoption of the proposal.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the proposal, the Commission stands ready to disburse the first instalment as swiftly as possible after the adoption of the MFA decision and upon the agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding with each partner country. The second instalment could be disbursed in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in the first half of 2021, provided that the policy measures attached to it have been implemented in a timely manner.\n\nBackground\n\nTeam Europe\n\nThe EU's response follows a \u2018Team Europe' approach, aimed at saving lives by providing quick and targeted support to our partners to face this pandemic. It combines resources from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to support partner countries and address their short-term financing needs, as well as the longer-term structural impacts on societies and the economy. The overall figure of the \u2018Team Europe' package reaches more than \u20ac20 billion. The first Team Europe packages are already being implemented in the EU's immediate neighbourhood: the Western Balkans, in the East and to the South.\n\nThe EU, as global actor and major contributor to the international development system, promotes a coordinated multilateral response, in partnership with the United Nations, International Financial Institutions, as well as the G7 and the G20.\n\nMacro-Financial Assistance\n\nMFA is part of the EU's wider engagement with neighbouring and enlargement countries and is intended as an exceptional EU crisis response instrument. It is available to enlargement and EU neighbourhood countries experiencing severe balance-of-payments problems with policy conditionality. To benefit from an MFA, countries should meet certain political pre-conditions in terms of respect of democratic principles, human rights and rule of law. They should also benefit from an IMF financial assistance programme. In the implementation of the assistance, the Commission will ensure consistency with recent and ongoing MFA operations.\n\nIn addition to MFA, the EU supports the Neighbourhood and Western Balkans through several other instruments, including humanitarian aid, budget support, thematic programmes, technical assistance, blending facilities and guarantees from the European Fund for Sustainable Development to support investment in sectors most affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFor more information\n\nCommission proposal for \u20ac3 billion macro-financial assistance package\n\nCoronavirus: EU global response to fight the pandemic\n\nMacro-Financial Assistance\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Ukraine\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Moldova\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Georgia\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Tunisia\n\nEU macro-financial assistance operations to Jordan\n\n\u00a0\n\n","94c869c55d9fbe1f7be1c8f23c5f6955dc6bc28f9a7f34f7dfdd3f6c4e255e45":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Commission welcomes the adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the proposal to postpone by one year the date of application of the Medical Devices Regulation. This will allow all key players - Member States, health institutions and economic operators to give priority to the fight against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, forming a key position in the timing of the lifting of confinement measures as Member States return to the road of recovery.\n\nThe adopted amendment takes into consideration the need for an increased availability of vitally important medical devices across the EU, and at the same time continues to guarantee patient health and safety until the new legislation becomes applicable.\n\nVice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: \u201cI welcome the adoption in record time by the European Parliament and the Council of the proposal to postpone by one year the date of application of the Medical Devices Regulation. We are determined to have our medical industries pouring all their energy into what we need them to be doing: helping fight the pandemic. The European Union will do whatever it takes to support our health systems in their hour of need.\u201d\n\nStella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201cYesterday's adoption will allow us all, in this time of crisis, to maintain our focus on the most critical issues and to ensure the continued availability of vitally important medical devices. This is clear proof of our ongoing determination to tackle the pandemic through all possible means, while always maintaining the safety of patients as our utmost objective. I thank the Parliament and Council for the record time approval, cooperation and efficient handling of this urgent proposal.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus crisis increases demand for certain vital medical devices. It is therefore important to avoid any further difficulties or risks of potential shortages or delays in the availability of such devices that could be caused by the limited capacity of authorities or conformity assessment bodies related to the implementation of the Medical Devices Regulation.\n\nThe adopted amendment therefore postpones the application of the Medical Devices Regulation by one year - until 26 May 2021. The currently applicable rules will continue to guarantee patient health and safety.\n\nBackground \n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the public health crisis resulting from it is putting Member States, together with national authorities, health institutions and economic operators, under extreme pressure. These circumstances demand substantial additional resources, and the need for an increased availability of vitally important medical devices has considerably increased. At the time of adoption of the Medical Devices Regulation none of the above could have been foreseen.\n\nThe present situation strongly impacts upon the different areas covered by the Medical Devices Regulation. It is therefore highly probable that it would not have been possible for Member States, health institutions, economic operators and other relevant parties to implement and apply the Regulation from its foreseen date of application on 26 May 2020.\n\nIn order to ensure an effective regulatory framework for medical devices, the present amendment also postpones the date of repeal of the Directive on active implantable medical devices and the Directive on medical devices by one year.\n\nThe present adoption will not have impact on the date of application of the In Vitro Diagnostics Medical Devices Regulation, which becomes applicable from 26 May 2022.\n\nThe amendment of the Medical Devices Regulation complements other important measures in the area of medical devices, which the Commission continues to adopt in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Commission adopted the proposal on 3 April, and this was followed by the support of the European Parliament on 17 April. As a final step,\u00a0yesterday the Council has voted to adopt the proposal and it will enter into force upon publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nUseful links\n\nMedical devices\n\nDedicated Commission webpage on the EU's response to the COVID-19 outbreak\n\n","96713db6e8aac8af109385131c85a815f438cf12e016b592b4e20bd0e44d5df7":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe European Commission has unlocked \u20ac1 billion from the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) that will serve as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund (EIF), part of the European Investment Bank Group. This will allow the EIF to issue special guarantees to incentivise banks and other lenders to provide liquidity to at least 100,000 European SMEs and small mid-cap companies hit by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, for an estimated available financing of \u20ac8 billion. Today's announcement fulfils the commitment in the Commission Communication of 13 March to bring immediate relief to hard-hit SMEs, with money able to flow already in April. It is part of the package of measures announced by the EIB Group on 16 March designed to rapidly mobilise support for Europe's SMEs and mid-caps.\n\nOne of the immediate economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic is the sudden lack of liquidity affecting small and medium-sized businesses. These companies are typically the most affected in a crisis, and it is essential to support them with adequate liquidity so they can survive the crisis. However, in a situation of liquidity crunch banks are not incentivised to lend SMEs money due to the sudden increase in perceived risk. That is why EU guarantees supporting these loans are necessary. As of today, the EIF is offering to the market dedicated EFSI-backed guarantees to contain the impact of the pandemic on small and medium sized enterprises and small mid-cap companies.\n\nEuropean Commission Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People, Valdis Dombrovskis, said: \u201cAcross Europe, our businesses are struggling. The EU is responding quickly to help cushion the blow and to help small and medium-sized companies, which are especially vulnerable. Today, the Commission and the European Investment Fund are making available \u20ac8 billion in financing, bringing immediate cash relief to SMEs in Europe affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Money will be flowing already this month via local banks and lenders to help those most hard-hit by the crisis.\u201d\n\nEIF Chief Executive, Alain Godard said: \u201cIn times of unprecedented crisis it is essential that SMEs receive the support they need. The EIF is working intensively to ensure a swift and adequate response to the COVID-19 virus outbreak and we are pleased to be launching this new \u20ac8 billion initiative with the Commission today. While this is an important first step, the EIB Group will continue to work on finding additional solutions to quickly meet the financing needs of entrepreneurs across Europe.\u201d\n\nThe \u20ac1 billion unlocked from the EFSI under the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility and the InnovFin SME Guarantee under Horizon 2020 allows the EIF to provide guarantees worth \u20ac2.2 billion to financial intermediaries, unlocking \u20ac8 billion in available financing. The guarantees will be offered through the EIF to the market, via a call for expressions of interest\u00a0issued today to several hundred financial intermediaries, comprising banks and alternative lenders. Key features of these guarantees will be:\n\n\tSimplified and quicker access to the EIF guarantee\n\tA higher risk cover \u2013 up to 80% of potential losses on individual loans (as opposed to the standard 50%);\n\tFocus on working capital loans across the EU;\n\tAllowing for more flexible terms, including postponement, rescheduling or payment holidays\n\n\nThe new features will be accessible to new as well as existing financial intermediaries already working with EIF, who will extend special conditions to more than a hundred thousand companies benefitting from guarantees under the COSME LGF and the InnovFin SMEG programmes.\n\nNext steps\n\nFollowing today's call for expression of interest, financial intermediaries with existing EIF agreements under these COSME and InnovFin programmes will be able to access the new guarantees immediately upon their request. Other financial intermediaries can access the guarantees following a swift application process. In that way new money can already start flowing to hard-hit businesses in April. SMEs will be able to apply directly to their local banks and lenders participating in the scheme, which will be listed on www.access2finance.eu.\n\nThe Commission and the EIB Group will continue to work on additional measures and will use all the tools at their disposal to help contain the coronavirus pandemic and address its economic consequences.\n\nBackground\n\nTo unlock the \u20ac1 billion from the EU budget, the Commission and the EIB Group have made a series of amendments to their specific agreements.\n\nThe European Investment Fund (EIF) is part of the European Investment Bank group. Its central mission is to support Europe's micro, small and medium-sized businesses by helping them to access finance. EIF designs and develops both venture and growth capital, guarantees and microfinance instruments which specifically target this market segment. In this role, EIF fosters EU objectives in support of innovation, research and development, entrepreneurship, growth and employment.\n\nCOSME\u00a0is the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) running from 2014 to 2020 with a total budget of \u20ac2.3 billion. At least 60% of the programme is devoted to improving access to finance for SMEs in Europe, with two financial instruments. The COSME Loan Guarantee Facility supports guarantees and counter-guarantees to financial institutions to help them provide more loans and lease finance to SMEs. COSME Equity Facility for Growth helps provide risk capital to SMEs mainly in the expansion and growth stages.\n\nHorizon 2020 \u00a0is the EU programme for Research and Innovation running from 2014 to 2020 with a total budget of \u20ac77 billion. Under Horizon 2020, InnovFin \u2013 the EU Finance for Innovators \u2013 financial instruments aim to facilitate and accelerate access to finance for innovative businesses across Europe. In particular, the InnovFin SME Guarantee (SMEG) Facility provides guarantees and counter-guarantees on debt financing of between \u20ac25,000 and \u20ac7.5 million to improve access to finance for innovative SMEs and Midcaps. Under InnovFin SMEG, a facility managed by the EIF, financial intermediaries \u2013 banks and other financial institutions \u2013 are guaranteed against a proportion of their losses incurred on the debt financing covered under the facility.\n\nThe European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is the financing pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe, which was launched in November 2014 to reverse the downward trend in investment levels and put Europe on the path to economic recovery. Its innovative approach based on the use of an EU budget guarantee provided to the EIB Group enables substantial public and private sector funds to be mobilised for investment into strategic sectors of the European economy. The Investment Plan for Europe has already generated more than \u20ac460\u00a0billion of investment and supported 1.1 million start-ups and SMEs across Europe.
