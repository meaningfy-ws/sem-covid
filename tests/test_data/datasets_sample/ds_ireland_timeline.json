Certificate and Leaving Certificate Applied Oral Examinations, to provide for masks to be worn by candidates and interviewers during the examination interviews. Minister Foley said: \"It is important that both students and staff feel comfortable during the oral examinations interviews this year. In addition to very clear Public Health advice issued last week, the SEC has introduced a requirement for both interviewer and student to wear face masks during the entirety of the interview, except in cases where students are already exempted from wearing masks. \"I wish all students the very best as they continue to prepare for the oral examinations over the coming weeks.\" The public health measures to be put in place by schools hosting the examination interviews are detailed in guidance sent to schools, and include the use of social distancing, perspex screens, ventilation and cleaning and sanitation. The oral examinations will be held from Friday 26 March until Thursday 15 April. This year, as part of the public health measures being undertaken to hold the examinations safely, the oral examination interview is being organised by schools. This teacher will ask the questions and conduct the interview, but they will not mark candidates' performance. Instead, the examinations will be recorded on a recording device, and the recording will be submitted to the State Examinations Commission. It will then be marked by an external examiner. Examination interviews will follow the usual format for the subject.

The Council was established in September 2018 as part of the Government's Action Plan for Online Safety and brings together online safety experts from across academia, NGOs, industry, and government. The terms of reference and resulting work programme of the Council are designed to make the most of the experience and knowledge of its members. They include providing advice to government on online safety issues, identifying emerging online safety issues where the government may need to take action, inputting into the development of a wide range of online safety guidance materials, and reviewing national and international research. In 2019, the Council oversaw the commissioning of a large-scale research project to develop a strong evidence base and robust benchmark for online safety initiatives and future research. More recently, the Council has provided substantive feedback and input on the proposed Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, the general scheme of which was published on 10 January 2020. Speaking today, Minister of State Sean Canney, chairperson of the Council, stated: \"Recent events have shown us the benefits that the online world can have in our lives, keeping us connected and close even in the most difficult circumstances. However, in these hyper-connected times we are also more keenly aware of the challenges of the online world. Online safety is a priority for us all and the National Advisory Council for Online Safety has a key role to play in making the online world a safer place for our citizens, especially our most vulnerable.\" ENDS Background The establishment of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety is provided for by Action 20 of the Government's Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-2019, which represents a whole of Government approach to online safety. The Council, chaired by Minister of State Sean Canney, is a multi-stakeholder forum with a broad membership drawn from key stakeholder groups, including NGOs and industry. The Secretariat for the Council is provided by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.","4984925529a23037ce1dabc5e51e204ac6bde0c0102550d021e4e3d64084fa3a":"Today's cases The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has today been notified of 1 additional death related to COVID-19.

Minister Martin said \"the COVID-19 crisis has had a very severe impact on all areas of society, and it is particularly acute in our arts and tourism sectors. I look forward to working towards fulfilling the Government's commitment to assisting these sectors in particular as we plan our country's economic recovery.\" \"Having examined the Initial Report of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce , I met with the Taskforce yesterday, where I heard at first hand the impact that COVID-19 has had on this vital sector of the economy. As we emerge from the COVID-19 restrictions it is clear that the challenges facing the sector are without precedent and I look forward to the outcome of the Taskforce's deliberations and to working with the sector towards a sustainable recovery.\" She added: \"I am also aware of the challenges that exist for the National Governing Bodies of Sport and sports clubs as sports begin to return and I look forward to meeting the key stakeholders in the sector in the near future.\" The Minister also noted the report of the Expert Advisory Group to the Arts Council l which sets out a range of proposals to support the sector in the face of the challenges posed by the pandemic. \"I look forward to working with all the stakeholders to implement the full range of measures set out in the Programme for Government to address the needs of the arts sector at this time,\" she said. The Minister noted that our unique language and culture and sport are central to how we identify as a nation and that this in turn is at the heart of what attracts foreign and domestic tourists to holiday in Ireland. She added that she \"looks forward to forging stronger links between all of these elements to build a rich and rewarding cultural experience for our citizens and visitors alike\". The minister also underlined the importance of the media and the audio-visual sector in Ireland. She said: \"COVID-19, above all else, has shown us the critical importance of a vibrant and informed media, and particularly the importance of public sector broadcasting in both of our national languages. I know that this sector faces very specific challenges and I look forward to engaging strongly on this important area, which is a fundamental pillar of a modern and pluralistic democracy\". Minister Martin said that the Irish language and the Gaeltacht was of huge importance to the Government and to her personally, and that she is looking forward immensely to working closely with the Minister of State for the Gaeltacht, the Irish Language and Sport, Dara Calleary, to progress the broad remit of the department. Minister Calleary said: \"I was delighted to meet with Minister Martin and with officials from the Gaeltacht and Sport division today.\" In relation to the Gaeltacht and Gaeilge, Minister Calleary said, \"these are challenging times in all sectors of society, not least in our Gaeltacht areas, where the cancellation of this year's Summer Colleges will have a huge impact. I am aware of the challenges the language is facing, and of the need for the Government to take a proactive approach to promoting the language across the island, while protecting \"Tobar an Duchais\", those Gaeltacht communities for whom Irish is their principal community language. \"The commitments in relation to the language and the Gaeltacht contained in the Programme for Government have provided me with a strong mandate to bring forward important legislative and policy initiatives aimed at fulfilling my new role. I know Minister Martin has a keen interest in the Irish language and the Gaeltacht herself, and I look forward to working closely and productively with her in the department.\" In relation to sport, the Minister of State said: \"I look forward to doing what I can to ensure sporting events return safely for all. During the pandemic, it was clear that running, cycling and walking became increasingly popular as people wanted to mind their physical and mental health. We will build on this during my term in office to improve public health and wellbeing.

There are now more sick people in hospital than any time in the course of this pandemic. The risk that this disease poses to the individual who is infected has not changed. What has changed is that we are experiencing a much greater level of community transmission and as a result we are seeing higher numbers of people with severe illness who require hospitalisation or admission to intensive care and higher numbers of mortality. Please continue to stay at home and drive down this infection in our community.\" Dr. Ronan Glynn, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health said: \"Our survey data indicates that 60% report contacting older relatives and friends to ensure they are okay. Providing support and reassurance to older and more vulnerable members of society is an important part of our collective response to this pandemic. Our sense of community and support for each other must remain a key part of our armoury against COVID-19.\" Dr. Lorraine Nolan, Chief Executive, Health Products Regulatory Authority, said: \"Up to 11 January, the HPRA received a total of 81 reports of suspected side effects associated with the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine. All reports were generally consistent with those typically observed with other vaccines and included events of a mild to moderate nature which resolved or were resolving at the time of reporting. Among those most frequently reported were abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, joint pain and pains in the arms, some experience of dizziness, headache, itching and a rash all consistent with the known and anticipated side effects as emerged during the clinical trials. \"While the relatively mild effects described are of course uncomfortable for those who experience them, they do pass quickly and generally do not require any medical treatment. \"Safety monitoring of all medicines, including vaccines, is central to the remit of the HPRA and we intend to publish a regular update of the number and nature of reports regarding suspected side effects with COVID-19 vaccines, as the vaccination roll-out continues.\" Dr. Vida Hamilton, National Clinical Advisor and Group Lead, Acute Hospitals, HSE, said: \"We are now one week operating in critical surge capacity, the first time we have had to rely on this during the pandemic. Our staff escalation plan is in operation and we are very grateful for the non-critical care staff who are supporting the delivery of these critical services.

Today's data from HPSC, as of midnight, Monday 23nd March (1,146 cases), reveals: 55% are male and 45% are female, with 63 clusters involving 289 cases the median age of confirmed cases is 45 years 305 cases (26%) have been hospitalised of those hospitalised, 39 cases have been admitted to ICU 283 cases (24%) are associated with healthcare workers Dublin has the highest number of cases at 559, (57% of all cases) followed by Cork with 133 cases (11%) of those for whom transmission status is known: community transmission accounts for 49%, close contact accounts for 23%, travel abroad accounts for 28% Dr. Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health, said: \"Our data showed yesterday that only 6% of our tests so far returned positive; so for every 100 people we test we are only finding 6 people with COVID-19. In light of this, our case definition changed. \"Changing case definition is a standard practice in managing pandemics. Ultimately, we want our 6% detected rate to increase, we want to find as many people as possible with COVID-19, isolate them and contain the spread.\" Dr. Ronan Glynn, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health said: \"We are seeking to prioritise those who are to be tested with a focus in the short-term on those who are vulnerable and those who are at the highest risk to exposure.\" Dr. Colm Henry, Chief Clinical Officer, HSE said: \"There has been ongoing engagement with GPs over the past 24 hours. GPs are best placed to advise individuals with symptoms whether they need a test or not. Ultimately, the test has no impact on the clinical course of this disease and the priority for anyone with symptoms is to isolate themselves.\" Information is available on the HSE website or by calling the HSE helpline 1850 24 1850. The National Public Health Emergency Team will meet again on Thursday 26 March to review Ireland's ongoing preparedness and response to COVID-19.

Turnover of all GI companies for 2019 reached a record 1.23 billion, an increase of 20% on 2018. The SME sector accounted for 27% of turnover at 362 million; earnings from markets outside Ireland reached 496 million, an increase of 4% over 2018. The effects of Covid-19 are evident in the job numbers reported for the first six months of 2020 as only a modest net increase of 51 in jobs was noted. Job losses were most evident in consultancies and manufacturers unable to service overseas projects. While 50% of members availed of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme initially, only 5% are now availing of the scheme. The effects of public health restrictions due to Covid-19 on GI members were initially severe, but have lessened since mid-May as construction and infrastructure development activity have resumed across most markets. Sharp reductions in infrastructure development following the last recession are still affecting the economy and GI welcomes the commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain spending on essential infrastructure. It is also encouraging to note that EU and International Financial Instructions have also committed to significant infrastructure projects. The main inhibitor to recovery for GI members is the difficulty for personnel to travel to and from overseas destinations to provide project support and supervision. Another major concern for GI members is that infrastructure spending planned by the Government of Ireland will be reduced by Covid-19. Koen Verbruggen, Director of Geological Survey Ireland, commented: \"The continued growth and development of the Geoscience Ireland business cluster is very welcome and compares well with the data recently published by Enterprise Ireland which also showed exports by its client companies growing by 15% last year. Geoscience Ireland companies face the challenges of continued uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and Brexit. Geological Survey Ireland will continue to support the Geoscience Ireland initiative, in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation.\" For further information contact Sean Finlay, Geoscience Ireland, 087 2575017, ENDS Notes to the Editor Geoscience Ireland is a business cluster of 40 companies, delivering integrated expertise in water, minerals, environmental and infrastructure development to clients in over 75 countries. It was formed in 2012 and is supported by Geological Survey Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.

Important Projects of Common European Interest are large-scale, multi-country projects for global state-of-the-art innovation to solve market or systemic failures in particular sectors. Favourable State aid rules apply to IPCEI, allowing for the possibility of public-sector funding to be granted for certain projects that make an important contribution to the strategic objectives of the European Union. This call aims to identify businesses (including SMEs and\/or groups of businesses) and research organisations that are willing to participate in a project, within the scope of the upcoming Health IPCEI, with other European organisations. The primary focus of the Health IPCEI is expected to cover four main areas: the modernisation of production processes innovative products in new therapeutical areas personalised medicine and MedTech health crisis preparedness Speaking today, the Tanaiste said: \"The pandemic has highlighted the need to accelerate medical research, to build up Europe's production capacity to allow us cope with a sudden increase in demand if and when it's needed, and to push for better coordination between countries. \"Ireland is a global leader for medical device products, with over 300 MedTech companies based here, and we have a significant track record of clinical and academic research excellence in biopharma. We are well placed to play an active role in this IPCEI. \"This call is a great opportunity for cross country collaboration, for research and development into new therapeutics and personalised treatments, and, of course to look at new ways to help us prepare for future health crises, including vaccine development and research into fighting emerging infectious diseases. Successful projects will bring investment and create jobs. I encourage any organisation interested to seek more information from our website enterprise.gov.ie and apply.\" The Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly TD said: \"Over the last 18 months, COVID-19 has taught us the high cost that novel infectious diseases can inflict on the health and wellbeing of our societies. We are working closely with our EU partners on a range of initiatives to better protect the health of our citizens and to prepare for future pandemics. \"This call offers the opportunity for Irish businesses and researchers to join counterparts across the EU to address some of the biggest challenges we face. Beyond improved crisis preparedness, projects may also focus on developing the enormous potential of innovation in new therapeutics and personalised medicine.\" Further details, including the proposal template, the scope of the IPCEI, and the criteria proposal must address can be found on the department's website: Call for Expressions of Interest - Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on Health The call will close at 12 noon on Friday, 8 October 2021. Notes What an IPCEI is Important Projects of Common European Interest are large-scale, multi-country projects for global state-of-the-art innovation to address market or systemic failures in particular sectors. Favourable State aid rules apply to IPCEI and this framework allows for the possibility of public-sector funding to be granted at national level for certain projects that make an important contribution to the growth and competitiveness of the European industrial sector and to the strategic objectives of the European Union. This type of pan-European industrial policy has already been shown to be successful through the two existing IPCEIs on battery cell production and microelectronics. The notion of \"Important Projects of Common European Interest\" is laid down in Art. 107(3)(b) TFEU as part of the State aid rules, describing a type of aid that can be compatible with the internal market; but was in the past rarely used (for example, for some collaborative R&D programmes and some infrastructure projects). In 2014, the Commission revisited this clause by adopting a dedicated Communication laying out the conditions for its application. This Communication is set to be reviewed again in Q1 2021. IPCEI are about disruptive and ambitious research and innovation, beyond the state-of-the-art innovation in the sector followed by first industrial deployment, where very important RD&I is still necessary (for example, to scale up a pilot line). The IPCEI provide knowledge, expertise, financial resources, and economic actors throughout the EU in order to overcome important market or systemic gaps and societal challenges that could not be addressed otherwise. IPCEI must contribute to EU objectives and have a significant impact on economic growth, sustainability, or value creation across the EU. An IPCEI involves more than one MS and should have positive spillover effects on internal market\/Union society with the benefits not limited to participating Member States and companies. In case of RD&I, projects must be of a major innovative nature or of important added value in the light of the state of the art in the sector. First industrial deployment is covered where it allows for the development of a new product with high RD&I content or of a fundamentally innovative production process is being developed. By their nature, IPCEI often entail significant risks and require joint, well-coordinated efforts and transnational investments by public authorities and industries from several Member States. IPCEI also include actions by beneficiaries to generate positive spill-over effects beyond their business as usual, throughout the EU, based on the knowledge and results they generate from participation in the IPCEI. Currently, there are two batteries IPCEI and a microelectronics IPCEI in progress. Several other IPCEI are in development in Hydrogen, Cloud Infrastructure and Services (IPCEI-CIS), and for Microelectronics and Communications Technologies (Microelectronics IPCEI2) and this proposed Health IPCEI. New IPCEI have also been proposed in the areas of Proteins for Animal Feed and Raw Materials. Health sector in Ireland Ireland's MedTech sector has become one of the leading clusters for medical device products globally with over 300 MedTech companies and nine of the top ten global MedTech companies based here. Exports of medical devices and diagnostic products represent 8% of Ireland's total merchandise exports and Ireland is the second largest exporter of MedTech products in Europe. Ireland boasts five clinical research facilities, which support patient-focused research and we are ranked number one globally for the exchange of technology and ideas. Over 70% of MedTech companies in Ireland are engaged in R&I. On the biopharma side, over 85 pharmaceutical companies operate in Ireland, with 9 of the world's top pharma companies based here. Ireland has a significant track record of clinical and academic research excellence in this area with around 2 billion is invested annually in Biopharma R&D by IDA client companies.","3a4f5eb576aaec2eb1001605d2b56b7df504b18be66637cbc0ccadb8c579d875":"1.

The programmes have been developed by SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards in consultation with the Irish Hotels Federation and Failte Ireland. One programme is to develop team leaders and the second to develop supervisory management capability. Both programmes are aimed at assisting recovery and growth in the hospitality and tourism sector. As a major employer in Ireland, the hospitality and tourism sector have identified the need to retain key talent and develop leadership capability to rejuvenate businesses for recovery and growth. Speaking today, Minister Harris said: \"COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on our economy and the hospitality sector has been badly impacted. \"The sector has temporarily had to close and I want to ensure we use this time to support the sector in preparing for when they can resume business. The hospitality and tourism sectors are vital to the Irish economy and we must support it to recover and grow.\" The Developing Leaders for Hospitality and Tourism programmes will upskill team leaders and supervisory staff in critical areas including finance and people management. Employees will be trained in customer care, digital skills, communications, strategic planning and management and will learn green and sustainability skills. The upskilling opportunities will be rolled out across the country in each Education and Training Boards from March. The first has begun in Limerick with 30 people participating. Minister of State for Skills, Niall Collins, said: \"This is a really exciting opportunity for people who have temporarily lost their jobs to learn new skills and prepare for the return of their sectors. \"We need our tourism and hospitality sectors to be ready for the challenges post-COVID and to ensure they can remain sustainable in the future.\" Commenting on the collaboration, Elaina Fitzgerald Kane, President at the IHF said: \"I would like to commend SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards throughout the country for this Skills to Advance initiative. It is a very opportune time for increased cooperation between hotels and ETBs to deliver training and upskilling support to their teams during these challenging times. \"Our primary goals are to protect and restore livelihoods in our hotel, guesthouse and broader tourism community across the country. These two hospitality training programmes are very relevant and support the development of the leadership and management skillsets required to recover and grow tourism in Ireland sustainably. My industry colleagues and I look forward to collaborating and working in partnership on this very welcome and timely initiative.\" Welcoming the launch of the new programmes, Andrew Brownlee, CEO SOLAS said: \"The Further Education and Training Sector is committed to upskilling and reskilling employees across all industries particularly those who are facing challenges or undergoing changes. These programmes are coming on stream at a time of unprecedented challenges for the Hospitality and Tourism sector and are designed in response to their needs. The excellent collaboration between the FET sector and industry bodies has meant that these programmes were developed in a short time period and with specific industry needs in mind.

I am putting this reduced rate in place until December 2021 in order to provide significant additional support to businesses throughout 2021 when hopefully our economy and society can start to return to some form of normality. \"This measure represents targeted, timely and temporary support to those areas of the economy most deeply impacted by the public health restrictions. Based on 2017 figures of the number of VAT traders in 9% sectors, the measure has the potential to benefit approximately 14,600 businesses. When we look specific sectors most seriously impacted by the pandemic and the health restrictions, employment in the accommodation and food services sector fell from 181,000 in Q2 2019 to 128,000 in Q2 2020. However, there were approximately 122,000 workers in this sector claiming the PUP in June. While PUP claims decreased from 122,000 to 90,000 by mid-October, the impact of the pandemic remains considerable. \"The introduction of a 9% VAT Rate for the tourism and hospitality sectors alongside other measures such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme forms an important part of the Government's economic response to the pandemic.\" Editor Notes With effect from 1 November 2020, Hospitality and Tourism related services and goods currently applying at the Reduced Rate of 13.5%, will be reduced, on a temporary basis, to the second reduced VAT rate of 9%. This includes catering and restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks, certain printed matter, and hairdressing. This change will apply from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021. This measure will cost the Exchequer 336 million in 2021 and 401 million in total.","2d77583f21889dc357f6cf4d44cfcd2db9faf140610b872582b1a461d8816247":"The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has today been notified of 1,703 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

The National Drug Treatment Reporting System has shown an overall increase of 1,658 or 18% in the number of treated cases recorded between 2013 and 2019. These figures highlight the levels of increased demand for drug treatment services nationwide. Between 2018 and 2019 there was an increase of 3.8% or 390 cases in the number of cases presenting for treatment. Opioids continue to be the most commonly reported main problem drug at 39%, followed by cocaine and cannabis at 24% and 23.5% per cent respectively. In looking at the patterns and trends in treatment cases since 2013, it is clear that opioid use has decreased from 51% of cases treated in 2013 to 39% of cases treated in 2019. The increase in cocaine use stands out. It has increased from 8% of cases in 2013 to 24% of cases in 2019. The Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy Frank Feighan, said: \"I welcome this data which has been released today by the HRB as it clearly illuminates a worrying development in relation to the continuing rise of cocaine use and crack cocaine use in Ireland. \"The HRB data also highlights significant decreases in opioid use and just how well drug treatment services nationwide have responded to the increased demand. The investment in treatment services over the last number of years under Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery has enabled us to increase the capacity to meet the extra treatment demand.\" The HRB plays an important role in supporting high quality monitoring, evaluation and research to ensure policies and practices are evidence informed. Their research contributed to the development in 2019 of the 750,000 multiannual investment plan under the National Drugs Strategy for 14 strategic health initiatives. These initiatives will strengthen the implementation of the Strategy, where the focus is on early harm reduction, responding to emerging trends and patterns of substance misuse, improving access to services for people with complex needs. The Department of Health works with the HSE to raise awareness of the dangers associated with drugs through the Drugs.ie website. In 2019, the HSE developed and promoted two national campaigns aimed at students and the festival goers, who may not present at traditional addiction services. Earlier this year, in recognition of the increased risks posed to drug users during COVID-19 the Department of Health and the HSE developed two 'Harm Reduction Posters' directed at those with substance abuse issues and those with alcohol related problems respectively. The key harm reduction messages in the posters are person centred and offer simple advice and suggestions in line with the person centred approach of the National Drugs Strategy, Healthy Ireland and Slaintecare. The Department of Health, as part of the introduction of the Health Diversion Programme, is providing 100,000 in 2020 to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use. This will include the use of club drugs, festival drug use and new trends. Minister Feighan added: \"As Minister with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, I believe that addressing the drug problem in Ireland requires a multi-pronged approach; providing targeted harm-reduction and prevention initiatives in tandem with treatment services. I would strongly encourage people with substance abuse issues to contact the HSE's Drug and Alcohol Helpline which is available on 1800 459 459 from Monday to Friday, 9.30am to 5.30pm.\" ENDS Notes to the Editor: Health related expenditure on drug services increased over the last 4 years from 121 million to 130 million enabling an expansion in addiction treatment services around the country. In 2019 additional funding of 1 million was secured on a recurring basis for the implementation of Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery. 750,00 of this funding has been allocated to 14 strategic health initiatives to strengthen the implementation of the strategy. Each strategic health initiative will receive 190,000 in total funding over a three year period. These new health initiatives reflect regional priorities agreed between the HSE Community Health Organisations (CHOs) and the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces and ensure that resources are targeted at groups most in need. The episodes of treatment captured in the NDTRS for 2019 include a very wide range of interventions and settings from services in the community to specialist residential units. A key goal of the National Drugs Strategy Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery is the development of sound and comprehensive evidence informed policies and actions. The HRB plays an important role in supporting high quality monitoring evaluation and research to ensure policies and practices are evidence informed. The Department of Health works with the HSE to raise awareness of the dangers associated with drugs through the Drugs.ie website. In 2019, the HSE developed and promoted two national campaigns aimed at students and the festival goers, who may not present at traditional addiction services. Next year, the HSE will commence a targeted national campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use and recommend steps on how people can reduce the harms. This work will include information about club drugs, festival drug use, newer drugs, as well as cannabis.

While all of our hard work is certainly paying off, we are seeing downward trends, the number of hospitalisations is stabilising and the positivity rate is decreasing, but cases remain high \u2013 this week\u2019s daily rates have been on a par with those seen last April.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the last few days we have seen case numbers in excess of 800 a day. It is worth remembering that per thousand cases you can expect somewhere between 35-50 people will need to be hospitalised, between 4-6 people will be admitted to ICU and most tragically, somewhere between 10-15 people will lose their lives. That is still a lot of people going to hospital, it is still a lot of people ending up in ICU, and it is still, most tragically, a lot of people dying of COVID-19.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Numbers in hospital are still more than double seen at the peak of the October wave and numbers in ICU are still at 158 yesterday. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The message that I want to emphasise is that we cannot let our guard down. The virus, and especially the new variant, which is now dominant here, spreads more easily than that which was circulating earlier in the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The best way to protect ourselves from either getting the virus or passing it on to someone else is to stick with our own households and avoid meeting people outside of this. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Visits to others homes or a return to the office for those who can work from home are still off the agenda for now.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minimising our contacts outside of our own households in every way we can will buy us time to keep the virus suppressed while giving a chance to more vulnerable people to get their vaccines.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Mobility\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thankfully, an improvement in weather means exercising outside is more attractive. We should take every chance to exercise \u2013 it\u2019s good for both our physical and mental health but please stick within your 5km from home and keep that 2m distance from others. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        With more people moving around the same 5km radius, it may get crowded \u2013 if it is crowded, consider changing the time you exercise. Try a different place or route that might be less crowded. If you are out and it is crowded, wear a face covering. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It\u2019s evident that people are beginning to move around again \u2013 we have seen a slight increase in the last week in traffic volumes which are up around 2%, retail and recreation numbers are up 7% and workplaces up nearly 3%. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So far, people have been incredibly compliant with what we are asking you to do but we need to be patient a little longer.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Staying at home is as important as ever. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Workplaces\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        You should only be in work if you are an essential worker and have to be in the workplace. If that is the case it is vital to keep your guard up. Follow the guidance during work, remember that this includes breaktime \u2013 avoiding congregating over coffee and if you are with colleagues \u2013 stay two metres apart and wear a mask when you are not eating or drinking. If you can avoid travelling to and from work with colleagues you should do so and if you do, wear and mask and keep the windows open.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Most importantly, if you have any symptoms \u2013 isolate, and stay at home, contact your GP to get a test as soon as possible. Similarly, if you are a close contact, stay at home and come forward for a test.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Shop safely\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        While visits to supermarkets are essential, it is important that retailers and customers remember to stick to all of the measures that have served us so well through the pandemic. Mask wearing, keeping physical distance, using the hand sanitiser, avoiding crowds - all apply in the shops and supermarkets. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If you own or manage a supermarket or shop remember to keep a close watch on the capacity of your store to minimise the numbers inside at any one time \u2013 ensure staff are wearing face coverings and wearing them correctly. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Face coverings \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Masks continue to be an important tool to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19. We have heard reports that we should now be double masking or wearing medical grade face coverings. Intuitively the more layers you have the better, but ultimately if you\u2019re not wearing the mask properly, you\u2019re not protecting yourself to any better extent. While double masking is certainly not discouraged, it is more important to wear a mask correctly and that it fits correctly. This means wearing your mask so that it covers your mouth and your nose snugly and there are no gaps. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Remember:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tdo not touch a mask or face covering while wearing it - if you do, clean your hands properly\n\tdo not use a damp or wet medical mask or reuse a medical mask\n\tobviously, do not share masks\n\tdon\u2019t lower your mask to speak, eat and smoke or vape - if you need to uncover your nose or mouth, take the mask off and put it in a bag for used masks\n\tdon\u2019t discard masks in public places\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There is lots of information on correctly wearing and disposing of masks go to gov.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The basics\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        We must keep the virus suppressed as the vaccines are rolled out in our community. New variants continue to be a cause for concern and we must not forget that this virus has not gone away. It will feed on our complacency so we have to stick with the habits we have learned over the last year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Announcements\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Today we here in the Department of the Taoiseach have launched a new collaboration with the ESRI\u2019s Behavioural Research Unit called The Social Activity Measure, otherwise known as SAM. It is a behavioural study that records the public response to the risk of COVID-19 infection over time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        SAM is an anonymous, interactive, online study that surveys people about their recent activity. The study offers insight into where and how risks of transmission arise and will inform policy and communications regarding the opening of parts of the economy and society, while keeping COVID-19 under control.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The study will collect data from 1,000 respondents every two weeks. As well as informing policy and communications decisions relating to the government\u2019s response to COVID-19, the results from the research will be published on gov.ie.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Results from the first wave will be published this week. Initial findings indicate that the vast majority of us are keeping our contacts low, but there are still some people with a lot of discretionary contacts. Interestingly, some of those people think they are doing better that most people in complying. They are not. If you are one of these people and you think what you are doing is the \u201cnorm\u201d, maybe think again. We might be tempted to let our guard down and visit or meet someone you haven\u2019t seen in a while. We should take heart from the fact that this initial data would suggest that most people are keeping their contacts very low and if this continues, we will continue to suppress the virus. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We will keep you informed with further insights from SAM over the coming weeks.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Updates - Supports\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are currently 48,500 employers registered with Revenue for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. To date, a total of over \u20ac1.9 billion in subsidies has been paid to 46,700 employers. An additional \u20ac335 million in employer PRSI has been forgone due to the reduced rate of PRSI on wages paid which are eligible for EWSS.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Covid Restrictions Support Scheme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition, to date 20,100 businesses have registered for the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme with Revenue. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Pandemic Unemployment Payment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This week, the Department of Social Protection has issued weekly payments to approximately 477,700 people in receipt of Pandemic Unemployment Payment. This payment is valued at \u20ac143.3 million and marks a decrease of 3,666 on the number paid last week.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is the first time the numbers on the register have decreased since the introduction of the Level 5 restrictions in December. To date, around \u20ac5.9 billion has been paid out in total since March 2020.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These figures are in addition to the 188,543 people who were on the Live Register at the end of January. Since the last payment, almost 12,900 people closed their PUP claim, with approximately 10,200 of these stating that they were doing so because they are returning to work. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The quickest way to make a claim for PUP or to close a claim is to do so online and to log on www.MyWelfare.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Enhanced Illness Benefit Payment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I mentioned it last week but I really want to emphasise the importance of self-isolating or restricting your movements if you are asked to.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The government have tried ensure people are not concerned about a loss of income if they do so. When a worker is told to self-isolate or restrict movements by a doctor or the HSE due to being a probable source of infection or having been diagnosed with COVID-19, they can apply for an Enhanced Illness Benefit payment of \u20ac350 per week. To be eligible for this payment, a person must be confined to their home or a medical facility. Unlike the general Illness Benefit, there are no waiting days attached to this payment, it is paid from day one of illness or self-isolation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is not necessary for a person with symptoms to leave their home to get a medical certificate from their doctor as all of the application process can be completed online via www.MyWelfare.ie.\n This week, approximately 4,700 people have been medically certified for receipt of this benefit.

This represents a fall of 25,526 compared to last week. The overall PUP figures have now fallen by almost 500,000 since numbers on the payment peaked at over 600,000 in May 2020. The greatest reduction this week is in the Accommodation and Food Services sector. The PUP figures published this week are in addition to the 179,761 people who were on the Live Register at the end of August. All COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payments have been paid into recipients' bank accounts or at their post office this week. Commenting today, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said: \"Throughout the summer months, we have seen a continuous steady decrease in the number of people relying on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. \"The number of people in receipt of the PUP has now fallen by almost 500,000 since the peak in mid 2020. \"The economy is now substantially reopened and it is really encouraging to see businesses actively advertising for and hiring new staff. Through the government's Pathways to Work strategy we want to support people through training, further education and reskilling opportunities to give them the tools and most importantly the confidence to get back to work.\" The Minister continued: \"The Pandemic Unemployment Payment has proven to be one of the most important supports in our country's history. \"In fact, since the introduction of the PUP in March 2020, almost one million people have been supported under the scheme at one stage or another. \"The PUP was always a temporary emergency support and as the emergency phase of the pandemic has now passed, it is the right time to start the process of winding the payment down. \"The tapering of the PUP is happening in a gradual, phased manner between now and next February recognising the fact that some sectors of our economy are getting back to normal at a slower rate than others. \"It's important that businesses continue to avail of the supports available through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme in order to help them rehire staff. \"In particular I would encourage those working in the music and entertainment industry to utilise the Music and Entertainment Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) which remains opens for applications. I know that the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland (MEAI) are doing a lot of work to promote this particular support and I would strongly encourage people to make an application to ensure they don't miss out.\" The payment week for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment runs from Friday to Thursday and payments are paid on the following Tuesday. Individuals who have closed their PUP by Monday 13 September, as they have returned to work, will receive their final PUP payment on Tuesday 21 September. People returning to work The department continues to remind workers who are returning to work that they must close their claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment on the actual date that they start back at work, in order to ensure that their claim is processed correctly and to avoid incurring an overpayment that the department will take steps to recover. As PUP is paid weekly in arrears people who have closed their claim last week are receiving a final payment this week and are still counted in the numbers in payment for this week. The easiest way to close a claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is online via www.MyWelfare.ie. Any worker returning to work with an enquiry about closing their claim can contact the department's dedicated Income Support Helpline at 1890 800 024 between 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday. Transition of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) In line with the government's Economic Recovery Plan, the PUP is gradually being reduced on a tapered basis over a 6 month period from September 2021 until February 2022 to align it with the standard jobseekers payments. Students Almost 20,000 students who had been receiving the PUP and advised the department that they are or will be full-time students in the upcoming 2021\/2022 academic year received their final payment last week on Tuesday 7 September. Changes to PUP Rates The maximum weekly rate of 350 is now reduced to 300. The 300 rate is reduced to 250 and the rate of 250 has reduced to 203. These new payment rates were reflected in the payments received yesterday, Tuesday 14 September. The process of moving from the lower 203 rate of PUP to a jobseeker's payment was due to begin in early September. This has now been deferred until after all sectors have started to reopen in line with the Roadmap announced on Tuesday 31 August and all affected customers will continue to receive their PUP payment until 26 October when the process of their transition to a jobseeker's payment will begin. Work on the transition process will commence at the end of September when the department will write to all affected customers to outline the options available to them. Two further phases of rate changes are scheduled to take place from 16 November 2021 and 8 February 2022. As PUP recipients go on to the 203 rate in each phase, they will be transitioned to standard jobseeker terms. Control Measures The department conducts a series of pre and post payment checks on all PUP claims which include continuing eligibility checks. Subject to these checks being cleared the department then processes payments based on the clients' self-declaration. The department runs post payment checks that includes verifying data against Revenue records, examining cases where the same bank account is used multiple times, examining cases where an employer or members of the public report concerns, and the use of data analytics to identify and check claims. It also undertakes employer inspections. This work is undertaken by the department's Special Investigation Unit, which includes over 20 Gardai on secondment to the department. As business reopens the department's inspectors continue to conduct control reviews and matching records against employer payroll data from the Revenue Commissioners to help ensure people close their claim as they return to work. To avoid incurring an overpayment people returning to work should close their claim and can do so easily at www.MyWelfare.ie. Self-employed people and PUP Self-employed people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment who are looking to maintain their business can earn up to 960 over an eight-week period, while retaining their full PUP entitlement. There is no formal application process and a self-employed person simply needs to inform the department if they earn over 960 in any eight-week period. The 1,000 Enterprise Support Grant will remain in place for the rest of the year for self-employed people who close their PUP payment. Those who claimed the grant in 2020 but who found themselves back on PUP in 2021, will be able to access the grant for a second time.

International Travel 2. Supports 3. Notes The government has today agreed that the current public health restrictions will remain in place until 5 March 2021. While we have seen a welcome decrease in the numbers of cases in recent days, the overall numbers and, significantly, the numbers in hospital and ICU with COVID-19 are at their highest since the start of the pandemic. For this reason, we must continue efforts to get the virus under control by limiting congregation, mobility and social contacts as much as possible. Maintaining Level 5 restrictions will place continued demands on society and business, however, it is essential that we continue to hold firm and reduce the cases in order to protect the vulnerable, protect our health care services (including maintaining non-COVID healthcare) and reopen schools at the earliest opportunity. The Minister for Education will continue to work with stakeholders to agree a plan for a phased return to in-school provision, commencing with children with special educational needs. International Travel Noting that non-essential international travel is a breach to Level 5 rules, the government has agreed to introduce a number of measures aimed at reducing the risk it poses, including: 1. An increase to the fixed penalty for breach of the rules relating to international travel. 2. Increased Garda checks and enforcement activity relating to people travelling internationally who are in breach of Level 5 rules. 3. The existing regulations requiring pre-departure PCR tests will be extended to 5 March. 4. A range of mandatory quarantine measures will be introduced, applying to all international arrivals: mandatory quarantine at a designated facility will be required for passengers who arrive in breach of the pre-departure negative\/'not detected' PCR requirement mandatory quarantine at a designated facility will be required for persons who arrive from Brazil and South Africa in other cases, passengers will be required by law to quarantine at home Application of these measures to passengers who are not EU\/EEA citizens can be introduced by regulations. For all other passengers, it will be necessary to amend primary legislation. The detailed legislative work to implement this will get under way immediately. 5. Restriction of travel from South Africa, Brazil and other South American countries, including suspension of visa-free short-term visits, until 5 March. Supports It is fully recognised that these further restrictions will be very difficult for people. Payments available under both the Employment Wage Support Scheme (EWSS) and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will continue to be maintained. This will ensure continued support for both employers and workers who lose their jobs due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, the government continues to make available a wide range of supports for businesses. Payments remain available at current levels under both the Enterprise Wage Support Scheme (EWSS) and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). This ensures continued support for both employers and workers who lose their jobs due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions. Under the EWSS, which provides a subsidy to qualifying employers to offset payroll costs, a payment of up to 350 per week will continue to be available. This enhanced payment level will remain in place until the 31 March. Similarly, the PUP, available to those who have lost their jobs, including the self-employed, as a result of COVID-19, will continue to be made available at the current pay-related level of up to 350 a week until 31 March.

The extra week which will be provided for by way of an amendment to Section 11 of the Finance Bill, will be paid to businesses the week after the restrictions are lifted as a further support to businesses on reopening. This is designed to take account of the fact that businesses may take some time and incur additional cost as they re-open once the restrictions are lifted. The additional week is payable if the restrictions are in place for 3 weeks or more and can be claimed at the end of the restriction period. The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. A two-step process is necessary to make a claim under the CRSS. The qualifying person must first register for CRSS on Revenue Online Service' (ROS) and then complete a claim in respect of a claim period or claim periods. Revenue have been accepting registrations for the scheme since 1 November, and the claims process is open since 17th November with over 45.5million in payments already issued. The details of the scheme have been published in Finance Bill 2020 and the key features of the scheme are: CRSS is designed to assist those businesses, who as a direct result of the restrictions as set out in the Government's 'Living with Covid-19' Plan, have been forced to temporarily close or been significantly impacted in operating from their premises; The scheme will generally operate when Level 3 or higher is in place and will cease when restrictions are lifted; The scheme will apply to businesses where Government restrictions prohibit or reduce access by customers to their business premises; Qualifying businesses can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a cash payment in respect of an advance credit for trading expenses for the period of the restrictions; To qualify under the scheme, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made; The scheme will operate from 13 October 2020 to 31 March 2021 and there is provision for the Minister for Finance to vary aspects of the scheme by Ministerial Order. Revenue have published an overview of the scheme with some detailed examples, together with guidance on the operation of the scheme on www.revenue.ie. The Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe said: 'I am confident that the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme will provide much needed support to businesses that have had to close as a result of the restrictions necessary to address the spread of the Covid 19 virus. As we anticipate changes to the restrictions in the coming period, there will be an extra payment available to those businesses who can reopen to help with these expected and associated costs. This may be claimed through the Revenue Online System as was the case with the CRSS claims'. \"The additional week is payable if the restrictions are in place for three weeks or more and can be claimed at the end of the restriction period. We understand the difficulties businesses and individuals are facing and the Government remains committed to timely and targeted supports. The CRSS is just one part of the Government's supports, which also include the wage subsidy schemes and temporary reduction in the VAT rate. Specific sectoral schemes are also being rolled out which will support many businesses who may not qualify for CRSS. \"The scheme came into effect from Budget day 13th October and the scheme will be implemented by the Revenue Commissioners. Revenue has been accepting registrations for the scheme since 1 November, and the claims process has been open since 17th November with over 45.5million in payments already issued. Claims can still be submitted to cover the period covering the current period of restrictions (to 1 December) until December 8th. \"I'm encouraging all eligible businesses to register with Revenue on ROS for the scheme so that they can participate in the scheme with payments issuing in 2-3 days following receipt of a valid claim. This will provide much needed funds to assist businesses in getting the doors back open so that they can do what they do best and begin trading again.\" ENDS","a42001e213e38fc58636b9231f541561a75815b8e993f3a706fdcfe0acc378e3":"The Minister for Education Norma Foley TD today announced the appointment of Ms. Arlene Forster as the Chief Executive Officer of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) for a five-year term.

Pandemic Unemployment Payment PUP was introduced on a temporary basis in March 2020 as an unprecedented response recognising the unique circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic. The payment has continued to support many people in cushioning the financial impact of Covid-19 with over 865,000 people having received at least one payment. With the re-opening of businesses and more jobs becoming available the requirement for exceptional measures is diminishing. The experience of recent weeks is that over 170,000 people have returned to work since the 2021 peak in the PUP register in February. Last year 400,000 people closed their PUP claim over the summer months. Minister Humphreys commented: \"As Minister for Social Protection, my focus over the past 12 months has been ensuring that we protect our citizens who lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. \"The Pandemic Unemployment Payment has proven to be a critical support for people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. \"To date, we've spent almost 8 billion on the PUP, ensuring that families who found themselves in really difficult situations were protected when they needed support the most. \"Over 24 million payments have been issued and over 865,000 people have received support under the scheme.\" To allow as much time as possible for employment to recover, a transitional approach will be taken with payments reduced on a tapered basis over 6 months from next September so that people are not faced with a 'cliff-edge' reduction. PUP will be extended beyond 30th June 2021 until February 2022 for existing claimants. This is to allow the impact of the lifting of restrictions to take hold and for further sectors to re-open. PUP will close to new entrants from 1st July 2021 onwards. At that stage as the vaccination rollout continues and with restrictions being progressively lifted there should be no additional layoffs due to the imposition of further restrictions. Payments to Students will cease once they return to full time education the last payment will be made on 7th September. Ordinarily, students do not qualify for jobseeker supports. The current rates of payment above the rate of 203 will remain in place until 7th September at which point they will begin to be gradually reduced on a phased basis in increments of 50. The first reduction is planned to take effect in payments on 14th September, with subsequent reductions taking effect in mid-November and early February. People currently receiving the 203 rate and those who reach the 203 rate in each phase, will then transition to standard jobseeker terms. This will be done over a period of time and with advance notice. Minister Humphreys added: \"The scale is unprecedented but it was necessary to protect our citizens at a time of national crisis. Thankfully that crisis is now subsiding. \"The vaccine roll-out is continuing at pace and we are now able to look ahead to a summer where businesses across the country will re-open, some for the first time in over a year. \"In February, there were over 481,000 people in receipt of the PUP. \"Today that number is just over 309,000, a fall of over 170,000 which clearly shows that people are returning to work as businesses reopen. \"Next week the numbers will fall below the 300,000 mark and as key sectors like hospitality re-open, we expect the numbers to fall significantly throughout June, July and August.\" Continuation of other Covid-19 related social welfare supports Between now and the end of the year, the Department will ensure that it continues to provide other important supports. Supports for Self-employed The 1,000 Enterprise Support Grant will remain in place for the rest of the year for self-employed people who close their PUP payment. Those who claimed the grant in 2020 but who found themselves back on PUP in 2021, will be able to access the grant for a second time. The arrangements to allow self-employed workers earn up to 960 over an 8 week period while in receipt of PUP will remain in place The Part Time Job Incentive will remain available to self-employed workers to the end of the year. This enables them to take up limited self-employment and retain a weekly payment of 128.60. Rent Supplement The flexible approach to Rent Supplement including those for victims of domestic abuse that have been in place throughout the pandemic, will continue until the end of the year. Enhanced Illness Benefit The Covid Enhanced Illness Benefit payment will continue at its current rate. Any future decisions on this payment will be informed by public health advice. Helping People Back to Work Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme funded by the Department and administered by the Revenue Commissioners will be extended until the end of the year and the conditions will be modified to make it easier for employers to qualify. This will help employers with the costs of taking workers back into employment and should contribute to a fast recovery in employment. Minister Humphreys continued: \"I have always said that my Department is here to help over the past year that has been very obvious in the way it responded to help people with the financial stresses of Covid -19. As the economy re-opens we are still here to help - not just through the continued provision of income supports but through the provision of employment advice, employment supports and access to retraining. \"In this way we want to help people move from PUP and other income supports into employment I will be shortly publishing an updated Pathways to Work Strategy but can announce today some of the key elements of that strategy that were included in the National Economic Recovery Plan.\" Intreo the Public Employment Service will, with its service partners, recruit and engage additional employment case officers to increase the overall caseload capacity by over 100,000 compared to pre Covid-19 levels. This will provide valuable additional employment service capacity to support individuals who have lost employment back into work. A new work-placement programme will provide 10,000 paid work-placement opportunities for unemployed people. This programme has been submitted to the EU for funding under the Resilience and Recovery Fund. The Jobs Plus recruitment subsidy scheme will be expanded to help employers recruit up to 8,000 unemployed people and to bias that recruitment toward people affected by Covid-19 in particular young people. 50,000 new places will also be made available in further education and training to help people from sectors that are particularly affected to re-skill and upskill into new sectors of opportunity. Further details on these and other initiatives will be provided in the forthcoming Pathways to Work strategy which will be announced later this month. The total value of the supports announced today are estimated to be over 4 billion up to end December 2021. The Minister concluded: \"Today is about looking forward, rebuilding our economy and getting people back to work. The exceptional range of income supports have served their purpose and will continue to do so for the next few months, but then we must turn our focus to a set of exceptional employment support measures to help people find and sustain employment. It is to that job that we now turn.\" ENDS Press Office - Media Enquiries Only (Including Out of Hours) Address: Department of Social Protection, Aras Mhic Dhiarmada, 1 Store Street, Dublin 1, D01 WY03 Website: www.gov.ie\/dsp Email: Phone number: 01 704 3860 01 704 3847 01 704 3184 Map: View location on map","b8cf530fedf449e48774ec503b5771d3e3d9a23917ad0cfb636c6116f90327de":"1.

They also acknowledged the collective efforts undertaken by the Regional Assemblies and the staff of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to assist with the reprogramming of European Regional Development Fund (EDRF) support to address the urgent and exceptional challenges posed by COVID-19 to health care provisions in all regions of the country. Ireland has today submitted a second claim to the EU Commission for support towards the costs incurred during 2020 in the purchase of PPE supplies for the Irish healthcare system, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This brings to 311m the support provided under the ERDF Programmes in Ireland to the HSE for PPE. Availing of flexibility measures introduced at EU level, Ireland's two ERDF Programmes responded by setting up the Health Support Scheme, which has directed 311m of much needed resources towards the HSE's efforts to procure the supply of PPE for front line health care workers in Ireland. Minister Michael McGrath said: \"In response to the COVID-19 crisis, one of the measures the EU put in place was to enable Member States to reallocate EU Funds to fight the pandemic. This flexibility was matched by the efforts of staff across a range of different public bodies to ensure that the funds could be used to source PPE, and deliver it to where it was needed, across every region of Ireland. Securing the supply of the PPE for Ireland at the height of a global pandemic represented an unprecedented logistical exercise for the staff involved. \"I want to acknowledge the personnel in the HSE who collaborated closely with the staff of the Southern Regional Assembly, the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, my department, the Department of Health and colleagues from the EU Commission on the development and roll out of the EU Funded Health Support Scheme.\" Minister Stephen Donnelly said: \"I want to express my appreciation to the staff of HSE Health Business Services who rose to the extraordinary challenge to ensure the supply of PPE in Ireland in the midst of unprecedented global demand during the pandemic. The procurement of PPE in highly competitive and volatile circumstances was, and remains, critical to protect our healthcare workers. \"The financial support for PPE mobilised through the ERDF made a very important contribution towards that. I acknowledge that support, along with the subsequent close and detailed administrative effort required to claim over 311m of the associated costs in Structural Funds from the Commission.\" Notes The funding from the ERDF Programmes was facilitated by the EU's Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII) and the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+) Regulations to support operations and foster crisis response capacities in the context COVID-19; and Regulation 2020\/558 on specific measures to provide exceptional flexibility for the use of the European Structural and Investment Funds in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. ERDF funding of 310,839,246 has been awarded to the HSE for the supply of COVID-19 PPE to the health service in the S&E and BMW regions. This comprised 103,030,629 from the Border, Midlands and Western (BMW) Regional ERDF Operational Programme, and 207,809,246 from the Southern and Eastern (S&E) Regional ERDF Operational Programme The S&E Regional Operational Programme and the BMW Regional Operational Programme are managed respectively by the Southern Regional Assembly and the Northern and Western Regional Assembly and are co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund.","d0c2993eb8a13e6e14d55a99e9e031d21102e0611c525b67030ea25f27087f70":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        The Minister for Health, Mr Simon Harris TD, has reappointed the following as members of the Irish Blood Transfusion Board:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Dr Elizabeth Kenny from 21 May 2020 to 20 May 2023\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dr Kenny works as a Gastroenterologist in Cork University Hospital and Mater Private Cork.

The Ministers and their officials and agencies have worked with hospitality industry representatives and unions over the last two weeks to assess options to operationalise the NPHET advice of 28 June that restrictions on indoor restaurant and bar services be eased for those that are fully vaccinated or recovered by COVID-19. The lifting of restriction was initially scheduled for 5 July 2021, but the rapid spread of the Delta variant internationally and modelling of the potential impacts on public health in Ireland led to NPHET advising a more cautious approach to reopening. In the context of the overriding objectives to protect public health and to mitigate the potential for further restrictions arising from the Delta or other variants, the government has agreed to the following measures: an easing of restrictions on indoor hospitality for members of the public who are fully protected by vaccination or who have recovered from COVID-19 in the previous six months. Over 2 million people are now fully vaccinated in Ireland members of the public will be able to avail of indoor services on the presentation of verifiable evidence of vaccination or immunity status. Customer data once verified will not be retained by the cafe, bar or restaurant the government's new Digital COVID Certificates, which Ireland and other EU countries are implementing, can be used by members of the public as evidence of being fully vaccinated, or other medical documentation, which will be set out in guidelines in the coming days for visitors to Ireland outside the EU, including the US, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a nationally certified equivalent can be used for the purposes of verifying the vaccination or immunity status of such persons, in line with agreed government policy on international travel children under-18 accompanied by a vaccinated or recovered adult parent or guardian can also be admitted for indoor services So as to ensure a safe and sustained reopening, social distancing measures will remain in place in order to protect workers and children in such premises in line with discussions with unions and the hospitality sector. As fully vaccinated and recovered non-residents will be mixing with vaccinated and unvaccinated residents and workers in hotels, full social distancing measures will continue in hotels. Pub, restaurant and cafe operators and hotels will be required to comply with the government's Work Safely Protocol for the protection of workers and public health, social distancing. Detailed operational guidelines for reopening will be published by Failte Ireland in the coming days. The government's Work Safely Protocol and the Failte Ireland guidelines place a strong emphasis on the importance of implementing effective ventilation in all premises where the public and workers congregate, including increasing air flow, air extraction systems and the use of CO2 monitors. Improving ventilation will be part of the operational guidelines to be published by Failte Ireland and will continue to be part of Government's communications campaign. The ongoing effectiveness and impact of measures will be kept under review by the inclusion of the hospitality sector in the Workplace Health and Safety Monitoring Oversight Group. Following agreement by Government today of required legal underpinning for the phased reopening of indoor hospitality and for a system of verification, compliance and enforcement, the Minister for Health will present the amending legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas in the coming days. In relation to setting a date for opening of this sector, it is the government's intention to allow the sector to open as soon as practicable. This will be dependent on the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas over the coming days and the submission to the President for signature. The government also agreed to give further consideration to the use of PCR and rapid antigen testing in further phases of lifting of restrictions. The government's new Expert Advisory Group on Rapid Testing, Chaired by Professor Mary Horgan will be asked to provide appropriate guidance.","d61cd3b145efee6e7d1cf574a2048c4fbc6af4a70567f693166b846569bb5d8a":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                        \t\n                            1.

This initiative will see grants of up to 200,000 provided to local authority-led digital and telecommunications projects. This initiative builds on the previous Digital Innovation Programme that ran in 2018. It has an increased funding limit and an added opportunity to apply for funding to scale-up proven projects. Speaking today, Minister Humphreys said: \"The Government committed to continuing the Digital Innovation Programme in both the Programme for Government and the new rural development policy, Our Rural Future. This Programme supports local authorities to collaborate with each other or with third parties such as social enterprises and community groups, to trial new technologies and new approaches to common issues.\" \"Under the previous 2018 Digital Innovation Programme there was a wonderful diversity of projects, from life-saving thermal imaging cameras in Galway, to a rural working hub in Roscommon. We have seen projects that support tourism in Kerry, Longford and Monaghan to robotics in Offaly and projects improving accessibility to local services in Wicklow and Tipperary.\" Minister Humphreys continued: \"I am very keen to see more of the same. I want to see creative solutions to common rural challenges, be that connectivity in isolated areas, smart farming, next generation public services or digitally-enhanced tourism.\" The 2021 Digital Innovation Programme has a specific focus on collaboration, whether between local authorities or between local authorities and third parties, such as social enterprises or educational institutions. Projects must be local authority-led and, where assets or infrastructure will established, favour rural and isolated areas. Minister Humphreys added: \"This year's Digital Innovation Programme is looking for original, creative and unusual projects that showcase rural ingenuity. Our heartlands, our islands and our local communities have so much to offer. Let's take this opportunity to show that rural Ireland is home to innovation and really kick start the rural digital revolution.\" ENDS Notes to Editor: The Digital Innovation Programme is an initiative of the Department of Rural and Community Development. It is designed to encourage local authority led projects that support digital development. These projects must promote, support, or otherwise advance at least one of the seven pillars of digital maturity: Digital Skills Infrastructure Innovation & Entrepreneurship Digital Economy & Employment Digital Services Community & Culture Digital Transition Projects that cut across more than one of the pillars are particularly welcome as are projects that involve multiple contributors. These projects will provide innovative digital solutions to issues, or identify solutions to digital issues and should be scalable and replicable by other local authorities. There will be two streams: Innovation As with DIP 2018, these projects will include trialling of entirely new technologies or innovative uses of existing technologies. Research may also be funded under this stream. The maximum award in this stream will be 75,000. Scaling-up This stream will provide funds to scale-up an already proven technology or initiative. For example, a project that has only been trialled at a municipal level in Ireland could be scaled-up to county level, or county level to national level. Alternatively, a project that sought to benefit a particular cohort within society or address a specific challenge could be broadened to include additional cohorts \/ challenges. The maximum award under this stream will be 200,000. The deadline for applications is 4pm, Friday 23rd July 2021 Previous DIP funded projects","b2ab03532e126688c9039b5ee81ebbe0cf64f389507adc752ec5a9f8f70a6173":"Implementation of Level 4 Measures results in reduced Intreo Office hours As Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal move to Level 4, Social Protection Minister, Heather Humphreys T.D., is reminding people in these counties to avail of welfare services online. Due to the restrictions, which come into effect at midnight, the opening hours of Intreo Offices are being reduced. Minister Humphreys is reminding people that they can apply for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) or a Jobseeker's Payment at MyWelfare.ie, rather than making an unnecessary visit in person to their Intreo Centre or social welfare branch office. Over 95% of people who applied for PUP this week did so online, ensuring that the payment can be processed quickly. People who are diagnosed with the Covid-19 virus or who have to self-isolate and are medically certified by their doctor, also have the option of applying for the Enhanced Illness Benefit online at MyWelfare.ie. Full information on the Enhanced Illness Benefit is available here. Commenting today, Minister Humphreys said: \"In the interests of the public health advice and observing social distancing, I am asking people, if at all possible, not to attend their local Intreo Centre or social welfare office. Instead, they should avail of the online services available through MyWelfare.ie. This is the quickest and easiest way to apply. It is also the quickest and most efficient way for the Department to process the applications and is the safest option for our customers and our staff. To observe the strict public health advice and to safeguard both our customers and our staff, the Department will be reducing our public office opening hours with effect from tomorrow, Friday, 16th October.

The greatest reduction this week is in the area of Accommodation and Food Services sector. The PUP figures published this week are in addition to the 184,213 people who were on the Live Register at the end of July. All COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payments have been paid into recipients' bank accounts or at their post office. Commenting on this week's figures, Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys said: \"The number of people receiving the Pandemic Unemployment Payment has now fallen by almost 70% since February. \"In the past week, some 4,400 PUP recipients closed their claims with almost half of these working in the Accommodation and Food sector. \"It is heartening to see more people return to work each week as we continue to move cautiously through our recovery from COVID-19.\" Minister Humphreys added: \"We know from past experience that when the economy recovers, it doesn't always move at the same pace for everybody. \"'Our Pathways to Work Strategy' ensures that supports will be provided to enable people to get back working again, be it through upskilling in their area of expertise or training for an entirely new career path. \"As the economic recovery continues and new jobs are created, we want to ensure that people in receipt of income supports have the training, skills and most importantly the confidence to take on new roles. \"The Pathways to Work Strategy will give people the support they need to secure quality, sustainable employment.\" The county with the highest number of people receiving PUP is Dublin which stands at 58,215. It is followed by Cork (13,536) and Galway (8,120). The payment week for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment runs from Friday to Thursday and payments are paid on the following Tuesday. Individuals who have closed their PUP by Monday 16 August, as they have returned to work, will receive their final PUP payment on Tuesday 24 August. People returning to work The department continues to remind workers who are returning to work that they must close their claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment on the actual date that they start back at work, in order to ensure that their claim is processed correctly and to avoid incurring an overpayment that the department will take steps to recover. As PUP is paid weekly in arrears people who have closed their claim last week are receiving a final payment this week and are still counted in the numbers in payment for this week. The easiest way to close a claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is online via www.MyWelfare.ie. Any worker returning to work with an enquiry about closing their claim can contact the department's dedicated Income Support Helpline at 1890 800 024 between 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday. Transition of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) In line with the government's National Economic Recovery Plan, the PUP will be gradually reduced on a tapered basis over a 6 month period until February 2022 to align it with the standard jobseekers payments. This transition commences in September 2021. Changes PUP has been closed to new claimants since 8 July this year. People who have lost their job since 8 July can apply for Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance in the normal way. Students Students currently receiving the PUP who have advised the department that they are or will be full-time students in the upcoming 2021\/2022 academic year will receive their final payment on Tuesday 7 September. Changes to PUP Rates The top three rates of PUP will reduce by 50 in September. The maximum weekly rate of 350 will reduce to 300. The current rate of 300 will reduce to 250 and the current rate of 250 will reduce to 203. The new payment rates will be reflected in payments received on Tuesday 14 September. People on the 203 PUP rate will transition to standard jobseekers terms. People who are receiving this rate of payment will be advised in the coming weeks on their options regarding standard Jobseekers' payments, that is, Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance. Payment of PUP will continue while jobseeker claims are being processed. Two further phases of rate changes are scheduled to take place from 16 November 2021 and 8 February 2022. As PUP recipients go on to the 203 rate in each phase, they will be transitioned to standard jobseeker terms. Control Measures The department conducts a series of pre and post payment checks on all PUP claims which include continuing eligibility checks. Subject to these checks being cleared the department then processes payments based on the clients' self-declaration. The department runs post payment checks that includes verifying data against Revenue records, examining cases where the same bank account is used multiple times, examining cases where an employer or members of the public report concerns, and the use of data analytics to identify and check claims. It also undertakes employer inspections. This work is undertaken by the department's Special Investigation Unit, which includes over 20 Gardai on secondment to the department. As business reopens the department's inspectors continue to conduct control reviews and matching records against employer payroll data from the Revenue Commissioners to help ensure people close their claim as they return to work. To avoid incurring an overpayment people returning to work should close their claim and can do so easily at www.MyWelfare.ie. Self-employed people and PUP Self-employed people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment who are looking to maintain their business can earn up to 960 over an eight-week period, while retaining their full PUP entitlement. There is no formal application process and a self-employed person simply needs to inform the department if they earn over 960 in any eight-week period. The 1,000 Enterprise Support Grant will remain in place for the rest of the year for self-employed people who close their PUP payment. Those who claimed the grant in 2020 but who found themselves back on PUP in 2021, will be able to access the grant for a second time.

I caught COVID-19 and within five days of experiencing my first symptoms I was admitted to hospital, where I spent 68 days in intensive care, most of that time on a ventilator, in an induced coma. \"I was told by my doctor that I would be in the induced coma for a few days, but I actually woke up two months later.

Anyone can catch it, and anyone can become very sick. \"I am very grateful to be alive, and I would like people to realise the effect that COVID-19 can easily have on you. \"Being in an induced coma on a ventilator means that you are unconscious and a machine has to breathe for you.

The RTE initiative which was launched by Minister Madigan in Government Buildings on Friday last, is prompting the nation to unite as one and Shine a Light at 9pm tomorrow evening, in a gesture of hope and solidarity during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of Ireland's main cultural and heritage sites will be lit as part of the campaign. National Cultural Institutions are taking part including The National Gallery of Ireland, The National Museum of Ireland, The National Concert Hall and The National Library of Ireland as well as The Crawford Art Gallery. Many of our country's National monuments will also be lit especially for the occasion including the Rock of Cashel, Ross Castle, Ormonde Castle, Kilkenny Castle, Casino Marino and Cahir Castle. Our National Parks throughout the country including Killarney National Park and Glenveagh National Park will also be taking part in the campaign with lights shining in Visitor Centres, where possible. The public is being asked to stay at home and abide by Government guidelines to combat the spread of Covid-19. Images of the light displays at sites throughout the country will be posted on the Department's social media platforms (details below). Minister Madigan said \"this is an opportunity, despite our necessary isolation, to send a collective message that we cherish the ill, our loves ones, our healthcare staff and all our frontline workers in these trying times that we are united and we will prevail.\" \"I am inviting everyone today to join in and to be part of the light, to be the light in the darkness. It can be the light of the smallest candle or the lighting up of a ten-storey building. Let's shine a light together for the people we love, people who we know are now sick or grannies and grandads we can't see, or our friends we can't visit these holidays. Shine a light for whoever is in your heart.\" Organisations such as Foras na Gaeilge and the Heritage Council are also supporting the initiative. Virginia Teehan, Director of The Heritage Council said \"Our spoken heritage is sprinkled with rich symbolism. The Irish the word crithir means particle or a spark of a flame, or the tiniest portion of something. It has other meanings that can act as a wedge to prise open perspectives that would otherwise remain hidden. For example, it can refer to the vulnerability and insubstantiality of solid objects; the trembling of the land in an earthquake, or the crumbling surface of ploughed land when dry after rain. Crithir means all these things and symbolises how the lights that glow in our homes and on our historic landscapes and buildings, on this Easter Saturday evening, symbolise both vulnerability and hope.\" Waterways Ireland will also take part in the campaign by lighting up a heart in Grand Canal Dock basin from 8 p.m. on Easter Saturday. The Basin will be lit up with a floating installation of lit candles. The installation will float in the basin for approximately 2 hours. This Waterways Ireland installation is being delivered in collaboration with a number of the creative and artistic consultants the organisation has worked with over the years whilst strictly observing social distancing measures. The public are asked to abide by Government guidelines to stay at home and not to stay 2 metres from others images of all the sites taking part will be shared on the Department's social media platforms.

A large number of these organisations are providing critical services to vulnerable individuals and groups in society arising from the COVID-19 crisis. Many of these organisations now find themselves in financial difficulty as fundraising efforts, commercial activities and other services they rely on have been curtailed due to the ongoing crisis. The 40 million funding package is being made available through the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is specifically set aside to support initiatives which will benefit the most disadvantaged groups in society. The package consists of: a 35 million 'COVID-19 Stability Fund' which will provide a level of support to qualifying organisations who are most in need and have seen their trading and\/or fundraising income drop significantly during the crisis a 5 million government commitment to a Philanthropy Fund, (Innovate Together) which will focus on supporting responses to the COVID-19 crisis that require innovative and adaptive solutions to existing and emerging challenges Speaking about the funding package unveiled today, Minister Ring said: \"I am acutely aware of the impact of the current restrictions on the funding of charities, social enterprises and community and voluntary organisations and on the services they deliver to those most in need. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their contribution to the inspiring community response to the current crisis. \"This significant funding package for the sector will help to assist these key organisations to weather the crisis and allow them to maintain their valuable services.\" The Minister continued: \"Today's announcement shows that Government has heard the concerns of the sector and, despite the significant financial constraints we now face, we have worked creatively to deliver this significant response. The Stability Fund will be administered by Pobal in conjunction with my department. However, it should be said that while the funding provided will be very welcome, Minister Canney and I recognise that significant challenges remain for community and voluntary groups and charities during this time. Government departments and agencies will continue to work closely with the sector in managing through these challenges over the coming months.\" The Minister concluded: \"Community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises have played a very significant role in supporting vulnerable people in our communities over recent weeks, particularly in the context of the Government Community Call. I would like to commend them on that work, which I know is continuing.\" This new funding is being provided in addition to more than 45 million in funding, announced last November, for the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2020. The funding was allocated for 43 separate measures to be delivered across 9 government departments to benefit disadvantaged groups. On foot of the unveiling of today's funding package, Minister Canney stated: \"When the Dormant Accounts Fund was established, provision was made for supporting the most disadvantaged in our society with any available funds. This package being put in place today achieves exactly that, making sure that these funds are being put to the best possible use at a time of real need for many in society.\" Minister Canney continued: \"I wish to put on record my thanks to Social Innovation Fund Ireland, which will be administering the Innovate Together, Philanthropy Fund. By joining forces with the philanthropic community, not only will we leverage donations for this important initiative but we can also tap into the innovative experience and expertise which already exists in this sector. \"The new funding package announced today will ensure that the organisations assisting our most vulnerable groups can continue this important work so that people can get the help and support that they need during these most challenging of times.\" The funding package for these organisations is complementary to the range of other supports provided by the government to support businesses, employers and employees on foot of the crisis.

Examples of other Government Supports Other government supports available are: COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme Pandemic Unemployment Payment 2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund 250 million Restart Fund to assist micro and small businesses 3 month waiver on commercial rates for affected businesses worth 250 million The Dormant Accounts Fund The main purpose of the Dormant Accounts legislation is to reunite account or policy holders with their funds; and relevant institutions are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies. Under the legislation, the rightful owners can reclaim their funds at any time. In order to utilise funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed, the legislation introduced a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed for the purposes of measures to assist those who are economically, socially or educationally disadvantaged, or persons with a disability. Annual Dormant Accounts Action Plans are published each year, and generally provide funding of 35-40 million per annum for measures aimed at addressing disadvantage. This funding package is a once off package of 40 million, in addition to those annual action plans, and is made possible through a build-up in the funds available over the last number of years.

Under the scheme, businesses may claim for the restart payment within eight weeks of the date of re-opening. Claims can be made via the claim portal in respect of CRSS, which is available via the eRepayments system on ROS. Revenue has updated their guidelines to assist businesses and these can be found at this link . The enhanced restart payments are provided for in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provision) Act, which was signed into law on 19 July. Businesses who qualified for CRSS that are reopening after 2nd June are eligible for an enhanced 'restart week' payment, which will cover a period of three weeks at double the normal rate. This will assist them with the additional costs of reopening. The Minister said: 'The CRSS has proved to be a significant support for businesses that were affected by public health regulations, which meant that they had to restrict access to their premises. The Act gives enhanced support to these businesses on reopening and I would encourage them to apply for the triple week payment at double the normal rate'. As at 15th July, there were 22,800 businesses with 26,800 premises registered for CRSS with Revenue (this includes those at applicant stage). Of these, 12,300 have claimed 'restart' weeks and are now trading without the support of CRSS. The Minister added: 'It is great to see the number of businesses that were supported throughout the period of restricted access now reopening and no longer needing access to CRSS for support. A total of 655 million has been paid to businesses under the CRSS since its introduction in the Budget last year. The weekly amount being paid is now reducing significantly as businesses reopen'. \"The Government and I have always committed that there would be no cliff edge to supports. Businesses that are no longer eligible for CRSS because they have reopened have the withdrawal of this support eased by the enhanced payments on reopening. I see this as part of the gradual unwinding of business supports, which will progressively return our public finances to a sustainable position while supporting the economic recovery.\" Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS) The Act also provides for the BRSS which will be implemented in September 2021. This scheme is being introduced for vulnerable but viable businesses, particularly in sectors that were significantly impacted throughout the pandemic, even during periods when restrictions were eased. Businesses whose turnover is reduced by 75% in the reference period, 1st September 2020 to 31st August 2021, compared with 2019 will be eligible. The scheme will not be restricted by location, rate-paying or physical premises. Businesses that previously availed of other schemes such as the small business assistance scheme for Covid and the tourism business continuity scheme, for example, as well as the CRSS, will be eligible to apply for a once-off payment based on a percentage of their average weekly turnover for 2019, subject to a maximum payment of 15,000, provided they meet the qualifying criteria. Charities and approved sports bodies may also be eligible. Additional details are available at . Notes for editors The maximum amount that may be claimed as the enhanced payment (restart) in respect of each of the weeks covered increased from 5,000 to 10,000 (total maximum payment is 30,000).

The Government previously announced that the commercial rates waiver put in place for the first quarter of 2021 had been extended to the second quarter and it is now to be further extended to the third quarter. The waiver is intended to continue supporting eligible businesses as they adjust to the reopening of the economy and recover from the impact of the pandemic. Businesses currently eligible for the waiver will continue to be eligible for the waiver for quarter three. As has been the case with the 2021 to date, automatic eligibility applies to: Retail Hospitality including hotels, pubs and restaurants, leisure and entertainment Personal services such as hairdressers and barbers Health services Various other categories It is estimated that the extension of the waiver in the third quarter of 2021 will cost 160 million. Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O'Brien TD, said: \"I am delighted to confirm that he current commercial rates waiver has been extended to the end of quarter three. It is vital that businesses are supported as they adjust to the reopening of the economy and recover from what was a most difficult period. It's equally important that we support our local government sector, who have provided great supports to their communities throughout this pandemic. The cost of the waiver is expected to be approximately 160m and will be met by the Exchequer.\" Minister of State for Planning and Local Government, Peter Burke TD, said: As Minister for Local Government, I am committed to ensuring continued support for businesses which have been severely impacted by the pandemic while simultaneously making sure our local authorities are not financially penalised and can continue to carry out their vital frontline work. The form of the waiver in place since January 2021 will be applied for a further three month period from July to September 2021. I recognise that while businesses are in the process of reopening, they are emerging from an extremely difficult period and continued supports for a further period are warranted. This decision by Government will mean continued support for local authorities as they provide key services, such as road maintenance, public lighting, development control and the provision of parks and open spaces, necessary to create the environment in which businesses can prosper.\" ENDS","a9214f9c47ac95069e4b0d91a065f6c479c44938db41a34a7018ee7df969b5f9":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        On the nomination of the Minister of Further and Higher Education, Innovation, Research and Science, the Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, T.D., has appointed the following person as a member of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board from 14 January 2021 to 24 February 2022\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dr Carole Glynn\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dr Carole Glynn is currently Head of Department of Applied Social Sciences at Limerick Institute of Technology.

The Tanaiste said: \"These results show that Government allocated 869.2m to Research and Development last year, a 8.4% increase in investment on the previous year. \"R&D is a really important driver of competitiveness, productivity and economic growth. We invest now and reap the rewards in terms of jobs and new technology in the future. \"This investment went towards finding solutions to problems facing business; creating the jobs of the future; testing new technologies and making Ireland a global innovation leader.

Ireland can become a global innovation leader. The new department will drive this agenda and will ensure research and innovation is at the centre of our economy recovery.\" The data is published in a report named: The Research and Development Budget 2019-2020. The publication is compiled from a comprehensive survey of thirty government departments and agencies. Government spend on R&D was 802.2m in 2019 an increase of 4.8% in expenditure over the previous year. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its Agencies (Science Foundation Ireland, InterTrade Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland) were responsible for over half (50.9%) of all government R&D investment in 2019 at 408.4m. It is estimated to have increased in 2020 by a further 8.4% with allocated funding of 869.2m. The report provides details of government funded research programs and highlights the extent and variety of R&D being carried out in the country. In addition, the report brings together the latest data on business, higher education and government agencies' spending on R&D in Ireland. In 2019, Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) across all sectors of the economy was 4.027 billion. The highest expenditure on R&D continues to be within the business sector, which accounted for an estimate 2.910 billion or 72.5% of total GERD. Following a Government decision to transfer certain research and innovation functions, the Research and Development Budget 2019-2020 Survey will be undertaken by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science from 2021 onwards.

The new guidance will come into effect on 4 May. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact across society, especially for older people. It is recognised that the necessary public health protective measures, such as restrictions to visitations in long term residential care facilities has effects on the social, psychological and emotional well-being of residents and their families. The extensive provision of vaccines to nursing home residents brings great hope and is providing an opportunity for additional visits. The revised visitation guidance continues to build on learning from the positive impact of the vaccine rollout nationally and internationally and will provide a further easing of visiting restrictions as we continue to see huge benefits from the vaccine roll out across the community. Residents may now be facilitated to receive four routine visits per week. This will be possible following two weeks after the full vaccination of approximately 8 out of 10 of all residents in the nursing home. Otherwise, two visits per week should be facilitated. The duration of visits should be appropriate to the needs of the resident and should not be less than one hour. Where there is high vaccine coverage, 2 people may visit at a time but there is no requirement to limit the number of nominated visitors. The increased level of visiting provided for under the new guidance follows the move to two visits per week announced last month. Most nursing home residents are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and, in recognition of this, and the increasing evidence of the protection conferred by full vaccination, new guidance has been developed that further expands the scope of visiting. Although the situation in nursing homes has greatly improved, the risk associated with COVID-19 remains very real. There is still a risk of introduction of infection, including the possibility of a new variant of COVID-19. There is a particular concern about the possibility of introducing a new variant, against which the vaccine may be less effective. Therefore, caution remains appropriate. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention and control measures must be maintained and we must continue to follow public health advice, including when visiting, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities. The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges. Following the approval of the new guidance, Minister Donnelly said: \"The most recent guidance, published in March, paved the way for a return to visiting our loved ones in nursing homes and has given great joy and hope to nursing home residents and their families and friends. And now, with the further benefit of full vaccination for so many nursing home residents, it is a very welcome step, through this new guidance, that there is a return to more normalised visiting for nursing home residents. \"The experience associated with this pandemic has been and continues to be difficult and has been acutely felt by those living in nursing homes. Through the necessary measures to protect one another from the virus, we have also all experienced the loss of important social connections with loved ones, a loss which has been particularly felt by our family and friends in nursing homes. \"Meaningful contact with family and friends, which is so important to our wellbeing, is something that we have striven to provide as safely as possible. With high levels of vaccination having now been achieved in many nursing homes, it is really encouraging news that this also brings the chance for nursing home residents to have more opportunities for that meaningful contact.\" Welcoming the new guidance, Minister Butler said: \"There is no doubt that the last 14 months have been incredibly difficult and challenging for nursing home staff, residents and their families and the sacrifices made have been enormous. I would like to acknowledge and thank nursing home staff for their tireless efforts and hard work in keeping people as safe as possible. \"I understand that, for some, there may be apprehension about an increase in visiting, given the considerable challenges posed since the arrival of the pandemic. However, a balance must be struck between protecting residents and staff from the risk of COVID-19, and individual's rights to visits from family and friends. Visiting, social connections and meaningful contacts are an inherent part of the wellbeing of residents and of the quality of care provided. With the benefit of the vaccine, regular visiting is now moving away from general and compassionate circumstances only, towards a more normalised situation. \"The implementation of the new guidance from 4 May will allow time for nursing home service providers to communicate with families, book visits and prepare for additional visiting. I expect that all nursing home providers will facilitate visiting, to the greatest extent possible, in line with the new guidance announced today.\" Notes The government's revised plan for managing the virus 'COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead ' is a cross-government approach to managing the pandemic for the coming months and was published on 23 February 2021. It sets out sets out the approach to the next Phase. COVID-19 is highly contagious and when it is circulating at high levels within the community, there is an increased risk that it will enter into nursing homes and other long-term residential care facilities. People in these settings are often very vulnerable to this virus and its effects, as well as the settings themselves posing risks in terms of infection control and prevention. In order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 being transmitted to vulnerable populations, it may be necessary to reduce the number of visitors to long-term residential care facilities at certain critical times. Visiting restrictions are widely practiced internationally as a protective measure with some variations in how they are applied. However, as per regulatory requirements, visiting is part of the normal daily functioning of nursing homes. Therefore, the nursing home provider has a legal obligation for doing all that is practical to support safe visiting. The nursing home should have the capacity and relevant skill sets within its staffing complement to manage this appropriately. The surge in COVID-19 in January 2021 and the resulting harm to residents and staff is a reminder of the ongoing need for vigilance to prevent introduction of COVID-19 into nursing homes. Although the situation has improved considerably there is a continuing risk even with vaccination of introduction of infection. There is a particular concern about the possibility of introducing a new variant that the vaccine does not protect against. The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has developed this new guidance, which takes account of the benefits of vaccination, to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support safe visiting, to the greatest extent possible, having regard to balancing the principle of a cautious approach to reopening with recognising the early data on the positive impacts of the vaccine. The guidance recognises the positive and continuing impact of the vaccine rollout, especially in nursing homes, with four visits per week now possible at all levels of the framework of restrictive measures, where 8 out of every 10 residents in the nursing home have been vaccinated. Aside from operational requirements, flexibility on the duration of visits is permitted and where such operational requirements exist, a minimum of one-hour visits should be facilitated. The guidance recommends that providers develop an individualised visiting plan for each resident as part of the resident's overall care plan and the duration of visits should be appropriate to the needs of the resident. There are additional Specific Critical and Compassionate Circumstances, where there is no upper limit on the frequency or duration of visiting that is acceptable, subject to the ability of the nursing home to manage the visiting safely. These include, for example, circumstances in which end of life is imminent and when there is an exceptionally important life event for the resident (for example death of a spouse or birthday). The guidance also re-states the existing position that there are very limited, if any, circumstances, including outbreaks, in which outdoor or window visiting should be suspended on infection prevention and control grounds. The guidance notes the particular risks and challenges that arise in the context of an open outbreak in a nursing home. Where there is an open outbreak, further public health measures are required, including limitations on visiting. The guidance outlines these measures. The guidance also highlights the ongoing public health measures that are required in order to ensure visiting occur is in the safest way. The revised guidance has been developed in consultation with key national stakeholders. The publication of this guidance also supports the implementation of recommendation 12.1 of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report. Recognising the difficult landscape that COVID-19 has presented for long-term residential care settings, a series of enhanced measures have been agreed by the NPHET to provide support to these settings and these are currently being implemented by the HSE, HIQA and service providers. The substantial package of support measures for nursing homes include measures to support those which have outbreaks of COVID-19 and measures aimed at breaking the chain of transmission of the virus. These supports include enhanced HSE engagement; multidisciplinary clinical supports at CHO level through 23 COVID-19 Response Teams; supply of precautionary and enhanced PPE, free of charge; serial testing programme for all staff of nursing homes; where possible, access to staff from community and acute hospitals; suite of focused public health guidance and training resources; temporary financial support scheme for private and voluntary nursing homes with over 86.4m in additional funding support provided thus far (including an additional one-off grant for visiting infrastructure) - The Scheme is open until 30 June 2021; Temporary accommodation to nursing home staff to support measures to block the chain of transmission; HIQA COVID-19 quality assurance regulatory framework.","c88d754249742efee2ea267a90efa2b4443f53f019dd0a8196383ebd698b7fbb":"The Taoiseach, yesterday, met with representatives of the Catholic Church - Archbishop Eamon Martin, Archbishop Dermot Farrell, Archbishop Kieran O'Reilly and Archbishop Michael Neary - to discuss the current level of Covid-19 restrictions and the Church's desire to return to worship, in particular during the season of Lent and with the approach of Holy Week and Easter. The Archbishops requested the meeting as part of ongoing constructive dialogue regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions on public worship. Recognising the huge challenges which the pandemic poses, the Archbishops emphasised that they wish to continue supporting the public health message and to encourage all necessary measures, including vaccination, to protect health and well-being, especially that of the most vulnerable. They shared their concern that life at present is particularly stressful and difficult for people to endure, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Recognising the spiritual comfort and hope that participation in public worship brings, the Archbishops asked that public worship resume when an easing of restrictions is considered. They expressed a strong desire that people might gather safely this year for the important ceremonies of Holy Week and Easter. They also requested consideration of an increase in the number of the bereaved who may attend funeral Masses. The Taoiseach thanked the Archbishops for their support and acknowledged the importance of the Church community in people's lives at this time of stress and worry. He outlined the ongoing concerns regarding the spread of the virus, particularly the new variants, stressing that any increase at all in mobility can have serious consequences for public health and put pressure on the health service. In concluding, he said the concerns raised at the meeting would be given consideration. It was agreed to maintain dialogue as the situation evolves.","7ce5531259d53b50815c0c2df551625b4bd2686ffd9ba963fb8918646996df92":"1. Today's cases 2. Latest update on vaccines 3.

We are aware that case numbers have now stopped declining and as a consequence the reproduction number has increased to an estimated 0.7 - 0.9. \"The data strongly suggests that a small, recent increase in the level of social contacts has led to the increase in reproduction number we see now. A small additional effort to reduce our contacts will make a big difference to reduce disease incidence before December 1st.\" Dr. Colm Henry, Chief Clinical Officer, HSE: \"This pandemic has placed huge demands on our healthcare workers in addition to the standard care of patients. Their work now involves additional infection prevention and control measures which require constant vigilance and awareness.

Minister McEntee said: \"I am very pleased that the latest report from the Policing Authority continues to note a high quality policing response by An Garda Siochana and an exemplary level of public service. This reports notes the very positive social outcomes from the outreach efforts by the women and men of An Garda Siochana to actively engage with communities across Ireland throughout the pandemic. \"I am particularly heartened that the report notes the 'recognition and the appreciation of the effort, approach and willingness with which the Garda Siochana has engaged with the health emergency remains palpable'. \"The work of An Garda Siochana in recent months encompassed many crucial elements, such as Operation Faoiseamh, which aimed to prevent loss of life and to ensure that victims of domestic abuse were supported and protected. \"The Authority notes the view expressed to it that 'the policing response to domestic abuse is the best it has ever been in Ireland', and consideration can be given to what elements of recent operations can now be embedded in An Garda Siochana practice and policy. \"I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation for the professionalism and dedication which continues to be shown by the members of An Garda Siochana and other frontline services. Ours is truly a community police service of which I am very proud.\" Since the easing of the temporary powers under the Health Act on 8 June, An Garda Siochana have relied largely on their existing pre-COVID policing powers. Nonetheless, An Garda Siochana still have a crucial role to play in our national effort to suppress the pandemic. The Minister therefore noted the continued relevance of the Authority's reports. In line with the easing of restrictions, the reports of the Policing Authority will now continue on a monthly basis. Minister McEntee added: \"While the demands, as we move through the Roadmap to Reopen Ireland, are described as 'increasingly complex and challenging', I have no doubt An Garda Siochana will rise to that challenge. \"I am very grateful to the Policing Authority for their commitment and diligence to reporting on policing the pandemic. In my recent meeting with the Chair of the Policing Authority, Bob Collins, on 15 July last I expressed my support for this important function being provided by the Authority in these extraordinary times. I emphasised how important it is for these reports to continue to be produced while we progress through the stages of the public health guidelines and I look forward to the future monthly reports of the Authority, which are critical and important to proper democratic oversight in these extraordinary times. \"I am also grateful to the Garda Commissioner and his team for the frequent engagement with the Authority to assess and report on the enforcement provisions. These efforts contribute greatly to public confidence that these restrictions are being enforced sensibly and in the context of protecting human rights.\" ENDS Notes to the Editor: Additional powers were provided for An Garda Siochana in support of public health related restrictions on movement and gatherings, through legislation and regulations by the Department of Health namely the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, which amends the Health Act 1947, and associated regulations. These powers are temporary in nature and expired on 8 June 2020. An Garda Siochana rely largely on their pre COVID-19 set of powers with some notable exceptions where penal provisions for non-compliance were provided for: S.I. 181 of 2020 sets out regulations for international travellers to the State requiring them to provide information on their location during their stay within the State and made non- compliance with this a penal provision S.I. 206 of 2020 introduced a limited range of additional penal restrictions focussed on the organisation and undertaking of events, and access to business premises S.I. 234 of 2020 allowed pubs serving a substantial meal and restaurants to open with certain restrictions and penal provisions on 13 July, S.I. 244 of 2020, setting out regulations surrounding the wearing of protective face coverings on public transport, was enacted. Failure to comply with the regulations is a penal provision providing the Garda Siochana with the additional powers referred to earlier Additional information on the use by An Garda Siochana of these powers and associated monitoring by the Policing Authority is available on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality, at the following link: www.justice.ie\/en\/JELR\/Pages\/Use_of_Covid-19_related_powers_by_An_Garda_S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na.","4d9603985b7a6fb0cf2f3b3c40b0b53c20c98481cfd96d857e57c2e7d2f00c81":"The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross and the Minister of State with responsibility for Sport, Brendan Griffin TD, today announced the establishment of an Expert Group. This group will provide guidance to Ireland's sporting bodies to prepare for the phased return to sporting activity in line with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. The National Governing Bodies of sport have been working over recent weeks to develop protocols for returning to training and competition in their respective sports. The Expert Group will assess the consistency of the various protocols being prepared by the National Governing Bodies of Sport in Ireland with the Roadmap. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will chair the Expert Group, which includes medical experts from the Sport Ireland Institute and the sports sector, as well as officials from both the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Sport Ireland. The Group also contains a specific representation for disability sport. Minister Ross said: \"Like every sector in society, those involved in Irish sport at all levels have been hugely affected by the COVID-19 crisis. They are understandably most anxious to return to normal business as soon as possible, both those involved at a high performance level and those eager to return to playing and participating in the sports they love within their communities. Unfortunately that is simply not possible in current circumstances. Small and very measured steps must be introduced slowly, which is what the Roadmap sets out to do through the various phases. But the good news is that some low-risk sporting activity can start up again next Monday in accordance with the public health advice. The sports organisations are putting detailed protocols in place and the Expert Group that we are establishing today will be assessing the consistency of these arrangements with the Roadmap and current public health advice. In my view, it is essential that the public can have confidence in how sport is being restored in Ireland and I believe that this initiative is an important confidence-building measure.\" Minister Griffin said: \"The response from the sporting community to the COVID-19 pandemic has been inspirational. The damage caused to so many sectors in Irish society is very evident and it has been no different in sport. Even though the road to recovery will inevitably be challenging, it is encouraging to notice the degree to which so many people miss sport in their lives. Phase 1 of the Roadmap is a small but important first step on the journey back. A small number of sports will start again from next Monday to some extent under strict conditions of travel limits, social distancing and constraints on the number of people that can participate. There has to be a strict adherence to the Roadmap and the public health advice. The Expert Group being established today is intended to help sporting bodies to achieve the required compliance from their memberships. Guidance advice will be provided by this Expert Group for each of the five phases of the Roadmap, which will assist the sporting organisations in their preparations for the staged return to sport set out in the roadmap.\" Sport Ireland Chief Executive John Treacy said: \"Sport will play an important role as the country looks to emerge from the current crisis and the establishment of the Expert Group to guide National Governing Bodies through the process of reintroducing sport is a welcome step. Through Sport Ireland's extensive consultation with the sports sector, there is a clear appetite for the reintroduction of sport at all levels and an appreciation that this must be done in a controlled and safe manner. The work of this group will provide a clear pathway for sport based on expert opinion and within the parameters outlined in the government's Roadmap for the Reopening of Society and Business. We would like to acknowledge the professional and diligent manner in which the sports sector has reacted and adapted to the ongoing situation. A lot of work is being put in behind the scenes to ensure that sport can resume as quickly and as safely as possible.\" The membership of the Expert Group is: Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport: Peter Hogan (Chair), Betty Griffin, James Lavelle Sport Ireland: Paul McDermott, Dr. Una May, Niamh O' Sullivan, Shane Califf, Dr Jim O'Donovan (Sport Ireland Institute) Sport Sector: Dr Rod McLoughlin (IRFU), Dr Alan Byrne (FAI), Feargal McGill (GAA), Niamh Daffy (CARA) ENDS","50ef1392791eaaf26b7ee5ef24a37078972be365089faf174df7918f525ce1c2":"New membership rates almost double versus same period last year. 467% increase in people taking e-learning courses. Mr Michael Ring TD, Minister for Rural and Community Development, has called on members of the public to avail of the excellent content and services offered by the online public library service during the COVID-19 crisis. Minister Ring, whose department is responsible for public libraries, also highlighted the significant increase in users of the online library service since this emergency began. There has been a near doubling of new library memberships during the COVID-19 crisis compared to the same period last year. Over 30,000 new members joined the library in March 2020 compared to just over 17,000 in March 2019. Furthermore, there has been a considerable rise in usage of specific library services in the week commencing 29 March compared to the week commencing 1 March, including in the following areas: 313% increase in new users of eBooks and eAudiobooks service 467% increase in e-learning courses being taken 227% increase in language courses being taken 246% increase in usage of the online newspapers\/e-magazines Minister Ring said: \"This increase in usage of our online library services shows the benefits that people are getting from our libraries during this crisis. While the doors of our public libraries are temporarily closed, it's great to see that people are availing of the vast array of reading and educational material online. \"During this challenging period, the online library service provides excellent ways to entertain and educate children as well as opportunities for adults to learn a language or skill or enhance their wellbeing. \"I am really heartened by the increase in membership and usage of our online libraries and I urge more people to sign up and avail of the wonderful content and services available. This is your library service, it is completely free and there is so much to be gained from it.\" If you are not a member already you can become an online library member by completing the online registration at Libraries Ireland. Our online public library service offers: over 33,300 eBooks and 25,200 eAudiobooks 4,000 magazines 2,500 online newspapers from over 100 countries over 500 e-learning courses over 100 online language courses In response to the increased demand, Minister Ring recently allocated 200,000 to purchase over 5,000 new eBooks and eAudiobooks. Minister Ring concluded: \"We have invested significantly in our online library service in recent years and it has really come into its own in recent weeks. This has been made possible by our library staff and management who in a very short time period have re-purposed the library service so as to enable the public to get the best out of our libraries during this time. \"Library staff are continuing to innovate in order to keep people entertained and educated online, including through online STEAM Workshops, Virtual Coding Workshops, online photography courses, virtual bookclubs, and writing competitions. \"The national Spring into Storytime reading programme is also underway in co-operation with Irish publishers and authors, with lots of online story times and author readings for children of all ages throughout April and May. A large number of the libraries have also collaborated with Engineers Ireland to manufacture 3D facial shields for health workers.\" ENDS","5c619b5cfbb8282a8d631ef8a4713691c6f3c0d65b052ef2e9e3c74680eb1c60":"The Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has today announced that patients who are prescribed medical cannabis products will no longer need to travel to the Netherlands to collect their medication. Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, patients or their family members travelled to the Netherlands to collect their medical cannabis prescriptions. Authorities in the Netherlands have forbidden the commercial export of cannabis oils but will allow the filling of individual prescriptions from EU states. A delivery service from the Netherlands to Ireland to assist patients of licenced clinicians in obtaining their prescribed cannabis products was established in April 2020. This was on a temporary basis due to the COVID-19-related restrictions around travel. This will now be made permanent. Speaking today, Minister Donnelly said: \"Many patients and their families have shared stories with both me and officials in my Department about how this initiative has made a huge improvement to their lives. They spoke about the stress of having to travel regularly and the associated health risks with that, as well as their concerns that they would run out of their medication. \"I am so pleased that these problems will now be a thing of the past for them. There will no longer be a need for them to travel abroad in order to collect their prescribed cannabis products. Instead, they can focus on their health and wellbeing. The welfare of patients and their families comes first and I am happy to reassure them that they will no longer have to personally source their prescriptions.\" Officials in the Department of Health will finalise the arrangements in respect of how the collection and delivery service will work on a permanent basis into the future. ENDS Notes to editor: Ministerial licencing of medical cannabis Doctors may utilise the ministerial licencing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients, should they wish to do so. In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time. The majority of patients of licenced clinicians obtain their prescribed products Transvaal Pharmacy in the Hague in the Netherlands. The medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment, including cannabis treatment, for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. The Minister for Health has no role in this clinical decision-making process. Since April 6th, the Department of Health has organised a number of collections from the Netherlands for patients of clinicians in possession of a ministerial licence under the Misuse of Drugs Act owing to the COVID-19 travel restrictions and quarantine requirements.","6012d38b83c2b02dc417de69026c74ec1752dfd1d2c0e83b9f4d841e0e2ba40e":"The Minister for Health is today announcing that agreement has been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) on a reformed public health model in Ireland. It is understood that the IMO will recommend the Agreement to their members who will ballot on it in the coming weeks. Minister Donnelly said: \"The government has recognised that major reform of the Public Health function is necessary and through the COVID-19 Path Ahead Plan we have committed to investing in, and resourcing of public health and the delivery of a strengthened and reformed consultant-delivered public health model. The past year has highlighted the critical national importance of a public health workforce with the capability to provide a robust and resilient health protection response. I welcome that an agreement has been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation that will support the implementation of a fundamentally reformed public health model at a national and regional level which is aligned with international best practice. I want to acknowledge the support from Minister McGrath and his commitment to this critical public health reform which has enabled us to reach this agreement.\" The enhanced service delivery model radically changes the governance and operating structure within Public Health, introducing a more fit-for-purpose National and Regional management structure across each of the pillars of Public Health a consultant led 'hub-and-spoke' structure as envisaged by the Crowe Horwath Report. The Minister is pleased that implementation of the new model will be progressed on a phased basis and will include the establishment of the grade of Consultant in Public Health Medicine to provide the strategic leadership for this reformed Public Health Model. As Ireland emerges from the current set of protective measures and seeks to prevent, minimise and delay any future escalation in cases, a fast, dynamic and agile, integrated and intelligence-led public health response, organised at a local level, will be critical to preventing or minimising a further resurgence in cases in the medium and long-term. As a result, the Phase 1 priority posts for recruitment through open competitive processes will be in the Health Protection pillar. Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ronan Glynn, said: \"The past year has highlighted the critical importance of a robust, comprehensive, public health-led multidisciplinary response to the management of infectious disease threats in our communities. As we hopefully emerge from this pandemic, the other components of public health medicine including the promotion of public health and wellbeing, the ongoing evaluation and improvement of our health services and the use of health data and intelligence to inform those developments, should provide a fundamental underpinning to the necessary transformation that will be required in our approach to the improvement of the public's health in the years to come. Today's announcement recognises the critical role that consultants in public health medicine can play in this transformation, acknowledges the importance of prevention as well as cure, and provides a basis for the development of a new and reformed model of public health medicine in Ireland.\" Chief Clinical Officer of the HSE, Dr. Colm Henry, added: \"We have long known the value of our Public Health teams and the role they play in the individual and collective health of our people. The past year has highlighted the global threat to population health posed by novel infectious agents and the critical national importance of a public health workforce sufficient to provide a robust, resilient, and responsive health protection response to those threats. The HSE's Public Health teams have been at the forefront of our COVID-19 pandemic response, demonstrating considerable leadership, commitment, and professionalism in protecting our communities. I look forward to working with our Public Health colleagues to bring the service to the next level and ensure that Ireland emerges from the pandemic with a public health service and workforce aligned with international best practice.\" A considerable amount of work has been completed in the design of the new model and the department and the HSE are excited to continue to work with our public health physicians to now implement the new model. The next step will involve the HSE commencing an open recruitment process for Consultants in Public Health Medicine to fill the prioritised posts. Notes In 2017, the Department of Health commissioned Crowe Horwath to undertake a review of the current and future role, training, and career structures of public health physicians in Ireland. The report published in December 2018 recommended that a new Service Delivery Model for the Public Health function in the HSE should be created and that it should be led by Consultants in Public Health Medicine. The new model introduces a strong Public Health Function strategically aligned within the HSE to protect and promote the health of the Irish population, to contribute effectively to major service design and policy implementation, to address health inequalities, and ensure a population needs based approach to integrated healthcare delivery. The model seeks to rebalance capacity to deliver effectively across all four domains of public health practice (Health Protection, Health Intelligence, Health Service Improvement and Health and Wellbeing) and optimise the contribution of consultant expertise to deliver greater impact across an expanded remit of service provision. Under the new model, Consultants in Public Health Medicine (CPHM) will lead appropriately resourced multidisciplinary teams, that include surveillance scientists\/epidemiologists, senior medical officers, trained contact tracers, administrative and, crucially, robust operations and management support. Consultants in Public Health Medicine (CPHM) are the medical experts, with substantial and direct involvement in the assessment, delivery of care (with a focus on proactive, preventive and integrated care) and overall leadership for ensuring the protection and improvement of health of the population. The Department of Health, HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation have been engaged in discussions about the new model and the future of the specialty of Public Health Medicine over the past number of months and are agreed on the implementation of the new model and the immediate introduction of the grade of Consultant in Public Health Medicine for the first time in Ireland. A Consultant-led model will enable recruitment and retention of Public Health Doctors with the capability, autonomy, authority, accountability and multidisciplinary teams to deliver an agile, dynamic, intelligence-led public health medicine service to protect the population from health threats, promote health, improve health services and tackle inequalities in health. The parties have agreed that a Consultant-delivered Public Health Model will be implemented by December 2023, with the establishment of 34 consultant posts in the first year and a total of 84 Consultant in Public Health Medicine posts by end December 2023. The phased nature of the implementation will facilitate the completion of a review process to ensure reform is embedded in this Public Health Model throughout the implementation process.","6258b2daca65e8b11a898aacb69cc07bf38aaa97de5e284cb1d96124de06a107":"1.

This indicates a deteriorating disease trajectory nationally and is a significant reminder of the severity of this disease. \"There have been further increases across key indicators of COVID-19 right across the country and the growth rate of the epidemic has accelerated in recent days. \"Due to the lower volume of tests being carried out over Christmas Day and yesterday, we believe there are higher levels of disease circulating in the community than today's reported case numbers reflect.

This represents a decrease of 8,546 people compared to last week. The figures published today are in addition to the 177,969 people who were on the Live Register at the end of April. All COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payments issued will be in recipients' bank accounts or at their Post Office today, Tuesday 11 May. Dublin is the county with the highest number of people who are receiving PUP this week at 122,775. It is followed by Cork (37,118) and Galway (20,567). The sector with the highest number of people receiving PUP this week is Accommodation and Food Service activities (98,124), followed by Wholesale and Retail Trade (62,115) and Construction (34,663). The Construction sector has seen the largest decrease in the number of people receiving PUP this week with 2,774 fewer people receiving the payment compared to last week. People returning to work As the country begins to move out of Level 5 restrictions, the department continues to remind workers who are returning to work that they must close their claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) on the actual date that they start back at work, in order to ensure that their claim is processed correctly and to avoid incurring an overpayment that the department will take steps to recover. The past seven days saw 12,245 people close their PUP claim stating that they were doing so because they are returning to work. Dublin had the greatest number of people closing their claims to return to work (3,300), followed by Cork (1,269) and Kildare (661). The sectors with the largest number of employees closing their Pandemic Unemployment Payment claims to return to work are Construction (3,107), Wholesale and Retail Trade (2,295), and Accommodation and Food Service activities sector (1,422). Some 969 people closed their claims to return to work in the Administrative and Support service Activities sector. The easiest way to close a claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is online via www.MyWelfare.ie. Any worker returning to work with an enquiry about closing their claim can contact the department's dedicated Income Support Helpline at 1890 800 024 between 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday. Speaking today on the latest PUP figures, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said: \"This week, the country took a big step forward in terms of reopening our economy and society. \"The decision to ease restrictions was only possible due to the hard work and determination shown by the Irish people. \"The reopening of sectors of our economy is resulting in more people going back to work. \"There are 8,500 fewer people receiving a Pandemic Unemployment Payment today and that number is expected to fall further in the coming weeks, as industries like retail and hospitality reopen. \"In situations where it is not be possible for other businesses to reopen for a while, I want to reassure those employers and employees that the government supports will remain available to them until 30 June. \"In the coming weeks, the government will make decisions on how these financial supports will operate as we continue through the recovery phase of this pandemic. \"But let me be very clear, there will be no cliff-edge when we reach the end of June. The government will adopt a cautious and phased approach, recognising the fact that some sectors will be slower to reopen than others.\" The Minister continued: \"Huge progress is being made in relation to the rollout of the national vaccination programme. \"Without doubt, this progress gives us all cause for hope and optimism in relation to the weeks and months ahead. \"But we must maintain a sense of caution. We need to continue to adhere to the public health guidelines and act sensibly in order to suppress this virus even further.\" Control Measures\/Re-hiring Workers The department conducts a series of pre and post payment checks on all PUP claims which include continuing eligibility checks. Subject to these checks being cleared the department then processes payments based on the clients' self-declaration. The department runs post payment checks that includes verifying data against Revenue records, examining cases where the same Bank account is used multiple times, examining cases where an employer or members of the public report concerns, and the use of data analytics to identify and check claims. It also undertakes employer inspections. This work is undertaken by the department's Special Investigation Unit, which includes over 20 Gardai on secondment to the department. As the industry reopens the department's inspectors will be conducting control reviews and matching records against employer payroll data from the Revenue Commissioners to help ensure people close their claim as they return to work. To avoid incurring an overpayment people returning to work should close their claim and can do so easily at www.MyWelfare.ie. The department notes the concerns expressed in recent days regarding employers facing difficulties in re-hiring staff. Experience from 2020 showed that about 400,000 people closed their PUP claim once the economy partially reopened. This is clear evidence that the vast majority of people want to, and will take up employment, once it is available to them. However, any employer who faces difficulties in re-hiring staff can notify the department at and we will follow-up with the workers concerned. Self-employed people and PUP Self-employed people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) who are looking to maintain their business can earn up to 960 over an eight-week period, while retaining their full PUP entitlement. There is no formal application process and a self-employed person simply needs to inform the department if they earn over 960 in any eight-week period.

The funding was jointly announced today by Minister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys TD, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael McGrath TD, and Minister of State with special responsibility for Charities and Community Development, Joe O'Brien TD. The 10m investment builds on the 45 million COVID-19 Stability Fund which, in 2020, supported over 600 organisations to continue delivering vital services to the most vulnerable in our communities. The new funding, agreed as part of the Government's Resilience and Recovery Plan, is targeted at organisations that have seen their trading and\/or fundraising income drop significantly as a result of the Pandemic. The funding will be administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Rural and Community Development. Details of the online application process will be published shortly. Welcoming the 10m funding, Minister Humphreys said : \"Our community and voluntary groups, as well as our charities and social enterprises, have played a crucial role during the Pandemic. \"They have continued to provide critical services to our elderly and most vulnerable citizens even at the height of Level Five restrictions. \"Many of these groups are now struggling financially due to for example a significant drop in income through fundraising. \"That's why Government has decided to step in and provide this 10 million fund, which is on top of the 45 million provided in 2020. \"I intend to make a further announcement in the coming weeks regarding the application process, and would encourage all potentially eligible charities, social enterprises and community and voluntary organisations to fully engage with the application process when it opens.\" Minister McGrath stated : \"Without doubt, this Pandemic has shown us the real meaning of 'community'. \"I am therefore very pleased to provide 10 million in funding through the COVID-19 Stability Fund for Community and Voluntary Organisations, Charities and Social Enterprises. \"I know from listening to organisations on the ground the difficulties they have faced in recent months, and the impact of restrictions on their ability to generate income. \"I am committed to assisting these organisations in whatever way possible to ensure that the valuable services they provide to the most vulnerable, who have been so deeply impacted by the public health crisis, continue on into the future.\" Minister O'Brien continued : \"I am very pleased to join with Ministers Humphreys and McGrath in announcing the 2021 round of the COVID Stability Fund. \"When the scheme was initially established in 2020, it was believed that social restrictions would be with us for a short period. \"With the evolving situation, it became necessary to examine the continuing impact of public health measures on the ability of community and voluntary organisations to generate income and deliver basic services. \"I understand the difficulties charities may have in accessing other supports and I'm delighted that the fund will reopen to support potentially eligible organisations who have not been supported in other ways, who have tried to weather the storm themselves but who now need some help. \"We want to ensure vital services continue and that we in Government do our part to help the organisations to do this. \"I commend the resilience and adaptability organisations have shown in trying to make up the shortfall through online fundraising and I am always inspired by the innovation shown in a sector filled with determined change-makers and activists. I again extend my most heartfelt thanks to you all for the vital work you do.\" ENDS Notes for editors The Government is aware of the challenges facing community and voluntary organisations and is committed to working closely with the sector in managing through these, recognising that it will require a whole of Government approach. In 2020, the Department of Rural and Community Development, working with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, provided support through the 45m COVID 19 Stability Fund for organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises. The Fund was intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups delivering critical front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fund-raised or traded income as we dealt with the sudden introduction of social restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19. This Fund was in conjunction with many other Government supports. This fund provided up to 45million of funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF) and the criteria aligned with DAF objectives to support: 1. The personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; or 2. The educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged; or 3. Persons with a disability. 1,060 applications were received during the application periods. Funding of over 43m, including the additional 10M in funding announced during Budget 2021, has been approved to over 600 organisations to date and the payment processes for this funding remain ongoing. Today's announcement details an additional 10M allocated to the Stability Fund as part of the Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 plan announced by the Taoiseach on Tuesday 23rd February. Further details on how relevant organisations can apply for this funding will be available shortly. In preparation for the application process, intending applicants should gather relevant financial information for 2019 and 2020, details of services provided including the numbers of beneficiaries, evidence of increased service demand due to the pandemic if applicable, and details of public funding received in 2020 and applied for in 2021. Each applicant organisation will be required to hold a registered company number or registered charity number in order to be considered. Further details of the online application process will be made available in due course. This new funding is being provided in addition to more than 51 million in funding, announced last November, for the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2021, which allocated funding for 46 separate measures to be delivered across 10 Government Departments to benefit disadvantaged groups.","9b12a5f419650d370b8de6256bcb19ba71f528d50b307703b5b03791ae5c7707":"1.

First 5, the ten-year Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families (2019-2028) was published in November 2018 followed by an initial three-year implementation plan for the Strategy in May 2019. First 5 focuses on the period of early childhood, from the antenatal period to age five, and takes a joined-up, cross-government approach to supporting babies, young children and their families during these critical early years. The First 5 Annual Implementation Report 2019 summarises the progress in implementing the strategy, with over 90% of all 2019 commitments met at this point. The Report also outlines key achievements from 2019, including: the introduction of a new entitlement to paid parents leave and extended entitlements to unpaid parent leave; foundational work to streamline and improve parenting supports across Government; a range of new measures to promote healthier childhoods; progress on key reforms to the early learning and care system; and the introduction of new measures to tackle early childhood poverty. Speaking about today's publication, Minister O' Gorman said: \"As Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I am delighted to publish the First 5 Annual Implementation Report 2019 and share an update on the very considerable progress that has been made to deliver on the 2019 commitments. \"This Report illustrates the positive work that is taking place right across Government and society to ensure children get the best possible start in life\" The Minister welcomed the collaborative efforts and shared ambition to deliver on the vision of First 5 across Government Departments, State Agencies and the Community and Voluntary sector and reiterated Government's continued commitment to First 5. Minister O' Gorman said: \"The Programme for Government reaffirmed a commitment to full implementation of First 5 and places children and families at the heart of our work. We are continuing to make good progress. \"Through this Strategy and the Programme for Government, we will transform services and supports for children and their families to help make Ireland a great place for every child to grow up. \"I look forward to continued positive collaboration with colleagues across Government Departments, State Agencies, Community and Voluntary sector and wider partners in the pursuit of better outcomes for babies, young children and their families\". ENDS Notes to the Editor: A high level summary of progress on 2019 milestones across the First 5 Big Steps are set out below. i. A broader range of options for parents to balance working and caring Extended entitlements to paid and unpaid leave for both fathers and mothers were introduced in 2019 (with further extensions announced as part of Budget 2021). The Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 gives parents a new statutory entitlement to parent's leave, that is, two weeks paid leave per parent for the parents of a child born or adopted on or after 1 November 2019. This is available to employed and self-employed parents and can be taken during the first year of a child's life. Parents who qualify for this leave and with the required number of social insurance contributions receive Parent's Benefit of 245 per week. It is estimated that 60,000 parents will receive the benefit each year, at a projected cost of 32 million. The phased introduction of an additional eight weeks unpaid parental leave was announced in 2019 and rose from 18 to 22 working weeks in September 2019 (and from 22-26 weeks from September 2020). This is provided for in the Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2019, which also changes the maximum age of the child whose parent is entitled to unpaid parental leave from eight to 12 years. The Department of Justice reviewed the relevant provisions of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 in 2019 with a view to extending the current entitlement to paid breastfeeding\/lactation breaks or paid reduction in working hours for breastfeeding mothers in the workforce from 26 to 104 weeks (2 years) after the baby's birth. The Heads of provisions extending the period in which employees would be entitled to the breastfeeding breaks or paid reduction in working hours were approved by Government in 2019 and work has begun on drafting of these provisions for inclusion within an early appropriate Bill. Efforts to enable greater access to family-friendly flexible working were also advanced. The Flexible Working Consultation was launched on 11 December 2019 by the Department of Justice to seek views from employers, employees, trades unions and the wider public on the types of flexible working arrangements currently in place and the changes that they wish to see. As the results of the survey have been overtaken by the rise in homeworking due to COVID-19 social distancing measures, consideration is being given to undertaking a follow-up survey. The results of the survey will contribute to the development of guidelines on flexible working. ii. A new model of parenting support A Parenting Support Policy Unit has been in place in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability and Youth since the end of 2018 to co-ordinate policy direction and activity relating to parenting support. In 2019, this Unit initiated collaboration and engagement with a wide range of Departments, Agencies and organisations, raising awareness of the role of the Unit and gaining an understanding of development, funding and provision of parenting support services. Work undertaken in 2019 to advance the First 5 parenting support commitments included securing agreement on the approach to developing a national model of parenting support services, and the development and commencement of an implementation plan for each action. Rapid reviews of effective mechanisms of information delivery to parents and international approaches to parenting support policy were commissioned to inform the development of an information platform for parents and the development of a national model of parenting support services. iii. New developments in child health A Steering Group was established by the Department of Health in 2019 to commence work on a dedicated child health workforce - one of the major commitments of First 5. The dedicated workforce will focus initially in areas of high population density and disadvantage. A range of measures to promote positive health behaviours and the physical and mental health of babies, young children and their families were also introduced alongside further development on the National Healthy Childhood Programme. Key progress included: Ongoing development and roll out of www.mychild.ie and mainstreaming of initiatives commenced under the Nurture Programme Infant Health and Wellbeing. Development of a range of breastfeeding supports, including training programmes, the 'Breastfeeding Good Start in Life' parent booklet, a National Infant Feeding Policy and appointment of lactation consultants. Development and consultation on draft HSE Baby-Friendly Standards. Publication of National Standards for Antenatal Education and development of training programme for antenatal educators. Development of a range of supports to increase uptake of vaccinations in early childhood and during pregnancy. Publication of Healthy Eating Guidelines for 1-5 year olds, with progress underway to develop Nutrition Standards for Early Learning and Care Settings. Publication and initial implementation of the National Skin Cancer Prevention Plan, which identified babies and young children identified as a priority group. Publication of national guidelines on 'Nutrition during Pregnancy' which included guidelines on folic acid supplementation. Continuation of the START campaign, with a particular focus on treat foods and physical activity for young children. Publication of Smile agus Slainte, the National Oral Health Policy, under which a universal dental health package for children under six is being introduced. Development of the Healthy Ireland Smart Start Programme for children under 3. Pilot of the school milk school scheme in early learning and care settings. Review and updating of the Healthy Food Made Easy Programme. iv. Reform of the Early Learning and Care (ELC) system Building on the very significant developments in early learning and care and school-age childcare over recent years, further progress was made to improve affordability, accessibility and quality. Major First 5 milestones met in 2019 include: The Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) (Registration of School-Age Services) Regulations 2018, which came into force in February 2019, allowing school-age childcare services to register with Tusla and thereafter take part in the National Childcare Scheme. A public consultation on draft quality guidelines and comprehensive regulations was also completed. Publication of new criteria and guidelines for level 7 and 8 courses in early learning and care and publication of Universal Design Guidelines for Early Learning and Care Settings. A Steering Group to develop the workforce plan for early learning and care and school-age childcare was convened in May 2019. To ensure a strong consultation process, a Stakeholder Group comprising representatives from across the sector was formed to work in conjunction with the Steering Group. Both groups met a number of times in 2019. An Expert Group to develop a new funding model for early learning and care and school-age childcare was established in September 2019. A Research Partner, Frontier Economics, was also appointed to support the work of the Expert Group. The Expert Group's inaugural meeting took place in October 2019. A draft Childminding Action Plan which set out short, medium, and long-term measures for the regulation and support of childminders on a phased basis over the next decade, was published in August 2019 for the purposes of public consultation. An extensive consultation took place in quarter 4 of 2019. A report was commissioned to consider the findings of the consultation process. This report was completed in December 2019. A National Childminding Co-ordinator and a team of regional Childminding Development Officers were appointed to support the implementation of the Action Plan. The National Childcare Scheme opened for online applications in November 2019. Under the National Childcare Scheme, families will be supported to meet the cost of quality early learning and care and school age childcare through a system of universal and income-related subsides. In Budget 2019, an additional 89m was allocated to early learning and care and school-age childcare. Further progress was made in Budget 2020 (i.e. an additional allocation of 64m) this represents a cumulative 31% of First 5 investment target, which pledges to at least double investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare by 2028 (from baseline in 2018). v. A package of measures to tackle early childhood poverty and disadvantage Progress was also made on a number of measures to address poverty and disadvantage in early childhood. In addition to the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme in November 2019, funding secured in Budget 2020 provided for a range of measure that will have a direct and positive impact on child poverty (i.e. increase in Working Family Payment thresholds, increase in earnings disregard for working lone parents receiving One-Parent Family Payment or Jobseeker's Transition Payment, pilot hot meals programme in school, pilot meal programme in early learning and care settings). Work also commenced on the development of a DEIS-type model for early learning and care settings, which will create further opportunities to narrow the gap for disadvantaged children.

The HSE is now working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients may have had, to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread. Dr. Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: \"Ireland remains in containment phase with just one case of community transmission. This is, however, a rapidly evolving situation. Public health doctors are working hard to ensure our containment measures are operating effectively. \"Most people who become infected with Covid-19 experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for some. \"However, this will need a national effort. Every individual needs to be aware of how to protect their own health and the health of others. \"The most important way they can do this is by following public health advice. Central to this are the protective measures we can all take against Covid-19, which include: wash your hands regularly with soap and water maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing\/sneezing avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth practice cough and sneeze hygiene - covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough\/sneeze. Then dispose of the tissue immediately stay informed: keep up to date on latest Covid-19 information on www.hse.ie \"At Tuesday's meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team, we established a sub-group to look at health and social care workers' protection. \"This will remain a priority as part of our response to Covid-19 in Ireland. We also need the public to play their role in preventing the spread of this new disease and protecting themselves and their loved ones.\" Dr. Colm Henry, the Chief Clinical Officer of the HSE, said: \"We appreciate the hard work and dedication of our frontline healthcare workers, who are essential to the Irish healthcare system as we deal with this emerging situation. \"Their ongoing commitment and professionalism will help us withstand the threat posed by Covid-19.\" Dr. Ronan Glynn, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health, said: \"There are actions every single worker in our healthcare system can and should take now: refocus your attention on handwashing and respiratory hygiene make sure you are trained in the appropriate use of Personal Protection Equipment most importantly, if you have been a contact of a confirmed case or if you have recently travelled back from an affected region, be alert to signs and symptoms of COVID-19 for a period of 14 days and do not go to work without first discussing with your local Department of Public Health.\" The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health. Any person who has travelled from an affected region in the last 14 days, or who has come in contact with a confirmed case in the last 14 days, and is concerned that they may have symptoms of Covid-19 (Coronavirus) should immediately isolate themselves from others and phone their GP. ENDS Notes to the Editor: The National Public Health Emergency Team case definition includes Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Iran and four regions in northern Italy (Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont) alongside mainland China. Anyone who has been to an affected region (mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Iran and four regions in northern Italy) in the last 14 days AND is experiencing symptoms should immediately self-isolate and call their GP. Anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19 in the last 14 days AND is experiencing symptoms should immediately self-isolate and call their GP anyone who has been to an affected region (China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, Iran and four regions in northern Italy) in the last 14 days, and are well, should visit www.HSE.ie for advice. It can take up to 14 days for symptoms of Covid-19 (Coronavirus) to show. Symptoms may include: a cough shortness of breath breathing difficulties fever (high temperature) Covid-19 (Coronavirus) can also cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Things you can do to protect yourself from getting Covid-19 (Coronavirus) include: wash your hand properly and regularly cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze Wash your hands properly and regularly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub: after coughing and sneezing after toilet use before eating before and after preparing food","649d579d4df0ba9ba188ffdcce2a43ea60e2a7d61dc19a109c3a48c85ccd91f2":"Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly TD has welcomed the publication of the sixth annual report of the National Healthcare Quality Reporting System (NHQRS), which gives an overview of quality in our health service. Findings are reported across 52 indicators from 11 data sources and cover data to the end of 2019. The Report highlights some of the areas where our healthcare system has been improving: Ireland compares well internationally on hospitalisation rates for heart failure and diabetes the 30-day in-hospital mortality for heart attack has decreased by 36% over 10 years since 2010, almost all breast cancer surgeries have been performed in designated cancer centres the majority of patients rate both their overall experience of in-patient care and maternity care as positive (over 80% rated experience as good or very good in both national surveys). 'Being treated with dignity and respect' is also rated positively cancer survival rates in Ireland continue to improve Speaking as the report was published, Minister Donnelly said: \"I am delighted to welcome the publication of the 2020 National Healthcare Quality Reporting System (NHQRS) by my department compiled from data received from across the health services. This is the sixth annual report and provides information on the quality of our healthcare services, including the patients experience, and showing how Ireland compares internationally. This is an important source of information for service providers, patients and their families and for policy makers. In particular, it offers the opportunity to identify areas where improvements can be made so that high quality, safe, patient centred care can continue to be a priority in our healthcare services. \"There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed immense challenges for everyone in society, and particularly for our healthcare workers and the health service as a whole. However, despite these immense challenges and adversity of the pandemic, publication of this NHQRS report shows the continued commitment, across the health service, to transparency and reporting on healthcare quality.\" He continued: \"Of note, data in the NHQRS Report for the 2019\/2020 flu season show improving rates of flu vaccine update by healthcare workers, a trend that is all the more important as we respond to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Uptake rates for other vaccines remain below target. We must all remember that vaccination is a critical part of the response in dealing with both flu each winter, and now with COVID-19.\" Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health, said: \"The NHQRS is now in its sixth cycle and the insights that the NHQRS Reports have provided over the years are already having a constructive impact in identifying areas for focussed improvement. The NHQRS is not an end in itself. This Report is used as a tool by health service providers and policy-makers to evaluate their services systematically and inform quality improvement initiatives. For example, the 2020 Report highlights the potential to improve our approach to cancer surgeries for colon and rectal cancer. However, as can be seen from this year's Report there are also areas where year-on-year improvements and enhancements are evident. For example, the Report highlights the very significant increase in screening for CPE colonisation and infection in recent years. Also importantly, this year's Report has expanded the indicators on patients' experience of health services to include the care experience of women who used our maternity services. I very much look forward to seeing future NHQRS Reports expand to take account of wider patient experience across the health and social care service.\" The information provided in this Report should be reviewed and examined by those tasked with the planning and delivery of healthcare and\/or the development of health policy locally, regionally and nationally. This information is important to ensure safe quality healthcare in Ireland through a process of systematic, continuous quality improvement. This is all the more important as we continue to respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, while delivering care to the many patient and families that use the health service every day. ENDS Notes Background The National Healthcare Quality Reporting System (NHQRS) is the Irish health indicator framework. An indicator is a measurement or value of an item and often used with the prefix performance, quality or health and used to provide comparable information and to track progress and performance over time. Since 2014 the NHQRS has produced an annual report that is published on the Department of Health website. In this 2020 report there are a total of 52 indicators, from 11 data sources, across five key domains. The NHQRS aims to provide a mechanism through which data or information about the quality of Ireland's healthcare structures, processes and outcomes can be made publicly available and compared against acceptable standards or best practice. The NHQRS and its governance structure is led by the Department of Health, through the Office of the Chief Medical Officer and the National Patient Safety Office (NPSO). Development of the report is supported by the Statistics and Analytics Unit, Department of Health. In 2016, a multi-agency committee was re-constituted to: provide oversight and advice on the strategic direction of the NHQRS to agree the selected indicators in line with international trends and health policy in Ireland to agree definitions and metadata for the indicators and to prepare and present an annual report to the Minister for Health Committee members facilitate communication between their own organisations in relation to the NHQRS processes and the annual report. A technical group supports the committee by providing expertise and experience in measuring and monitoring of healthcare using performance measures or indicators. The NHQRS annual report The publication of an annual report increases transparency in our healthcare system for the public and patient and also acts as a stimulus for improvements by health service providers through the identification of variation in practice and outcomes. In addition to the increased transparency in our healthcare system for the public and patient it also acts as a stimulus for improvements by health service providers through the identification of variation in practice and outcomes. The appropriate response to any reported differences in indicators is for service providers to further examine and to explain the positive and negative findings. This will necessitate more in-depth analysis and evaluation and will require follow up actions as appropriate to be taken. This report is designed to be used by healthcare service providers and policy makers to identify trends in healthcare quality and patient safety.

This represents a 25 per cent, or 13.7 billion increase on 2019; The rise in expenditure reflects increased departmental drawdown in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the areas of health and social protection; An Exchequer deficit of 12.3 billion was recorded in 2020, a 13 billion deterioration on the previous year. The Exchequer deficit is estimated to contribute to an overall general government deficit of 19 billion, or around 5 per cent of GDP. An Exchequer deficit of 12,316 million was recorded to end-December 2020. This compares to a surplus of 647 million in 2019. The 12,963 million year-on-year deterioration in the Exchequer balance is primarily driven by increases in voted expenditure. Cumulative tax receipts of 57,165 million at the end of the year were down by 3.6 per cent or 2,149 million on last year. Receipts in 2020 benefitted from a strong performance in January and February, as well as solid income and corporate tax receipts, which have compensated to an extent for sharp declines in other tax heads, notably VAT and excise receipts. Corporation tax was the only major tax head to record an increase in 2020, ending the year 945 million higher than 2019, as sectors such as pharma, ICT and financial services coped well with economic conditions. Income taxes similarly held up well, ending the year down 224 million, or 1 per cent on 2019. Although a strong start to the year (pre-Covid) is partly responsible, both PAYE and self-employed receipts significantly exceeded initial expectations. The sector specific nature of the majority of job losses combined with the progressivity of the income tax system served to protect income tax receipts in 2020. The combined year-on-year fall in VAT and excise receipts was 3,187 million, as personal consumption particularly of services was heavily impacted by the public health restrictions. Overall, the strength of corporation and income taxes compensated to a degree for the fall in consumption taxes resulting in a year-on-year decline of 2,149 million, or 3.6per cent in aggregate tax receipts. Total net voted expenditure was 67,849 million in 2020. In year-on-year terms, this was up 13,703 million, or 25.3 per cent on 2019. The rise in expenditure reflects increased departmental drawdown in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in relation to the Department of Health and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. Commenting on the figures, the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe T.D. said: \"The end-year Exchequer returns show the scale of Government intervention during this pandemic. From an expected surplus of around 2 billion before the pandemic struck, to an estimated deficit of 19 billion, the strength and depth of the Government's response is unprecedented in our country's history. Although we once again enter a difficult period of tough but necessary restrictions, today's figures point to some positive underlying trends in the economy. The Government will continue to use the resources of the State to protect the most vulnerable, support businesses and sustain incomes until our country emerges from this pandemic even stronger than before.\" The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael McGrath T.D. said: 'The figures published today show the full extent of the Government response to Covid-19 in 2020. Gross Voted Expenditure in 2020 reached 85.3 billion, nearly 18 billion higher than 2019. Just under 5 billion was spent on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment in 2020 together with 4.1 billion for the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and its successor the Employment Wage Subsidy scheme, demonstrating the scale of the government's commitment to protecting household income for people across the State. Gross Voted Expenditure on Health grew by 3.4 billion to nearly 20.9 billion ensuring that the necessary resources were available to procure vital equipment, support vulnerable citizens and build a testing and tracing regime for the virus. Budget 2021 was based on a prudent \"no vaccine\" assumption and both the Recovery Fund and the Covid Contingency Reserve are designed to ensure the funding is in place to continue the national fightback against this unprecedented challenge. I welcome the international confidence in the Irish economy and our public finances as indicated by continuing very low Government bond yields which are supported by the actions of the ECB.\"","689d68d20d14cd1b40b0d7248b44518be21547c96515d4e8c5e9bc3fded7a272":"1.

Minister Zappone welcomed expert guidance provided by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) written specifically for the childcare sector. The guidance, developed in consultation with her department, focuses on a \"play-pod\" model. The \"play pod\" model restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, which is not possible with young children. The purpose of 'play-pods' is to limit the number of people a child has contact with, to facilitate tracing, and to support close, positive interactions between children and their adult caregivers, like in a key-worker system. This system will also reduce the amount of contact adults have with each other. Where possible, there should be two adults in a 'play-pod', to allow breaks without need for floating staff. The maximum size of a 'play-pod' will be confirmed in the coming days. Services will now be asked to apply the guidance to their setting and determine what capacity they may offer. It is expected that a significant amount of capacity will be available in individual services that reopen in the summer, subject to, for example, their space, room layout and staffing availability. Whilst there are 4,500 Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare services in the country, fewer than 2,000 of these normally remain open in July and August. The HPSC guidance developed by their Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control Division (AMRIC) on 'Infection Prevention and Control guidance for settings providing childcare during the COVID-19 Pandemic' was agreed by NPHET's Expert Advisory Group this week and will be published on the HPSC website today. As services reopen, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will keep the operation of the guidance under close review and take appropriate updated action as required. The Minister also announced which children would be eligible to resume full or part-time childcare services from 29 June. Whilst initially the government Roadmap had indicated that services would resume only for the children of essential workers, this has now been widened. Subject to local capacity, services are encouraged to support: children of health and social care workers, other frontline workers, childcare practitioners and parents who need access to childcare in order to return to work vulnerable children sponsored under the National Childcare Scheme(NCS) (for example, children who are homeless and Tusla referrals) and children funded through legacy childcare schemes who are experiencing poverty, disadvantage or child welfare issues children with disabilities who previously attended part or full-time early learning and care, including those preparing to start school in September children previously registered in childcare services on March 12, whose parents continue to need childcare for employment or training purposes and who were assured that they would retain their place through conditions attached to the department's Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS). If capacity issues emerge, priority should be given to the children of essential or frontline workers Childminders will also be able to resume looking after children in the childminder's home from 29 June, while complying with HPSC advice. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been engaging intensively with a number of organisations representing the childcare sector, through an Advisory Group. It is preparing a range of additional guidance and resources to assist the sector to prepare for reopening. These will start to issue in the coming days and continue over the 4 remaining weeks before opening. Speaking after today's Government meeting, Minister Zappone said: \"My department is delighted to have this detailed health guidance from the HPSC to help services plan for reopening. I am also very appreciative to the many representatives of the sector on the Advisory Group who have assisted with the planning to date and who will continue to assist with further resources over the coming 4 weeks.\" The department has conducted research to ascertain the level of demand among parents to assess the level of demand from parents for childcare services. IPSOS MRBI carried out a survey of 563 households with children under the age of 15 years. This was conducted from 22 24 May 2020. Preliminary data has revealed a number of important findings in relation to parents' childcare arrangements during the COVID-19 restrictions, and their plans once restrictions are eased in line with the government's Roadmap. Key findings include that: prior to restrictions, over half of respondents (56%) cared for their children in their home, with 27% availing of centre-based Early Learning and Care or School-Aged Childcare. A further 18% had the support of grandparents, while 15% used childminders for their childcare needs unsurprisingly, since restrictions have been in place, the majority of parents (97%) have reported caring for their children at home while 27% of parents were availing of centre-based care prior to restrictions, looking ahead to when restrictions are initially lifted, 13% of parents intend to return their children to centre-based care Acknowledging the findings, Minister Zappone noted: \"The voice of parents is key to how we move towards the phased re-opening of childcare services. They will make choices in the best interests of their children and their families. Understanding their intentions and concerns will allow my department to plan with greater precision, addressing concerns parents may have.\" With the support of Pobal and Better Start, the department is also currently conducting research among Childcare Providers across the country. Whilst demand for services may be lower than it was in March, some working parents who were using childcare services before the closures on 12 March will be reassured to know that they may now have the option to return to the service. The Minister is strongly encouraging service providers and parents to make contact with each other so that the level of demand and supply for places from 29 June onwards can be known. Minister Zappone said: \"For the sake of children, families and our economy, I hope that those childcare services that normally operate over the summer will be able to resume their service on 29 June. This is essential so that parents can get back to work. This is a national effort. The Trojan efforts of our frontline workers have assisted us this far. I know that all of those who can play a part in getting our economy on a recovery path will do so. It is also very important that vulnerable children will be able to access early learning and care services, as soon as they are permitted to reopen. Children and families are at the heart of our plan. Re-opening childcare will be as child centred as possible and as much risk as possible will be mitigated. The safety and wellbeing of children and enabling them resume social interaction and play with their friends is what we are focused on.\" ENDS Notes to the Editor: The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is prioritising the actions necessary for reopening full and part-time childcare services on 29 June. Once these are advanced, priority will move to planning for the resumption of ECCE (free pre-school programme) at the end of August. Consultation The department is undertaking extensive consultation and research in developing the plan for phased reopening of childcare services. This includes the establishment of an expert Advisory Group to review and develop proposals. The Group includes representatives chosen by the childcare sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Early Childhood Ireland, the National Childhood Network, the National Community Forum, PLE and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. Collectively members represent tens of thousands of providers and staff. The Minister has also established a Reference Group, to supplement the work of the Advisory Group on phased service reopening, and to give an opportunity for input to provider representatives who are not on the Advisory Group. The Reference Group had its first meeting yesterday, 28 May, and the Advisory Group will meet again next week.

This research call specifically focuses on tackling the rising threat of antibiotic resistance, an issue of critical importance to the Agriculture, Food and Health sectors. The call, supported by the European Commission, includes 30 funding organisations from 21 member countries and including commitments from the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine under its support for Research has a total estimated call budget is 24.9 million. On drawing attention to this new Call, the Minister commented that \"this call will lead to innovative interventions to control the development and transmission of antibiotic resistance in and\/or between One Health settings.\" He continued that \"in order to successfully address AMR the primary goal of the agri-food sector must be to reduce antibiotic usage through maintaining the highest possible standards in animal health.\" The call invites eligible Research Performing Organisations to submit collaborative research proposals directed at addressing the issue. Through this research call, it is intended to create and reinforce the collaboration between research partners coming from different countries and different fields of expertise to promote research on antibiotic resistance. Concluding, the Minister wished the applicants every success with their applications stating that \"the new knowledge, technologies and innovations that will emerge from this Call to provide valuable evidence for policy development and useful tools to help us meet the targets set out in the European Green Deal. I have no doubt that the research and innovation community in Ireland will take full advantage of this opportunity by submitting excellent proposals.\" Notes for editor: JPIAMR is a global collaborative platform, engaging 28 member nations to curb antibiotic resistance (AMR) with a One Health approach. The initiative coordinates national funding to support transnational research and activities within the six priority areas of the shared JPIAMR Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda therapeutics, diagnostics, surveillance, transmission, environment and interventions. What is AMR? Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is resistance of a microorganism to a drug that was originally effective for treatment of infections caused by that microorganism. Resistant microorganisms (including bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites) are able to withstand attack by antimicrobial drugs, such as antibacterial drugs (e.g., antibiotics), anti-fungals, anti-virals, and anti-malarials, so that standard treatments become ineffective and infections persist, increasing the risk of spread to others. What does 'One Health' mean? The 'One Health' concept is a worldwide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment. Recognising that human health, animal health and ecosystem health are inextricably linked, 'One Health' seeks to promote, improve and defend the health and well-being of all species by enhancing cooperation and collaboration between physicians, veterinarians, other scientific health and environmental professionals and by promoting strengths in leadership and management to achieve these goals.

The Minister emphasised his concerns regarding the response of insurers to the Covid 19 crisis, the need for them to play their part in the recovery phase while ensuring a sufficient focus on the cost and supply of insurance by insurers. Key points made by the Minister included: The unprecedented measures taken by Government to address the challenges of Covid 19 and the importance of the insurance sector playing their part; Acknowledgement of the various clarifications that Insurance Ireland made regarding business interruption insurance, in particular about where there is ambiguity in the policy that insurers will interpret it in favour of the consumer, and also that their members recognise that the Government advice to close is the same as a direction; Concern that some insurers have adopted a \"blanket\" rejection of all business interruption claims. Failure to pay certain policies in the context of the industry clarifications reinforced the Minister's view that some insurers were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly; An emphasis on the fact that Insurance Ireland members, who have agreed to do so, must deliver on their commitments made regarding Forbearance and Business Premises. Those who have not yet signed up are encouraged to do so; A call that, on Motor Insurance, insurers must be pro-active and generous in relation to their treatment of motor insurance policyholders. In this regard, he pointed out that a combination of the very profitable part of this market over last 12 months when combined with what is likely to be a significant reduction in claims for this period, provided a strong case for some type of refund of premium package. Thus providing some financial relief to their customers in this extraordinary time; Finally, an indication that the cost and supply of insurance remains his priority and will be also be a priority for the new Government and the industry needs to actively engage on the reform agenda. Minister Donohoe said: 'The main message that I wanted to convey to the insurance industry, through Insurance Ireland, is the need for the industry to help itself and do the right thing by customers during this time. I made it clear that failure to do so will be very damaging for the longer term reputation of the sector'. \"I also thanked Insurance Ireland for the agreement they facilitated last week on forbearance and closed premises, but I emphasized the need for insurers to deliver on it and for those that haven't signed up to do so.

This Bill gives Credit Unions discretion for the first time ever to convene wholly or partly virtual Annual General Meetings (AGMs). The new measures have been introduced in response to public health guidelines restricting gatherings (including AGMs) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislation has extended the date by which Credit Unions can hold their AGMs, from the end of January to April 2021. These provisions will facilitate greater participation by Credit Union members at their AGMs. Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Sean Fleming TD said: \"I want to thank the Credit Union movement, the directors and staff for supporting and assisting their members during COVID-19. Credit Unions are embedded in our communities and have always been instrumental in helping people and small businesses. This legislation empowers Credit Unions with flexibility to convene general meetings during this unprecedented time.\" \"I look forward to working with the sector to address the many challenges facing the Credit Union movement.\" ENDS","72d872b6e4a5e06aca29e524da668798f4e03e80d24385decd52d8da6f85e24a":"1.

Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection Regina Doherty emphasised: \"Where employers, who have to cease trading because of the impact of social distancing, continue to pay workers they will be able to claim refunds from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. A temporary refund scheme is being established for this purpose. This refund will be for 203 per worker per week. This means that workers retain their link with employers and there is no need for them personally to submit a jobseekers claim.\" The Minister explained that refunds will take some time to process but in the meantime the Banks will provide working capital finance in the form of overdrafts or short-term loans to cover costs. The Minister announced that in addition to this fund, the department is introducing a new scheme for anyone whose employer is unable to continue to pay them due to a downturn in business. Minister Doherty will bring to Cabinet tomorrow details of the new scheme. This evening, Minister Doherty stated: \"Ireland has entered uncharted territory as a consequence of the spread of Covid-19. This is now both a public health and economic issue. \"In light of the significant volumes of jobseeker applications expected this week, the department will from tomorrow be introducing a new Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment specifically designed to get thousands of people into payment as quickly as possible.\" The new payment that has been put in place will be available to all employees and the self-employed who have lost employment due to a downturn in economic activity caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The payment will have a simple one-page application form and will be paid for a period of 6 weeks at a flat rate payment of 203 per week. Individuals applying for the payment will be required to apply for the normal jobseeker's payments within this 6 week period. Once this normal jobseeker claim is subsequently received, the department will process these claims and reconcile payments at that time. This will involve backdating increased payments for certain customers. For those workers whose employers do lay them off without pay, and mindful of social distancing requirements, there is no need to visit an Intreo Centre. Intreo Centres have to apply social distancing recommendations so queues will be long and people who call may have to wait a long time. Application forms can be downloaded online and submitted by post. Those people with a registered MyGovID account can make their claim online. People are asked to assist the department over the next few days by applying for income support from the department through our online channels. Information for people claiming a payment There is no need for to attend your local Intreo Centre but you can apply in the following ways: 1) An application form for the new Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment can be downloaded here and returned to us at Free Post, PO BOX 12896, Dublin 1 OR 2) You can apply for another income support from us through our online portal www.MyWelfare.ie (you will need a Public Services Card) OR 3) Phone us on 1890 800 024 or 01 2481398 and we will send you the relevant application form for the new payment Minister Doherty added: \"I want to reassure our clients that the department will process all applications for income support as soon as possible. The new payment will speed this process up and ensure that our customers receive a payment from the department in as short a time as possible. Payments will issue based on date of application, not date of processing, meaning that all payments will be back dated. We would ask customers to please keep checking your Bank Account as payment may issue in advance of us formally notifying you.\" None ENDS","8e2ada89697cd797562c8979bd87ac616c77658515dec04c14805edb05ca9c2f":"Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys, TD, today held a virtual meeting with the Labour Market Advisory Council (LMAC). Minister Humphreys briefed the Council on her plans to enhance employment services in response to the Covid 19 crisis. This includes expanding case worker capacity, reviewing contracted service provision, implementing a new work experience placement programme, increasing and expanding training supports, increasing places on State Employment Schemes such as TUS and CE, extending enterprise\/self-employment grants, and enhancing recruitment subsidies. The Minister sought feedback from the LMAC on the plans and its input into the design of the schemes proposed. In doing so, the Minister said: \"Although we are now back into a period of restrictions we are actively planning to move quickly on the rollout of these vital additional supports as soon as restrictions are lifted. \"In total we plan to spend 2.2bn on employment programme provision in 2021. The Department is working with its stakeholders such as the LMAC to fine-tune its plans and has already started engaging with its partners such as those in the education and training sector and with employers to ensure that we can hit the ground running to provide as many opportunities as possible to as many people as possible as early as possible once restrictions are lifted. \"The LMAC, an expert group of experienced labour market practitioners, worker representatives and employers has already given advice to the Government on how we should do this and today I briefed it on the steps we now intend to take. I have asked the LMAC to provide further feedback and advice to me and will take this into account as we finalise the details of how we will implement the actions set out.\" In total, including funding under the July Stimulus and in Budget 2021, the Government is providing up to 2.2 billion for employment and activation programmes in 2021 primarily by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Further and Higher Education. In light of the pandemic's economic impact the Department of Social Protection is enhancing the capacity of the Public Employment Service to support employees who have permanently lost their job. The Department has also introduced and continues to develop new measures aimed at subsidising employment, developing work experience opportunities and enhancing the supports and services available to people who may wish to seek to expand their skillset and avail of education, training and employment supports. Examples of the measures being taken by the Department of Social Protection to increase capacity include: An additional 300 staff to work in the Department during 2021 including expanding the capacity of Intreo Centres to provide employment services and supports with the assignment of an additional 100 Job Coaches. Recruitment for these posts has started and it is intended to fill these positions over the next number of weeks. The expansion of the footprint of the community based contracted service into 4 new geographical areas where a Local Employment Service does not currently exist. In addition to expanding the service footprint the Department has extended the existing Local Employment Service, Job Clubs, JobPath and Employability contracts into 2021. In recognition of the challenges facing the labour market in a post Covid-19 environment, there will be a need to have an expanded Public Employment Service in place to offer guidance and advice to those who will be seeking employment. The Department recognises that, given the shock to the labour market and the economy, not all jobs may return once we move on from COVID public health restrictions. To this end the Government is investing in expanding the Public Employment Services, through increasing the capacity in the Intreo Centres as well as through contracted service providers to ensure that these supports are available when they are required, in 2021. Young jobseekers can now benefit from the JobsPlus scheme after being unemployed for 4 months instead of 12 months, which had previously been the case. This means that an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy once they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months. This will help make it more attractive to recruit young people who face particular difficulties in securing a footing in employment. A recent evaluation of these schemes undertaken jointly by the EU Commission's Joint Research Centre and the Department found that participation on this scheme had very positive impacts on employment outcomes and earnings for participants. The JobsPlus evaluation is available here. The Department is working closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education to identify training needs and ensure that jobseekers can access the range of schemes. The Department of Further and Higher Education is investing significantly in over 35,000 new places on programmes for unemployed jobseekers as part of the July Stimulus and the Department of Social Protection's case officers and job coaches will work with jobseekers to ensure that they are made aware of and referred to these programmes. Minister Humphreys and Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris TD, will be announcing further initiatives over the coming period. Note for Editors Measures relating to the Minister's discussion with the LMAC include:- Work Experience Placement Programme Building on the existing Youth Employment Support Scheme a new funded work experience placement programme is being developed to provide work experience for up to 10,000 jobseekers, of any age, who have been unemployed for more than six months (including periods in receipt of a PUP payment). It is envisaged that the scheme will be formally launched later this year. In the meantime, any employer who is willing to act as a host organisation for these work experience placements can register their interest at Recruitment Subsidies JobsPlus Under the JobsPlus Scheme employers receive a recruitment subsidy, paid over two years, of between 7,500 and 10,000 for each person that they recruit from the Live Register. As announced as part of the July Stimulus Package, the Government has agreed measures to make it easier for employers to help young jobseekers (under 30 years of age) benefit from the JobsPlus scheme. Young jobseekers can now benefit from the JobsPlus scheme after being unemployed for 4 months instead of 12 months, which had previously been the case. This means that an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy once they employ a young person who has been unemployed for just 4 months. This will help make it more attractive to recruit young people who face particular difficulties in securing a footing in employment. Criteria for availability for subsidies available to employers hiring unemployed people under this scheme have also been widened for other age groups meaning more people now qualify for the maximum subsidy of 10,000. State Employment Schemes State Employment Schemes are schemes that provide people with an opportunity to work part-time in their community and, in so doing, acquire valuable work experience and skills while receiving an additional payment on top of their normal jobseeker payment. These schemes include the Community Employment, TUS and the Rural Social Scheme. The number of places available on these schemes is being increased by 3,000. The Department is currently working with the Community Employment and TUS sponsors to establish the additional places and it is expected that they will come on stream over the next 4 5 months. Training Supports\/Grants The Department works closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education to identify training needs and ensure that jobseekers can access these schemes. The Department of Further and Higher Education is investing significantly in over 35,000 new places on programmes for unemployed jobseekers as part of the July Stimulus and the Department of Social Protection's case officers and job coaches will work with jobseekers to ensure that they are made aware of and referred to these programmes. In addition, the Department is directly supporting jobseekers to access short duration training programmes by increasing the value of the grant it pays to jobseekers to take up a short employment focused course from 500 to 1,000. This is estimated to benefit at least 12,000 jobseekers in 2021. As announced in Budget 2021, a new 1,000 training grant per person is also being introduced to help people with disabilities access training through the Employability service. Supports for the Self-Employed The Department already supports people who wish to enter self-employment through schemes like the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (which enables a person on establishing a business to keep all or part of their jobseeker payment for up to two years while starting the business). These supports are now being enhanced: Budget 2021 provided for self-employed workers on PUP including those in the arts, entertainment industry and taxi drivers to re-commence their self-employment and earn up to 480 gross per month while continuing to receive their full PUP payment. The availability of the Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme is being extended to the self-employed who come off PUP or a jobseeker payment. Instead, they will receive a partial jobseeker payment while retaining the income from their employment. It is particularly suited to self-employed people on PUP whose income exceeds 480 a month. The Enterprise Support Grant for small\/micro enterprises is being extended into next year with a further 12 million. The purpose of this scheme is to enable the payment of a 1,000 'restart' grant to small self-employed business owners who move from PUP to help them with re-opening their business.

Minister Brophy made the pledge at the 2021 International Donors' Conference in Solidarity with Venezuelan Refugees and Migrants convened by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the International Organisation of Migration and the Government of Canada. Minister Brophy said: \"Forced displacement of children, women and men in regions all over the world is one of the most challenging problems facing us and we have heard today of the terrible plight of those who are forced to flee because of the crisis inside Venezuela. The exodus of Venezuelans from their home country is at historic levels. The impact on human lives remains critical and the situation has been further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Minister Brophy commended countries in the region for their generosity towards the victims of the crisis: \"Countries neighbouring Venezuela have shown exceptional solidarity to those forced to leave. Now it is more crucial than ever that the international community shows increased solidarity with these countries.\" In announcing the funding pledge Minister Brophy called on the international community to engage and work with all stakeholders in Venezuela: \"The international community needs to engage and work with all stakeholders in the country to support a peaceful, negotiated and democratic solution to the crisis. The solution should be led and owned by the long suffering people of Venezuela.\" Notes The crisis in Venezuela has had a devastating effect on Venezuelans with many forced to leave the country. The exodus from the country is the largest in the recent history of Latin America. More than 5.4 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants are outside the country, with 4.6 million in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Many Venezuelan refugees and migrants working in the informal economy in the wider region have lost their livelihoods. As a result, a growing number of Venezuelans are returning home. Latin America and the Caribbean remains one of the worst affected regions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indigenous communities and Venezuelan refugees and migrants are particularly vulnerable. In 2020 Irish Aid provided 1 million in 2021 to the UNHCR the UN Refugee Agency - in response to the Venezuelan Migrant Crisis. 2m is being provided in 2021. This is in addition to Ireland's core funding to the global humanitarian system, including over 20 million in core support to UNHCR, IOM, the ICRC and the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund. A grant of 500,000 was also made to the OCHA Venezuela Country Based Pooled Fund (CBPF) in December 2020. In addition, Irish Aid emergency relief supplies were recently delivered to the Colombian Red Cross for Venezuelan refugees in Colombia from Ireland's prepositioned stocks in the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in Panama.","842bc69c30dbff6a95fcd95c4db9e940f273d1b0dd8b9ba1cafff75436edfdc4":"Today's cases The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has today been notified of 14 additional deaths related to COVID-19.

Together with the GDPR, this Regulation will ensure a comprehensive and coherent approach to the free movement of all data in the EU. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Every individual, business or organisation has the right to use, collect, store, transfer or manage non-personal data, and to use data centres or cloud services anywhere within the EU.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This can help avoid any potential duplication of costs; for example, IT infrastructure can be centralised in one EU country, even if they operate in multiple countries\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Non-personal data is information that cannot be linked to an identified or identifiable person, such as data which is:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tgenerated as part of business processes (for example, business to business invoices)\n\tgenerated by connected industrial devices (sensors communicating recorded data, such as for weather apps)\n\trecorded for maintenance requirements (for example, industrial robots, streets, bridges etc.)\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Personal data and mixed data sets\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The rules for dealing with personal data differ from those for non-personal data.

Joe O'Brien, TD, Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, today announced funding of over 51 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund to address disadvantage right across the country. Money in the Dormant Accounts Fund can be used to fund measures that address economic, social, or educational disadvantage and to support people with a disability. The 2021 Action Plan allocates funding of 51 million to 46 measures to be delivered across 10 Government Departments. Some examples of measures approved for funding include: 6.4 million for investment in sports in disadvantaged communities and for persons with disabilities. 6 million for youth and community justice services aimed at countering the influence and impacts of crime on young people and in communities. 2.3 million to support social enterprises to address social and economic disadvantage. 1 million for a youth initiative to provide young people with the soft skills needed to improve employability. Launching the Action Plan today, Minister O'Brien said : \"I am delighted to launch the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2021 which provides funding of over 51 million to help address disadvantage right across Ireland. The 46 measures approved for funding in 2021 will be implemented across Government and will help to address a diverse range of issues such as long term unemployment, youth disadvantage, migrant integration and probation supports to prevent re-offending.\" The Minister continued : \"Dormant Accounts funding makes a real difference to individuals and communities right across the country. The Navan Travellers Workshop, It's Good to Talk Counselling Service in Wexford and the Lucan Disability Action Group are examples of two organisations that recently received support from the Dormant Accounts Fund through the COVID 19 Stability Fund. \" \"Dormant Accounts Funding is helping vulnerable individuals, supporting social inclusion, and strengthening our communities. The 2021 Action Plan being published today will help ensure that we can continue to support those who need it most during these challenging times.\" The Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan 2021 is available to download here. ENDS Notes for editors: #DAF2021 In total, 46 different measures, to the value of 51 million will be supported under the 2021 Action Plan. A full list of measures to be funded under the 2021 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan is set out in the table below. Many measures have been funded in previous Action Plans and have now been approved for continued funding in 2021 to enable the measures to operate again next year. The majority of approved measures will progress in 2021, with each Government Department responsible for delivery of their own measures. Measures can progress over a number of years with funding drawn down from the Fund as spending is incurred. This Action Plan builds on previous plans and ensures continued support for individuals and organisations right across the country. Funding under the 2021 Action Plan has increased to 51 million from 45.5 million. This builds further on a strong growth in spend in recent years, based on the resources in the fund, and compares to 28.5 million approved in the 2016 Action Plan. Separately, in 2020, Dormant Accounts Funding has also funded 50 million in once-off supports for charities, community and voluntary organisations, and social enterprises in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This funding is currently being disbursed to successful applicants under the Covid-19 Stability Fund (45 million) and the Covid-19 Innovate Together Fund (5 million). Background to the Dormant Accounts Fund The Dormant Accounts Acts 2001-2012, together with the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003, provide a framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts in credit institutions (i.e. banks, building societies and An Post) and unclaimed life assurance policies in insurance undertakings. The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account or policy holders with their funds in credit institutions or insurance undertakings and in this regard, these bodies are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies. However, in order to utilise the unused funds the legislation also introduced a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed from dormant accounts and unclaimed policies for the purposes of measures to assist: 1. the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; 2. the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged or 3. persons with a disability.

The exceptions for the Christmas period are designed to support people to have a meaningful Christmas, albeit different to other years. The main objective is to stay safe and keep the COVID-19 numbers down so that we can maintain the lowest possible level of restrictions into the New Year. Guidance and advice will be available on gov.ie, supported by communications campaigns. People are advised to plan their activities in advance, to limit their contacts throughout this period, to keep celebrations small, that outdoors is safer than indoors and to ensure good ventilation if indoors with other people. The measures are as follows: From 1 December, under Level 3, as set out in the Plan for Living with COVID-19: weddings with up to 25 guests are permitted (same as current provisions) funerals with up to 25 mourners are permitted (same as current provisions) no organised indoor events should take place, other than as provided below gatherings of 15 people may take place outdoors non-contact training may take place outdoors in pods of 15 only individual training should take place indoors and no exercise or dance classes are permitted no matches\/events may take place except professional and elite sports, approved inter-county Gaelic games, horse-racing and approved equestrian events, all behind closed doors gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools may reopen for individual training only nightclubs, discos and casinos should remain closed hotels, guesthouses, B&Bs may open with services limited to residents only non-essential retail and personal services may reopen people should continue to work from home unless absolutely necessary to attend in person public transport capacity is limited to 50% From 1 December: households should not mix with any other households outside those within their bubble people should stay within their county apart from work, education and other essential purposes From 4 December: restaurants and pubs operating as restaurants (serving a substantial meal) may reopen for indoor dining with additional restrictions, (including requirement for meals to be prepared on site, inside the premises). This includes access for non-residents to restaurants in hotels higher, further and adult education should remain primarily online Adjustments for the Christmas Period From 1 December: places of worship to reopen for services with restrictive measures, subject to review in January museums, galleries, and libraries to reopen cinemas to reopen wet pubs to remain closed except for takeaway\/delivery From 18 December to 6 January: households can mix with up to two other households travel outside your county to be permitted From 7 January, the measures put in place prior to 18 December will apply, subject to ongoing review of the trajectory of the virus. The measures for cross-border travel will be the same as for travel between all other counties, that is, from 1 December, people should stay within their county apart from work, education and other essential purposes while from 18 December to 6 January, travel outside the county is permitted. It has further been agreed that the use of face coverings is now recommended in crowded workplaces, places of worship and in busy or crowded outdoor spaces where there is significant congregation. Additional seasonal support through CRSS will be provided to qualifying businesses that will remain closed due to public health restrictions introduced by the government to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is in recognition of the additional financial impact on those businesses of being closed at Christmas, which for many would be a particularly busy trading period. The government also noted the progress of the HSE in building capacity across critical care beds and acute services, restoration of cancer and community support services and the actions taken to mitigate the immediate risks as a result of Winter pressures and COVID-19 case increases. Work on the development of the Testing and Tracing capability has been intensive. Recruitment of test and tracing staff has been a priority and performance in test and tracing turn-around times continues to improve. Testing capacity is now 140,000 per week. The first full meeting of the High-Level Task Force on COVID-19 Vaccination took place on 23 November 2020. The Task Force will work with the Department of Health and the HSE to have a national COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy and Implementation Plan prepared for Government on 11 December 2020.

The Minister stated, \"I am aware that Irish horses have been competing across Europe in recent weeks. My officials met with representatives of Horse Sport Ireland and the Irish Equine Centre yesterday (2 March) to develop an appropriate risk mitigating response. Whilst this is not a notifiable disease, given the extent that the virus seems to have spread across Europe and the description of the clinical outcome, I strongly endorse the recommendation from that meeting that all those competing horses, on returning to Ireland follow the EHV-1 protocol for returning FEI horses, to isolate and carry out two PCR tests prior to completing quarantine.\" EHV is a herpes virus that is spread widely across the world including Ireland, where it usually manifests as a respiratory of reproductive disease and occasionally in a paralytic form. Given its ubiquitous nature and the availability of a vaccine, EHV is not a notifiable disease. The disease can be contained by isolation and testing. The Irish Equine Centre is an OIE reference laboratory for EHV and provides support to industry with their expert advice. EHV is covered by industry codes of practice, in particular the prevention of EHV infection in breeding stock through good management and hygiene practices as well as regular vaccination. EHV has no zoonotic impacts. The Minister concluded by recalling the critical importance of animal health in all animal based production systems and no more so than in equine sectors. Note for Editors: 1. Clinical Signs: EHV-1 may manifest in many ways. Typically horses will develop a fever, and develop respiratory signs such as a serous (thin, watery) nasal discharge and occasional cough. Some horses may also show submandibular lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes under their jaw) and ocular discharge. In some cases, when the virus has a specific genotype, EHV-1 can manifest with neurological symptoms. These can be of variable severity, ranging from mild ataxia (in co-ordination) and paresis (weakness), to full recumbency with an inability to stand as well as urinary and fecal incontinence. EHV-1 infected pregnant mares will likely suffer a late-term abortion of their pregnancy. In some circumstances, if they only became infected with the virus late in their gestation, they may not abort, but give birth to a foal that is infected with the virus, which will likely die of severe complications in their respiratory and hepatic systems as well as bone marrow dysfunction. Ensuring broodmares are properly vaccinated for EHV-1\/EHV-4 is important as part of good biosecurity and prevention of EHV infection in breeding stock. 2. Summary of Outbreak on the Continent: An outbreak of Equine Herpes Virus (EHV-1) occurred at the CES Valencia Spring Tour (ESP), with horses that were in attendance at the venue from at least 1st February 2021 potentially exposed to the virus. Numerous horses at the venue subsequently displayed clinical symptoms of the virus, including neurological symptoms, and to-date four horses have died. A certain number of horses which left Valencia and travelled back to their home countries (FR, BEL, DE) have subsequently developed clinical signs of the virus as well. Veterinary authorities are on-site in Valencia to deal with the outbreak, carry out the necessary testing and treatment of clinically-affected animals. Those horses requiring more intensive care are being managed in isolation units in tertiary level equine hospitals.

The largest international weather prediction research consortium world-wide, ACCORD will focus on developing world-leading weather forecasting systems to provide the best possible support to society, based on knowledge leading research and pioneering supercomputing technology. Eoin Moran, Director of Met Eireann, said: \"ACCORD is a step change in localising weather prediction for Europe and Ireland linking knowledge-leading science to deliver even better, more localised,weather forecasts to the Irish public.\" ACCORD builds on Europe's impressive tradition of cooperation in meteorology. EUMETSAT provides Europe with advanced weather satellite capability; EUMETNET coordinates weather and climate observations across Europe; while ECMWF is the undisputed leader in global weather prediction. ACCORD will collaborate closely with each of these international organisations to provide the very best weather prediction capability for Ireland and Europe. Advanced high resolution short-range weather prediction models are developed through the research efforts of National Meteorological Services such as Met Eireann. Since the 1980s, owing to the complex and specialised scientific endeavor involved, National Meteorological Services have by necessity collaborated within several international consortia, with Met Eireann becoming a member of HIRLAM (High-Resolution Limited Area Model) in 1989. ACCORD is in fact a merger of the 3 existing consortia, ALADIN, HIRLAM and LACE, resulting in a unique collaboration of twenty-six countries of Europe and Northern Africa. Research scientists working at Met Eireann will contribute knowledge and expertise in areas including mathematical modelling, data assimilation, observation pre-processing, model numerics and physics, machine learning, nowcasting and ensemble prediction. Dr. Saji Varghese, Head of Research in Met Eireann and chair of the consortium's Science committee commented: \"We will advance and strengthen research in the complex science of weather prediction, develop new algorithms to take advantage of the opportunities from parallel computer architectures and tackle the challenge of massive data flows. We will enhance and evolve the development of our numerical weather prediction model code, and extend cooperation on new components of the modelling system.\" While the consortium will collaborate on science and development, the production and delivery of operational weather forecasts will continue to be provided on a national basis. The operational numerical weather prediction systems will receive regular upgrades to include the scientific and technical innovations developed within the 26-member consortium. With our joint effort, we will accelerate the improvement of weather forecasts which will have a knock-on effect on the many sectors of society that rely on accurate weather information.
