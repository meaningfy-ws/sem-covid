While all of our hard work is certainly paying off, we are seeing downward trends, the number of hospitalisations is stabilising and the positivity rate is decreasing, but cases remain high \u2013 this week\u2019s daily rates have been on a par with those seen last April.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the last few days we have seen case numbers in excess of 800 a day. It is worth remembering that per thousand cases you can expect somewhere between 35-50 people will need to be hospitalised, between 4-6 people will be admitted to ICU and most tragically, somewhere between 10-15 people will lose their lives. That is still a lot of people going to hospital, it is still a lot of people ending up in ICU, and it is still, most tragically, a lot of people dying of COVID-19.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Numbers in hospital are still more than double seen at the peak of the October wave and numbers in ICU are still at 158 yesterday. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The message that I want to emphasise is that we cannot let our guard down. The virus, and especially the new variant, which is now dominant here, spreads more easily than that which was circulating earlier in the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The best way to protect ourselves from either getting the virus or passing it on to someone else is to stick with our own households and avoid meeting people outside of this. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Visits to others homes or a return to the office for those who can work from home are still off the agenda for now.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minimising our contacts outside of our own households in every way we can will buy us time to keep the virus suppressed while giving a chance to more vulnerable people to get their vaccines.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Mobility\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thankfully, an improvement in weather means exercising outside is more attractive. We should take every chance to exercise \u2013 it\u2019s good for both our physical and mental health but please stick within your 5km from home and keep that 2m distance from others. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        With more people moving around the same 5km radius, it may get crowded \u2013 if it is crowded, consider changing the time you exercise. Try a different place or route that might be less crowded. If you are out and it is crowded, wear a face covering. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It\u2019s evident that people are beginning to move around again \u2013 we have seen a slight increase in the last week in traffic volumes which are up around 2%, retail and recreation numbers are up 7% and workplaces up nearly 3%. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So far, people have been incredibly compliant with what we are asking you to do but we need to be patient a little longer.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Staying at home is as important as ever. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Workplaces\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        You should only be in work if you are an essential worker and have to be in the workplace. If that is the case it is vital to keep your guard up. Follow the guidance during work, remember that this includes breaktime \u2013 avoiding congregating over coffee and if you are with colleagues \u2013 stay two metres apart and wear a mask when you are not eating or drinking. If you can avoid travelling to and from work with colleagues you should do so and if you do, wear and mask and keep the windows open.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Most importantly, if you have any symptoms \u2013 isolate, and stay at home, contact your GP to get a test as soon as possible. Similarly, if you are a close contact, stay at home and come forward for a test.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Shop safely\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        While visits to supermarkets are essential, it is important that retailers and customers remember to stick to all of the measures that have served us so well through the pandemic. Mask wearing, keeping physical distance, using the hand sanitiser, avoiding crowds - all apply in the shops and supermarkets. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If you own or manage a supermarket or shop remember to keep a close watch on the capacity of your store to minimise the numbers inside at any one time \u2013 ensure staff are wearing face coverings and wearing them correctly. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Face coverings \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Masks continue to be an important tool to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19. We have heard reports that we should now be double masking or wearing medical grade face coverings. Intuitively the more layers you have the better, but ultimately if you\u2019re not wearing the mask properly, you\u2019re not protecting yourself to any better extent. While double masking is certainly not discouraged, it is more important to wear a mask correctly and that it fits correctly. This means wearing your mask so that it covers your mouth and your nose snugly and there are no gaps. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Remember:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tdo not touch a mask or face covering while wearing it - if you do, clean your hands properly\n\tdo not use a damp or wet medical mask or reuse a medical mask\n\tobviously, do not share masks\n\tdon\u2019t lower your mask to speak, eat and smoke or vape - if you need to uncover your nose or mouth, take the mask off and put it in a bag for used masks\n\tdon\u2019t discard masks in public places\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There is lots of information on correctly wearing and disposing of masks go to gov.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The basics\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        We must keep the virus suppressed as the vaccines are rolled out in our community. New variants continue to be a cause for concern and we must not forget that this virus has not gone away. It will feed on our complacency so we have to stick with the habits we have learned over the last year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Announcements\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Today we here in the Department of the Taoiseach have launched a new collaboration with the ESRI\u2019s Behavioural Research Unit called The Social Activity Measure, otherwise known as SAM. It is a behavioural study that records the public response to the risk of COVID-19 infection over time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        SAM is an anonymous, interactive, online study that surveys people about their recent activity. The study offers insight into where and how risks of transmission arise and will inform policy and communications regarding the opening of parts of the economy and society, while keeping COVID-19 under control.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The study will collect data from 1,000 respondents every two weeks. As well as informing policy and communications decisions relating to the government\u2019s response to COVID-19, the results from the research will be published on gov.ie.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Results from the first wave will be published this week. Initial findings indicate that the vast majority of us are keeping our contacts low, but there are still some people with a lot of discretionary contacts. Interestingly, some of those people think they are doing better that most people in complying. They are not. If you are one of these people and you think what you are doing is the \u201cnorm\u201d, maybe think again. We might be tempted to let our guard down and visit or meet someone you haven\u2019t seen in a while. We should take heart from the fact that this initial data would suggest that most people are keeping their contacts very low and if this continues, we will continue to suppress the virus. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We will keep you informed with further insights from SAM over the coming weeks.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Updates - Supports\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are currently 48,500 employers registered with Revenue for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. To date, a total of over \u20ac1.9 billion in subsidies has been paid to 46,700 employers. An additional \u20ac335 million in employer PRSI has been forgone due to the reduced rate of PRSI on wages paid which are eligible for EWSS.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Covid Restrictions Support Scheme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition, to date 20,100 businesses have registered for the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme with Revenue. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Pandemic Unemployment Payment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This week, the Department of Social Protection has issued weekly payments to approximately 477,700 people in receipt of Pandemic Unemployment Payment. This payment is valued at \u20ac143.3 million and marks a decrease of 3,666 on the number paid last week.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is the first time the numbers on the register have decreased since the introduction of the Level 5 restrictions in December. To date, around \u20ac5.9 billion has been paid out in total since March 2020.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These figures are in addition to the 188,543 people who were on the Live Register at the end of January. Since the last payment, almost 12,900 people closed their PUP claim, with approximately 10,200 of these stating that they were doing so because they are returning to work. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The quickest way to make a claim for PUP or to close a claim is to do so online and to log on www.MyWelfare.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Enhanced Illness Benefit Payment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I mentioned it last week but I really want to emphasise the importance of self-isolating or restricting your movements if you are asked to.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The government have tried ensure people are not concerned about a loss of income if they do so. When a worker is told to self-isolate or restrict movements by a doctor or the HSE due to being a probable source of infection or having been diagnosed with COVID-19, they can apply for an Enhanced Illness Benefit payment of \u20ac350 per week. To be eligible for this payment, a person must be confined to their home or a medical facility. Unlike the general Illness Benefit, there are no waiting days attached to this payment, it is paid from day one of illness or self-isolation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is not necessary for a person with symptoms to leave their home to get a medical certificate from their doctor as all of the application process can be completed online via www.MyWelfare.ie.\n This week, approximately 4,700 people have been medically certified for receipt of this benefit. This reflects a 34% decrease on the numbers paid last week, which was 7,149. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Tourism Business Continuity Scheme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The recently announced \u20ac55 million Tourism Business Continuity Scheme is intended to help tourism businesses offset fixed costs incurred in 2020 and support them to continue operating through 2021.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Two new skills programmes also recently announced will assist the tourism sector to retain key talent and develop leadership capacity to rejuvenate businesses for recovery and growth - one programme is to develop team leaders and the second to develop supervisory management capability. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For more information on the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme go to gov.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Keep Well\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We have been in Level 5 for quite a while now and I\u2019m sure boredom and general weariness, not to mention worry and anxiety are affecting all of us at times. It is worth checking out our Keep Well campaign which provides guidelines, information, and tips on how we can plan to do things that will help us keep well and help us to mind our mental and physical well-being. There are a lot of great initiatives being run locally so check out gov.ie\/healthyireland.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There really is something for everyone. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            National Vaccination Strategy\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        This week marks the very welcome start of the vaccination programme for those aged 85 or older living in the community. GPs will commence inviting those in this group to come forward for vaccination. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We have already delivered over 270,000 doses. We have delivered 5.3 vaccine doses per hundred people and 1.7% of the population is now fully vaccinated. Ireland is progressing well with our programme compared to EU states and is well above the EU average. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are building the appropriate capability, processes and systems to quickly distribute all vaccines as supply increases. The vaccination programme is already involving national partnerships with GPs, Pharmacists, and other Healthcare Professionals across Ireland as well as through specialist vaccination hubs. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Our approach is safe, effective, and fair. Most people in Ireland want to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, with 85% saying they will definitely or probably will seek it. This demand and confidence is growing and is a very positive statistic. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For more information on the Vaccination Strategy and prioritisation list go to gov.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            And finally\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thank you as always for your attention.

This document sets out the Department of Finance macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for the period 2021-2025.  The macroeconomic forecasts underpinning the SPU were endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on 7th April (a legal requirement).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Commenting on the figures, Minister Donohoe said: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u2018The publication of these economic and fiscal projections means that we now have a medium-term trajectory against which Government can assess and benchmark the evolving situation and calibrate policy accordingly\u2019.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThe speed at which the economy can recover will depend on the success of our vaccination programme.  This is being significantly ramped-up in the second quarter, and should allow for a more significant but cautious easing of containment measures over the summer.  This will allow for a substantive and sustainable recovery to begin.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cMy Department is projecting that Modified Domestic Demand \u2013 the best indicator of economic trends \u2013 will increase by 2\u00bd per cent this year, accelerating to 7\u00bd per cent next year, as pent-up consumer and business demand is released.  Excess household savings, built up during the pandemic, will be partly unwound, further supporting spending.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The economic fall-out from the pandemic is most evident in the labour market.  The Department is projecting an average unemployment rate of around 16\u00bc per cent this year, before declining to 8\u00bc per cent next year as the economy is fully re-opened.  The level of employment is projected to increase by around 80,000 this year and 225,000 next year, although the level of employment will still remain below its pre-crisis peak until 2023.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On the fiscal front, the Government has deployed its balance sheet to support workers and firms and to cushion the impact of the pandemic.  After a deficit of 5.0 per cent of GDP last year, a further deficit of 4.7 per cent of GDP is in prospect for this year.  As a result, public debt has increased from \u20ac204 billion immediately pre-pandemic to an estimated \u20ac239 billion this year or 112 per cent of GNI*.  As the economy recovers next year, the deficit will improve to 2.8 per cent of GDP, with the debt ratio falling to 107 per cent of GNI*.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On the public finances, Minister Donohoe said: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u2018We are projecting an improvement in the public finances next year.  There are, however, clear downside risks for the public finances.  In particular, international corporate tax reform could weigh more heavily on this revenue stream than is currently assumed.  Having said that, the public finances are in a much better position to absorb the expected shock to corporate tax revenue than, say, a decade and a half ago.  The tax base is much wider than prior to the global financial crisis and, importantly, there is time to build up the resilience of the public finances before international reforms move to the implementation phase\u2019.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister Donohoe added: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u2018The impact of the pandemic on the domestic economy and the public finances has been severe. However, the acceleration of the vaccination programme means that the beginning of the end is, hopefully, now in sight.  The strength of our economic model and more importantly, our people, clearly demonstrate that we should face this current period with optimism.  We can and we will rebuild our economy, get our people back to work and safely emerge from the pandemic.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael McGrath said: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u2018Across 2020 and 2021, we have provided over \u20ac28 billion for various Covid related spending programmes, nearly half of which are direct income supports via the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Wage Subsidy Schemes.  This represents real cash in people\u2019s pockets to mitigate the effect of an unprecedented health emergency. I believe the underlying strengths of the economy give us cause for optimism that there will be a very considerable recovery in our economic fortunes starting in the second half of the year. This will help get thousands of people back to work, improve tax receipts and reduce Covid related expenditure\u2019. \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThe Draft SPU charts a course for an orderly reduction in the deficit which has arisen due to the essential programme of spending we have undertaken in response to the Covid pandemic.  We will continue to invest considerable sums in much needed capital projects through this period, and I look forward to the conclusion of the review of the National Development Plan in the coming months which will involve setting out an ambitious capital investment programme out to 2030. In the immediate term, the government will honour its commitment that there be no cliff edge end to the economic supports at the end of June. We are conscious that continued support will be required to assist sectors of the economy on the path to recovery and we will set out these plans in the coming weeks.\u201d  \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ENDS\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Notes to Editors:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        1. The Stability Programme Update is a legal requirement: all Member States must submit to the European Council and Commission by end-April each year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        2. The document is prepared on the basis of the policy position set out in Budget 2021, and includes all announced policy measures.  It does not include any additional measures.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3. In a more severe scenario where current, stringent restrictions need to remain in place for a prolonged period, GDP growth this year would be almost 1 percentage point lower than the main baseline projection, and would be 2\u00bd percentage points lower next year.  As a result, by the end of next year, the Irish economy would be approximately 4\u00bd per cent smaller than it would under the baseline forecasts. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        4. The macroeconomic analysis and forecasts contained in this document are based on data available to end-March 2019.  The fiscal projections are based on data to mid-April.  The presentation provided to the IFAC is available on the Department of Finance website.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        https:\/\/www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/5d363-spu-2021-presentation-to-ifac-1-april-2021\/\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        5. The document is accompanied by the latest version of the Department of Finance\u2019s Economic Insights series.  This features three short notes relating to the impact of the pandemic to date and possible legacy effects.  These cover real-time indicators and how they can explain economic developments during the pandemic, the operating of the so-called \u2018automatic stabilisers\u2019 in Ireland, and a discussion on the possible \u2018scarring\u2019 effects of the pandemic on future growth. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        https:\/\/www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/bc298-economic-insights-economic-developments-during-covid-19-and-beyond\/\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        6. The unemployment rate for 2021 is based on the CSO Covid-adjusted unemployment rate which adds all PUP recipients to the standard unemployment rate.  For 2022 onwards, the standard and Covid-adjusted unemployment rates are assumed to converge. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        7. Budget 2021 set out a General Government Deficit forecast of -5.7% of GDP for 2021. The improvement outlined in the SPU forecast is due to the updated assumptions associated with 2021, i.e. an orderly Brexit, and the rollout of a national vaccination programme. However, these factors have also been offset by the lockdown since the beginning of the year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n            SPU 2021 Chartpack\n\n            \n            Download\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n            Database of past forecasts\n\n            \n            Download\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n            Economic Insights: Economic Developments during Covid 19 and beyond\n\n            \n            Download\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n            Emerging economic developments - real-time economic domestic indicators 14 April 2021\n\n            \n            Download\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n            Draft Stability Programme Update 2021\n\n            \n            Download\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n            Stability Programme Update 2021 - Summary\n\n            \n            Download\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n            SPU 2021: Presentation to IFAC \u2013 1 April 2021\n\n            \n            Download\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n        \n            SPU 2021 Media Presentation\n\n            Media Presentation\n\n            Download\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","07e10eabe926db01330fe75c8e24204d2b2b0f7b452b22a9819bd942f589068a":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        65 suspected cases of Covid-19 (Coronavirus) tested in Ireland.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To date, there are no confirmed cases of Covid-19 (Coronavirus) in Ireland.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Note: The World Health Organization has confirmed the official name of Coronavirus disease to be 'Covid-19'.

The moment I heard of this virus. The moment the scale of potential harm and death became clear. And, as a member of the COVID-19 Cabinet Sub-Committee, since the inception of that Committee, the memories of so many difficult decisions that have had an impact on so very many.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In my time with you today I will:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \temphasise the value of the foundations of the Irish economy and how they were recently strengthened\n\trecognise the unique nature of the approaching challenges and opportunities\n\tdescribe how we can approach and how we can successfully overcome these challenges while relentlessly pursuing many opportunities\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The fallout in the labour market\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The pandemic has taken a toll on all aspects of life but, as Minister for Finance, l will focus here on the economic fall-out.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As we turn the page on one of the most turbulent years our country has ever faced, the labour market has been turned on its head. To put some numbers on this: there are over 1 million people on some form of income support from the State \u2013 nearly half a million people receiving the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, another 350,000 being supported by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, and nearly 200,000 on the Live Register.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Of course, the labour market fall-out has been uneven in several respects.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Firstly, public-facing sectors have fared worst. Sectors such as hospitality, leisure and personal services require face-to-face interaction and are much less conducive to e-commerce and social distancing than, say, office working or parts of manufacturing. This is why business closures and jobs losses have been concentrated in these sectors.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To put this into perspective, the number of hours worked in the food and accommodation sector fell at an annual rate of 53 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020. On the other hand, hours worked in the information and communications sector \u2013 much more compatible with remote working \u2013 rose 3 per cent over the same period. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The second distinctive impact is the disproportionate one on younger workers. When PUP recipients are included, the unemployment rate in the 15-to-24 age cohort rose to 46 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, compared with a total unemployment rate of 19.8 per cent. In part, this is because of the higher incidence of youth employment in the contact-intensive sectors of the economy \u2013 often in part-time or entry-level jobs.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thirdly, employment data also show that workers with lower educational attainment have borne the brunt; this is not unrelated to the sectoral nature of the shock. For instance, the number of persons engaged in paid employment without a third level qualification fell by 10 per cent over the year to Q4 2020. For comparison, and bearing in mind some measurement challenges, the numbers with a third level qualification engaged in paid employment actually grew over the same period. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In designing long-term policy responses, this uneven nature of the shock is important. To put it another way: this time last year, the thinking was that the pandemic was a system-wide, symmetric shock. It now appears that it is more of an asymmetric, sector-specific shock, with unique impacts. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The scale of these impacts is so large because these sectors employ so many and are so important to our economy and society.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The government\u2019s response\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In recognition of this, the government responded rapidly, bridging through to the recovery by putting in place a range of support for both firms and workers. The overarching objective has been to support households and firms, as well as to limit the \u2018scarring\u2019, or permanent, effects of the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In terms of quantum, around \u20ac38 billion of government resources has been mobilised to date. This is around 18\u00bd per cent of modified gross national income, and compares favourably with supports provided in other jurisdictions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        An important consequence of these payments is that household income \u2013 at least at the aggregate level \u2013 actually increased last year, albeit at significant cost to the Exchequer.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Indeed, data from the Central Statistics Office show that during the most severe phase of the pandemic last year \u2013 the second quarter \u2013 median household income fell by just under 2 per cent, once government supports are included. The counter-factual scenario in which no support was provided would have resulted in a 20 per cent decline in median household income.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        With supply side restrictions \u2013 the temporary closure of leisure, hospitality and many parts of retail \u2013 the fall in consumer spending has been far greater than the change in household income. In other words, households \u2013 in the aggregate \u2013 have accumulated a large quantum of savings.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The so-called savings rate \u2013 that part of disposable income that is not used to purchase goods and services \u2013 reached record levels last year. In the second quarter for instance, the average household saved nearly \u20ac4 of every \u20ac10 of take-home pay; in normal times, the average household saves around \u20ac1 in every \u20ac10 of take-home pay.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Put another way, of the \u20ac126 billion of household deposits in the domestic banking system, around \u20ac15 billion of these have been accumulated over the past year \u2013 most of this is \u2018excess savings\u2019.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ireland is not unique in this regard \u2013 the same pattern was seen in almost all advanced economies last year, though not to the same extent. Importantly, this means that once the virus has been contained, the unwinding of the savings ratio will provide some support for economic recovery, at least in the short-term.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Preparedness of the economy\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This extraordinary counter-cyclical policy response from Government is possible for two reasons \u2013 firstly, careful management of the economy in the pre-pandemic period and, secondly, the favourable sovereign financing conditions associated with monetary policy.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In relation to economic management, the public finances have been put on a solid footing in recent years. Budgetary surpluses were recorded in the two years preceding the pandemic \u2013 with a primary budget surplus running since 2014 \u2013 while current spending increases were in line with the trend growth rate of the economy. Government had also established a \u2018Rainy Day Fund\u2019 to insulate the public finances. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Moreover, the sort of macroeconomic imbalances that were allowed to build-up before the last crisis have not been evident on this occasion: there has been no credit bubble, for instance, illustrating why macro-prudential tools are so important. Coming into the last crisis, we had annual credit growth of around 25 per cent; in recent years it has been broadly flat.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The structure of our tax system has also played an important role: we have not become dependent on transitory, transactions-based taxes, as was the case in the past.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This shows the importance of maintaining a broad income tax base, with a progressive rate structure. This is one of the reasons why our tax revenue has held up so well over the past year: for instance, total tax fell by just 3\u00bd per cent and, notwithstanding the fall in employment, income tax fell by just 1 per cent last year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        None of this happened by accident. The regaining of national creditworthiness, the careful management of lending and the maintenance of sensible taxation structures during a period of economic growth were all political decisions. They mattered.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Their absence would gravely deepen our national economic challenges. Taking them as a given is to ignore their value in our efforts to rebuild.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        But the European context is essential too.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ireland, like every euro area Member State, has benefitted from the European Central Bank\u2019s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. The most recent figures \u2013 which related to end January 2021 \u2013 show that the eurosystem had purchased over \u20ac10 billion of Irish sovereign debt since its launch in March 2020. To put it another way, the Central Bank is now the largest single creditor to the Irish Government.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Additionally, by activating the so-called \u2018general escape clause\u2019 of the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Commission has allowed Member States to temporarily deviate from their budgetary requirements in order to take the necessary measures to effectively address the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So while ECB support helps to lower interest rates, it is important to remember that a budgetary policy that focusses on short-term counter-cyclical support and long-term sustainability keeps them low.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The careful management of our national finances that preceded the pandemic meant that we entered it from a position of strength; the exact corollary of the situation we faced at the time of the global financial crisis. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Equally, European institutions like the ECB, the Commission and the Council have responded in a very different manner to this crisis than that of a decade previously.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In large part, these advances have been forged at the political centre, both in Ireland and within the EU.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is because the centre is not the same as the status quo. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It digested the social and political lessons of the financial crisis; it built a stronger institutional architecture to prepare for the next crisis; and it understood the social and political consequences of failing to meet the needs of its citizens at a time of great challenge.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        And it is from the centre that we will build back once the pandemic has passed, while also responding again to the new lessons and risks that have been central to this crisis.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        And to emphasise, once the extraordinary monetary supports are phased out, the benefits of prudent economic management pre-pandemic alongside determined counter-cyclical support during the pandemic, will become evident.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The full toolbox \u2013 fiscal and monetary policy\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Of course, right across the globe, activist fiscal policy has been the order to the day.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All of the main multilateral agencies that provide economic advice \u2013 the European Commission, IMF, OECD \u2013 take the view that, because the crisis was not caused by underlying economic imbalances, such as excessive credit growth or inappropriate fiscal policies, the correct policy response is for governments to deploy their balance sheets in a pro-active, counter-cyclical manner.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is why we have seen a surge in public debt across advanced economies and yet, because monetary policy has complemented this approach, the debt service burden is falling. In effect, the two main macroeconomic stabilisation tools \u2013 fiscal and monetary policy \u2013 are working hand-in-glove.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are several reasons why discretionary fiscal policy is now essential, and why it and monetary policy need to complement each other, especially in the current circumstances.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Firstly, the scale of this crisis \u2013 unparalleled in modern times \u2013 necessitates a more aggressive counter-cyclical policy response.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Secondly, monetary policy\u2019s capacity to respond is constrained \u2013 at least in part \u2013 by the zero lower bound for interest rates. In theory, of course, the short-term \u2013 or policy \u2013 rate could be moved into negative territory, but this would have potentially severe side effects, including by compromising the business models of the banking system in a market economy.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the shock is asymmetric. The uneven impact across different sectors of the Irish economy is clear to see, as I discussed earlier. Anyone who is able to go for a walk within their immediate locality can observe this.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Monetary policy works at the aggregate level but, beyond the financial sector, cannot target individual sectors. This is where fiscal policy is better suited to supporting incomes and employment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These insights have guided the design and implementation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To date, EWSS has provided subsidy support of almost \u20ac2.5 billion, including PRSI relief worth \u20ac360m, to over 47,000 employers in respect of 532,000 employees. There are over 20,000 firms in receipt of the CRSS payment with almost \u20ac330 million paid out to date.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The asymmetric nature of this shock will extend not just through the initial impact but, in all likelihood, also to the early stages of our recovery.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As we see from the resilience of Irish GDP through 2020, large components of the traded sector of the economy have remained robust and are likely to be further boosted by the eventual turn-around in the global economy.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        At the same time, significant elements of the domestic economy remain effectively closed at the moment and may face uncertain futures for some time. Hence, the need for targeted and continued State interventions to support workers and firms in these sectors.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Interest rates and growth: R-G\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This interplay between budgetary and monetary policy has stimulated an important debate about the sustainability of higher public debt: this, of course, is not just of academic interest, it has implications for everyone in our society.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In Ireland, the debt-to-modified national income ratio rose to 108 per cent last year and is set to rise further this year. Crucially, however, the low interest environment that we find ourselves in means that, despite this sharp increase in debt, interest costs are actually falling.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To put this into perspective, last year\u2019s interest bill absorbed 4\u00bd per cent of total revenue; in 2013, the interest bill absorbed 12\u00bd per cent of total revenue. This phenomenon is repeated across other advanced economies, including in the euro area, UK and US.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Such shifts in the economic environment have led many high-profile commentators and policy makers to suggest traditional measures of assessing the burden and sustainability of debt may need to be re-thought. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Jason Furman and Larry Summers in the U.S, for example, have advocated for a move away from the traditional practice of analysing the stock of debt by reference to the flow of national income. Instead, they focus on comparing interest rate flows to revenue flows: a more like-for-like comparison. Olivier Blanchard, of course, has famously championed the \u2018r-g\u2019 debate of late, with great traction.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All of these points are detailed and assessed in my department\u2019s Annual Report on Public Debt in Ireland, which I published a few weeks ago. This emphasises that there is no single metric that shows whether a country\u2019s debt is sustainable or not.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        But if we accept the premise that \u2018flows\u2019 \u2013 the interest bill \u2013 matter more, then it is equally valid that other flows \u2013 namely the deficit \u2013 also matter. The idea that \u2018deficits don\u2019t matter\u2019 \u2013 especially for a small economy without the possibility to print its own currency \u2013 is so far wide of the mark as to be dangerous.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In other words, keeping the interest bill down will depend on reducing the deficit \u2013at the appropriate pace and time \u2013 and setting out a clear and credible pathway to its reduction and elimination, particularly for funding day-to-day expenditure.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Maintaining the public finances \u2013 and the interest bill in particular \u2013 on a sustainable path is particularly important within a monetary union where monetary policy is not always optimal for a small country.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So while the policy framework with respect to deficits and debt is evolving, this does not absolve us of the need to reduce our deficit over time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Yes, we need to continue to provide counter-cyclical support for the economy; but this support must, of course, be sustainable.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There is a new balance that we must attain.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To sustain our debt, to manage our deficit we need economic growth. That economic growth requires and is receiving, and will receive, strong support. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        And, to be perfectly clear, these supports are essential. I know their value as, in collaboration with other colleagues, I introduced them. To withdraw them too soon would be damaging to our national finances due to the likely harm caused to jobs and income. I know this from regular engagement with the Irish business community. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        But it is important to also be clear that the need to manage our national finances differently will emerge. And it is in our interests to be ready for that moment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This will undoubtedly be the subject of continued debate but the truth is nobody can know for certain the future path of interest rates.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Indeed, it is notable that inflation rates in many countries have picked up in recent months; this has been accompanied by increases in inflationary expectations as market participants have priced-in higher inflation rates in the coming months.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are two things which we do know. Firstly, the higher the stock of public debt which you are carrying, the more painful any increase in borrowing costs will be. And secondly, the more carefully a national deficit is managed the better the prospects for more affordable costs.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Next steps\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The policy challenges are indeed complex. We have navigated our economy and society through some serious challenges before \u2013 testament to strong economic foundations \u2013 and we will do so again. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As President of the Eurogroup and a member of the G7 Finance Minister Group I am privileged a play a role in the coordination of our efforts across Europe and with leading economies. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        At a European level, I welcome yesterday\u2019s Commission communication on \u201cThe fiscal policy response - one year since the outbreak of COVID-19\u201d and the Commission\u2019s preliminary indication to extend the general escape clause into 2022.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This statement provides much needed clarity for Member States as we all work to navigate these uncertain times. From a Eurogroup perspective, we will reflect closely on this communication in our meeting later this month. Particularly how this feeds into the coordination of budgetary policy in 2022.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While not pre-empting these discussions, I anticipate that this very important communication will provide the basis for continued agreement on coordinated economic policy. This could build on our assessment last December, which at the time, focused on the need for a supportive fiscal policy stance.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This will be discussed in our meeting in March and again during the summer. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Also at a European level, there are a number of important deliverables over the next few months. These include the work to finalise stability and convergence programmes and to complete the national Recovery and Resilience Plans.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Following these, the Commission will provide new forecasts in the spring and we look forward to their fiscal policy guidance as part of the European Semester. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All of these will be on the Eurogroup\u2019s work plan through to the middle of this year and into 2022.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        At national level, the government will bring forward a National Economic Plan and a Medium Term Plan to align public spending with revenue, as provided for in the Programme for Government. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This Programme also provides for the establishment of a Commission on Taxation and Welfare, which will review and make recommendations on how our taxation and welfare system should develop over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The tax code and the welfare system are among the most important tools available to us as a society, so it is important that we review how well the systems we have today are serving our needs and their suitability to meet the challenges of tomorrow.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I expect the Commission to look across a number of policy objectives, including promoting economic growth and social inclusion, as well as reducing our carbon footprint.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Conclusion\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The global reach of the virus has altered how we think about uncertainty, and in particular so-called \u2018tail-risks\u2019.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Just 12 months ago, no one would have believed the year we were about to endure. In order to reduce the vulnerability of the economy and the public finances to some of this uncertainty, reducing the debt ratio back to lower and safer levels must be a key priority over the medium-term. This will, once again, provide us with options should we face another unexpected shock in the future.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To conclude, vaccination is now being rolled-out across the country and the beginning of the end is, hopefully, now in sight. Many of our youngest citizens returned to school earlier this week and, all going to plan, more will return in mid-March.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The challenges are great, but we have achieved much and, in our national efforts to prevail over this disease, we will achieve more.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thank You.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","18ffd5113a8da95d36469445e751f1efd63ac44bb26ae2c6a86988a0eb6027ff":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        Check against delivery\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Good afternoon to everybody. We had a very productive meeting this morning, and it was very good to welcome our new colleague from Slovakia, the new Slovakian minister of finance, Igor Matovi\u010d. I started our meeting with an update of my engagement with our leaders in the Euro Summit three weeks ago. The discussion focussed on the international role of the euro. But it was also an important impulse for our work on a Banking Union. And our work on Banking Union was actually the first debate that we held today with finance ministers from all 27 member states. My colleague, Tuomas Saarenheimo, the president of the High-Level Working Group on EDIS, updated us on progress made by our representatives.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As you will be aware, last December, the Euro Summit asked the Eurogroup to prepare on a consensual basis, a stepwise and time-bound work plan on all outstanding elements needed to complete Banking Union. I'm glad to say that our deputies are making progress on this, and I am confident that we will reach agreement on a work plan to continue to strengthen our Banking Union. We agreed very strongly on the need for this work plan to be balanced.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Our banking system has proven its resilience to date during the era of Covid-19, and this is the result of our common efforts over the past decade in building up and in strengthening the Banking Union to this point. So we have achieved much, but today there was commitment from all to look at how we can achieve more.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We have a strong commitment to ensure that European citizens and firms enjoy access to financing from robust and efficient financial services. Through our work, we will work to create conditions for an integrated, resilient and competitive system that will also contribute to the protection of taxpayers and depositors.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        From this, we moved on to our regular Eurogroup meeting. We started with my update to fellow ministers on recent international meetings. The world obviously is still in the midst of this terrible pandemic, and this was the key focus of our IMF and World Bank meetings. My takeaway, however, was one of optimism about the months ahead. Optimism about our economic policies, including within Europe, to support our societies towards an economic recovery, as we recover our health. Vaccination is accelerating, and we are already seeing encouraging signs coming through in some of our economic data due to our vaccination effort and beyond. Growth is forecast to accelerate sharply once the level of infections and the scope of containment measures are reduced.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        But this is not a moment to undermine the scale of the challenge we face. It is without precedent. But our response in Europe has been equally unprecedented in our speed and in our scale. And in the Eurogroup, we continue to be united in tackling the economic and social effects of the pandemic. This was reflected in the statement we issued last month. In fact, the support that we are making available to our economies is still increasing. Finance ministers across the euro area are adopting additional support packages, as demonstrated with recent announcements in Germany, Spain and Italy. And then, of course, building on all of that are the efforts from our Commission, led, amongst others, by Paolo, where we are working, and they are working so hard to implement our common Recovery and Resilience Plan as swiftly as possible. And from my own engagements with the Commission, I can see at first hand the huge effort and commitment that they are displaying to deliver the ambitions of the recovery funds. We need to continue to tailor our policy strategy to our challenges. That's why we will be coming back to a discussion on economic development in May.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Our second discussion was on insolvency frameworks in the euro area. This is an important and also complex topic that we've discussed in the Eurogroup on a number of occasions. Well functioning insolvency frameworks can make a big difference to recovery. Under discussion today showed additional support for additional non-legislative measures to help our frameworks to converge, and we agreed to revisit this topic again.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We then had a really positive exchange on the possible introduction of a digital euro. The ECB presented the outcome of its public consultation. The Commission gave us an update on their work. There is, of course, substantial interest in this innovation, which has the potential to shape our daily lives in years to come, depending on if and how it's taking forward. The consultation showed that issues linked to privacy, security and ensuring the reach of this project, if it goes ahead, ranked highest in our citizens and businesses priorities. Our discussion also covered financial stability, including the potential impact on banks and financial inclusion, including the impact a digital euro could have on the use of physical cash. This is an important project, not just technically, but also politically, and I expect that Eurogroup ministers will play an important role in considering the case for and the political dimensions of a digital currency.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is something that the Eurogroup will be reflecting further on, and we will be discussing and engaging on this issue again, while fully respecting the institutional roles and the independence of all involved in this work.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Finally, we briefly took stock of our important work on transparency. We review this regularly, and this review today, confirmed to us that the Eurogroup has become much more transparent in recent years and that there is a strong commitment on behalf of all of us to maintain this standard going forward.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","1c4e2e2ba25a4e8bbcb45902f296a784d1478c03a4df9af424eb557e9d670368":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Wednesday, 13 January, 2021\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is the duty of a republic to be willing to hold itself to account.

Some of these pregnancies were as a result of rape and\/or incest.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Children born outside of marriage were stigmatised and were treated as outcasts in school and in wider society.

Before the 1960s living conditions in many private Irish households were generally poor.  In the congregated settings of Mother and Baby Homes poor sanitary conditions had much more serious consequences for disease and infection control. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        County homes as well as Kilrush and Tuam are identified as having appalling conditions.  Conditions in other mother and baby homes were better and improved over time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Many of the women suffered emotional abuse and were often subject to denigration and derogatory remarks from the religious, with little kindness shown, especially when giving birth.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The overall picture is of a hard, cold and uncaring environment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        One of the most disquieting features of the report is that up until 1960 mother and baby homes appear to have significantly reduced the prospects of survival of children.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The death rate among infants in mother and baby homes was almost twice that of the national average for children born outside of marriage.  A total of about 9,000 children died in the institutions under investigation - about 15% of all the children who were in their care.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is deeply distressing to note that the very high mortality rates were known to local and national authorities at the time and were recorded in official publications.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, there is little or no evidence of State intervention in response to these chilling statistics.  In fact, a number of reports actually identifying the problems were not acted on.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I know it will be a disappointment that the report does not answer all the deeply personal questions on the burial arrangements for many of the children who died in these institutions \u2013 in many cases the burial location remains unknown. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are no records for a number of the large institutions where significant numbers of infants are known to have died \u2013 including Tuam, Bessborough, Castlepollard and Sean Ross.  While this is difficult, options for dignified remembrance and memorialisation will be implemented where this is not already the case. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While women may not have been strictly legally forced to enter these homes,  the fact is that most had no alternative, especially those who did not have the support of their family or independent financial means.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Overall, the Commission concludes that Ireland was a cold and harsh environment for the majority of its residents during the earlier half of the period under investigation.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It was especially cold and harsh for women.  All women suffered serious discrimination.  Women who gave birth outside marriage were subject to particularly harsh treatment.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Emerging from the survivor stories are the horrific accounts of rape, either perpetrated within families or by someone within a woman\u2019s community.  This led ultimately to entry into a Mother and Baby Home where the woman bore a social stigma but there was no accountability for the men responsible, and the agencies of the State showed little or no interest in addressing these crimes.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Commission acknowledges the additional impact which a lack of knowledge and understanding had on the treatment and outcomes of mothers and children with different racial and cultural heritage, those who faced mental health challenges, or those with physical and intellectual disabilities. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Such discriminatory attitudes exacerbated the shame and stigma felt by some of our most vulnerable citizens, especially where opportunities for non-institutional placement of children were restricted by an unjust belief that they were unsuitable for placement with families.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While context is essential to our proper understanding of this chapter of our history, it does not lessen what happened or diminish the responsibility of Church and State for the failures laid bare in what we have learned. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For much of the period covered by the Commission, women as a group and regardless of age or class were systematically discriminated against in relation to employment, family law, and social welfare, solely because of their gender. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Children were similarly unequal, and none more so than those who were cruelly labelled \u2018illegitimate\u2019. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I share deeply the Commission\u2019s unequivocal view, that the existence of the status of \u201cillegitimacy\u201d until 1987 in this country \u201cwas an egregious breach of human rights\u201d.  This was a huge injustice and blighted the lives of many.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is a sad truth that the history of human kind, even to today, has largely been defined by a failure to acknowledge and vindicate the rights and status of women and the labelling of those who failed to conform to social norms.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We cannot account for what happened elsewhere, but we can and must do so for what happened in our country.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Response of the Government\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        An apology on its own is not enough.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We, collectively in this House, will be judged by our actions.

\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"Vetting is a crucial prerequisite ahead of recruiting people to a number of specific, potentially sensitive places of employment.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"In particular, those organisations centred around the safety, enjoyment and comfort of children and vulnerable people need to take all reasonable steps to ensure that only suitable people are recruited and employed.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"This requires a strong Garda vetting process that reassures the public that appropriate checks are conducted on individuals in positions of trust.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Currently, there is no requirement for someone who is vetted once to be re-vetted, unless they move job or position with sporting or community organisations, and other limited circumstances.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A key focus of the interdepartmental group will be the introduction of a mandatory system of re-vetting every three years.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This would involve an obligation on an employer, service provider or voluntary organisation to make a new application 36 months after the original vetting had been carried out.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Minister continued:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"This interdepartmental group is being established

Redeployment on promotion, or to a substantially different job, would continue to require re-vetting.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Under this proposal, a person employed by the HSE as a social worker would not need to be re-vetted (within the 3 years) for a change of work location within the basic social worker grade, but would on promotion to a position of greater authority. Likewise, in relation to volunteering, a person vetted to coach under 14s with the GAA could switch to a different sport without being re-vetted.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In both employment and volunteering situations, provision will also be made for vetting certificates to be withdrawn before the expiry of the 36 months if deemed necessary, for example: in situations where new information come to light that points to a substantive and immediate risk to children or vulnerable adults.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Membership of the group will consist of representatives of the Department of Justice, Department of Health, Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the Health Service Executive and the Public Appointments Service.

It is now a criminal offence for organisations to fail to carry out the necessary vetting of such employees, contractors and volunteers.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where the National Vetting Bureau receives an application for a vetting disclosure in respect of a person concerning relevant work or activities, the National Vetting Bureau make such enquiries of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na as it deems necessary, to establish whether there is any criminal record or specified information relating to the person.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All Garda vetting applications are processed on a first come, first served basis in chronological order from date of receipt. This is with a view to observing equity and fairness in respect of all vetting subjects. It has been the practice that the processing time for vetting applications is kept to the minimum necessary in order to ensure that the statutory obligation to receive a vetting disclosure prior to permitting any person to undertake relevant work or activities on behalf of an organisation can be facilitated without undue delay.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        96% of vetting applications received in 2020 were completed within 5 working days, with 54% of these being completed on the same day they were received. The average turnaround time for the completion of applications was 3 working days. To date in 2021, the current turnaround time for over 85% of vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-Vetting system is 3 to 5 working days.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While Section 20 of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 provides for the re-vetting of employees who were previously vetted for their current position following the expiry of a specified period, this has not been commenced. It is anticipated that primary legislation will now need to be introduced.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","223cb991c69e6d28e931f4f01b66befdd1b1db361472464b1e5c54bfce45d258":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        The Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee TD has announced that a preclearance\/visa scheme is being introduced by her department for the non-EEA family members of UK Nationals seeking to come to Ireland after 31 December 2020.

The farm is not a specialised treatment farm; rather it remains a typical working farm where people in need of support can build relationships and take part in day-to-day farm activities in a non-clinical environment and can be used as a form of social support. These operations are run in a number of settings ranging from working family farms, local community initiatives through to more institutional frameworks.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Participation in social farming has been shown to provide benefits to participants such as improved community connections and relationships, increased self-esteem and capacity, improved health and well-being and the opportunity to develop occupational and life skills from engaging in farm-based activities.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        From a low base, predominately in the border counties of the Republic, Social Farming activity in Ireland has grown rapidly in the last two years. Social Farming Ireland led by Leitrim Development Company provides a wide range of services and initiatives which support the development of social farming nationally including dissemination of information, farmer engagement \/ recruitment, training and development, working with health, social care and other services to activate social farming placements.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The range of services with whom Social Farming Ireland is working is growing and through the work of the Network over the past number of years even more \u201cnew\u201d sectors such as youth, education, homelessness services, services for refugees and eldercare services have continued to emerge.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","259c157b4e1933408516bc2e2ecd507d785f9201694792ae148e75fff8e0dd2f":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        The Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys TD, and the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, Anne Rabbitte TD, have today confirmed that arrangements will be put in place to support the continued provision of employment services for young people with disabilities.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Ability Programme was introduced in June 2018 to bring young people with disabilities closer to the labour market.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The funding for this Programme will amount to around \u20ac16 million over a three-year period.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is being provided jointly under the European Union\u2019s ESF 2014-2020 Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning Operational Programme and the Irish Exchequer.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Ability Programme is being delivered by 27 community and voluntary groups around the country. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As the three year Programme is to conclude in June 2021, Ministers Humphreys and Rabbitte have today confirmed that a range of new measures will be put in place to ensure that funding support for young people with disabilities will remain available into the future. Further details will be announced in the coming weeks and Pobal and the Department of Social Protection will be communicating directly with Ability Providers. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Earlier today, the Ministers met with representatives of the Ability Programme providers to brief them on the options to be put in place when the Programme ends on 30 June 2021. This will ensure certainty into the future. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister Humphreys stated:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cI am committed to improving and extending supports to help more people with disabilities get into employment and stay in the workforce. The work that the providers have carried out under the Ability Programme has been innovative and has made a huge difference in the lives of the young participants. I want to continue this type of programme so that more young people with disabilities avail of the opportunities they need to fulfil their potential. I am very satisfied that the plan being put in place will meet the needs of these young people and that the supports will fit within the suite of existing employment supports for people with disabilities provided by the Department of Social Protection.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister Rabbitte added:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cIt\u2019s vital for people with disabilities to have access to such employment supports and I\u2019m delighted to have worked with Minister Humphreys on clearing a path forward on this. Initiatives like the Ability Programme really helped people through the employment opportunities it offered and the results it has delivered have been real and tangible for its participants. Such measures also align with the government\u2019s aims and obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and it\u2019s great to be able to continue with such a programme, which I hope will further bolster the positive impact for the young people involved.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ENDS\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Notes for Editor\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Ability Programme was introduced in June 2018 and is a pre-activation programme for young people with disabilities.

Thank you to Ciar\u00e1n for the kind introduction and to the Dublin Economics Workshop for the invitation to speak today. I know I was originally pencilled in for February, so thanks for being so accommodating and it\u2019s a great way to start the week.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I know that the DEW traditionally was hosted in Kenmare, before moving around the country to the likes of Limerick, Galway and Wexford. Today of course, due to COVID, we are virtually based in Dublin.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These virtual events have become part of the new norm as a result of how we have had to adapt to COVID-19. It has transformed many of the ways in which we work and interact. However, I do miss the physical meetings. It can also be difficult to gauge the mood in the room for want of a better phrase, so I plan to keep my remarks relatively short. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        But I look forward to addressing you all in person, in the not too distant future.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Today, I want to focus on the euro area and our response to COVID-19. I will do so more from my role as President of the Eurogroup rather than as Minister for Finance.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        One of the things I have done as Eurogroup President is to use these virtual forums as a means of reaching out more. Today\u2019s talk follows similar engagements that I have had with the LSE last month and the Hertie School last Friday. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I will try to outline my insights with you on Eurogroup, its role, my own priorities as President and our response to date to COVID-19.  The latter brings me to the statement that we issued this day last week on budgetary policy. I will go into some detail on this work as it is likely to be of particular interest for this audience. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        One of the tenets of my Presidency was built around a vision of an effective, inclusive and transparent Eurogroup. It is for these reasons that I place a particular emphasis on engagements like today. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So I look forward to hearing your own views and your questions. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Eurogroup - Role\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So to begin, I was elected President of Eurogroup last July for a two and a half year term. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Eurogroup is an informal body of Euro Area Finance Ministers. Our main goal is achieving consensus on economic policy through a focus on political and strategic discussions. This is somewhat different to ECOFIN\u2019s more legislative role and the latter is also explicitly an EU27 body. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Our aim is to ensure the close coordination of economic policies across the Member States so as to promote stronger and more resilient growth. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Eurogroup meetings require considerable preparation to ensure they are centred around relevant political discussions that feature a high level of engagement from Ministers and other informed experts. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The sharing of experiences and perspectives plays a key role in engaging Ministers and building up understanding and consensus. Again, the issues of communication and coordination are vital.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Every Eurogroup meeting is preceded by numerous calls to my ministerial colleagues and their teams. This is how we get our work done. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is one of the means I use most to help understand the issues at play for each Member State. This regular communication also allows us to build the pillars of rapport and understanding upon which all political agreements depend on. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        From these calls and meetings, it has really stuck me how similar we all are in the battle against COVID-19. We are all facing similar sets of problems, such as the closure of hospitality sectors and trying to choose the best supports, such as job retention schemes. Often, the only difference is timing.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As President, I also engage actively with the EU institutions. This includes the ECB, the Commission, the ESM and the Council. We also have regular \u2018inter-institutional actor meetings\u2019, a mouthful, I appreciate, but in simple terms that involves the Presidents of the Council, Commission, ECB and myself. All of these feed into how we operate.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Another key part of my role is to represent Eurogroup at the European Council. I presented to our leaders back in December and will do so again later this week on the International Role of the Euro. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I also attend G7 meetings - again representing the euro area. These are currently chaired by the UK and just last month we spoke on the common challenges created by COVID-19 and the global economic response to it. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are also fortunate in that we can expand Eurogroup, into a more inclusive format, depending on the topic at hand. This can involve opening up discussions to include non-euro area countries but also in inviting external speakers to participate on selected topics. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Since July, we have heard from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) and their Director Andrea Ammon on COVID-19, Professor Lawrence Summers on economic policy and most recently Dr Mike Ryan and Dr Bruce Aylward from the WHO, also on COVID-19.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So I hope this, \u2018whistle-stop tour\u2019 of how we operate gives you an insight into Eurogroup and its central role in economic and fiscal policy making.  All of this is of course underpinned by a very detailed workplan. We have five broad objectives:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        (i)\tEconomic and fiscal policies to support recovery and long-term growth;\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        (ii)\tUse of banking union as a source of stability and growth;\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        (iii)\tCapital markets union (in terms of the euro area aspects);\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        (iv)\tThe euro as a digital currency; and\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        (v)\tThe international role of the euro.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I won\u2019t discuss all of these today as I want to focus on the very first item \u2013 economic and fiscal policies that support recovery - particularly given this is of interest to all.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Euro Area response to COVID-19\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As an avid reader, I am very aware of recent commentary on the US fiscal response, relative to the EU.  There is no doubt that the US plans are ambitions and very large, which is to be welcomed. However, I think it would be amiss to underestimate what the euro area and the broader EU has done. Here too, the response has been extraordinary, in every sense.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In fact, I have repeatedly highlighted that the EU has stepped up to the challenge posed by COVID-19 and Eurogroup has played a leading role in this. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Just to highlight some of what has been done \u2013 we built up the necessary level of political momentum to set up the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). The original idea for it was agreed as part of the (inclusive) Eurogroup statement of 9 April 2020. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Eurogroup was also supportive of the activation of the general escape clause, for the first-time last March. This sent a clear and early signal to the markets that this crisis, and our response to it, would be very different.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Three critical key safety nets were also quickly agreed at Eurogroup as a direct counter to COVID-19 - to the value of \u20ac540 billion; SURE, the ESM\u2019s Pandemic Crisis Support and the EIB\u2019s pan-European guarantee fund. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These schemes are fully operational and the success of SURE in particular \u2013 in terms of Member States accessing it and also in respect of how oversubscribed bond offerings have been \u2013 speaks volumes. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        More broadly, the centrepiece of the EU response to date has been Next Generation EU and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (the RRF). This was a momentous step for the EU to take. While just over a year ago, this crisis would have been unimaginable, I think the EU\u2019s response to it has also been equally unimaginable.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        More broadly, the Eurogroup also agreed in November to the ESM Treaty Reform and the early introduction of the backstop to the Single Resolution Fund.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These decisions are strengthening our crisis response mechanisms and protecting our citizens. They are tangible actions with long-term benefits for all.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Before I move on, I should also recognise what national governments have done, as well as the role of the ECB. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There is no question that fiscal and monetary policy have worked hand-in-hand. This is something that wasn\u2019t always the case \u2013 all we have to do is look back at previous crises. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        From the outset, the ECB has been decisive in their monetary policy actions notably through the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. Their decisions have been vital in keeping yields low and in facilitating liquidity. They have helped to instil an air of confidence and certainty at a time marked by uncertainty. This was again in evidence just two weeks ago with their most recent monetary policy decisions. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        National governments have also stepped up and have taken unprecedented steps to protect incomes, lives and livelihoods. We have seen record levels of government borrowing to facilitate the operation of our automatic stabilisers and new and innovative discretionary income support schemes for individuals and businesses.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While estimates vary, last year close to 8% of GDP was spent supporting our euro area economies, with an additional 19% of GDP in various types of liquidity support.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All of these decisions have helped crisis supports flow in an efficient and effective manner.  They are protecting millions of people on a daily basis. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Reflecting back on what has been done - the speed, breadth and depth of decision-making stands out. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Economic policy has been bold, agile and effective. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To highlight one economic metric - Okun\u2019s Law \u2013 the relationship between output and unemployment - has not held up in Europe with job losses far less than what we might have imagined given the scale of the economic shock.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In recent weeks, and as I mentioned earlier, we have seen a number of comparisons on the respective sizes of the EU and US economic responses. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These arguments miss the point. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        They also deflect from what each country is doing. Aside from obvious differences between the US and 19 euro area countries, there are inherent differences in our economies, in our social protection systems and in our longer-term objectives. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ultimately both economic blocs - for want of a better phrase - are injecting huge amounts of resources into battling COVID-19. These stimuli will also mutually reinforce one another. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ironically, I spent part of my Saint Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations in discussion on this very issue with Secretary Yellen.  We both firmly agreed on these points and that we will engage further on these issues at forums such as the G7. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Before I conclude, I\u2019d like to give you an insight into how Eurogroup practically impacts on the fiscal policy of the 19 Member States, based on our Eurogroup meeting last week and the statement issued in relation to budgetary policy.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Eurogroup \u2013 budgetary policy orientation \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        At Eurogroup we have regular discussions on economic policy. Usually, these debates occur at particular points in the year centred on the European Semester \u2013 for example around budget time, and mid-year following Stability and Convergence programmes and the Commission\u2019s spring package.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, last week\u2019s statement marked somewhat of a change. There was a feeling that we needed to reaffirm our economic messaging in respect of budgetary policy coordination, not just for this year but also in terms of 2022, so that Member States could prepare budgets that continue the vital economic supports to citizens and businesses. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This culminated in the statement we issued last Monday evening, on which there was absolute consensus.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are a number of elements to it, but the key takeaway was the unanimity on the need for supportive economic policy right across the euro area. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In simple terms, we reaffirmed that there will be no premature withdrawal of budgetary support. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While the wording was agreed on Monday, the statement was underpinned by a consensus built up with colleagues across Eurogroup over the past year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Eurogroup will also issue further guidance later in the year as new data and information comes in. Over the summer, we will take the economic policy conversation forward, with a particular focus on 2022.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To date, budgetary policy has proven to be both very effective and agile. It will need to remain flexible so as to win the battle against COVID-19. In fact, this was at the heart of the second part of the statement \u2013 where we emphasised the need for budgetary policy in time to pivot towards more targeted supports.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We also explicitly recognised the challenge posed by higher levels of indebtedness - an inevitable by-product of the exceptional supports at present \u2013 and the need to address this in time through differentiated and more sustainable medium-term strategies.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We also stressed the need for ambitious reforms and productive investment, supported by the RRF. The latter offers a unique opportunity for Member States to deliver stronger, more sustainable and inclusive growth while prioritising the green and digital transitions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Conclusion\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To conclude, there is no doubt as to how exceptionally seismic this shock has been. COVID-19 has been a tremendous challenge to all. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In fact, we face a virus that uses the same qualities we rely on in Europe, to infect; our interconnectedness, our interdependence and our interconnectivity. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So there is an inherent symmetry in all this. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, there is also a tremendous sense of symmetry in our response.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Nobody expected a shattering global pandemic but through Eurogroup and beyond we have the political processes and structures in place to support one another. This, I feel, was the key difference this time. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Europe was different and has responded differently. In a thousand ways.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We have achieved an unprecedented level of coordination on economic and fiscal matters over the past year. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All of this is based on the clear goal of supporting citizens, businesses and countries in a time of great need.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To conclude with two quotes from both sides of the Atlantic, which I think is fitting given what we have discussed today:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the words of Robert Schuman:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u201cEurope will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.\u201d  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the words of President Theodore Roosevelt:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u201cIn any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.\u201d\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ENDS\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","3294905fd0387eef90da1e89fde4238c36efac43c76d2aed66b91aff53025afc":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            This press release is available in a number of different languages at the link below\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Access to COVID-19 Enhanced Illness Benefit and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for People in Direct Provision (multi-lingual)\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Any worker (including non-nationals) can get Enhanced Illness Benefit from day 1 if they need to self-isolate\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Social Protection Minister, Heather Humphreys TD, has today reassured workers who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, or certified by a medical doctor to self-isolate because they are a probable source of COVID-19, that her department\u2019s Enhanced Illness Benefit payment is available to them.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All employees (other than some public sector employees who pay a modified rate of social insurance) and self-employed, including non-nationals and people living in Direct Provision,\n are entitled to claim and receive the special COVID-19 Illness Benefit payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Earlier this week, Minister Humphreys secured government approval to extend the duration of the Enhanced Illness Benefit scheme until 31 March next year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To receive this payment an employee must:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tbe diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection as certified by a registered medical practitioner or, be certified by a registered medical practitioner to self-isolate\n\tbe aged between 18 and 66 years\n\tbe employed or self-employed and have worked in the four weeks preceding their \u2018declared certified from date\u2019\n\thave a contract of employment (if an employee)\n\thave at least one paid qualifying social insurance contribution in the 4 weeks immediately before claiming the payment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            How to apply:\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The quickest and easiest for way to apply is online at www.MyWelfare.ie.\n Application forms are also available from the department by contacting us at (01) 704 3300.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        No waiting days are applied to COVID-19 claims, meaning that the payment starts on the first day that the person is medically certified as being unfit to attend work.

The opportunity to exchange our experiences to date and to discuss possible next steps, is very welcome. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Since we last met in September, it has become clear that the catastrophic and highly disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism sector, will be more prolonged than first feared and will possibly be felt for several years to come. Recovery will be slow and we need to find common solutions, not just within the EU, but on a worldwide basis. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Making international travel safe again, while having regard to the evolving epidemiological situation, the evolution of testing technologies and progress being made on vaccination programmes, will be key to kick-starting tourism\u2019s recovery. Close coordination between all of the EU Member States will remain crucial as we roll out the vaccination programme and hopefully move in the not too distant future to begin removing those travel restrictions now in place in our Member States and restore the basic right to freedom of movement which all EU citizens enjoy. The EU traffic light system for travel allows for a coordinated and standardised approach and therefore should remain as a key measure, as we hopefully move towards the end game of this pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While mass tourism may not be on the horizon in the near future, it is crucially important that we remain committed to supporting the survival of the tourism ecosystem, so that when safe travel resumes, we will be in a position to kick-start an immediate and robust recovery. Any further initiatives at EU level which promote safe travel would be welcome and I urge the Commission to consider what is possible in this regard.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We need to continue to provide the supports necessary to enable our aviation sector to survive and to maintain the necessary core capability to retain strategic connectivity. For island economies such as Ireland, it is essential that tourism is enabled by safe, competitive international access and connectivity.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We must continue to provide supports for every tourism subsector to ensure the industry and the tourism offering, isn\u2019t massively diminished once the pandemic passes. The sector faces a significant challenge in acquiring and retaining staff with the appropriate skills. Many tourism businesses have already lost some of their best staff to other sectors, many of whom may not return to tourism due to job vulnerabilities exposed during the pandemic. Therefore it is vital that we support the sector to retain, upskill and reskill its workforce. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        With the right investment and support, particularly in the survival phase, tourism can retain and enhance capacity, skills and strategic assets that will strengthen the pace of recovery, when it begins. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Last May, the Irish Government established a Tourism Recovery Taskforce that developed a Tourism Recovery Plan, which includes a set of recommendations on how best our Tourism sector can adapt and recover from the current crisis. Last December, I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group, to oversee the implementation of this Recovery Plan and also to monitor the sector\u2019s recovery over the next number of years. This industry-led oversight Group has already submitted its first report to me and this has been a very useful input into my discussions with colleagues in Government. The collaborative approach we have taken to responding to the pandemic \u2013 involving industry the tourism agencies and Government \u2013 has been well received and has meant that we are very much attuned to the needs of the sector. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As we sow the seeds of tourism\u2019s recovery, we must not miss the opportunity to grow a more sustainable industry from the current crisis. It has never been more important that the recovery and regrowth of tourism is based on a sustainable and balanced approach. Ireland has the ambition to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practises and I am determined to develop a suite of actions to promote sustainable tourism practises in our country. The implementation of these actions along with the guiding principles we have developed for sustainable tourism development will underpin the advancement of a new tourism policy, with an overall emphasis on sustainability, to be adopted by the Irish Government. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The challenge for all of us is to make tourism less susceptible to the impacts of global events such as the current crisis. We need to make tourism more resilient, greener and more digitalised. We must cast a wider net in terms of our policy approach, recognising not just the environmental considerations but also the social and economic aspects of sustainability. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Over the next number of years, it is likely that we will see an increase in demand for outdoor leisure experiences, based on nature, such as walking, cycling and mountaineering. We need to implement policies that will support the development of eco-tourism, so as to build a greener, healthier and more environmentally friendly tourism offering. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Re-opening tourism businesses and managing their recovery in a way that is economically viable, safe and attractive for tourists and local communities will require coordination at a level not seen before. The roadmap to recovery will require flexibility, agility, investment and innovation, and will require a commitment to strong collaboration with the industry. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While we collectively continue to experience the dreadful impact of this pandemic on life, society and economy across Europe, there is now cause for cautious optimism as the rollout of vaccinations gathers pace.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I am confident that, together, we are resilient enough to overcome the challenges ahead and that we will see the return of a vibrant, sustainable and safe tourism sector in the not too distant future.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thank you.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","35b195f3e77ae12adcfabf37b6bba7732118f5c801ccd4155f45040ae919ce62":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        Check against delivery\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Introduction\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I move today two resolutions seeking the approval of the House for the following draft orders which provide for the extensions up to the end of June of two support schemes, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, the EWSS and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme, the CRSS:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tEmergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 (Covid-19: employment wage subsidy scheme) (Date Adjustment) (No. 2) Order 2021, \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        and\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tTaxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Covid Restrictions Support Scheme) (Date Adjustment) Order 2021\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Responding with speed and scale\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Speed and scale of response to the supply and demand shocks created by the pandemic has been the focus of our economic response. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Since March last year, we have moved rapidly, using the public sector balance sheet to replace lost private sector demand, in order to ensure that firms, workers and incomes were supported and protected through wage subsidies, deferrals of liabilities and income supports.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Our overarching objective has been to support households and firms, as well as to limit the \u2018scarring\u2019, or permanent, effects of the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Schemes\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The schemes we are seeking to extend today are part of the broad range of supports provided by the Government to help businesses through the pandemic and it is no exaggeration to say that the level of support provided to businesses has been unprecedented. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Significant levels of support have been provided by way of direct income supports via the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Wage Subsidy Schemes, which represent real payments to our citizens and businesses to help manage financially in these very difficult times.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) cost almost \u20ac3 billion; the EWSS has cost \u20ac2.8 billion with almost half a billion in PRSI foregone; the CRSS is approaching \u20ac0.5 billion; and \u20ac2.3 billion of tax debt has been warehoused. This gives a total of \u20ac9 billion in supports for businesses under the aegis of my Department alone. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition, \u20ac6.5 billion has been paid by the Department of Social Protection under the PUP.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Wage Subsidy Schemes have been a central pillar of our response to this pandemic, supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The TWSS was in place from March until the end of August. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The EWSS, which is an economy-wide support scheme open to all sectors, replaced the TWSS from 1 September 2020. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition to these schemes, a number of other Departments are also providing further direct supports, whether to specific sectors such as tourism and live performance or in specific circumstances, such as assistance in re-opening.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The beginning of the end \u2013 cautious reopening\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We have to look at the motions before the D\u00e1il today in the context of where we are in relation to the re-opening of the economy. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are already seeing the start of the re-opening process with the full return to schools from last Monday week, travel limits extended to 20 kilometres or within county and the resumption of residential construction, as well as early-learning and childcare projects. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This week, inter-county GAA training and elite athlete training was permitted to resume. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        And as we look towards this cautious reopening of our society and economy over the weeks and months ahead, it is clear from last week\u2019s Stability Programme Update that the relationship between economic activity and public health restrictions has weakened over each successive wave.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The adaptability and innovation shown by businesses and consumers is borne out by the high frequency, real-time economic data published by my Department, which shows that the impact of the current set of restrictions is around half that of the spring 2020 lockdown. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Much of this is down to the flexibility of our domestic enterprises.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Consumers have adjusted too. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Last month\u2019s VAT data, up 8 \u00bd per cent on the first quarter last year, shows that people have altered their behaviour.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        They are buying local, buying online and have shifted their consumption habits.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the medium\u2014term, the speed at which the economy can recover will, of course, depend on the success of our vaccination programme.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A consistent theme of the IMF and World Bank Spring meetings that I attended recently is that vaccine policy is economic policy.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        And our vaccination programme will be the touchstone for our economic recovery.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, it will take some time before the economy is fully re-opened, and in recognition of the challenges that continue to face businesses I want to reiterate today that there will be no cliff-edge in the removal of support. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Supports will continue for as long as is necessary to ensure a strong recovery.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We have not fought this pandemic and its economic fallout for over a year on a scale that is unprecedented in Irish economic history just to fall at the final hurdle. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Motions\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The motions are required as part of the process of extending the schemes until the end of June 2021.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the case of the CRSS, subparagraph (ii) of section 484(2)(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 inserted by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2020 provides that the Minister for Finance may vary the Scheme by extending the end date of the measure beyond 31 March 2021 (but not later than 31 December 2021). \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The draft Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Covid Restrictions Support Scheme) (Date Adjustment) Order 2021 provides for this extension and has been laid before the D\u00e1il on 8th April. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The legislation requires that the Order shall not be made unless a resolution approving the draft has been passed by the D\u00e1il. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In relation to EWSS, Section 28B(21) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides that the Minister for Finance may vary the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme by extending the end date of the measure beyond 31 March 2021 (but not later than 30 June 2021).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The draft Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 (Covid-19: Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme) (Date Adjustment) (No. 2) Order 2021 provides for this extension and has been laid before the D\u00e1il, also on 8th April. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Again, the legislation requires that the Order shall be approved by this House. This is similar to the processes we went through at the end of January in relation to the additional seasonal support over the Christmas period for the CRSS and early February in relation to the extension of the enhanced rates of EWSS to end-March. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are certain specified conditions which must be fulfilled before these Orders can be made and the necessary steps have been taken to comply with the legislation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Both the CRSS and EWSS schemes have been monitored with regular assessments undertaken, noting the continued challenges for the Irish economy arising from the pandemic, the Exchequer cost and scheme utilisation. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I recently published the assessments I received on the EWSS to date, for the period September 2020 to January 2021. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I note that the coverage of the EWSS remains significant, with over a quarter of all employers making a claim in January 2021 in relation to 15% of all employees in that month, thus clearly demonstrating that the EWSS is an important policy intervention during this challenging time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I have formally consulted with my colleagues, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath and, in respect of EWSS, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and have determined that it is necessary both schemes remain in place until 30 June 2021.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I think that it is fair to say that the two schemes have provided much needed support to businesses as they endeavour to cope with the effects of the pandemic and that they have helped ensure that businesses remain viable as we start the process of re-opening the economy. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The schemes in action\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The numbers are striking and I think that it is worthwhile to consider their impact.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As at today, 22nd April, 22,100 businesses have registered 25,900 premises for CRSS with Revenue. 148,400 claims for CRSS payments of \u20ac478.9 million in respect of 24,600 premises have been made to date and \u20ac475.5 million of this has been processed for payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        With regard to EWSS, 48,900 employers have currently registered with Revenue and over half a million employees have benefitted. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u20ac2.8 billion has been paid and almost half a billion in PRSI foregone so far. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As of last week, there were over 420,000 people in receipt of PUP.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the input of the Revenue Commissioners into the success of the schemes. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        They successfully re-engineered their systems to pay money out to businesses rather than taking money in. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Of course, they have continued in their vital role of tax collection, while facing the difficulties that all organisations have faced in dealing with working from home for a very large proportion of staff. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        They have also provided helpful guidance on the operation of the schemes and have added to this guidance as issues arose. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I wish to first look at the extension of the EWSS for now to 30 June 2021. The EWSS represents a substantial and key part of the Government\u2019s response to the pandemic. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This will be the second extension of this scheme by the Government, thus demonstrating that the EWSS is a successful and vital policy instrument in supporting viable firms, encouraging employment and assisting in maintaining the link between employers and employees. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The primary employer qualification for the EWSS is based on the employer's turnover in the current six-month period being less, compared with the same pre-pandemic position period in 2019. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that it is operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from 1st January to 30th June 2021 compared with the equivalent period in 2019. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The EWSS is designed to be flexible for the employer and take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover so if there is a reduction in turnover in the future because of a change in circumstance the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that later period.   \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The level of subsidy given to the employer is based on the number of paid workers on payroll per week and a flat, per-head value rate is applied based on prospective pay levels so that claims may also be made for new hires or seasonal workers.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Following the re-introduction of Level 5 restrictions in October 2020, the Government decided that from 20th October 2020 the amount of the EWSS subsidy paid per employee would be up to \u20ac350 per week, graduated on the basis of the income of the employee, in line with the levels of payments given under the PUP scheme.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As set out in Finance Act 2020, the enhanced rates were to be in place until 31st  January 2021 after which they were due to return to the original rates of \u20ac151.50 for those paid more than \u20ac151.50 per week and \u20ac203 for those paid more than \u20ac203 per week. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, given the current circumstances with this public health pandemic, the Government decided on 23rd February last to maintain the current EWSS rates to 30th June 2021.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is aligned with the rates of payment of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Such alignment is important, as otherwise there would be a risk of migration of employees from the EWSS to the PUP, which has the potential to undermine the very purpose of the EWSS \u2013 supporting viable businesses and maintaining the link between employers and employees. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The EWSS is also an important bridge between social welfare payments, such as the PUP, and regular employment, which is the ultimate goal. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The relevant legislation provides that, as Minister for Finance, I may vary certain aspects of the scheme such as the end date, the rate of subsidy, and the criteria of the turnover test for qualifying employers, by Ministerial Order.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This affords me, as Minister, sufficient flexibility to ensure that the scheme remains agile and responsive in light of changing circumstances associated with the pandemic. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In terms of direct subsidy payments, the estimated cost of the extension of the enhanced rates for Q2 is \u20ac1.167 billion. This is to be met from the voted expenditure of the Department of Social Protection.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition, it is estimated that further \u20ac180 million will arise from the continuation of the 0.5% reduced rate of Employers\u2019 PRSI, thus giving an estimated total cost of about \u20ac1.3 billion. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Covid Restrictions Support Scheme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Turning to the CRSS, this scheme has provided much needed support to businesses that have been forced to close or restrict access to their premises on foot of public health regulations. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The vast majority of businesses in Ireland are affected by Covid but the CRSS is intended to target specific businesses where access by customers is restricted. The CRSS is and was intended to be a targeted scheme, and was never meant to be a general support measure for the entire economy. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As I have said, the economy is only slowly and cautiously beginning to re-open and therefore the Government has agreed that the CRSS should be extended for now to 30 June 2021. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The \u201crestart week\u201d provided for in the CRSS, which allows a business to claim for an extra week upon reopening after restrictions are lifted, will be of particular benefit as businesses start to re-open.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The estimated cost of the extension of the CRSS is in excess of \u20ac240 million, to be met out of resources allocated for Covid contingency funding. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As we look forward to reopening the economy and society in the coming weeks and months, we can expect an initial rebound, in part fuelled by pent-up demand, but this is not the same as a full  recovery.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We recognise that re-opening will be costly and  will pose new challenges that will need to be sustained by continued supports and corrective measures to allow us get the balance right between supporting recovery and cost to the Exchequer.   \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Conclusion\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I will conclude by restating the Government\u2019s commitment that there be no cliff-edge end to the economic supports at the end of June. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are conscious that continued support will be required to assist sectors of the economy on the path to recovery and we will set out these plans in the coming weeks.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The resolutions before the House seek approval of the two orders to extend these important schemes and I commend them to the House.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ENDS\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","38ecdb7d1b62077869f053a2c919c8702d8d2db94c6e5be05ab646c3bf1145bd":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                        \t\n                            1.

In recognition of the crucial role of animal health and welfare in economic and environmental efficiency, applicants to the scheme can also select from a number of optional health and welfare measures including meal feeding or vaccination of weanlings and\/or faecal egg testing of suckler cows. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dairy Beef \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Minister also reminded farmers that the new Dairy Beef Calf measure for 2021, which has a budget allocation of \u20ac5 million in 2021 will also close on 26 April 2021. The objective is to increase the economic and environmental efficiency of beef from the dairy herd, and to facilitate further the integration of the dairy and beef sectors by providing support for farmers who are rearing progeny from the dairy herd. The core action is the weighing of eligible calves for which there is a payment of \u20ac20 per calf up to a maximum of 20 calves. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister McConalogue acknowledged the strong potential for better integration of dairy and beef systems to provide a new income stream for beef farmers.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Minister stated that, \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThe aim of this pioneering Dairy Beef Calf measure is to increase the economic and environmental efficiency of beef from the dairy herd and to facilitate further the integration of the dairy and beef sectors.

This will be done through the enhancement of the national herd dataset for genetic evaluations, with a view to supporting the adoption of best practice and more informed decision making at farm level. The Programme will target the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves through the collection of the live weights of cows and progeny in the herd of each participant; improving the welfare of suckler calves at the time of weaning; and controlling liver fluke in adult suckler cows.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The objective of the Dairy Beef Calf Measure is to support decision making on farms through better quality data on herd performance and to increase the economic and environmental efficiency of the beef from the dairy herd, and to facilitate further the integration of the dairy and beef sectors by providing support for farmers who are rearing progeny from the dairy herd. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ENDS\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","44783fed2b45614c200172a8ac209468973c585699e923496e52b84c082c0b02":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                        \t\n                            1.

These meant that incorrect grades were issued to some students when they received their results on 7 September. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On discovery of these errors, the Department contracted an independent third party, US-based Education Testing Services (ETS), to undertake an independent expert opinion on the coding.  This report was received on 3 October. The report identified two issues, the first an error relating to how the code handled cases where students did not sit all three core subjects (Irish, English and Maths) at Junior Cycle level. The second issue concerned how the algorithm used in standardisation process treated students\u2019 marks at the extreme ends of the marks scale. ETS confirmed, however, that this second issue does not have any meaningful impact on results. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The three errors identified have now been corrected and the full set of student data has been re-run in the corrected model. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The results of the correction mean that some students are now receiving higher Calculated Grades in one or more subjects than the grades they received on 7 September.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As a result of this:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \t5,408 students will receive a higher grade, by one grade band, in one subject\n\t621 students will receive a higher grade, by one grade band, in two subjects\n\t71 students will receive a higher grade, by one grade band, in three or more subjects\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition to the students who received a lower grade than they should have in this year\u2019s Leaving Certificate, some students received a higher grade. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, they will not be affected in any way. Their grades stand.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Those marked down as a result of the errors have had their proper grade restored.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            How students will know if they are impacted \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students receiving higher Calculated Grades will receive a text message and email confirming this and advising them to log on to the Calculated Grades Student Portal from 6.00pm on 3 October to view their new results, where they will also be able to print a new statement of results which will replace their first statement. Students whose grades are not impacted will also receive a text message to this effect. Their grades will remain unchanged.  They will see no change to their Calculated Grades if they log onto the portal. No student will receive a lower grade as a result of this process.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            No student has received a downgrade on 3 October from the results they received on 7 September\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition to the students who received a lower grade than they should have in this year\u2019s Leaving Certificate Certificate as a result of the errors, some students received a higher grade. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These students will not be affected in any way. Their grades stand. Students will only receive improved grades as a result of these errors. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The CAO will assess who might be eligible for a revised CAO offer\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department has sent a corrected file of results to the CAO, who will assess this to establish who is eligible for a new CAO offer. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Any student who would have been entitled to a different offer in previous CAO rounds if they received the correct grade on 7 September will receive this offer, or a deferred offer, as soon as practicable after the updating of results.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will work with the CAO and the higher education institutions to see how these students can be facilitated to commence the course that they would, in other circumstances, have been offered in an earlier round.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The errors that were found \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        On 30 September, the Department of Education and Skills announced that two errors had been identified in the Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades process. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department then contracted Educational Testing Services (ETS), to conduct a review of the code for the system of Calculated Grades. In their review, ETS raised two issued, including a third error which they had identified regarding the code. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All three errors concerned how the coding for the system of Calculated Grades drew in and handled Junior Cycle data. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The first error was in a single line of code programmed by the Department\u2019s external consultant, Polymetrika International Inc. That error affected the way in which students\u2019 Junior Cycle results were included in the national standardisation process.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It was intended that students\u2019 Junior Cycle results in Irish, English and Maths would be included in the data used by the national standardisation process, together with their best two other subjects. These data were to be considered at an aggregated class level. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The error meant that students\u2019 results in Irish, English and Maths were put together with their weakest two other subjects for determining the overall performance of their class. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The second error related to the inclusion of candidates\u2019 Junior Cycle results in the subject Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE) as part of the data used in the national standardisation process. This was incorrect, as in line with the design of the Calculated Grades process, this subject should not have been included in the data used by the model. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The third error, identified by ETS, relates to where students did not sit all three core subjects (Irish, English and Maths) at Junior Cycle level. In those cases, the system was meant to use the average national Junior Cycle score of the group of students who took their Leaving Certificate in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. Instead, it chose the student\u2019s next best subject for inclusion in the group computation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These three errors have now been corrected and the full set of student data has been re-run in the corrected model. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Student\u2019s individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine their Calculated Grades\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Your Junior Cycle exam results, or whether you sat the Junior Cycle examinations at all, were not used to determine your own specific Calculated Grades. Instead, the overall, or aggregate, Junior Cycle results for class groupings were used, as this aggregate data provides a good means of determining the performance of a class group in the Leaving Certificate.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The Department made further checks before issuing revised Calculated Grades results\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        As well as review activity undertaken by the Department and by Polymetrika, the Department contracted ETS, Educational Testing Service, a US-based non-profit organisation which specialises in educational measurement, to independently review the coding for the Calculated Grades model. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ETS has concluded its review and submitted its report to the Department on 3 October.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The ETS report has been published on the Department\u2019s website here.\n \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            For students who submitted an appeal of their Calculated Grades\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The appeals process will continue as normal, whether or not you have received an improved grade following the rectification of the errors. This is because the appeals process is a technical appeal, focused on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Applications for appeals closed on Wednesday 16 September. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Every effort is being made to process appeals as quickly as possible but it is not possible at this time to commit to a date for the issue of the appeal results. Students will be notified of this date as soon as possible. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is not possible to provide an expedited appeal for any student or group of students. All appeals will be processed and results released simultaneously to ensure fairness and equity to all.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Students who applied to higher education institutions outside of Ireland \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        If you are notified of an upgrade in a subject(s) as a result of the errors, and you believe that it would have made a material difference to your application, you should in the first instance contact the higher education institution you applied to. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If necessary, following that, you can contact the Department by emailing lc2020@education.gov.ie\n. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            CAO Round 3 Offers issued on 1 October\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        CAO round 3 offers issued at 5.00 pm on Thursday 1 October.

For the Calculated Grades system to be operated with integrity, and to ensure fairness to all students, an estimated percentage mark, based on credible, satisfactory evidence, can only be accepted from an appropriate source.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are two particular groups of students who may not have been able to receive Calculated Grades and they will already have been advised of this during August 2020:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tstudents who were enrolled in full-time education but were studying an extra subject(s) outside the school\n\texternal students who were not enrolled in full-time education and are regarded as out-of-school learners\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In cases where a student was attending school, but was studying one or more subjects outside of school, school Principals were asked to make every effort to provide an estimated percentage mark for that subject(s) provided there was sufficient, credible evidence available from an appropriate source.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Out of school learners had to apply directly to the CGEO for Calculated Grades.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where it was not deemed possible to provide a Calculated Grade in a subject(s), to either an out of school learner or a student studying a subject outside of school, the student was contacted by the CGEO to inform them of this decision.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Despite every effort being made by schools and by the Department of Education and Skills to provide Calculated Grades to as many students as possible, there was a small number of cases where there was no credible evidence from an appropriate source to support a Calculated Grade in a particular subject.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where it was not possible to provide a Calculated Grade, students had the right to appeal. They will also have the opportunity to sit the 2020 Leaving Certificate examinations in one or more subjects. The 2020 postponed Leaving Certificate examinations will commence on Monday 16 November, subject to public health advice.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Key dates after the 7 September results\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Last updated 07 September 2020\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Key dates after the results\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \t7 September 2020 \u2013 UCAS deadline for confirmation by Irish students that the \u2018remaining offer conditions\u2019 have been met.

If that is your own situation, you will be granted an exemption in the subject(s) solely for matriculation\/minimum entry purposes. This exemption will be granted automatically and you do not have to apply for it.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        You cannot use the exemptions(s) to satisfy additional programme requirements over and above the matriculation\/minimum entry requirements.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The subject(s) will count as subject(s) for matriculation but will not attract points.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        You can get further information from the admissions offices of the individual institution you have applied to.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Extra places in higher education in 2020\/21\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        There will be extra places available if you have applied for college this year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On 1 September Government approved an additional 1,250 places in the higher education system, on a diverse range of high-demand courses as part of a package of measures to support those applying to college in 2020.

It also provides scope to ease anxiety, reduce uncertainty and demonstrate the ability of the education system to respond to student concerns.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The results of Calculated Grades Appeals Stage 1 and 2 have been issued\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Last updated 16 October 2020\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students who were disappointed with one or more of their Calculated Grades had the opportunity to submit an appeal.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The appeals process was open from 9am on 14 September until 5pm on 16 September. Appeals were submitted via the Calculated Grades Student Portal. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The appeals process has three stages, which are outlined below.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The results of stages 1 and 2 of the appeals process were made available to students who submitted appeals on Friday 16 October on the Calculated Grades Student Portal. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The appeals process is a process review focused on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is not possible to appeal the information (estimated percentage mark or rank order) provided by the school. Due to the nature of the Calculated Grades system the professional judgement of the school is outside of the appeals process.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The design of the statistical model and the application of the national standardisation process is also outside of the scope of the appeals process.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students who remain unhappy with the outcome of the stages 1 and 2 appeals can apply for a stage 3 appeal. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Purpose of the appeal process\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The appeal process is a process review, focused on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of the data. An example of this would be whether any mistake was made in entering your information into any of the systems used in the process.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            How the appeal process works\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The appeals process is a process review focused on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Appeals were accepted from individual students only.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Appeals from schools or other groups were not accepted.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The appeals process includes three stages as follows:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tStage 1: Checks were undertaken on the forms completed by the school and that the information was transferred correctly from the forms to the data collection system\n\tStage 2: A review was carried out to ensure that the data was correctly received and processed through the systems used in the national standardisation process conducted by the department\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Data checks included a check to ensure that the rank order of the class group for the subject and level taken were preserved in the standardisation process and that students placed on the same school-estimated mark in the same subject and at the same level taken by the school are conferred with the same calculated mark.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Stages 1 and 2 were taken together.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tStage 3: Students unhappy with the outcome of the above process can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the department. \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students who wish to invoke this process can do so by downloading and completing an application form from the Student Portal, which must then be returned via email or post.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The closing date for receipt of completed forms is 5pm on Friday 23 October.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The Scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered at Stages 1 and 2.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students were also given the opportunity to register for the postponed Leaving Certificate examinations which are due to begin on 16 November. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            If you want to submit other evidence of your achievement in support of your appeal\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        As the appeal is a technical check of the data being processed through the system, you should not send any supporting documentation or evidence of achievement. Material such as this will not be considered and may not be returned.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Purpose of standardisation\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order (the student's place in the class group) for each of your subjects. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school. Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark. But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The national standardisation process has led to some school estimates staying the same; some being increased; and some being reduced. The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there are 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics (e.g. school type, student gender, etc.) either at the level of the student or the school. The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We appreciate that some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved. While this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published, it may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school has been adjusted downwards.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Schools prepared this information in May and submitted it in June. Schools were asked not to discuss their estimates with students on the basis that the marks assigned by the school may not be the final marks and it might be misleading to students to have this information in advance of the Calculated Grades process being completed. We appreciate the cooperation shown by schools in this regard.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Your class rank information\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Last updated 28 September 2020\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students have previously been provided with their Calculated Grades, estimated marks and calculated marks through the student portal. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        From Monday 28 September at 9 am students will also have access to their rank order in their class. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            What is Class Rank Order \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In order to form the basis for Calculated Grades, schools provided for each student at each of their subjects and levels an estimated mark and rank order within their class group. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The rank order is the student\u2019s position in their class group relative to the other students in their class at that subject and level as indicated by their school. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Personal Choice to access Rank Order \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students are under no obligation to access this information.  It is their personal choice to login to the portal if they wish to access this information.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Personal Data to be treated sensitively \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The rank order is the personal information of each individual student. Students are asked to be extremely mindful in sharing this information with other students in their class as they might inadvertently reveal the rank order of other students in the class, which is their personal information.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Understanding Rank Order \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Each student\u2019s position in their class rank order has been preserved in the national standardisation process. Students\u2019 position in the class relative to other students in the school taking the same subject and level was indicated through the in-school alignment process. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This means that the standards in each class relative to other classes of the same subject and level in the school were indicated by the estimated marks. This means that while a student might be at a high rank order within their class group there may be other students in the school who have received higher calculated grades than that student as the estimated marks of these other students were higher.  Likewise, a student who received a lower rank order in a class may have received a higher calculated grade than a student in another class who got a higher rank order. Again, this is down to the estimated percentage marks awarded to each of these students.  All students in the school with the same estimated marks for that subject and level, whether in the same class or another class of the same subject and level in the school, will have the same calculated marks and the same calculated grade.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            No Need to make a Data Access Request\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        This information is being made available to all students who wish to access it through the student portal. This information is the personal information of students and would be available to them under a data access or a freedom of information request.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Reason for providing this information through the portal \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Following detailed consideration of the issues associated with making this information available, the department considers that, on balance, it is better to make this information available without request through the portal rather than students needing to make a request for it. This is in line with good practice under both Data Protection and Freedom of Information legislation.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In making this decision, the department engaged with the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) who was satisfied that making this information available through the portal was an efficient way to provide students with access to their personal data which is considered to add to transparency and fairness about the calculated grades process.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The department considers having consulted with the DPC and obtained legal advices, that it is in the best interests of students to enable them to access their personal data in a prompt and efficient manner, without placing unnecessary barriers to them accessing what undoubtedly is their personal data, to which they have a right of access under law.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Purpose of providing Rank Order now\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The provision of rank order at this time is purely for information purposes. The appeals process for calculated grades has closed but, in any event, both estimated marks and rank order form part of the professional judgment of the school and are outside of the scope of the appeals process, which comprises a technical check on the data submitted by schools and the further processing of the data.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Wellbeing of students\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Leaving Certificate results and CAO offers time  can be an anxious time for many students.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 the tradition of coming back to school to celebrate the results with teachers and classmates on the day that the results issue was not the  same as in previous years.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Gov.ie\/LeavingCertificate page\n  contains a lot of information that will be helpful to students in understanding the Calculated Grades process and providing clarity on issues they may have.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Schools have been advised to  provide support to students during this period, through enabling students to come to the school if they wish at a scheduled time, following COVID-19 and health and safety protocols, to meet with members of the Student Support Team such as Guidance Counsellors, Year Heads, Tutors and Chaplains.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        HSE\/HSE-funded service providers will be available to support students through the provision of e-mental health services.

Schools were asked to draw on a range of evidence in making their judgment. Schools were provided with very clear guidance as to how to approach this process in the document Calculated Grades for Leaving Certificate 2020 \u2013 Guide for Schools on Providing Estimated Percentage Marks and Class Rank Orderings. You can read more about this here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            If you want to know why your calculated mark is lower than your estimated percentage mark from the school\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Research makes clear that because teacher judgements are made in the context of each school, they need to be examined and adjusted at a national level to ensure comparability across different schools and that a common national standard is applied.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Schools will have taken different approaches to providing estimated percentage marks for their students. While clear guidance was provided to schools in avoiding bias during the process of estimating marks for their students, it is inevitable that some schools will have been overly harsh in their estimations while others will have been overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A process of national standardisation was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The national standardisation process has led to some school estimates staying the same; some being increased and some being reduced.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Appeals can be made by individual students only\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Calculated Grades appeal process is student focused and applications will be accepted through the Student Portal from individual students only making their own decision to submit an appeal.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Appeals from schools, entire class groups, or other groups will not be accepted.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            There is no fee to appeal\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        While there is normally a per subject fee to appeal Leaving Certificate results, this year appeals against Calculated Grades are free.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Appeal processes can lead to a result being upgraded, downgraded or staying the same\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Following the processing of the appeals, results may stay the same; be upgraded or be downgraded.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Notification of the outcome of an appeal\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Anyone appealing a grade will be notified of the outcome of their appeal through the Student Portal.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Date for issue of appeal results to be confirmed\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Every effort will be made to process appeals as quickly as possible but we are unable at this time to commit to a date for the issue of the appeal results.

The main reason for this is to ensure equity and fairness for all students. As a result, it was expected from the outset that estimated marks received from schools would change due to the standardisation process.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The technical detail of the standardisation process is now published and available here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is as a result of this standardisation process that the Calculated Grades will have an equal standing as previous and future Leaving Certificate grades. If this is not done, it would undermine the currency and value of Calculated Grades.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Research clearly shows that because teacher judgments are made in the context of each school, they need to be examined and adjusted as necessary at a national level to ensure comparability across different schools and that a common national standard is applied.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Schools will have taken different approaches to providing estimated percentage marks for their students this year. Although clear guidance was provided on how to avoid bias whilst doing this, it is inevitable that some schools will have been overly harsh in their estimations while others will have been overly generous. Standardising the estimated marks brings schools into line with each other across a national standard. As a result, some estimated marks will have been reduced and others will have been increased.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Why schools\u2019 estimated percentage marks cannot be used alone\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The approach taken to calculated grades is based on international, educational research which tells us that teachers are more likely to make accurate judgments of student performance in a high stakes context and that teachers are good at ranking their students relative to each other. Therefore, schools were asked to provide an estimated mark and a rank order for each student in a class group.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, teachers in each school may be unaware of standards in other schools. Some may over-estimate student marks while others may underestimate marks. Under-estimation and over-estimation of marks does not occur evenly across all schools. Standardisation helps to ensure that students in different schools are treated equitably.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        By collecting and using a range of different types of information, the different sources of data complement each other, to provide the most accurate and fair set of results within the limitations of the available data. As the school data is only accurate at school level, the final calculated marks, and so Calculated Grades, provided to students, for any subject and level, may be higher or lower than the estimates provided by their school. While the school-based estimates may move upwards or downwards, the class rank order, provided by the school, will not be changed.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Information on the details of the standardisation process\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The standardisation process is now complete. A report by the National Standardisation Group which details how the process was implemented has been published and is available here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition the Report of the Technical Working Group has been published. This report provides the background to the design of the Calculated Grade model and is available here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Other documents from the bodies that oversaw the calculated grades system and the national standardisation process have also been published:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tFirst Letter of Opinion regarding the Calculated Grades System from the Independent Steering Committee to the Minister for Education\n\tCalculated Grades 2020 External Reviewer Statement \u2013 Statement in Advance of the Issue of Results\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These documents are available here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Changes made to the standardisation process announced on 1 September\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The main reason for applying a standardisation process to the system of Calculated Grades is to ensure equity and fairness for all students. This principle of equity and fairness underpinned the original Government Decision of 8 May 2020 to introduce a system of Calculated Grades and has been the guiding principle in all of the work undertaken by the Calculated Grades Executive Office.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is important to understand that from the outset, estimated marks received from schools were expected to change as a result of the standardisation process. Irish teachers and schools engaged diligently in providing estimated marks and rankings in 786 schools and centres, but they had never done such work in the past. Although teachers in each school or centre were knowledgeable about standards of learning among their own students, they could not be fully aware of standards in other schools across the country. This meant that it would not have been possible for them to make absolutely accurate judgements in terms of the national standard for Leaving Certificate grades for all subjects at higher, ordinary and foundation level. Standardisation was necessary to ensure that the candidates receiving calculated grades in 2020 are treated fairly and equitably relative to each other.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition, it is desirable to ensure that candidates within the 2020 cohort who are sitting the alternative written examinations in November and those who sat the examinations in 2019 or who will sit the examinations in 2021 and other years, are also equitably treated. By reducing excessively generous marking among those receiving calculated grades, and by increasing the marks of those that have been marked too harshly in teachers\u2019 estimates, standardisation helps to ensure a degree of comparability between students receiving calculated grades and those sitting examinations.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The standardisation process put in place at the start of the Calculated Grades process used a range of data sets, including:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tthe estimated percentage marks and class ranking of students supplied by schools to the Calculated Grades Executive Office\n\tJunior Cycle Exam performance of the class of 2020 in each school, to be used at a group level rather than an individual level\n\tthe historical school distribution \u2013 based on historical Leaving Certificate Examination performance at the school level across 2017, 2018 and 2019\n\thistorical national Leaving Certificate results data for 2017, 2018 and 2019 with student-level linkages to the corresponding Junior Certificate results data of those student cohorts\n\tthe historical national distribution of student results on a subject-by-subject basis\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On 1 September the government approved the finalised process for Calculated Grades. The process, through the examination and adjustment of estimated percentage marks from schools, will fulfil its key role of ensuring that the calculated grades iron out the unfairness that could arise when different schools applied various standards when judging the performance of students. The government agreed to a number of adjustments proposed by the Minister. The Minister was conscious that the use of school-by-school historical data on the performance of students in previous years\u2019 cohorts (data set 3 above) had been criticised in public commentary about calculated grades and that it had led in other jurisdictions to accusations that students attending disadvantaged schools in those jurisdictions were at risk of being treated unfairly or subjected to \u201ca post-code lottery\u201d. There had also been criticism about the judgements of schools being adjusted to rigidly maintain year-to-year comparability in the national standards of the examinations.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In view of the above the Minister proposed that the finalised standardisation model should not include the school-by-school historical data on the Leaving Certificate performance of students in the school in previous years. She also proposed placing a reduced reliance on the historical national distribution of student results on a subject-by-subject basis (data set 5 above). These adjustments to the model were agreed by Government.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As a result of the changes, even greater emphasis was placed on the estimated percentage marks provided by schools, while still using to a limited extent historical national distribution data, along with the combined Junior Certificate exam performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            How this change impacted on the process\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The outcomes from the model reflect the objective of ensuring that the school estimates are given priority. Schools\u2019 estimated percentage marks remain at the core of the model.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On an overall basis the results are stronger than in previous years, with different effects clear across various subjects and levels. However, the government considers that this is acceptable given the exceptional nature of the year that Leaving Certificate students have experienced.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The finalised standardisation model is not showing any differential effects against disadvantaged schools. In fact, the attainment gap has narrowed compared to previous years.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The process will also deliver on the commitment made that stronger performing students in traditionally lower-performing schools can attain beyond the normal range of grades provided their performance has been reflected in the interval level information between students in the rank order provided by the schools as set out in the Guide for Schools.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Do my individual Junior Cycle examination results determine my Calculated Grades\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        No. Your individual Junior Cycle results do not determine your Calculated Grades. Rather, what the Calculated Grades process does is to take the overall Junior Cycle results of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and use these to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group. The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level. The process is not applied at an individual student level.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Further information on this is available in the Report from the National Standardisation Group, which can be found here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            How the Calculated Grades processes were overseen\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        A range of steps were taken to ensure adequate oversight of the various Calculated Grades processes:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \ta National Standardisation Group implemented the national standardisation process and the application, review and adjustment of the data in line with the principles, parameters and constraints associated with the model to arrive at fair and just representations of student performance\n\ta Calculated Grades Programme Board provided governance and decision-making for the overall Calculated Grades programme\n\tan Independent Steering Committee oversaw the quality and independence of the process and reported to the Minister\n\tan External Reviewer was appointed as a further independent expert to provide oversight of the system and overall validation on the model, including the appeals system\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Differences between the approach in Ireland and the standardisation process that applied in the UK\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are a number of very important distinctions between the UK approach to standardisation and that applicable in Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tthe Calculated Grades model used in Ireland gives primacy to the teachers\u2019 estimated marks. The Irish standardisation model takes as its starting point the teachers\u2019 estimated marks, not the historical patterns of achievement in each school used as the starting point in the UK. Also, the UK relied in most instances on student ranking only and could not take account of the relative differences between students\u2019 marks\n\tunder the Calculated Grades model we collected much more precise information about student achievement. We collected estimated percentage marks for each subject for each student from schools, not estimated grades. This has allowed the model to adjust much more carefully how we combine different sources of information that we have concerning students\u2019 performance\n\tthe Calculated Grades model built in systems that are able to identify and fairly accredit the learning of an exceptional student, irrespective of the school that he or she attended.

It was comprised of representatives from the Calculated Grades Executive Office, the Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate, the Educational Research Centre and the State Examinations Commission. The report of the group can be found here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A Calculated Grades Programme Board provided governance and decision-making for the overall programme associated with the Calculated Grades Model and process. The Board was chaired by an Assistant Secretary General from the Department of Education and Skills and membership comprises officials from the Calculated Grades Executive Office, the wider Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A non-statutory Independent Steering Committee to oversee the quality and independence of the process being undertaken by the Calculated Grades Executive Office was established by the Minister. The Steering Committee comprises six independent members appointed by the Minister and is chaired by Dr \u00c1ine Lawlor, former Director of the Teaching Council. The Steering Committee was established to provide assurance to the Minister as to the quality and integrity of the outcomes of the Calculated Grades system.

In addition, as set out in this Chapter, the Government also drives a number of overarching projects and engagements which support our overall Brexit priorities. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Economic and Budgetary Measures \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        While Ireland has one of the most open economies internationally, the UK remains a key partner and is the destination for almost 14% of our goods and services exports (2018) and the source of 13.5% of our imports (2018). \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Overall trade with the UK was valued at about \u20ac82.1 billion in 2018. It is a vital market for our SMEs. Changes in the East-West trade relationship due to Brexit will increase costs and affect productivity and competitiveness. A range of studies in recent years all point to substantial impacts for the Irish economy.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Brexit comes at a time when the economy is already hugely challenged as a result of COVID19. Elements of Brexit readiness work, such as business and employment supports, are already being applied in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy response to the spread of the COVID-19 virus both domestically and internationally, while necessary from a public health perspective, has resulted in a sharp contraction in global and domestic economic activity. The size and speed of the impact is unprecedented in modern times. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A range of studies point to the negative impact Brexit, in any form, will have on economic growth in Ireland.  The Department of Finance has projected over the medium-term the level of GDP would be around 2 \u2013 3\u00bc percentage points lower relative to a hypothetical status quo scenario, with most of the impact in the first year or so.  Underneath these figures are significant regional and sectoral variations with agri-food, fisheries, manufacturing and retail, the most exposed sectors.  These projections pre-date the COVID-19 impact, but it is clear that we are facing into the end of the transition period from a fundamentally different economic starting point than for a no deal Brexit in 2019.   \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Government has been planning for Brexit since before the UK referendum to ensure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for all scenarios. Significant dedicated measures and supports were announced in Budgets 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Supports up to and including Budget 2019 amounted to over \u20ac800 million, and Budget 2020 provided for more than \u20ac1 billion to be spent in the event of Brexit occurring without a Withdrawal Agreement. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Further targeted measures to support businesses and affected sectors prepare and adapt will be considered in the context of Budget 2021. In order to inform these considerations, the Department of Finance and the ESRI have examined the interrelationship between COVID19 and Brexit on short-term economic prospects. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Overall, this work suggests that if you add the Brexit shock to that of COVID-19 the number of sectors exposed to risk increases but the impacts are not magnified by the interaction of the two economic shocks. Nevertheless, we  expect the capacity of businesses and households to manage a second economic shock will be more limited. This research will inform the Government\u2019s macroeconomic forecasts as part of Budget 2021 and will be published shortly. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Many of the Government\u2019s existing Brexit supports have been applied to respond to COVID-19. These, along with the wider COVID-19 economic response measures, can assist businesses to improve their resilience ahead of the end of the transition period.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, there will also be additional challenges, including new customs and SPS requirements and trading arrangements, which are unique to Brexit. In light of this, the Government\u2019s July Jobs stimulus\n included a \u20ac20 million Brexit package to help businesses and affected sectors to prepare for the changes that are ahead.   Further information on business supports can be found here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A number of EU supports will also be available. The European Council recently approved a \u20ac5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve, to support countries and sectors worst-hit by the impacts of Brexit. The Government is engaging with the Commission as it develops and rolls out this fund, to ensure that Irish businesses and sectors benefit to the maximum extent possible, in the context of the disproportionate impact Brexit will have on Ireland. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Government actions\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Government will in the period to the end of transition: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tcontinue to provide a wide variety of supports and assistance to businesses to help them get Brexit Ready, while also continuing to provide supports to businesses and individuals impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\n\tconsider analysis of the economic impacts of Brexit, including the overlay of COVID-19 impacts, in deciding the overall approach to Budget 2021\n\tconsider further measures to support businesses and affected sectors to prepare for, and adapt to, Brexit in the context of Budget 2021 \n\tcontinue to engage constructively with the European Commission to explore the full range of State aid flexibilities and supports for sectors impacted by Brexit. \n\twork with the Commission to ensure Irish businesses and sectors benefit from the \u20ac5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve, to the maximum extent possible. \n\tincrease communications and stakeholder engagement to ensure businesses are aware of available supports and programmes\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            What businesses should do\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tvisit www.gov.ie\/Brexit\n for information on available Government and EU support programmes. \n\tavail of Brexit advice from your trade representative body and\/or the relevant state agencies to ensure you are not missing out on vital help available\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Communications and Stakeholder Engagement \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        A key element of our readiness work will include a major public information campaign to businesses and citizens and will be underpinned by outreach to key stakeholders. In the coming months, all Ministers and Departments will further step-up their levels of engagement with stakeholders across the island of Ireland. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Minister for Foreign Affairs will continue to chair the Brexit Stakeholders Forum.   Our communications strategy for the next phase of Getting Ireland Brexit Ready will directly address the needs of citizens and businesses.  It will continue to be audience led and strongly focused on \"Calls to Action\". \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It will encourage engagement and action on the part of business and citizens to prepare for the enduring changes arising in 2021 by highlighting that the status quo is not an option and now is the time to prepare for the end of the transition period.    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Central to this will be our trader engagement programmes to support business readiness for the new trading environment at the end of the transition period.  Our Getting Your Business Brexit Ready campaign will target small businesses, including shops, hauliers, farmers, fishers and others who trade with the UK, who are most exposed.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The campaign will comprise of events, stakeholder briefings, and national and local radio and press campaigns to build further awareness among businesses and sectoral audiences of the challenges and changes that will arise when the transition period ends, highlight the steps the Government is taking to address these challenges and encourage them to take necessary actions and to take up all relevant offers of support. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We will also refresh and re-run public information campaigns, targeting communications based on the circumstances of the citizen \u2013 shopper, traveller, patient, driver, employee and student. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Unlike earlier campaigns, this campaign cannot, due to COVID-19 restrictions, plan for aligning with large gatherings or trade shows such as the Ploughing Championships.  We will increase our use of virtual communications platforms such as webinars and online instructional videos. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Subject to public health guidelines we will also look at the possibility of hybrid events consisting, for example, of a panel and small socially distant audience that is also webcast. We will also take opportunities at ministerial and official level to engage with appropriate partners such as business, farming, and fisheries organisations to amplify our message across their platforms.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Official websites and social media accounts will remain important. www.gov.ie\/Brexit\n remains a trusted signposting website for businesses and citizens.

(The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland means that no new checks or controls will apply on trade in goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland from the end of the transition period, and ensures that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. )\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Given the volume of trade between Ireland and Great Britain, implementing these new procedures requires substantial investment in infrastructure, staff and resources, procedures and IT systems.   \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Since 2018, detailed work has been underway across Government to invest in the infrastructure and systems required for additional checks and controls for trade with the UK, in both directions, at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort, as well as at Dublin Airport.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is one of the most visible aspects of the Government\u2019s preparations for Brexit.  Our approach to this work is driven by the twin objectives of ensuring trade can flow through our ports and airports to the greatest extent possible while maintaining food safety and public health and Ireland\u2019s obligations to the Single Market. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The work on the Border Control Post (BCP) at Dublin Airport is now complete and consists of   approximately 2,000 sq. metres with separated inspection areas for animal products, SPS and food safety checks and live animals, together with associated staff accommodation, freezer storage and inspection facilities.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Dublin Port\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        At Dublin Port: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \t2 large warehouses have been acquired and refurbished to provide a total of 25 inspection bays for SPS and food safety checks, as well as a Revenue turnout shed, which is in addition to two existing inspection bays elsewhere in the Port\n\tparking for up to 128 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) has been provided, as well as documentary and identity check facilities, a public office, driver facilities and staff accommodation to cater for approximately 90 staff\n\ta live-animal Border Control Post (BCP) and pet facility were put in place. \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Work is continuing to further enhance these facilities including the development of: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tfurther HGV parking, a documentary office for imports, driver facilities, a facility management office, as well as staff accommodation and parking\n\tan export facility including HGV parking, a documentary office for exports, driver facilities, and staff accommodation and parking\n\tthe refurbishment and extension of an existing warehouse to provide additional inspection bays for SPS and food safety checks, as well as Revenue turnout sheds.

An additional office was refurbished to provide accommodation for a further 63 staff.  An additional structure is being constructed at the live animal inspection facilities to provide additional capacity. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition to substantial investment in infrastructure, the Government has also provided additional resources to the agencies to carry out the checks and controls.  Provision has been made to date to facilitate the deployment of around 1,000 staff to ensure compliance with import and export customs, sanitary and phytosanitary and food safety regulations and work is ongoing to ensure border inspection posts are staffed sufficiently to meet Brexit challenges.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Ensuring optimal goods trade traffic flows \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        At Dublin and Rosslare Ports, the interagency approach agreed between Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health, HSE Environmental Health Service and the Food Safety Authority as part of the contingency planning for a no deal Brexit in January 2020 continues to be refined on the basis of new modelling and additional infrastructure.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Revenue staff will continue to manage and resource the control centre that has oversight of available spaces and exam bays and numbers of upcoming checks and inspections.  The agencies are also working to finalise resource and system planning, including to take account of the impact COVID-19 has had on operations.  The robustness of the proposed inter-agency arrangements will be tested prior to the end of 2020.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Capacity of the Customs IT systems has been significantly increased in order to deal with the expected growth in the number of transactions post-Brexit. Revenue estimates that import and export declarations could increase to as many as 20 million per annum (an extra 18.3 million or a 12-fold increase).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         A new national import system, Automated Import System (AIS) will replace the current system for imports in November 2020. This change is necessary in order to:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tensure compliance with the Union Customs Code\n\tto provide the most efficient process possible for trade\n\tto provide additional functionality that is not possible with the existing system\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The AIS is part of a planned suite of IT changes that have been in preparation by Revenue in relation to the full framework of customs IT systems and that is happening across the EU Member States. Preparations for the introduction of the system have been ongoing throughout much of 2019 and 2020 and Revenue has engaged extensively with software providers and customs agents to ensure these critical sectors are aware of the upcoming changes.  The AEP system will continue to be used for exports until 2023.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Revenue will also launch a Customs Roll-On Roll-Off Service to assist in streamlining procedures for ferry traffic at Irish ports.

Further information is set out here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Traffic Management \u2013 Dublin  \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Brexit-related traffic congestion in Dublin Port has the potential to impact on adjacent roads, the Port Tunnel, and the motorway system.  A Traffic Management Group was established to put in place a contingency plan in advance of a possible no deal Brexit in 2019. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This Plan is being updated to reflect developments since. The Plan will set out the roles of the various agencies, the associated communications strategy and operational plan outlining the options and actions required to mitigate impacts on the road network.

When the UK becomes a third country, it is possible that a Duty Free and VAT Retail Export Scheme may also operate between Ireland and the UK (excluding Northern Ireland).

It provides a useful complement to this Action Plan.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In July, at the Summit on the EU Multi-Annual Financial Framework and the COVID-19 Recovery Instrument, EU leaders agreed to make \u20ac5 billion available to a special Brexit Adjustment Reserve to counter the adverse consequences of Brexit on the most affected Member States and sectors. As one of the Member States most impacted by Brexit, Ireland is working with the Commission to ensure Irish businesses and sectors benefit from the Reserve, to the maximum extent possible. The Commission will make a legislative proposal for the new reserve in November 2020.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            EU Readiness Notices\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The European Commission is updating its 102 sector-specific Readiness Notices\n to help stakeholders to prepare for the end of the transition period. The Commission intends these readiness notices as an important source of information for stakeholders and pubic administrations about changes that need to be made before the end of the transition period.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        They cover a wide range of areas including, for example, air transport, the movement of animals, customs, data protection, waste, fluorinated greenhouse gases, road transport, and VAT on goods and services. In particular, the revised notices provide advice on the impact of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Links to specific Commission notices are provided where relevant throughout this Action Plan.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            EU Contingency Measures\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        As part of its no deal Brexit planning work, the Commission published a number of Communications on its approach to preparing for the UK\u2019s withdrawal. These Communications detailed the state of play of EU preparations, and a number of EU legislative contingency measures were also adopted. These contingency measures were temporary in nature, and were intended to mitigate the worst impacts of a no deal Brexit. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement ensures that a number of the earlier contingency measures will no longer be necessary while the Commission has made clear that stakeholders should take advantage of the extra time provided by the transition period to ensure they have taken all the necessary steps to prepare. Substantive discussions on possible contingency measures with the European Commission and other Member States will likely not take place until later in 2020. Contingencies for the end of the transition period can be expected to be limited in scope and will not maintain the status quo.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","4d7ef6d1d3ff1a04d0bf0547edd812b6f5a2a690b838048df52f80561e3248b4":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                        \t\n                            1.

Prior to Ireland and the UK joining the EU, there was mobility of professions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We can all recall many qualified Irish doctors and nurses heading over to the UK to work in the NHS, based on qualifications.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Over time, the EU developed a series of directives, designed to support one of its key freedoms \u2013 freedom of movement. One of these Directives dealt with Professional Qualifications such as doctors, nurses, physiotherapist, architects and veterinary surgeons.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As these professions moved from one Member State to another, it ensured that their qualifications as listed in this Directive were recognised, which facilitated labour mobility and the provision of service.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        That last point \u2013 provision of service \u2013 is very important as it brings the EU single market into play, and the EU Commission has sole competence in this area. In parallel, the number and type of professions increased.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Essentially, where there is a regulation to determine entry for any profession or trade, these also fell within scope of EU Directives. For example, Ireland has regulated entry into the security industry, which limits any person working as a security guard. You must have a QQI Level 4 qualification, amongst other things.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This trend has resulted in some 190 professions in Ireland, regulated by 44 competent authorities or regulators.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Clearly, the departure of the UK from the EU meant that this Directive no longer applies. This is particularly challenging for Ireland \u2013 you only have to think about mobility of teachers and medical professionals who routinely have been working on either side of the border over the past number of years.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Furthermore, this impact also must be reconciled with the Common Travel Area, where Ireland and the UK sought to protect mobility of citizens between both jurisdictions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In common with many actions, back in 2018, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs engaged with the EU Commission to see how mutual recognition of professional qualifications between Ireland and the UK could be reconciled within the EU Single Market.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Commission\u2019s view was that the Irish and UK Governments could only conclude a bi-lateral Intergovernmental Agreement if Ireland secured a derogation from the EU Commission.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While this remains an option, the process to secure a derogation in the midst of EU-UK negotiations would take too long, and would divert diplomatic resources from other priorities such as the NI Protocol.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The next best option was to pursue any arrangement based on Irish and UK regulators engaging with each other to agree processes for the continued recognition of professional qualifications.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In late, 2019, an Interdepartmental Working Group, chaired by an official from my department, coordinated this work, and relevant departments \u2013 eight in all- were asked to ensure each of their regulators put processes in place which would ensure that Irish and UK professions could continue to have their qualifications recognised.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This work was concluded, and Irish and UK regulators adopted varying approaches \u2013 some like the engineers put a Memorandum of Understanding in place, while others such as the Teaching Council and Medical Council adjusted their \u2018third country qualification recognition\u2019 policies.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        At the same time, my department were working closely with their UK counterparts in the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) to ensure that similar activity was being pursued by their regulators.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I am pleased to report that this relationship continues and since January of this year, there have been three bi-lateral meetings to ensure any glitches are addressed and resolved.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, these administrative arrangements were not always possible for two reasons \u2013 the first required Irish legislative amendments such as recognition of the UK equivalent of the Construction Safepass certificate.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The second instance refers to situations where qualifications are part of wider EU Directives such as Airline industry or other international agreements such as the International Maritime Agreements. However, this only represents a small number of cases, and the outcome generally is that UK professions must undertake the required competency test in Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I am satisfied that Ireland and the UK has taken whatever steps it can to ensure that there is continued recognition of professional qualifications\n for its citizens.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is also important to note that this is quite a distinct process from practicing your profession. Qualifications recognition is a step along the path to practice.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For example, to enable a UK citizen to teach in Ireland, he\/she must have their UK qualification assessed and recognised, but also this must be accompanied with appropriate Garda\/ Police clearances, as well as confirmation of good standing with the home competent authority.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Recognition of qualification in its own right does not guarantee the right to practice.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The publication of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement now provides the framework for a restoration of Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications. Essentially, it would require the consensus of all Member States, including on a sectoral basis, to agree the qualifications structures with the UK.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are similar provisions in the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Using that as a benchmark, it has taken five years so far, and work continues on this process for architects \u2013 there is no reason to see why similar timelines would also apply in the EU-UK TCA.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Therefore, the work of my department has positioned the task of continued recognition of professional qualifications very favourably.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Within the past few weeks, the other departments were asked to establish from their regulators whether any issues emerging at this stage \u2013 the response confirm that all was working well. Ireland has completed a process, while other Member States are only starting!\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This does not mean my officials are complacent \u2013 they will remain engaged on this matter, including continuing contact with their counterparts in the UK.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Erasmus and NI Students\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        As colleagues are aware, the Irish Government has decided that arrangements should be made to enable students of relevant institutions in Northern Ireland to have continued access to mobilities under the Erasmus+ higher education programme post Brexit.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While a number of options were presented to the Commission, it was finally agreed that this Government decision would be achieved by the temporary registration of NI Students with Irish HEIs.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        During this period of registration, this would facilitate a NI student mobility in a HEI in another Member State that has an existing agreement with the NI HEI to which the student belongs.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Once the mobility was complete, the student would return to their parent HEI in NI, along with the required certification and other academic documentation. The NI HEI would recognise the period of study abroad as they would now under Erasmus +.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Officials of my department have been working with HEIs, North and South to put the structures in place to implement the Government\u2019s decision for September 2021. Funding will not be required for this year as the institutions have unspent money.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It would also be timely to refer to the Turing scheme which is being introduced by the UK Government.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        My officials have made it clear to the NI HEIs that there is no exclusivity in the Irish Government\u2019s decision. Its objective is to offer an opportunity to NI students which they originally sought \u2013 should they decide to opt for a mobility under the Turing scheme, then that is their choice.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I want to make sure that should they wish to head to Paris or Munich under the Erasmus scheme, this option is also open to them.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Finally, I have acknowledged that I would like to have similar arrangements for further education students in NI.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        My officials are working on this, and I hope to bring a Memo to Cabinet within the next few weeks, as well as engaging with the Commission on this.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I have also undertaken to keep Minister Dodds appraised of developments as the operational details are finalised.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Support for Access for Students in the UK\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        On the issue of supports for students in the UK, you will recall that, in May 2019, the Irish and UK Governments signed an overarching Memorandum of Understanding on the CTA which committed to the maintenance of access to each other\u2019s education systems on an \u2018as is\u2019 basis.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        My department have been working with their counterparts in the UK to elaborate on this commitment by developing an MoU for the education sector.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The draft has been agreed between both jurisdictions, and my department is awaiting legal advice from the Attorney General\u2019s Office. All going well, I hope to bring a Memo to Cabinet within the next few weeks.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As part of my department's Brexit preparations, an amendment to the SUSI scheme was incorporated into the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020, which would ensure that Irish students could still their SUSI grant to UK, should they choose to pursue their higher education studies there.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Equally, UK students would still maintain access to the SUSI scheme, should they wish to study in Ireland. This means that the 1,260 Irish students and 200 UK students eligible for SUSI supports can continue their studies without any financial interruption.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, the CTA also afforded Irish students an additional protection. In 2020, the UK announced that EU students would be treated as International Students and as such, would be liable for higher fees. This does not apply to Irish students in accordance with the CTA. They will be charged on the same basis as a British student.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            NI Student Mobility to Ireland\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        On the matter of mobility, I am glad that this issue has been raised, as it means a lot to me. When I was appointed, I looked forward to travelling to Northern Ireland and engaging with representatives from the further and higher education system there. COVID-19 and travel restrictions put that to bed!\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For the 5 years from the 2013\/ 2014 academic year, the number of students coming to Ireland from all devolved administrations in the UK has fallen from 2,113 to 2,030 in 2017\/ 2018, which represents a fall of about 4%. The corresponding figure for Northern Ireland is 0.5% - there were 660 undergraduates in 2013\/ 2014 compared with 657 in 2017\/ 2018.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The small decline should not be preclude any review of these trends, and I have asked my officials to engage with the HEA and the higher education representative associations to explore reasons for these trends. I would certainly like to see mobility increase.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Conclusion\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In bringing my contribution to an end, Brexit was never going to be easy \u2013 no matter what steps Ireland took to minimise the impact, the relationship between Ireland and the UK was and will continue to change.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        My department has a particular responsibility to protect the further and higher education systems, but it doesn\u2019t stop there. I also have responsibility for the research and innovation systems.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The longer I have spent in this department, I see very closely the linkages with the economies on a North-South and an East-West basis. The well-being, socially, professionally and personally of all on both islands will always be linked, and I am determined to play my part to ensure that all on the island of Ireland will continue to benefit from the rich and vibrant collaborations between our education and research systems.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I look forward to your questions and observations.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thank you.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","4e88f52cf2be8139328c5fa5dd47500019d6bf5f2d9f8fe5a1d31ac47f67ba4f":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        The Minister of State Martin Heydon TD, today announced \u2018Bioeconomy Ireland Week 2020\u2019, which takes place between Monday 19 October to Friday 23 October. Bioeconomy Ireland Week will place a spotlight on Ireland\u2019s bioeconomy through a series of online events and activities suited towards a diverse range of audiences (citizens, industry professionals and policymakers) from multiple leading stakeholder groups within the Irish Bioeconomy Network. The week long series of events is coordinated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Department of Environment, Climate and Communications in collaboration with Bioeconomy leaders including BiOrbic SFI Bioeconomy Research Centre and Irish Bioeconomy Foundation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The bioeconomy uses renewable biological resources sourced sustainably from land and sea such as crops, forestry, fisheries, aquaculture, micro-organisms and animals and converts these resources and their processing by-products into value added bio-based products including proteins, feeds, fertilisers, plastics and energy. The Bioeconomy has the potential to create new sustainable opportunities for farmers and lead to the creation of high quality green jobs in rural and coastal areas.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Minister said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"We are living through historic times where not just on our own but the global economy has suffered in just a short few months. From this unprecedented and difficult position we have the opportunity to reformulate our economy and the bioeconomy provides opportunities to rebuild and restructure in a green sustainable and circular way for our primary producers, as well as the agri-food, marine, forestry, waste management, energy, construction, pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. We must Build Back Better.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister Heydon along with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan TD, also announced the launch of the National Bioeconomy Forum, which will comprise and provide a voice for a broad range of stakeholders in the bioeconomy, including industry, relevant state bodies and community groups. The goal of the Bioeconomy Forum is to promote, support and advocate for the sustainable development of the bioeconomy in Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For full list of multiple events taking place this week access to register and for more information of Bioeconomy Ireland visit the website www.irishbioeconomy.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The following is a list of some of the free online events taking place during \u2018Bioeconomy Ireland Week 2020\u2019:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Monday 19 October:\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        9.30 to 10.30am Bioeconomy Ireland Week Launch Event \u2013 Online Webinar: \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Panel speakers: Martin Heydon TD Minister of State, Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine; Dr Marc Palahi Director of European Forest Institute and Prof Kevin O\u2019Conner Director of BiOrbic SFI Bioeconomy Research Centre.

The projects are being funded under \u2018Call 2\u2019 of the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF). The URDF part-funds projects aimed at enhancing urban areas to make them more attractive places in which to live, work, visit and invest. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The projects for which URDF support have been approved are:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u2022\tLetterkenny 2040 Phase 1 (Donegal County Council) - \u20ac13.60 million\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u2022\tCity Campus - Sligo's Cultural and Learning Hub (Sligo County Council) - \u20ac28.68 million\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u2022\tImplementation of Sligo Public Realm (Sligo County Council) \u2013 \u20ac19.16 million\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department will now contact the local authorities on the next steps regarding funding. The projects announced today will augment the existing pipeline of 87 URDF-supported projects across the country for which just under \u20ac300 million has already been allocated. Today\u2019s announcement brings the total approved URDF funding for this investment region to date to \u20ac72.82 million. Details of the remaining provisional funding allocations for \u2018Call 2\u2019 URDF projects in other Project Ireland 2040 investment regions, not already announced, will be announced next week. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All selected projects support the National Planning Framework\u2019s \u2018national strategic outcome\u2019 of compact growth, a particular focus of the second call for URDF proposals. The URDF aims to facilitate a greater proportion of residential and commercial development, supported by infrastructure, services and amenities, within the existing built-up areas of larger urban settlements. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Announcing the provisional allocations this morning, Minister O\u2019Brien said: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThis funding will support projects in Donegal and Sligo that will enhance quality of life for many people. The projects are all about making these areas more attractive places in which to live, work, visit and invest. \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThese projects can help to revitalise Letterkenny and Sligo Town. Letterkenny will see new spaces created for a range of uses, included an enterprise space at the historic courthouse. The new spaces to be created for cycling and pedestrians support the Government\u2019s aims of more sustainable transport and low-carbon living in our cities and towns. Sligo\u2019s public realm project will not only enhance the quality of life for people who live, work and visit the town but should help attract investment in developing existing brownfield sites. The project for Sligo\u2019s cultural and learning hub is an example of the URDF funding a project that will develop under-utilised land to bring opportunity and new vibrancy to a place. \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cOverall, I believe this funding can be a catalyst for regeneration, development and growth. It will also provide much-needed economic stimulus and job creation in Donegal and Sligo as our economy emerges from the depths of the pandemic.\u201d  \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Minister added: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cCompact growth was the focus of this round of URDF funding. The projects the Government is funding are geared towards sustainable growth of our urban settlements, supported by jobs, houses, services and amenities, as envisaged by the National Planning Framework. As well as compact growth, the fund supports our other national planning aims. In that sense the URDF is a unique approach to Government funding. Whilst many Government-funded programmes are for specific types of projects, the URDF funds a diverse set of integrated projects with integrated aims. I look forward to working with Donegal and Sligo County Councils to progress these important projects.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister O\u2019Brien concluded: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cI understand there will be some disappointment in terms of projects which were unsuccessful. My Department will engage with local authorities and provide feedback in respect of unsuccessful proposals.\u201d \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The projects were chosen after a rigorous assessment process, overseen by a project advisory board consisting of Government departments, State agencies and national and international experts in areas such as building, architecture and planning. In total, the department received 76 project proposals. Each local authority submitted at least one application. Today\u2019s announcement honours the Programme for Government commitment to continue the URDF. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Donegal County Council project\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Letterkenny 2040 Phase 1 project - \u20ac13.60 million\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u2018Letterkenny 2040 Phase1\u2019 is a transformative urban regeneration project with a series of inter-related regeneration measures in Letterkenny Town Centre.

The Transitional LEADER Programme will therefore commence on 1st April 2021 for the purposes of making new commitments under that programme.  However, Local Action Groups can work on identifying and animating potential projects from 1st January 2021.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A breakdown of Transitional Programme funding by LAG area can be found: here.\n \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            ENDS\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Notes for editors: \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tLEADER is a rural development programme co-funded by the EU which operates a locally-led, bottom-up, approach to meeting the needs of local communities and businesses. The programme supports private enterprises and community groups in rural areas.\n\tThe current 2014-2020 LEADER programme for Ireland had an allocation of \u20ac250 million, including a contribution of approx. 63% from the EU. Aid is provided to projects under the following themes:\n\teconomic development, enterprise development and job creation\n\tsocial inclusion\n\trural environment\n\tFunding is delivered by 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs) in 28 sub-regional areas. These groups are partnerships of public and private entities from a defined geographical area. LAGs are responsible for local projects in accordance with the Local Development Strategies they develop themselves.\n\tDue to a delay in agreeing the post-2020 EU Budget, the next EU LEADER programme is not likely to commence until 2023.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to a Transitional Programme which will bridge the gap between the current programme and the next EU programme.\n\tThe Transitional Programme will commence on 1st April 2020, with LAGs approving new projects from 1st April 2020 to 31st December 2022.  All approved projects must be completed before the end of December 2023.  Claims for payment in respect of these projects must be submitted to the Department of Rural and Community Development no later than 30th June 2024.\n\tA key focus of the Transitional Programme will be on building capacity within communities which have not received LEADER funding to date.  The programme will also support job creation, and projects which address the climate agenda, digital transformation and encourage rural communities to build on their existing strengths and assets.\n\tEU co-financing may become available for the Transitional Programme on the basis of the framework applicable to the 2014-2020 LEADER programme.  The Transitional Programme will therefore be delivered through the current Local Action Group and Implementing Partner structures, and will apply the existing LEADER Operating Rules (with the exception of the amendment to the Rate of Aid). \n\tThe Transitional Programme will provide funding for new project applications, and Administration and Animation for each LAG and their Implementing Partners.\n\tThe distribution of the \u20ac20 million being made available to the Local Action Groups under the Transitional Programme is based, pro-rata, on the allocations received by each LAG at the outset of the 2014-2020 programme. The allocation for each LAG area is outlined in Appendix I.\n\tThe Department of Rural and Community Development is writing to each LAG with a breakdown of project and Administration costs.\n\tThis funding will be drawn down as projects are completed and payment claims are submitted.  LEADER projects typically span more than one year and projects under the Transitional Programme have until 31 December 2023 to complete their activities.  Payment claims under the Transitional Programme are likely to be made in 2022 and 2023, as well as in 2021.\n\tIn line with a Programme for Government commitment, the Minister is also announcing an increase in the maximum Rate of Aid that each LAG may award to private enterprises, community projects with a commercial basis, and to social enterprises from the current 50% to 75% for the duration of the Transitional Programme. Increasing the Rate of Aid will help stimulate rural economies and sustain jobs in rural areas, particularly in a post-COVID recovery scenario.\n\tAdditional Administration funding will be provided to the LAGs for the on-going management and delivery of the 2014-2020 LEADER projects.\n\tUnder the current 2014-2020 LEADER programme, all project approvals are due to be made before the end of 2020.  The extension of the current programme until 31st March 2021 will permit LAGs to approve the remaining projects which are currently being evaluated and approved.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Appendix 1 - Breakdown of Transitional Programme funding by LAG area\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \tLAG area\n\t\tShare of \u20ac20m Transitional Allocation\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \tCarlow \t\t\u20ac583,346\n\tCavan \t\t\u20ac774,753\n\tClare\t \t\u20ac810,930\n\tCork North\t \t\u20ac462,895\n\tCork South \t\t\u20ac348,300\n\tCork West \t\t\u20ac455,970\n\tDonegal \t\t\u20ac1,173,989\n\tDublin Rural \t\t\u20ac579,131\n\tGalway East\t \t\u20ac695,986\n\tGalway West\t \t\u20ac412,730\n\tKerry\t \t\u20ac929,079\n\tKildare \t\t\u20ac478,327\n\tKilkenny\t \t\u20ac708,325\n\tLaois \t\t\u20ac647,690\n\tLeitrim\t \t\u20ac545,316\n\tLimerick \t\t\u20ac843,327\n\tLongford\t \t\u20ac690,693\n\tLouth\t \t\u20ac554,715\n\tMayo\t \t\u20ac1,011,039\n\tMeath \t\t\u20ac627,557\n\tMonaghan\t \t\u20ac690,247\n\tOffaly \t\t\u20ac730,615\n\tRoscommon\t \t\u20ac804,787\n\tSligo \t\t\u20ac695,968\n\tTipperary\t \t\u20ac918,495\n\tWaterford\t \t\u20ac683,891\n\tWestmeath \t\t\u20ac671,291\n\tWexford\t \t\u20ac894,558\n\tWicklow\t \t\u20ac576,050\n\tTotals\n\t\t\u20ac20,000,000\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","57d8668795b4862e9ce698271afc9605daa337c4892f5287f56f4c21360bb1d7":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        Notice under the ARTERIAL DRAINAGE ACTS, 1945 and 1995, and Statutory Instrument No. 472 of 2019 European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019 and (Birds and Natural Habitats Regulations 2011 (S.I.

Providing all the documentation has been submitted correctly and within the correct timeframes, a large proportion of the documentary check can be commenced in advance of the consignment\u2019s arrival. This includes examination of the veterinary certificate and other documents accompanying a consignment\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        a. The original hard copy of the health certificate must travel with the consignment, and will be checked and held at the BCP at the point of entry into the EU\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        6. Provided all is in order with the documentary check, the consignment of live animals will then be subject to an identity check and physical check with\/without sampling as appropriate at the BCP.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        7. Upon satisfactory completion of the required checks, the decision is entered in Part 2 of the CHED which must accompany the consignment to the first place of destination referred to in the CHED. The consignment of live animals may then circulate freely within the EU.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        8. If the consignment does not meet the import requirements, the consignment may be rejected entry and re-exported or in exceptional circumstances, humanely destroyed if necessary.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","6395d0be2465e28be83d627ad74bd281067b91dd672826f0b728082d89639feb":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                        \t\n                            1.

You can spread the virus even if you do not have symptoms.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Close contact\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        COVID-19 is mainly spread through close contact and droplets that come from your nose and mouth. For example, from someone who is talking loud, singing, shouting, coughing or sneezing. This happens when people are within 1 to 2 metres of each other. It is why keeping a 2 metre distance from other people is so effective in reducing the spread.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Infected surfaces\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        You can also get the virus from infected surfaces. For example, when someone who has the virus sneezes or coughs, droplets with the virus can fall onto surfaces around them. If you touch that surface and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth, you could become infected too. That's why it's important to wash your hands properly and often.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            How long the virus can survive on surfaces\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Common household disinfectants will kill the virus on surfaces.

This can happen over a longer distance than droplets, such as across a room. To protect yourself, keep indoor spaces well ventilated (aired out) by opening windows and doors if possible.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            How to protect yourself\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Wearing a face covering can protect you.\n But you should still do the important things needed to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These include:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tsocial distancing\n\n\tcovering coughs and sneezes\n\twashing your hands properly\n\n\tnot touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean\n\tfollowing the current public health restrictions\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The virus can spread easily in crowded environments.

Isolation and the lack of a close network can also be the reason for delayed discharge from hospital and other healthcare settings. An increasing number of GPs are now referring patients to Social Prescribing programmes that help them with complex health conditions, as well as social isolation, anxiety, loneliness and other issues.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Sl\u00e1intecare is supporting seven Social Prescribing programmes all over Ireland through the Integration Fund, they are based in Dublin, Waterford, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo, Leitrim, Wicklow, Cork and Kerry.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Adrienne Dempsey is a Social Prescriber from the Fatima Groups United Family Resource Centre\u2019s Dublin 8 Social Prescribing Project who sits in the Rialto Medical Centre. Support from the Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund means that Adrienne is on site in the medical centre to meet patients, explain the variety of activities and supports available to them, and what the opportunities and benefits are. Before this, GPs at the centre could refer patients to the programme, but in general a lot of people did not follow up on the referral. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Around 55% of the people Adrienne meets are now taking part in activities run by the Social Prescribing project. Participants range in age from 23 to 87 years of age, and are about two thirds female and one third male. The main issues Adrienne is helping people to deal with are: a lack of social interaction; anxiety, depression and stress; and healthy eating and exercise. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There is a big focus on health and wellbeing activities, with yoga, meditation, pilates and other exercise classes on offer, as well as cooking, digital literacy, and arts and crafts.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dr. Susan Smith is a GP working in Inchicore and is involved in the Link Workers Social Prescribing project, which is focused especially on patients in deprived areas. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dr Smith said: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cPatients who live in deprived areas have worse health outcomes, and they develop chronic diseases earlier than the rest of the population.

One covers the Waterford City area and one covers Waterford County.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Waterford Social Prescribing programme is also linking people in with other Sl\u00e1intecare funded projects in the area. Patients have been referred to the Living Well programme, which is a six-week course that supports people to manage chronic health conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, heart conditions. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Social Prescribing addresses many of the goals of Sl\u00e1intecare. Social Prescribing shifts care to the community and increases supports to people with chronic diseases, those who are feeling vulnerable, isolated and lonely as well as those who are frequent attenders at GPs. It creates opportunities for people to get involved in caring for their own health and wellbeing, it deepens links between community and medical care, and it reduces the need for people to seek medical appointments with either their GP or to attend hospital for care for their chronic conditions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To find out more visit:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        www.fgu.ie\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        www.sacredheartfrc.ie\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        http:\/\/deepend.ie\/\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        @CK_HWBCR\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        https:\/\/www.brayareapartnership.ie\/\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Budget 2019 provided \u20ac20 million for the establishment of a ring-fenced Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund to test and scale how services can best be delivered. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The aim of the funding is to support the delivery of services which focus on prevention, community care and integration of care across all health and social care settings.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The 122 successful Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund projects show how joined-up thinking and working in partnership can help us reach Sl\u00e1intecare\u2019s goals of shifting the majority of care to the community, reducing waiting lists and improving experiences for patients and staff across the health and social care system in Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Joined-up Thinking Around Care for the Older Person\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The population of Ireland is ageing. While people living longer is a very positive sign of improving health among the population, older people are the largest users of the healthcare system. People aged 65 and over make up 12.7% of the population and 53% of hospital stays, while people aged 85 and over represent 1.4% of the population and make up 13.5% of hospital stays. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Sl\u00e1intecare wants to provide as much care as possible as close to home as possible, meaning that people should only have to go to hospital when absolutely necessary. The HSE Integrated Care Programme for Older People has the same goals, especially for older people, and wants to move away from hospital stays because of illness, towards continuous and long-term care as close to home as possible.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Integration Fund is supporting projects that help older people to access more care in their community, either through their GP, their Local Health Centre, Primary Care Centre, or from other health and social care, and community and voluntary services. These projects focus on caring for the person and joining up services between hospitals and in the community, so that people can stay healthy in their communities for as long as possible. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        One of these projects is focusing on providing care for older people in their communities in the Cork City area, preventing illnesses that result in people having to attend hospital, and encouraging people leaving hospital to be cared for in the community. \u201cUrgent Ambulatory Care and Virtual Ward for the Older Person in Cork City\u201d, is run by Cork Kerry Community Healthcare. This project is working to provide an alternative for older people having to go to the Emergency Department or be admitted to hospital. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ALONE B Connect, which also receives support from the Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund links healthcare, social care and community care together. The project uses technology to help older people better manage their own health and wellbeing, to come home from hospital quicker and to remain living independently at home. ALONE B Connect also provides training in the technology to older people and their families, and works with community and voluntary organisations to help them improve their service through using technology. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Siobh\u00e1n Kennelly, National Clinical Advisor and Group Lead for the HSE\u2019s Integrated Care Programme for Older People says: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThese projects really promote joined-up thinking around care for the older person, and put the older person at the centre of their work. This will have positive effects on the health and wellbeing of the older person and their families, as well as the hospital system\u201d.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Together these projects will benefit the older person who will receive more care at home or in their community, and avoid unnecessary hospital admission, or allow them to have shorter hospital stays. Thanks to reduced Emergency Department attendance, hospital admissions and shorter hospital stays the health system will also benefit.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Supporting Pregnant Women to Quit Smoking\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        For women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, stopping smoking is the single most important thing they can do to protect their health and the health of their baby. Smoking, and smoking among pregnant women, is a major cause of health inequalities in Ireland. Health Inequality means that there is a five-year difference in life expectancy between the richest and poorest people. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Smoking while pregnant leads to the risk of low birth weight babies, complications in birth, and other complications in pregnancy. Women who quit smoking during pregnancy and beyond have an increased life expectancy and improved physical health, as well as the benefit of bringing their baby to a smoke-free home.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u201cSupporting Pregnant Women to Quit and Stay Quit\u201d, run by Southeast Community Healthcare (SECH) is supported by the Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund and will help everyone involved in the journey of the pregnant woman to stop smoking.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Healthy Ireland, Tobacco Free Ireland, and the National Maternity Strategy share the goals of this project. The Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund is supporting projects that help people to learn more about their own health and to take simple and practical steps to take care of their health and wellbeing.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Quitting smoking in pregnancy is difficult but can be achieved when the right services are available. This project will deliver the support the woman needs, without judgement. The pregnant woman is at the centre of this project. Every health and social care provider the woman comes into contact with during her pregnancy, from GPs to Midwives and Maternity Hospitals, to Family Resource Centres, and pharmacists are supported to help the woman to quit and stay quit. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Members of the team will be trained to refer into dedicated smoking cessation clinics. These clinics will be established in each county in SECH in accessible primary care centres for the Pregnant woman and her extended family. One-to-one intensive smoking programmes are delivered by a Sl\u00e1intecare funded Smoking cessation officer as part of a six -week program.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u201cSupporting Pregnant Women to Quit and Stay Quit\u201d will have a positive impact on the pregnant woman herself, her child and family, as well as the maternity services and the wider healthcare system.

The programme works to support the physical, mental and social wellbeing of men\u2019s sheds members. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Sheds for Life will help men participating in the programme to better manage and improve areas of their life that will have a positive impact on their health and wellbeing. Members will take part in exercise and walking programmes, cooking and nutrition activities, digital literacy training and dental health workshops. Members will also have access to Heart Disease and Cancer screening, and Diabetes prevention and management workshops, these will all take place in a community based, non-medical environment, which makes it easier for members to access.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Based on the success of previous Sheds for Life programmes, The Irish Men\u2019s Sheds Association will expand the programme to Counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Meath in 2020 thanks to Sl\u00e1intecare funding.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Muriel Farrell of the Sl\u00e1intecare Office said: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cIt is fantastic to see a recipient of the Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund provide such a targeted and beneficial programme that is in line with Sl\u00e1intecare\u2019s objective of promoting the engagement and empowerment of citizens in the care of their own health.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Funding will support the delivery of over 400 follow up health checks with participating sheds across the 2019 Sheds for Life programme while also assisting with the expansion of the 2020 programme to sheds across counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Meath.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Over 200 men will benefit directly from Sheds for Life in 2020 through programmes and workshops, while 600 men will be reached through health screening (400 follow-up screenings from 2019, and 200 participants from new Sheds in 2020).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The positive effects on members will be measured through walking minutes, physical activity, changes in wellbeing, mental health, dietary knowledge and behaviours and knowledge in specific areas covered by the programme.

The project is also addressing the general upward trend in STIs, where the biggest risk groups are those aged under 25 and men who have sex with men. The service opened for appointments in late January and was inundated immediately, with over 120 enquiries for appointments in the initial days.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The project is led by Institute Nurse and Health Centre Coordinator Laura Tully, who has advocated for a service for students for many years. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cPreviously, students faced travel times of up to an hour to find a specialised sexual health service, 90% of those referred simply did not attend those clinics and many presented inappropriately to emergency rooms or out of hours GP services. This project epitomises the Sl\u00e1intecare vision, students now have access to an equitable, accessible service based on need right within their own campus community, and they can access the right care, in the right place, at the right time.\u201d \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Debbie Marshall, Registered Advanced Nurse Practitioner in Sexual Health has been appointed by the Institute to deliver the nurse led service to students for the duration of the project and will be supported by a specialist doctor weekly. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cStudents feel this is a much needed service, and has integrated into the student health service seamlessly.

This will ultimately encourage the development of a healthy sexuality throughout life; enhance people\u2019s lives and relationships; reduce negative outcomes such as STIs and crisis pregnancies and create an environment that supports sexual health and wellbeing. The service is being delivered in line with the aims of the HSE National Sexual Health Strategy (2015-2020) and the Healthy Ireland Framework (2013-2025).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Kick-Off meeting for Integration Fund Learning Network\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Image: Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund Athlone December 2\n\n\n\n    \n        The Sl\u00e1intecare Integration Fund Learning Network launched on Tuesday last (10th December) at an event in Athlone.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The aim of the event was to get the successful projects together to kick off networking, sharing information and learnings among the projects, as they begin project implementation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        More than 200 people gathered to learn about the work of other projects, how they are delivering the right care in the right place at the right time, and share ideas and experiences.

The Community and Voluntary sector are bringing Sl\u00e1intecare alive every day, and they are a crucial link between patients and service users. Hearing from those who are providing services and delivering care as part of the broader health and social care system is vital to the implementation of Sl\u00e1intecare\u201d. \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Sara Burke delivered her reflections on Sl\u00e1intecare from a policy and research perspective.

Regional health bodies will have their own budget based on local population needs.

For example, the possibility of lower supplementary welfare payments if a living wage lowered in-work poverty, higher revenues if a living wage increased productivity, consumer demand, purchasing power\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            4.

Other emergencies require a longer term sustained response from the emergency services and various State agencies.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Major Emergencies\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The following could constitute a major emergency:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Severe weather\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Although rare in Ireland, severe weather emergencies such as storms and hurricanes have caused damage to properties in the past. In case of such emergencies, Met Eireann will immediately respond to international weather warnings and issue public service weather alerts to local authorities. Your local authority will have arrangements in place to receive and respond promptly to these alerts.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Each local authority is required by the Framework for Major Emergency Management to have a sub-plan for responding to severe weather emergencies. A national framework for response to severe weather emergencies is being developed to ensure that all existing local severe weather plans are appropriately coordinated and linked.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Flooding\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Flooding is usually caused by a combination of events, including overflowing riverbanks, coastal storms or blocked or overloaded drainage ditches. There have been a number of severe floods throughout the country in the last decade. The impact of a flood can be devastating for a community, so it is important that people whose properties may be at risk take appropriate action to protect their homes from such an emergency.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Changes in rainfall patterns and a rise in sea levels as a result of climate change may lead to more frequent and severe flooding incidents in the future.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Effective measures can be taken to prepare for such incidents and minimise the resulting damage and difficulties in their aftermath. Such preparations are particularly necessary if you live in a flooding risk area.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Office of Public Works has produced an information booklet on the preparations you can take, what should be in a Family Flood Plan, insurance issues, advice for the elderly and those with mobility difficulties, and the signs to look out for that would indicate a flood is imminent.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Chemical spills\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Exposure to hazardous chemicals that have been spilled or released can cause serious or even fatal injury. In the event of such an incident the emergency services will identify the nature and level of danger and tell the public what to do.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        You may be asked either to remain in the protection of your home or workplace and seal windows and doors, or to evacuate the area. If the chemicals have a higher density than air, emergency services may ask you to move to higher ground. For your safety, in all circumstances, follow the advice of the emergency services.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If a spill or other chemical release occurs it is important to:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tCall 999 or 112 and inform the emergency services.\n\tStay away from the scene.\n\tAttempt to get upwind of the contaminated area.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If you are asked to stay indoors following a chemical spill:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tStay inside and close and lock all windows and external doors.\n\tEnsure that keys are readily available, or that you have an accessible escape route if you need to evacuate.\n\tIf advised by emergency services, turn off all fans, heating and air conditioning systems.\n\tClose any fireplace vents.\n\tClose internal doors to reduce air movement.\n\tGather your emergency kit and make sure the radio is working.\n\tGo to an internal room, ideally one at ground level with no windows.\n\tIf advised to do so, use duct tape or other wide tape to seal all cracks around the doors and any vents into the room and seal windows with plastic.\n\tContinue to monitor radio or television bulletins until you are told all is safe or you are advised to evacuate - emergency services may later call for the evacuation of specific areas in your community and issue specific instructions.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If you believe a toxic chemical has been released in a closed space such as a tunnel, underground railway or building:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tLeave the contaminated area by the quickest route - this is generally in a direction at right angles to the wind direction. Then consider moving to a location upwind of the contaminated area.\n\tCall 999 or 112 and alert the emergency services.\n\tIf you have any of the chemical on your body or clothes, avoid touching your mouth and eyes, remove your outer clothing and do not leave the area. For your own safety and that of others you will then need to be decontaminated by emergency services before you receive any medical treatment that may be necessary.\n\tTo help emergency services identify the chemical, keep track of your symptoms including your breathing, heart rate, perspiration, dizziness, blurred vision, skin tones and report them as soon as possible.\n\tUse caution in helping others who may be contaminated as you may become affected.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Transport accidents (air, sea, rail, road)\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Transport accidents are the most regular of all emergency situations, with their sudden and unexpected nature requiring a rapid and co-ordinated response from the emergency services.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ireland has experienced such events including the Air India crash off the Irish coast in 1985, rail crashes such as those at Buttevant in 1982 and Cherryville in 1983 and major road accidents such as the bus crash at Kentstown in 2005.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the last few years Ireland, in common with most EU countries, has engaged in the review and development of its major emergency or civil protection arrangements. This has resulted in the production of a new document, the Framework for Major Emergency Management.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The purpose of this document is to put arrangements in place to enable the three principal response agencies - the local authorities, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Health Service Executive, to co-ordinate their efforts whenever a major emergency occurs. The document governs the response to major transport accidents as well as other emergencies.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Accidents at sea\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the event of vessels or individuals getting into difficulties in Irish waters, the Irish Coast Guard is the service responsible for the initiation and co-ordination of search and rescue operations. The Coast Guard also co-ordinates the response to persons at risk of death or injury on the cliffs or shoreline of the Republic of Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Search and rescue operations are co-ordinated from one of the three Coast Guard rescue centres at Dublin, Valentia and Malin Head.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Depending on the gravity of the situation the Coast Guard will deploy Coast Guard helicopters, RNLI lifeboats, Coast Guard Units and Community Rescue boats. If required, additional resources will be requested from the naval service, Air Corps, vessels at sea, Garda Water Unit, air traffic services, fire brigade and Civil Defence.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        What to do (in the event of the emergency)\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If you notice that somebody is in difficulty in the water (e.g. sea, river, lake, or cliffs), dial 999 or 112 and ask for the Coast Guard. The service is free. Please do not leave it for another person to call.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Major pollution incidents at sea\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        A pollution incident at sea is defined as any occasion when a vessel requests assistance (other than search and rescue) due to damage or machinery failure with actual or threatened spill of oil or other hazardous noxious substances.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is usually a result of a marine casualty e.g. grounding, collision, fire or sinking. The response action may include salvage assistance to the vessel and will cover threatened or actual spill of oil or other substance at sea, and\/or shoreline clean up.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Response Action\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Irish Coast Guard is the authority responsible for managing marine emergency incidents by monitoring, intervention and exercising ultimate command and control of the incident. This includes casualty response to vessels in need of assistance and pollution response arising from the threat of or actual spillage or loss of oil or hazardous and noxious substances, which threaten the Irish coastline or related interests.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        What to do (in the event of the emergency)\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Contact the Irish Coast Guard by dialing 999 or 112. The Coast Guard will assess the incident and respond accordingly depending on the nature of the incident.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Bomb explosions \/ suspicious packages\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Bomb explosion\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tGet out of the vicinity\/building as quickly and calmly as possible.\n\tIn the event of falling debris, shelter under a sturdy table or desk until the situation has stabilised enough for your safe passage. When safe, leave quickly, watching out for weakened floors and stairs.\n\tEnsure that you are safe before trying to help others.\n\tIf trapped in debris, do not light a match. Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Rhythmically tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can hear where you are.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Receiving a suspicious package\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Be on the alert if you receive a package from someone you don't know. Pay particular attention to any package that appears to be badly wrapped or have an unusual shape. DO NOT open the package unless you are confident that you know what it contains and who has sent it. If you are in any way suspicious:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tLeave the package where it is.\n\tGet everyone out of the room and close the door. Isolate the room and prevent others from entering.\n\tCall 999 or 112 and ask for the Garda\u00ed.\n\tMake a list of persons who were in the room to give to authorities when they arrive.\n\tIf applicable, alert the building security staff.\n\tWait in a safe place until emergency services arrive and follow their instructions.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If you have opened a suspicious package - leave it where it is and if possible cover it.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tGet everyone out of the room and close the door. Isolate the room and prevent others from entering. If possible, turn off air conditioning.\n\tIf you have access to a bathroom, wash your hands or shower with soap and water. Do not touch your mouth or eyes with your hands.\n\tIf you are experiencing any immediate physical symptoms call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\n\tCall 999 or 112 and ask for the Garda\u00ed.\n\tMake a list of persons who were in the room to give to authorities when they arrive.\n\tIf applicable, alert the building security staff.\n\tWait in a safe place until emergency services arrive and follow their instructions.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Nuclear incident\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Nuclear incidents abroad that could affect Ireland include an accident at a nuclear plant, a terrorist attack on a nuclear plant or a nuclear explosion in another country.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Consequences for Ireland\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The impact on Ireland would depend on the nature of the incident and the prevailing wind direction and weather conditions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If radioactivity from an incident in the UK or elsewhere overseas reached Ireland, the distance from overseas nuclear plants means the increase in radioactivity levels (over normal background levels) would be relatively small but would occur over a wide area.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While no immediate health effects are likely to occur as a result of radiation doses received, a large number of people could be exposed to a long-term but small increase in radiation exposure. This could lead to an increased lifetime risk of cancer.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Consumption of contaminated foodstuffs is the most significant potential route of radiation dose. However this exposure could be almost totally prevented by introducing appropriate controls on the distribution and consumption of foodstuffs.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There could be significant disruption of the economy.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        What to do in the event of a nuclear incident\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Go in, Stay in, Tune in. In other words, stay indoors and listen to both radio and television for information and instructions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Once information is available on the accident and its consequences, specific advice will be given. This will include advice on whether it is necessary to stay indoors, to avoid consumption of locally-grown foods or to take any other steps.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Evacuation is not advisable for this type of emergency. It would expose people to a larger dose of radioactivity during the passage of a radioactive plume as vehicles offer little protection.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In contrast staying indoors is an effective protective measure to reduce radiation exposure during the passage of the radioactive plume. Staying indoors should not be required for more than a few hours.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        With the availability of up-to-the-minute information from our international partners through bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Commission, the relevant authorities will be in a position to keep the public well informed at all times on the latest situation and advice.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Public Guidance\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment\n and the EPA Office of Radiological Protection\n have published information on the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents on their websites.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Influenza pandemic\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Flu Pandemic\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Influenza (or flu) is an acute respiratory illness caused by infection with an influenza virus. It can be a serious illness and should not be confused with a cold.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        When a flu epidemic spreads across a region or worldwide it is called a pandemic. Pandemic influenza is therefore a worldwide flu epidemic caused by a new influenza strain which spreads easily between humans and which causes serious illness.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        History of Pandemics\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Influenza pandemics are naturally occurring events, with three having occurred in the 20th Century - in 1918, 1957 and 1968. Of these the 1918 pandemic was by far the most serious resulting in about 40 million deaths worldwide. There will be more pandemics, but when they might occur, how severe they might be, and which age groups they might impact upon cannot be predicted.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Preparing for a Pandemic\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive published the National Pandemic Influenza Plan as well as the advice of the expert group on pandemic influenza in January 2007.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The public has a key role to play in managing a pandemic and should one become imminent they will be asked to prepare their own personal plans to manage the situation. These will include arrangements for taking care of sick family members, stockpiling essential supplies and minimising the spread of the virus. It is envisaged that a pandemic could lead to very substantial numbers of the workforce becoming ill within a concentrated time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Public Guidance\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Within the Further Reading section, you will find more detailed plans for pandemics. You may also wish to consult the websites of the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Animal disease outbreak\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Department of Agriculture Fisheries, Food and the Marine has contingency plans in place to deal with outbreaks of serious animal diseases, including Foot and Mouth Disease, Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), Newcastle Disease, Classical Swine Fever, and Bluetongue.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Foot and Mouth disease is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cattle and pigs. It can also affect other animals with cloven hooves such as goats, deer and sheep.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The rapid spread of the virus and its subsequent ability to damage the livestock industry is the reason immediate action is taken if the disease is discovered anywhere. During a major outbreak in Britain and Northern Ireland in 2001, the virus spread into County Louth. However, strict Irish Government policies on the movement of livestock and the cancellation of some large events ensured that the outbreak was contained and did not spread any further into the Republic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Avian Influenza or Bird Flu is a disease affecting birds and some mammals. All evidence to date indicates that the virus does not spread easily from birds to humans. Most human cases have been related to direct contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects contaminated by their faeces. Typically they have occurred in rural areas or areas where many households keep small poultry flocks. In such instances it has been found that the poultry flocks often roam freely, sometimes entering homes or sharing outdoor areas where children play.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is important to remember that cooking destroys the virus in eggs and poultry, so both are perfectly safe to eat once cooked.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Newcastle Disease is a highly contagious viral disease of birds to which chickens are highly susceptible. The severity of the disease depends on which particular strain of the virus (of which there are many) has caused the disease. It is endemic in some parts of the world where disease outbreaks are not prevented or controlled by vaccination. The virus could be introduced into Ireland by migratory birds, racing pigeons or trade in pet birds or poultry and their products. Although Newcastle disease outbreaks have occurred in Ireland in the past, controls on trade, vaccination, and good bio-security practices are in place to keep infection out of our commercial flocks.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Classical Swine Fever is a viral disease of pigs that can range in severity from acute to chronic and can result in death, reproductive failure, wasting, recurrent illness or congenital infection. It has serious implications for farmers in that the virus can be spread through direct animal contact, contaminated materials, or from infected sows to their piglets. The only way to eliminate the disease is to destroy all infected animals and their products. The virus can also survive in poorly cooked meat or in some cured products. Department of Agriculture Fisheries, Food and the Marine has a contingency plan in place for protecting the national pig herd.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Bluetongue is a viral disease of ruminants including sheep, cattle, deer and goats. It is transmitted mostly by the bites of Culicoides midges that are prevalent throughout most of Europe in various habitats including farms. It is not spread through direct contact between animals and it is not shed into the environment to contaminate housing, equipment, footwear or clothing. Neither is it carried in milk or meat and it does not infect people. It can have an enormous impact on trade in live animals as very large areas are restricted as part of the control measures. The disease appeared in northern Europe for the first time in autumn 2006 and has never occurred in Ireland. However, with global warming, it is now possible that this could happen. The Department of Agriculture and Food has developed a contingency plan to deal with a disease outbreak should it occur.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the event of avian flu, foot and mouth or other serious animal disease occurring, the public will be told the nature and scale of the problem and will be kept fully informed as the situation develops.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        You will find more detailed information and advice, including contingency measures, travel advice, handling of dead birds, guidelines for keepers of poultry and birds, etc. on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine website.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are responsible for the public health aspects of the virus. Information on the risk to human health can be found on their websites at: www.health.gov.ie\n and www.hse.ie\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A major emergency is any event which, usually with little or no warning, causes or threatens injury or death, serious disruption of essential services or damage to property, the environment or infrastructure beyond the normal capabilities of the principal emergency services. It requires the mobilisation of additional resources to ensure an effective and co-ordinated response.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Major Emergency Plans\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Each Principal Response Agency (Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, Health Service Executive and local authorities) has an individual major emergency plan, which sets out its arrangements to respond to major emergencies. These agencies' plans are in turn consistent with the arrangements set out in the Framework for Major Emergency Management. There are also specific plans in place to respond to other types of emergencies, such as a nuclear incident or an influenza pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Further Information\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Framework for Major Emergency Management was finalised in 2008 following a review of the 1984 Framework for Co-Ordinated Response to Major Emergencies. The principal response agencies are now working to incorporate this new framework into their own existing emergency plans.

Follow the HSE guidelines on handwashing.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Hand hygiene can be achieved by hand washing or use of a hand sanitiser (when hands look clean).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Use of hand hygiene facilities including wash hand basins needs to be managed so as to avoid congregation of people waiting to use wash hand basins and hand sanitisers.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Hand sanitiser dispensers can be deployed more readily at exit and entry points of schools and classrooms and care should be taken to clean up any hand sanitiser spills to prevent risks of falls.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Warm water is preferable to hot or cold water for hand washing but if the plumbing system only supplies cold water, a soap that emulsifies easily in cold water should be used.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Wash hand basins, running water, liquid soap and hand drying facilities should be provided in all toilets, kitchens and any food preparation areas.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Hand washing facilities should be maintained in good condition and supplies of soap and towels should be topped up regularly to encourage everyone to use them.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Hot air dryers are an acceptable alternative for hand drying but must be regularly maintained. There is no evidence that hand dryers are associated with increased risk of transmission of COVID-19.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Posters displaying hand washing techniques and promoting hand washing should be placed on walls adjacent to washing facilities and can be laminated or placed in a plastic sleeve.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Hand sanitiser is suitable for use for hand hygiene when hands are not visibly soiled (look clean).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Evidence of effectiveness is best for alcohol based hand rubs but non-alcohol based hand rubs can be used too.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        When hand rubs\/gels are being used in school care should be taken to ensure that students do not ingest them as they are flammable and toxic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Frequency of Hand Hygiene\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students and staff should perform hand hygiene:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \ton arrival at school\n\tbefore eating or drinking\n\tafter using the toilet\n\tafter petting animals\n\tafter playing outdoors\n\twhen their hands are physically dirty\n\twhen they cough or sneeze\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The department has arranged for a drawdown framework to be established to enable schools purchase hand-sanitisers and any other necessary PPE supplies for use in the school. The procurement process for this framework is at an advanced stage and it is intended that these materials will be available for drawdown in early August. Further guidelines will be issued shortly.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The department will provide funding for the costs associated with the hand sanitising and PPE requirements in schools. This funding will be available in advance of school reopening at the end of August.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Physical Distancing\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Physical distancing can be usefully applied in a post primary school setting allowing for some flexibility when needed. It must be applied in a practical way to recognise that the learning environment cannot be dominated by a potentially counterproductive focus on this issue. Care should be taken to avoid generating tension or potential conflict and some flexibility in the implementation of measures may be required at time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is also recognised that it is not always possible for staff to maintain physical distance from students and it is not appropriate that they would always be expected to do so where this could have a detrimental impact on the student.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However where possible staff should maintain a minimum of 1 metre distance and where possible 2 metres. They should also take measures to avoid close contact at face to face level such as remaining standing rather than sitting beside\/crouching down.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Physical distancing falls into two categories:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tincreasing separation\n\tdecreasing interaction\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Increasing separation\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Given that each school setting is different in terms of (i) location; (ii) physical layout (iii) available space within the school; and (iv) student numbers; schools themselves are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfigurations \/ operational changes necessary to maintain physical distancing.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In recognition that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcone size fits all\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach would not be appropriate as schools themselves are best placed to decide on the appropriate configuration for their school, the department has developed a Framework to maintain Physical Distancing in the Classroom in Post Primary Schools with a full return of all Students for the 2020\/21 School Year.\n The Framework sets out a suite of available measures that must be implemented at individual school level to the greatest possible extent.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The suite of measures set out in the Framework are:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \treconfigure class spaces to maximise physical distancing\n\tutilising and reconfiguring all available space in the school in order to maximise physical distancing\n\treview timetables\n\treconfiguring classes\n\tconsider use of live streaming within the school\n\taccessing available spaces within the local community\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n

interaction\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The extent to which decreasing interaction is possible in a post primary school will depend on the school setting and a common-sense approach is required recognising the limits to which this can be achieved between students.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In post primary schools physical distancing of 2 metres where possible or at least 1 metre should be maintained between desks or between individual students or staff.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As far as possible and practical, students would remain in the classroom and teachers would move between rooms.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As far as possible and practical students would be assigned to a main class cohort which would remain in the classroom for most subjects, with teachers moving between rooms.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where possible and practical double classes should be planned to minimise movement during the day.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where students have an elective subject they would move quickly into the new class and would be seated with members of their class cohort, observing as much physical distance as possible.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Hand washing or sanitising would be required when moving between classes by teachers and students.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Physical distancing between the teacher and class would be observed.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where movement of class groups between rooms is required it should be planned to minimise interaction with other class groups.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Limit interaction on arrival and departure and in hallways and other shared areas.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Social physical contact (hand to hand greetings, hugs) should be discouraged.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where students need to move about within the classroom to perform activities (access to a shared resource) it should be organised to the greatest degree possible to minimise congregation at the shared resource.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Staff and students should avoid sharing of personal items.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where teaching and learning involves use of keyboards or tablets, the contact surface of the device should be cleaned regularly and hand hygiene encouraged.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n

The Department has accepted this recommendation.  Accordingly, it is now a requirement for face coverings to be worn by staff members where it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres from other staff, parents, essential visitors or pupils.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        PPE will also need to be used at certain work activities or work areas.

Minor works funding grant can be used for this purpose. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Masks\/Face Coverings\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Cloth face coverings act as a barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from travelling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the face covering coughs, sneezes, talks or raises their voice. Cloth face coverings are therefore intended to prevent transmission of the virus from the wearer (who may not know that they are infected) to those with whom they come into close contact. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is therefore a requirement that teachers, staff and students attending post primary schools wear a face covering when a physical distance of 2m from other staff or students cannot be maintained. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In certain situations the use of clear visors should be considered, for example staff interacting with students with hearing difficulties or learning difficulties. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All students on the post primary transport scheme should be asked to wear face coverings unless there is a good reason not to do so. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Cloth face coverings should not be worn by any of the following groups: \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tany person with difficulty breathing \n\tany person who is unconscious or incapacitated \n\tany person who is unable to remove the face-covering without assistance \n\tany person who has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable wearing the face covering, for example persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity. \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All staff and students wearing face coverings should be reminded to not touch the face covering and to wash or sanitise their hands (using hand sanitiser) before putting on and after taking off the face covering. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Information should be provided on the proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings Advice on how to properly use face coverings can be found here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All teachers and staff should be aware that they should wash or sanitize hands (using a hand sanitizer) before and after helping a student put on or adjust a face covering. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Face coverings should be stored in a space designated for each student that is separate from others when not being worn (e.g., in individually labelled containers or bags). \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Cloth face coverings should be washed after every day of use and\/or before being used again, or if visibly soiled. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Face coverings should not be worn if they are wet. A wet cloth face covering may make it difficult to breathe. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Schools should consider having additional disposable face coverings available for students, teachers, and staff in case a back-up face covering is needed during the day. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Whilst staff may wish to utilize their own face covering on a day-to-day basis, schools should have available a stock of additional disposable or multi-use face coverings, or if appropriate face visors, available for staff in case a back-up face covering is needed throughout the day or where required on an ongoing basis.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On the use of face masks by staff, schools should consider the specific circumstances where the use of medical face masks, to EU Standard EN 14683, may be more appropriate for staff (for example where staff by necessity need to be in close and continued proximity with students with intimate care needs such as SNAs or School Bus Escorts).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Wearing a face covering or mask does not\n negate the need to stay at home if symptomatic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Gloves\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The use of disposable gloves in the school by students or staff is not generally appropriate but may be necessary for matters such as cleaning, intimate care settings or when administering first aid.

The purpose of this legislation is to transpose the criminal justice elements of the Fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive, Directive 2018\/843.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Targeting money laundering is central to fighting organised crime. Those who commit crimes such as drug trafficking, human trafficking and fraud depend on hiding and converting the proceeds of those crimes. By pursuing those proceeds we can bring those responsible to justice and meaningfully reduce the incentive to commit the crimes in the first place.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Part of that effort is through the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau. However, preventative measures are also essential. In the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, and before that in the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the Oireachtas both criminalised money laundering activities, and required those whose business activities can be used to facilitate money laundering to help prevent it.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On a practical level, this means knowing your customers and doing appropriate due diligence before starting a business relationship. It means having proper processes in place to deal with suspicious transactions. And it means reporting suspicious transactions to the appropriate authorities.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Money laundering and terrorist financing are global issues. Criminals routinely move the proceeds of crime from one country to another and exploit inconsistencies and weak links. Accordingly, a coherent global approach is needed and the EU has long had legislation in the area. Internationally, the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF as it is known, are applied by 37 member jurisdictions and inform the global approach. FATF monitors and evaluates compliance by those 37 members.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The EU legislation and the FATF recommendations are frequently being updated to reflect new developments and to ensure they are still relevant. This process of continuous improvement is a feature of the regime. The Bill before the house, which amends the 2010 Act in line with the Fifth Directive, is the second significant amendment of that Act.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In 2018, the Act was amended to give effect to the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. The new regime adopted a more risk-based approach, where entities must take steps within a defined framework to identify and manage the risks in individual business relationships. It also adopted an increased focus on transparency of beneficial ownership, which has been further developed in the Fifth Directive.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Other enhancements in 2018 included a fitness and probity regime for the owners of private members\u2019 gaming clubs, new provisions in respect of Customer Due Diligence, new powers for the Financial Intelligence Unit and more stringent requirements around politically exposed persons.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Fifth Directive, implemented by this Bill, continues this process:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tit addresses the challenges presented by complex legal structures which can obscure the true owners of assets\n\tit brings virtual asset service providers and custodian wallet providers into the scope of AML regulation\n\tit improves safeguards for financial transactions to and from high-risk third countries and sets new limits on the use of anonymous pre-paid cards\n\tit also brings a number of new designated persons under the existing legislation, including property services providers as well as dealers and intermediaries in the art trade\n\tit enhances the customer due diligence (CDD) requirements of the existing legislation\n\tit prevents credit and financial institutions from creating anonymous safe-deposit boxes\n\tit provides for Ministerial guidance which will clarify domestic \u201cprominent public functions\u201d\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The measures specific to the criminal justice system in the Fifth Directive are primarily implemented in the Bill before the House. However, a very significant element of the Fifth Directive is improving the transparency of beneficial ownership of corporate and other legal entities to help address the use of complex legal structures for money laundering and terrorist financing. It also provides for the establishment of a national bank account register. This important ongoing work is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and my department works closely with the Department of Finance on these and other non-criminal justice measures.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Enacting this Bill will enhance the range of measures countering money laundering by reflecting modern developments. It will also help to bring us in line with our EU obligations. Members of the House may be aware that Ireland is late in transposing this Directive, the deadline for which was January of this year. The European Commission commenced the first stage of an infringement process, the issuing of a Letter of Formal Notice in May of this year. While this Bill is not the only element of the transposition, enacting the Bill before the house is an essential step in bringing our regime up-to-date, and ensuring that Ireland is in full compliance.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I do expect, however, that this area of law will continue to evolve as crime becomes increasingly sophisticated. Ireland has opted in to Directive 2019\/1153 which enhances the use of financial information by giving law-enforcement authorities direct access to information about the identity of bank-account holders contained in national centralised registries. In addition, it gives law enforcement the possibility to access certain information from national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) \u2013 including data on financial transactions \u2013 and also improves the information exchange between FIUs as well as their access to law enforcement information necessary for the performance of their tasks. These measures will speed up criminal investigations and enable authorities to combat cross-border crime more effectively.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As members will be aware, there are already robust and extensive anti-money laundering laws in place in Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The existing Act (as amended) runs to almost 150 sections, with the majority of those sections concerning designated persons and their obligations.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, at its heart is the offence defined in Section 7(1) of the 2010 Act. A person commits a money laundering offence if they, among other things, use, conceal, disguise, transfer, acquire, convert or remove from the State, the proceeds of crime. This applies if the person knows or believes that they are handling the proceeds of crime, or is reckless as to whether they are doing so. It is important to bear this offence in mind. While the other aspects of the regime support the prevention and detection of money laundering, and apply in a differentiated way to specific cases, it is open to no-one to recklessly facilitate money laundering.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This legislative framework is supported by a strong operational capability. There is a range of bodies active in combatting money laundering and terrorist financing, including An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na\u2019s National Economic Crime Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Central Bank, and my own department. The Anti-Money Laundering Steering Committee brings together the relevant departments and agencies to coordinate the national response to risks relating to money laundering and terrorist financing. In its most recent evaluation report for Ireland, the FATF found that Ireland has a generally sound and substantially effective legal and institutional anti-money laundering framework. This new legislation will update and enhance that framework, and will address many of the remaining gaps identified in the evaluation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I will now briefly set out the key points of the Bill by section.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Sections 1 to 3 contain provisions which update various definitions in the principal Act to bring it into line with the definitions used in the Fifth Directive. In particular, section 3 provides for the definitions of the new entities that will be considered \u2018designated persons\u2019 under the Act. This includes new definitions of property service provider, virtual asset service provider and custodian wallet provider.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 4 amends section 25 of the 2010 Act and brings the new entities under the designated person provisions who are required to apply AML measures in the course of their business. These new designated persons include letting agents, virtual asset service providers and high-value art dealers and intermediaries in that trade.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 5 amends section 33 of the 2010 Act and provides for a number of technical amendments including an obligation to carry out Customer Due Diligence (CDD) when required to contact the customer under any other enactment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 6 amends section 33A of the 2010 Act and provides for lowering the value limits for carrying out simplified due diligence on e-money instruments. This means that a person supplying e-money instruments, such as a pre-paid card, will be required to conduct CDD when the value of the requested card is \u20ac150 or higher. The existing threshold is \u20ac250.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 7 amends section 35 of the 2010 Act and provides that where a designated person is entering a business relationship with another entity, they must take steps to obtain the relevant information from the Register of beneficial ownership of trusts, corporate entities or financial vehicles, as appropriate and must not engage in that business relationship until the relevant information is obtained. By way of derogation, a financial institution is allowed to open an account ahead of obtaining the information but cannot allow any transactions on that account.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 8 amends section 36A of the 2010 Act to give effect to a technical amendment to the wording of the Directive in respect of which transactions require further examination.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 9 amends section 37 of the 2010 Act to provide for the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to issue guidance to competent authorities on the prominent public functions that will give rise to a person being designated as a \u201cpolitically exposed person\u201d (PEP). The amendments will also allow a designated person to continue to monitor someone who was previously designated a PEP so long as a money laundering risk exists in connection with their previous designation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 10 makes a technical amendment to section 38 of the 2010 Act to more clearly define the relevant relationship.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 11 amends section 38A of the 2010 Act and provides for a detailed list of enhanced due diligence measures that the designated person is required to apply when dealing with a customer established, or residing, in a high-risk third country.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 12 makes a technical amendment to section 40 of the 2010 Act in respect of information to be received from a relevant third party.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 13 places a requirement on the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU Ireland) to provide, where practicable, feedback in respect of suspicious transaction reports made to them. This reflects existing administrative practice.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 14 amends section 51 of the 2010 Act and provides for a defence to proceedings in relation to \u201ctipping-off\u201d where the designated person can prove that the entity to whom the information was disclosed was a specified financial institution, which is connected to the designated person or part of the same group structure.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 15 makes a technical amendment to section 55 of the 2010 Act in respect of record-keeping.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 16 amends section 58 of the 2010 Act and prohibits credit or financial institutions from creating anonymous safe deposit boxes.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 17 amends section 60 of the 2010 Act and assigns the supervising \u2018competent authority\u2019 for the new \u2018designated persons\u2019 under the amendments to section 25. The amendment also provides for the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to become the competent authority for barristers in the State following an agreement with the Bar Council.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 18 amends section 63B of the 2010 Act and provides for additional measures in respect of cooperation between competent authorities in different Member States.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 19 amends section 63D of the 2010 Act and updates the provisions relating to the persons employed by competent authorities in line with updates in the Fifth Directive.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 20 inserts a new section 63E into the 2010 Act. The new section provides that each competent authority establish effective and reliable mechanisms to encourage the reporting of breaches of the Act. The section also requires a competent authority to provide a secure communication channel for such reporting.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 21 amends section 65 of the 2010 Act and provides for additional detail which is to be included in the annual money-laundering reports of self-regulating bodies, for example the Law Society or relevant accounting bodies.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 22 makes a technical amendment to section 84 of the 2010 Act.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 23 repeals and replaces section 101 of the 2010 Act. The section inserts new provisions for the establishment of a Trust or Company Service Provider Appeal Tribunal. This is designed to establish one permanent Trust or Company Service Provider Appeal Tribunal, improve independence and transparency of the recruitment process for members of the Tribunal and strengthen the independence and impartiality of the Tribunal. The winding down of the current Appeal Tribunal and its replacement with this section will be managed by the commencement of this section, as and when appropriate.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Sections 24 and 25 amend and update the risk factors set out in Schedules 3 and 4 to the 2010 Act. The amendments are to provide for the relevant updates in the Fifth Directive.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 26 provides for the short title and commencement provisions of the Act and this is a standard provision.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I note for the information of the House that I may move Committee Stage amendments in respect of certain technical matters. In particular, consideration is currently being given to the appropriate treatment of providers of virtual asset services. This is a fast-moving area and recent recommendations in relation to it have been made by FATF.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In conclusion, this Bill reflects an evolution and an enhancement of the existing AML framework to reflect recent developments and is part of an ongoing process.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It will act as a further tool to combat global organised crime, to protect our financial system, and to ensure that we meet the highest international standards.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Combatting such crime is a government priority and I look forward to hearing Members\u2019 views and to the passage of this legislation through the House.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I commend this Bill to the House.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ENDS\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","80b8d9c7170450ed13245d410711af3f6208d7b59c444959e19fe2ce059fc102":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        Mr Michael Ring TD, Minister for Rural and Community Development, and Mr Se\u00e1n Canney TD, Minister of State for Community Development, Natural Resources and Digital Development, have welcomed the fantastic support of volunteers from local communities in response to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Since the call for volunteers to support the community response to COVID 19 went out in March, 16,957 people have registered to volunteer through the iVol app.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Volunteers are directly linked by their local Volunteer Centres to local organisations responding to COVID-19, conducting a wide range of very important work - from delivering food and medicines to older people who are self-isolating, to those volunteering in COVID test centres. There are also countless volunteers on the ground, helping out family, friends and neighbours.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister Ring said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cI would like to express my deep appreciation for the invaluable work being carried out by volunteers during the COVID-19 emergency.

Such development will take effort and commitment, which is why I was happy to secure a substantially increased budget allocation for horticulture for the 2021.  The 50% budget increase for the scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector, to \u20ac9 million, highlights my commitment to this sector and signals clearly that we are supporting its ongoing expansion and development.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Horticulture Industry Forum (HIF) was formed in 2014 as an umbrella organisation, for growers of Irish produce, to address challenges and highlight opportunities for the industry.

is working effectively to help new communities to integrate successfully in their local communities and life in Ireland. The report is a testament to the work of the 46 local development companies across the country that are implementing the programme. I know a lot of the work that is done is tailored and is particularly effective as it is at a one-to-one level. It\u2019s literally a direct person to person connection and bond that is helping many migrants navigate the multiple challenges that they are facing. \"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cIn my view SICAP is one of the most effective Programmes that we have that facilitates migrant integration in Ireland. It reaches into almost every community in Ireland and is based on personal contact between migrants and SICAP workers who are skilled and knowledgeable in terms of getting through the barriers to employment, education, access to services, social connections and an area that I think is particularly important, political participation.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cLast month Minister O\u2019Gorman and I launched a new approach and indeed a new relationship between the Irish State and people seeking international protection, where the State\u2019s efforts and supports to promote integration formally start from the first day a protection applicant arrives in Ireland. Many Local Development Companies have been doing this work, as the report shows, and now they have an even stronger mandate to do so following the publication of the White Paper on Direct Provision but also the evidence of good work from this report.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cWe know that people from new communities are not a homogenous group and it is crucial that individual nationalities and cultures are taken into account when programmes are being designed. The report is clear in its findings that Local Development Companies recognise this and actively apply a person-centred approach which is responsive to individual needs. I want to acknowledge the work of the Local Development Companies who are responsible for the implantation of SICAP locally and who work closely with the SICAP target groups to ensure that the inclusion measures are fit for purpose and achieve their objectives.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThe research published here today will be a vital input into ongoing policy formulation and working with my colleagues in my Department and across Government I look forward to implementing the recommendations over the months ahead to help achieve an inclusive society for all.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Pobal CEO, Ms Anna Shakespeare, said\n:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThe New Communities report focuses on the experiences of disadvantaged people who are migrants, asylum seekers and refugees supported by the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP). The report is an important piece of work and I very much welcome its launch today. It not only highlights the positive contribution that SICAP is making towards the integration of newcomers in communities across Ireland but also presents us with useful findings which can be used to inform practice.

This includes both group work and one on one individual supports in the areas of well-being and personal development, education and employment supports.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        New Communities is one of SICAP\u2019s primary target groups, which consists of migrants experiencing socio-economic disadvantage, asylum seekers and refugees\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Some of the key findings in the report include:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \t5,430 disadvantaged migrants, 1,168 asylum seekers and 851 refugees engage in the programme and make up a high proportion (14%) of SICAP clients. \n\tMembers of new communities are less likely to live in disadvantaged areas and are more likely to live in a jobless household; be at risk of homelessness and experience transport barriers.\n\tMany experience trauma and mental health issues often associated with seeking asylum.\n\tEach of the new community groups have different socio-economic characteristics with different levels of education and are more likely to be economically inactive due to legal restrictions in place. \n\tTailored supports are delivered especially to asylum seekers and refugees to help progression to employment and self-employment.  However, differences were noted in the types of jobs occupied by the new community groups.  Asylum seekers and refugees were more likely to progress into lower paid jobs in the food, drink and tobacco production sector.\n\tLDCs use different approaches recognising that they are not homogenous groups and factors like nationality and cultural background play an import role in the process.\n\tSICAP referred member to other services for additional supports e.g. Local Employment Services; Education and Training \n\tSICAP provided spaces for new communities to meet new people and develop social connections through dance and music providing opportunities for the groups to celebrate their culture and interact with others in the area.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","947e7f038f5d26de35b790828eab541f32098f723dbb5f1503656103fcaf619d":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        The Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe TD, today (Friday) notes the European Commission\u2019s decision to lodge an appeal with the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) challenging the judgement of the General Court of the European Union (GCEU) in the Apple State aid case.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The facts of the case, as established by the GCEU, demonstrate, as Ireland has always contended, that no State aid was given and that the Irish branches of the relevant Apple companies paid the full amount of tax due in accordance with the law.

We know that there have been days over the last week or two when we have all groaned at daily numbers seemingly stuck at around 500 or higher. This can be very disheartening for so many of us who are continuing to abide by the public health guidance and do the right thing.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, we have to remember how far we have come and how much we have achieved. Most of us are doing the right thing. The new and now predominant variant is much harder to control, much harder to stop spreading. This is what we are seeing in the levelling off in case numbers.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        What is concerning is that there has been a 9% increase week on week in case numbers, the first increase since the peak of the third wave. 13 counties now have community positivity rates of more than 10%. Rates are higher now on a number of measures measures compared to where we were at other points including just before Christmas.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As part of the HSE\u2019s enhanced COVID-19 testing for local communities, five new \u2018walk-in, no appointment necessary\u2019 temporary testing centres are being established to actively look for cases of COVID-19. These will be in areas where the number of positive cases are particularly high. Increasing the number of people we test will help us better understand how and why the virus is spreading quicker in certain areas. Around 1 in 5 people have COVID-19 without having any symptoms. Testing people with no symptoms will help us find positive cases earlier and allow these people take the necessary action to protect others. This will help us break chains of transmission.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The vaccination programme is rolling out, and we will continue to get vaccines to people as quickly as possible. We must all hold firm for a little longer \u2013 to give the vaccination programme a chance to reach more people in order for us to see the real benefits it can offer in our fight against this disease.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I know this seems like the most frustrating time but in many ways it is also the riskiest moment - when we are rolling out vaccines but not quite out of danger, when we have been in Level 5 for a long time and just want to be out of it, and especially want to start visiting our friends and families again.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Social Activity Measure\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        On Friday, we will be publishing Wave 4 of SAM (Social Activity Measure) \u2013 the study we are running in collaboration with the ESRI. Initial results from wave 4 confirm what we all know \u2013 that we are fed up, but most of us are complying with the restrictions and public health guidance despite that.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        One of the things that the study looks at it is home visits. We know many people have good reasons for visiting another\u2019s home \u2013 for care and support including childcare, for help with shopping or medicine or maybe they are part of your bubble. But we are seeing an increase in people making social visits to other homes and to receive visitors to their homes. We\u2019re are not necessarily talking about house parties, but we are talking about some home visits that are lasting an hour or more where masks are not being worn. It may be just a cup of coffee with extended family or a quick lunch. With the new variant, this is just a lot riskier than people may think. We are well used to hearing now that all social contact is risky, but this is especially the case if that contact is indoors, if rooms are not well ventilated, if you are not wearing a mask and the visit goes on too long. So, where you have choices about non-essential visits, think again and don\u2019t give COVID-19 the opportunity it will surely take.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are all finding this hard, we are all struggling. Sometimes it is hard to remember what our priorities are \u2013 protecting our most vulnerable, protecting our health service, keeping our children and young people in school \u2013 making sure everyone in our community gets the opportunity to get vaccinated and avoiding a damaging 4th wave of the disease.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Next week, ahead of April 5th, Government will consider the next stage of action and will make an announcement setting out the next steps on this journey. In the meantime, we must stay the course \u2013 for our families and friends, our communities, our frontline workers and for each other.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Nursing Home Visits\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In perhaps one of the first signals that we have brighter days ahead, this week we have the very welcome, albeit cautious and gradual, return of visits to long term residential care facilities and nursing homes. This is one of the first practical benefits of the vaccine programme.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Residents can receive two visits per week. These visits will be permitted on general compassionate grounds where a facility has a high level of vaccinations. And we know this is very welcome news for residents and their families. Level 5 restrictions introduced at the start of the year have been challenging for everyone but for residents and families of those in residential facilities, it has been particularly difficult.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Visitors will have to wear masks or PPE and book their visits in advance but will be able to enjoy the company of their loved ones after a very difficult few months.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Mandatory Quarantining\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Yesterday, mandatory hotel quarantine was introduced as another element of Ireland\u2019s public health measures to curb the transmission of COVID-19. Mandatory hotel quarantine is required for passengers who have been in a list of designated states, including those who have transited through a port or airport in a designated state, even if they stay airside or portside, in the 14 days prior to their arrival in Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Passengers will be required to complete 14 days of mandatory hotel quarantine at a designated facility, this could be reduced if a passenger receives a not-detected result of a COVID-19 test that is taken after ten days. It may also be extended if a passenger tests positive during their stay.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        People must also enter mandatory hotel quarantine if they do not provide evidence that they have a negative or \u2018not detected\u2019 result from a COVID-19 PCR test carried out no more than 72 hours prior to arrival into Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Before travelling to Ireland, people must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If you fall into the category of traveller required to quarantine on arrival, it is an offence if you travel without making the booking in advance. You can reserve a place in a mandatory hotel quarantine and read the full list of countries deemed high risk at www.gov.ie\/quarantine.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Resumption of Education\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the last three weeks, we have had the welcome return to in classroom learning for so many of our young people. Special schools are back to 100% capacity and all primary students are back in the school building. This is in addition to the return to the classroom for our fifth and final year leaving certificate students.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        From next Monday 29 March, early learning and care and school age childcare will resume. It is then planned that remaining post-primary school students will return on 12 April, after the Easter break.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We now want to ensure these school buildings can stay open and we can stay on track with our plan for reopening. It is therefore very important that we don\u2019t see the gradual re-opening of schools over this month as a signal that other forms of interaction are appropriate. Continue to exercise caution when dropping children to and from school. Don\u2019t arrange playdates or congregate in school grounds catching up with other parents you may not have seen for a while. We must ensure that the virus does not have an opportunity to spread in these settings.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Mobility and Compliance\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        I\u2019ve already highlighted that with schools reopening and a spell of good weather, we are seeing a lot more people moving around. Overall traffic volumes are continuing their upward trend, up 18% on last month. While retail and recreation mobility fell marginally in the last week after several weeks of persistent increases this may be due to the effect of St Patrick\u2019s Day. But, the number of people attending workplaces is rising again, with around a 12% increase on last month.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While your family life may be getting back to normal with returns to school and childcare, please remember, the current default position is to work from home. Your employer should be facilitating this if your physical presence is not essential in the workplace. Maybe you think it doesn\u2019t matter a lot but every additional contact counts \u2013 even more so with the new variant so it is worth the collective effort in reducing overall risk.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        What is very concerning at this point in our fight against COVID-19 is that An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na are continuing to see people gathering in groups at home and organising get togethers around social occasions. As I have said already, indoor and crowded settings facilitate this highly transmissible virus to spread. Such gatherings put at risk not only those attending, but everyone they come into contact with afterwards, including loved ones, neighbours, colleagues and your local community. To date, over 15,350 fines have been issued for breaches of COVID-19 restrictions, over 2,300 were for organising and attending house parties.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The Basics\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Despite our weariness and perhaps feeling demotivated because of the lack of progress and that we are a bit stuck on numbers. We do know what works. We just have to stick at it. COVID-19 doesn\u2019t get tired or demotivated. To use a football analogy, the new variant has given it \u201cfresh legs\u201d for this next phase of the match.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tstay at home unless absolutely necessary\n\tif you need to go out for an essential purpose, wear a mask, both in indoor and busy outdoor settings such as playgrounds, parks and supermarket queues\n\tkeep your distance \u2013 stay 2m away from others\n\twash your hands regularly with soap and water, use alcohol-based sanitiser where hand washing isn\u2019t possible\n\tstay within your 5km unless it is for an essential purpose\n\tcontinue to work from home where possible\n\tif you are in an indoor setting, make sure it is well-ventilated, keep windows open and try to think about refreshing the air regularly\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Updates - Supports\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        There continues to be a wide range of supports available to help employers and employees at this difficult time and they have all been extended to 30 June.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are currently 49,100 employers registered with Revenue for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.

This payment is valued at \u20ac141.88 million and marks a decrease of over 7000 on the number paid last week.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Since the last payment, almost 9,900 people closed their claim, with approximately 8500 of these stating that they were doing so because they are returning to work. The quickest way to make a claim for PUP or to close a claim is to do so online and to log on www.MyWelfare.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Enhanced Illness Benefit Payment\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        I want to remind all workers again that when a worker is told to self-isolate or restrict movements by a doctor or the HSE due to them being a probable source of infection or has been diagnosed with COVID-19 by a doctor, they can apply for an Enhanced Illness Benefit payment of \u20ac350 per week. To be eligible for this payment a person must be confined to their home or a medical facility. Unlike the general Illness Benefit, there are no waiting days attached to this payment, so it is paid from day one of illness or self-isolation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is not necessary for a person with symptoms to leave their home to get a medical certificate from their doctor as all of the application process can be completed online via www.MyWelfare.ie.\n This week, just over 2,100 people under the age of 66 have been medically certified for receipt of this benefit.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            National Vaccination Strategy\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        So far, we have successfully rolled out the vaccine to 492,000 people, with almost 184,000 fully vaccinated having received two doses.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Close to 11,000 vaccinators have been trained while recruitment for vaccinators at 38 vaccination centres is well underway. The aim is for four in five adults to have received at least one dose by the end of June.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are already seeing the positive impact of the vaccine roll-out on case numbers in the vaccinated population. COVID-19 infection among the three groups which have been vaccinated \u2013 residents and staff in long term residential care, frontline healthcare workers and people aged over 85 \u2013 has halved, while cases in the community are down around 20%. And as previously noted, this week the vaccine programme is supporting the return of visits to nursing homes and long-term care facilities.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The status of the roll out of the vaccine to specific groups is as follows:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tthose aged 65 and up living in long-term residential facilities and staff is substantially complete\n\tfrontline healthcare workers are also very close to completion\n\tover 85s have been completed and the process of vaccinating the 75-79 cohort is now underway. The target is to complete administration of vaccines for all aged over 70 by mid-May with full protection seven to 10 days afterwards. 88% of the deaths we have seen have been in this group\n\tvaccination of those aged 16-69 and at very high risk of severe COVID-19 disease will be rolled out further from this week\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Last week, the European Medicines Agency confirmed that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine in protecting from COVID-19 related serious illness and hospitalisation outweigh any risks associated with the vaccine, and that it is safe and effective. The HSE recommenced the administration of AstraZeneca over the weekend.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        New US trial data published yesterday showed this vaccine was 100% effective at preventing people from falling seriously ill and 79% effective at stopping symptomatic COVID-19.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Safety is non-negotiable in our programme, and it is essential that reports of potential safety concerns, even if very rare, are rigorously and swiftly investigated so that the public can be reassured and if required, appropriate action can be taken.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For more information on the National Vaccination Strategy and the prioritisation list go to gov.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            And, finally\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        I would like to finish today by again thanking you for all you are doing. We have come a long way but aren\u2019t yet where we need to be. We must continue to stay on the right path.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Trust in the public health advice. Think twice before deciding to take that trip, to go to that gathering or to venture outside your 5km. We know these measures work, they are working and if we can continue to persevere they will continue to work and we can begin a return to the normal we knew. We will the get dividends from our efforts as more and more of us are vaccinated. We just aren\u2019t there yet.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Remember, \u2018D\u00e1 fhada an l\u00e1 tagann an tr\u00e1thn\u00f3na\u2019 no matter how long the day seems, evening will always come.

The work of the WFP and its staff is crucial to saving lives and countering hunger every day.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the WFP rightly brings our attention to the 690 million hungry people in the world at a time when the UN is warning of the real risk that famine is looming in several countries.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"Combatting hunger and malnutrition is a key part of Irish Aid\u2019s work and Ireland is a strong supporter of the WFP.  I congratulate David Beasley, together with his hardworking teams, who put themselves at risk in the most difficult, complex places in the world.

These plans have included new roster arrangements, postponing retirements, extracting 319 recruit Garda\u00ed to allocate to front-line duties with appropriate supervision, and redeploying Garda\u00ed who work at the Garda College to frontline duties. The organisation also hired 210 vehicles to provide additional mobility to members nationwide for increased community support and community engagement across the country.

The focus of this activity is on encouraging people to adhere to the public health measures. An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na will take a graduated approach at this time, informing and encouraging compliance by the public, as well as taking enforcement action where required.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has recommenced Operation Fanacht, a major operation to ensure public compliance with travel restrictions in place while the country is under level 5 restrictions. In accordance with these restrictions, people are asked not to leave their place of residence unless it is for essential purposes. Garda\u00ed will be conducting checkpoints on main routes and this may lead to traffic disruption.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This phase of Operation Fanacht will involve 132 large-scale checkpoints a day on main arterial routes around the country in addition to thousands of mobile checkpoints on secondary routes in towns and villages a week.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In this, as in all its work, AGS continues to implement its ethos of community policing, seeking out those who are vulnerable and providing assistance and making sure they don\u2019t feel alone.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Normal policing operations to prevent and detect crime are continuing.  Garda\u00ed continue to use all powers available to them, including arrest, where appropriate. The enforcement of Road Traffic Legislation, in particular drink\/drug driving, including breath tests, will continue. These measures have been communicated to the Garda representative associations, who all appreciate the extremely grave situation facing the country and the need to seek to have maximum capacity available to maintain service delivery and support the public as required.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Nationwide Checks of Licensed Premises in Support of Public Health Guidelines\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        On Friday 3 July, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na launched Operation Navigation to conduct checks of licenced premises nationwide in relation to adherence to the public health guidelines.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Since Friday 3rd July, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has conducted thousands of checks on licensed premises throughout the country. In conducting these visits, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na continued its graduated policing response based on its tradition of policing by consent. This has seen Garda members engage, educate, encourage and, as a last resort, enforce.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While the vast majority of licensed premises were found to be in compliance with regulations and licensing laws, in a small number of cases  Garda\u00ed found potential breaches of the health regulations or licensing laws even after providing the premises with the opportunity to rectify the situation. As of 31 October, the total number of these potential breach incidents since Operation Navigation began is 287. The DPP will be consulted in each of these cases.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Operation Treor\u00e1im\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In support of public health measures, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na began conducting checks of retail premises across the country to ensure compliance with public health regulations on 25 October. AGS report that the vast majority of retail premises were found to be compliant or came into compliance when requested to do so. This is being verified by follow-up inspections.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, up to 31 October 2020, there have been 11 incidents where premises have continued with suspected breaches of regulations. In line with Garda policy, files relating to these incidents will be sent to the DPP.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Oversight & Transparency of New Garda Powers\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Minister for Justice requested the Commissioner to compile and publish a record of any use of powers granted to An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na under the Health Act 1947, with a view to ensuring transparency. The Commissioner has undertaken to submit and publish this data on a weekly basis. Latest figures on the use of these regulations show:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tIn supporting the COVID-19 public health guidelines, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has adopted a graduated policing response based on its tradition of policing by consent. This has seen members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na engage, educate, encourage and, as a last resort, enforce.\n\tIn what is a very small minority of cases across the country, despite receiving a number of warnings, some individuals were still not willing to take steps to comply with the public health guidelines and the regulations were used under the Health Act 1947.\n\tFrom 8 April, which was when the regulations came into effect, until 24 October 2020 inclusive, Garda\u00ed invoked the regulations 394 times out of more than a million interactions with the public. These include both arrests and incidents without arrest where name and address details were taken for consultation with the DPP on the decision to issue charges. Arrest remains a last resort.\n\tThe types of incidents encompassed in these figures include breaches of domestic travel restrictions, face covering restrictions, international travel restrictions and other restrictions such as the organisation of events.\n\tOf the 368 incidents, two were as a result of an instruction from a relevant medical professional as per the Act.\n\tUnder Operation Navigation, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has recorded 281 incidents relating to breaches of regulations concerning licensed premises.\n\tAs per Garda policy in relation to the regulations, in all cases where arrests were made under the regulations, members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na must consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions on the decision to charge.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         To provide additional public assurance on the appropriate and proportionate use of these powers, the Minister for Justice also asked the Policing Authority to assess and report regularly on the use of these regulations by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. The ninth report of the Policing Authority to the Minister of Justice was published on 11 November 2020. This full report can be accessed at the following link: Ninth Report of the Policing Authority on use of Covid-19 powers by An Garda Siochana (09 November 2020)\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Information on the use of Covid-19 related powers by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na can be found here: Use of Covid-19 related powers by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Coroners and Pathology Services\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        A Mortality National Oversight Group has been established, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A sub-group of Coroners was created, meeting twice weekly at first, to coordinate their responses to COVID-19 along with Department of Justice, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, and the State Pathologist, with support from the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as required. The final meeting of this group was held on August 5th.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As the Department of Justice has responsibility for the Dublin Coroners Court, the Department has appointed two additional deputy coroners and increased the number of administrative staff to support with increased workload of recording notifiable deaths.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Coroners Society of Ireland originally published their \u2018Guidance in relation to the Coroners Service and Deaths due to COVID-19 infection\u2019 on 11th March, with version 5 of this document published on 15th April. That guidance seeks to minimise the requirements for post-mortem examinations and post-mortem swabbing which might cause delays for families. If a clinical assessment of COVID-19 can be made, then there is no need for a post-mortem examination and post-mortem swabbing in most cases.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Coroners also worked with the HSE, PHECC, the National Ambulance Service and An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to revise the rules relating to pronouncement of death to reduce pressure on GPs to attend at all deaths.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Following engagement between the Department and the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, confirmation was received that Local Authorities would, on request, support Coroners with administrative staff during and after the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Part 2 of the Civil and Criminal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2020, dealing with Coroners was commenced with effect from 21 August, 2020.  The Act provides for additional capacity to the Coroner service, by the written request of the Coroner for the district, seeking Ministerial authorisation, for one or more of the following actions:-\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tassign as a temporary additional Coroner for that district, for a period not exceeding six months (which may be renewed), a person who already stands appointed as a Coroner or deputy Coroner for another district,\n\tappointment of a temporary additional Coroner for that district, for a period not exceeding six months (which may be renewed) of a person who may previously have been a Coroner or deputy Coroner to be appointed as a Coroner. An upper age limit of 75 years will apply, and\n\tappointment of a temporary additional Coroner for that district, for a period not exceeding six months (which may be renewed) of a person not previously appointed as a Coroner or deputy Coroner but who has the necessary qualifications under the Act to be appointed as a Coroner. An upper age limit of 75 years will apply.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To date one such Temporary Coroner has been appointed.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Office of the State Pathologist is adhering to all HSE, public health and Government guidance during the coronavirus pandemic. State pathologists always wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) when carrying out their work and will continue to attend at scenes of death when such attendance is requested or necessary.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Immigration Service Delivery\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        There is a very close working relationship between frontline Border Management Unit staff at the Airport, the DAA and the HSE.  Immigration personnel closely follow all advice from the HSE and, in the event that a suspected case arises, the clear protocols laid down are carefully followed. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The immigration services are also working closely with the HSE on a daily basis across a number of areas, including accommodation centres for international protection applicants and the international protection offices.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Along with guidelines on good respiratory and hand-hygiene practices, COVID-19 risk assessments are issued to each of these service areas and, together with the HSE, officials from the Department of Justice are ensuring information is updated on a daily basis and any changing circumstances are responded to effectively.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Passenger Locator Form\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        As Ireland moves towards the easing of measures, the risk of importing new cases through non-essential travel increases. The Government therefore continues to advise Irish citizens and residents against all non-essential international travel, and passengers arriving into Ireland from overseas are asked to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        From Thursday 28 May there is a legal requirement for passengers arriving in Ireland from overseas to complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form. The Form will be used to facilitate a system of follow up checks to make sure people who travel to the country are staying where they said that they would. The Form will also ensure more accurate and expeditious contact tracing, should we have a suspect or confirmed case on a flight or ferry coming into Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The onus is on the passenger to access the form before travelling and to have it completed on arrival. It is available for download from www.gov.ie\/locatorform\n and carriers are emailing a copy to intending passengers. On arrival, passengers must submit a completed form to the authorities setting out their contact details. Completion of this form is now mandatory.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        People arriving from Northern Ireland, working in defined essential supply chain roles, foreign diplomats and passengers who are transiting through the State without leaving the port or airport will not be required to complete the form. Passengers who are travelling immediately onwards to Northern Ireland will have to fill out a portion of the form. The relevant Regulations introduce new offences punishable by a fine not exceeding \u20ac2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Further information on these requirements can be found on the  Irish Health Service COVID-19 Advice Page.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Visa applications\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        On 20th March the decision was taken to temporarily cease accepting new visa applications. Increasing travel restrictions and the measures introduced as part of the Government\u2019s efforts to interrupt the transmission of COVID-19 means that travel may not be possible and even if possible is not advisable unless essential. The situation is kept under review in consultation with the relevant authorities. While it will still be possible to apply for an Irish visa online in the normal manner, these temporary measures mean that applicants will not be able to complete their application process. Any application made online will remain valid until such time as restrictions are lifted. A limited resumption of services has begun from 22nd June (see below). We intend to resume accepting other applications as soon as safety concerns abate. Certain Priority\/Emergency cases continue to be processed throughout the pandemic and these include the following:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tEmergency visa (e.g. Healthcare professionals, health researchers, and elderly care professionals);\n\timmediate family members of Irish citizens;\n\tpersons legally resident in the State; and\n\tPersons entitled to avail of the provision of the EU Free Movement Directive.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Contingency planning is also in hand to ensure that priority immigration services can continue to be provided, should circumstances change. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The temporary closure of the Burgh Quay Registration Office was announced on 20 March as the high degree of footfall made social distancing extremely challenging.  On that basis any immigration permissions that were due to expire between 20 March and 20 May 2020 were automatically extended for two months. On 13th May the Minister for Justice announced that all such permissions that are due to expire from 20\/5\/2020 to 20\/7\/2020 are automatically renewed by the Minister for a period of 2 months.  The renewal of permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions attach. In relation to persons with existing permission under Directive 2004\/38\/EC (Free Movement Directive), the automatic renewal is subject to the requirement that the person is complying with the requirements of the Directive. Any permission which was renewed by the notice of 20 March 2020 and which therefore has a new expiry date between 20\/05\/2020 and 20\/07\/2020 is automatically renewed by this notice for a further 2 months. On the 18 September, the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, T.D., announced a further temporary extension of immigration and international protection permissions to 20 January 2021. This applies to permissions that are due to expire between 20 September 2020 and 20 January 2021. This includes people in Ireland on short stay visas and those whose permissions have already been extended by previous notices issued.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A Frequently Asked Questions document on the impact of COVID-19\n on immigration and international protection is available on the Immigration Service Delivery website (www.inis.gov.ie\n). This document is regularly updated.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Resumption of Visa Services\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department has started a limited resumption of visa services from Monday 22nd June. During this initial resumption phase, we will only be accepting Long Stay \u201cD\u201d visa applications, including Study, as well as those identified under our current criteria as Emergency\/Priority visas. It remains the position that we are not issuing short stay visas for non-essential travel.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are still restrictions in place in many countries, so in locations where it isn\u2019t possible to resume from the 22nd June, we intend to resume accepting visa applications as soon as is possible thereafter. Any resumption of services is subject to current health and safety advice in relation to the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For up to date information in your location, you should go to the local Irish Embassy\/Mission website for that location.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Temporary Suspension of Irish Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        On 10 July, Minister McEntee TD, announced the temporary suspension of the Irish Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme (SSVWP) as part of COVID-19 measures to restrict travel and protect public health. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Programme had allowed people visiting the United Kingdom on short stay visas to travel to Ireland. Under the agreement, the visa holders had to leave Ireland before their permission to stay in the UK ended. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The suspension of the Programme is being implemented because of a divergence in approach between Ireland and the UK in travel measures to combat the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Programme applies to nationals of 17 countries: Bahrain, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, India, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Montenegro, Oman, People's Republic of China, Qatar, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Nationals of the affected countries will no longer be in a position to use their UK short stay visa for a visit to Ireland, but may apply separately for an Irish visa, which under current circumstances would only be accepted if it was a critical case.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is a temporary measure, which does not affect the Common Travel Area rights of British and Irish citizens or the operation of the CTA.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Expansion of online Registration Renewal System to include all Dublin-based non-nationals\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On 22 June, Minister Flanagan announced a new online Registration Renewal System for non-EEA students based in Dublin. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On 7 July, Minister McEntee announced that this online renewal system is being expanded and will apply to all Dublin based non-nationals seeking to renew their immigration registration. The new online system will allow applicants to complete their renewal online without having to book an appointment and then personally attend the registration office. Previously, such applicants were required to book an appointment prior to attending in person at the registration office, and these appointments were in high demand.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Applicants seeking to renew their permission will now complete the application form online, upload copies of supporting documents online, pay the applicable fee and then submit their passport and current IRP card via registered post. Documents will be checked and, if approved, the passport will be stamped and returned by registered post and an IRP card issued by express post.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The new process will allow officials to process renewals more efficiently by enabling them to better manage the volume of applications. This will also allow them focus more closely on the quality of documentation being provided to the office.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Importantly, the new system will also relieve pressure on the public registration office which, when it reopens, will focus exclusively on 1st time registrations. This will improve the quality of customer service provided to this group as well.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The online system is only available for renewal of registrations. As 1st time registrations require biometrics (a photograph and fingerprints) to be taken, it is not possible to do these online.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department\u2019s intention, in making the change, is to significantly reduce the bureaucratic burden placed on applicants and also, with faster processing times, offer greater certainty to applicants that their permissions will be renewed on time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The online renewal application portal can be found here: inisonline.jahs.ie\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Reopening of Burgh Quay Registration Office\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister McEntee announced that the Burgh Quay Registration Office would reopen from 20 July to facilitate 1st time registrations.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As 1st time registrations require biometrics (a photograph and fingerprints) to be taken, it is not possible to do these online. Anyone who had an appointment for 1st time registration cancelled will be contacted directly and given a new appointment. Anyone who did not have an appointment but needs to register should contact ISD at burghquayregoffice@justice.ie and request an appointment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The confidentiality of medical information\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department of Justice would like to again confirm that it does not and will not seek any information from an immigration perspective from either the Department of Employment and Social Protection or the HSE for persons coming forward for social supports or medical attention. Any undocumented migrant should not hesitate about coming forward to access health care or social supports during the COVID-10 crisis.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        More broadly, the Department looks at each case of undocumented or illegal persons in the State on a case by case basis and has consistently urged anyone in this position to come forward if they wish to apply to regularise their position.  A pragmatic approach is taken in relation to each case which is considered on its individual merits.  Ireland along with other Member States of the EU, has committed, under the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum (2008), to a case-by-case approach as opposed to mass regularisation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Further information on Immigration Issues\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        A detailed FAQ is available here\n which clarifies many issues relating to visas, stamps, immigration etc during the COVID-19 pandemic. This document is updated regularly. At all times, the Department will take a pragmatic approach to any issues that arise.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Applications for International Protection\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Processing of applications and appeals\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The arrival of people at our borders seeking to claim international protection has reduced; however, we continue to have people arrive at the International Protection Office in Mount Street to make new applications.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        New applicants for international protection are being advised to continue to report as normal to the International Protection Office in Mount Street where initial processing will take place. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This will enable follow on services, like accommodation, to be provided. Staff interactions with applicants are conducted behind glass screens to facilitate social distancing. The current number of applicants is quite low so waiting areas are far emptier, which also aids social distancing measures.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Alternative arrangements are being put in place for renewal of Temporary Residence Cards (TRC\u2019s) for international protection applicants which means they will not be required to present in person until further notice. This means that the International Protection Office will identify from its records those applicants whose permission is due to expire within the next two month period and will issue a new TRC to them by post at their last recorded address with an date extension of two months.  Any applicants in Direct Provision will be required to return their old card to their centre manager for return to the IPO.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Substantive interviews of international protection applicants have been suspended until further notice at the International Protection Office.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Similarly, Tribunal Hearings for appeals at the International Protection Appeals Tribunal have been suspended until further notice.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Irish Prison Service\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is clear that COVID-19 provides unique challenges to custodial institutions, including our prisons. COVID-19 in a prison setting would present significant challenges for prison management in terms of controlling the spread of the virus amongst staff and prisoners, and the provision of appropriate medical treatment to affected persons.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Recognising these challenges, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service at an early stage established an Emergency Response Planning Team (\u201cERPT\u201d) consisting of senior staff with skills and experience in areas including operational; healthcare; and infection control. ERPT was tasked with identifying and issuing instruction on the necessary actions with the aim of:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tBlocking the spread of COVID-19 into a prison setting;\n\tEarly detection of any possible case of COVID-19 in a prisoner or staff member; and\n\tPrevention of the spread of COVID-19, should a case be confirmed.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A significant amount of work has been carried out by the Irish Prison Service to date, informed and guided by the advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of COVID-19 issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 15 March 2020.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the first instance, the Minister for Justice approved a number of actions to reduce the number of prisoners in our prisons in March this year to support a more effective infection control regime, including greater physical distancing and cocooning. These included:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tThe granting of temporary release (TR) (which is already a normal part of prisoner management) to low risk prisoners, who were assessed on a case-by-case basis. As always TR is conditional on a prisoner being of good behaviour and each prisoner would be subject to re-arrest in the event of a breach. This gradual and planned reduction of the prison population has seen a decrease in the number in custody from 4,235 on 11 March 2020 to 3,772 on 22 October 2020, a reduction of approximately 463 or 11%.\n\tProviding for longer periods for those prisoners currently on TR to have to sign in with IPS, in order to reduce footfall in and out of the prisons, and to free up administrative staff to mitigate any depletion in prison officer numbers. Rather than signing in weekly, the requirement is currently monthly.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is important to note that a number of key constraints on the power of release remain:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tthe primary one is public safety - no prisoner who poses an undue risk to public safety will be granted TR;\n\tno one who is remanded for trial can be released;\n\tfactors such as housing and health status are also taken into account. The IPS is coordinating with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the HSE.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Managing the response to COVID-19 has seen enormous change for both prisoners and staff. To enable effective implementation of these changes, a communications campaign has been rolled out by the IPS: regular COVID-19 Information Leaflets for prisoners, developed by the prison Red Cross Prisoner Volunteers, and COVID-19 information newsletters for staff are being published and distributed to raise awareness of the particular risks the virus poses in a prison environment and to provide updates on the necessary actions being taken by the Service to keep staff, prisoners and their families\u2019 safe.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The IPS is also looking for retired staff to form a panel to support prisons in the event that staff levels drop due to staff having to isolate due to COVID-19.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To date, no prisoner has been infected with COVID-19 and the Irish Prison Service has been internationally recognised for its work in controlling the spread of the virus. The IPS has now shared their experience with other countries through the submission of a paper to the World Health Organisation on its approach to the outbreak for publication in the international Public Health Journal.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Screening and Testing for COVID-19\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The WHO has issued guidance recognising the distinctive challenges facing prisons and recommending that screening should be undertaken at the point of entry and that persons checked should be prisoners, visitors and prison staff. In line with the WHO advice and in consultation with the NPHET, screening has commenced from 30 March.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Irish Prison Service is taking a proactive approach to ensure the early detection of any possible case of COVID-19. Any prisoner who advises staff that they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 is immediately assessed by prison healthcare staff who, following the guidance provided by the NPHET and the HSE and public health authorities, arrange for the prisoner to be isolated and tested, if they meet specific criteria. Some prisoners who do not meet the HSE threshold for COVID-19 testing but are experiencing some symptoms continue to be isolated in line with HSE advice.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The IPS has opened a specific unit in Cloverhill to allow for the isolation of any confirmed case. This unit is currently being used to accommodate symptomatic prisoners who are suspected of having COVID-19. Prisoners continue to be isolated in this unit until cleared from isolation through the COVID-19 testing process. Staff working in this unit wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to ensure their health and safety.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        IPS staff have engaged with the National Ambulance Service (NAS) with regard to Covid-19 testing. Prison Staff are also currently being trained to develop contact tracing teams in all prisons, thus reducing the burden on the teams carrying out this function in the community.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Given the nature of this virus it remains possible that at some stage there will be a confirmed prisoner case and, should this occur, the decision to confirm and\/or release details of a positive test for COVID-19 will be a matter for the Chief Medical Office\/NPHET\/Public Health\/HSE.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Quarantining, Cocooning and Visiting\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        All prisoners newly committed to prison are being quarantined for up to 14 days, in order to reduce the risk that a new committal who might be incubating the virus could spread COVID-19 to the general prison population.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All prisoners aged 70 years or more or those that are deemed medically vulnerable are being \u201ccocooned\u201d, so as to minimise all interactions with other prisoners or staff and to ensure their health and safety. This approach is in line with Government advice to members of the public.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The prisoner population who require to be cocooned include the following:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tPrisoners 70 years of age or more; or\n\tPrisoners with medical conditions who the health care team identify as vulnerable. This includes:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        1. Prisoners with cancer, for example those with leukaemia, on chemotherapy, on immunotherapy, on other specified treatments, or on immunosuppressants after transplants.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        2. Prisoners with severe respiratory disease \u2013 for example, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma or cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3. Prisoners with Rare Diseases \u2013 for example, sickle cell anaemia.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        4. Pregnant women with cardiovascular disease.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Prisoners who are asymptomatic and are currently cocooned within prisons are being facilitated with their statutory out-of-cell time, except in limited circumstances where a prisoner cannot avail of exercise for medical reasons. The number of television channels and national newspapers available to prisoners who are cocooning have also been increased.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Prison visits\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Irish Prison Service began a phased recommencement of physical family visits to prisons on Monday 20th July 2020.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Following Public Health advice, and owing to the restriction on movements announced by the Government in an effort to curtail the spread of Covid-19, physical family visits to prison were suspended on 27th March 2020 and replaced with a new system of video visits.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Irish Prison Service fully appreciates how important contact with family is to prisoners and has been committed to the early return of physical family visits as soon as it was considered safe to do so.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In line with the Government Roadmap, and with infection control in mind, the Irish Prison Service has completed a comprehensive risk assessment on the return of physical prison visits.  The Service has identified the necessary measures, which are currently being progressed, to ensure that family members and friends can return to physical visits to our prisons in a safe manner.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Visits have now recommenced on a phased basis and movement through the phases will be subject to ongoing risk assessment and will take account latest public health advice, the range of Government restrictions in place and other factors including the prevailing transmission rate in the community.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Social Distancing and Exercise\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In order to prevent cross-contamination in our prisons, some further restrictions have also been put in place for prisoners and staff within our prisons. Certain activities, such as work and training, have been curtailed to reduce cross-prison movements and interactions, and the prison schools have been closed. Prison staff must also remain in the areas that they are specifically assigned for duty.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The IPS has introduced physical\/social distancing arrangements\/protocols in our prisons for prisoners and staff and these are being followed. This includes the marking of floor areas with 2 metre separation lines and the posting of signage throughout the institution. Those most vulnerable due to age or underlying health conditions wear gloves and wear face masks when exercising as an added precaution. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While prison gyms remain open, the capacity for use has been significantly reduced to safe operating levels to maintain physical distancing requirements and the cleaning of equipment before and after use is being overseen by staff.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Prison management continue to encourage exercise (excluding use of gym facilities) and recreational activity for those that are cocooning, ensuring that it is done separate to the general prisoner population.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Courts Service\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Courts service continues to work with the Presidents and judiciary in each court to organise an increasing workload in a cautious, conservative, safe and innovative way, to allow access to justice whilst also maintaining social distance and safety\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On the 08th May the Chief Justice, the Court Presidents and the Courts Service outlined the next steps being undertaken to extend court services in a gradual and responsible way for creating a pathway to opening some courts to ensure continuity of access to justice during the current public health emergency. Gradual and careful planning.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Courts will extend use of virtual remote court hearings, and organise more physical hearings in the coming weeks. Courtrooms are being laid out with physically distanced spaces. Cases will be listed at staggered times and distinct case types will be organised differently.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Supreme Court has announced that A new practice direction operational from mid-April introduced the issuing of a 'statement of case' setting out the Court\u2019s understanding of the relevant facts and issues. Consideration is also being given as to how the limited number of cases involving litigants in person should be managed. It is hoped that all cases in respect of which leave to appeal was granted before the end of April of this year will have been heard by the end of July.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Court of Appeal will continue to hear and increase the number of appeals remotely and increase the numbers heard.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The High Court will expand the type and number of cases to be heard from Monday 18 May 2020 with eight additional case types and matters will added to the urgent cases already being heard, including Insolvency matters both corporate and personal, Judicial review applications including Strategic Infrastructure challenges, All Family Law applications including adoption matters, Criminal Asset Bureau cases. Some Jury Trials to resume in many venues in the Circuit Court in September 2020.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the District Court, some Jury Trials to resume in many venues in the Circuit Court in September 2020. District Court Appeals will proceed on the adjourned date. Family law matters adjourned since March 2020 will be given a hearing date by the Court Office as soon as possible and consideration will be given to dealing with matters remotely where possible and appropriate. Hearings which were adjourned in Civil Cases and motions since March will be given a hearing date by the Court Office as soon as possible. Until further notice it will not be possible to hear cases which involve oral testimony while Judgments will continue to be delivered electronically.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Courts Service is establishing a consultative user group to ensure that court users are involved in informing decisions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Statement of the Chief Justice and each Court President which lays out specific arrangements in relation to each Court is available on the Courts Service website\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Courts Service has launched a new COVID- 19 Court Users\u2019 video for those attending court during the COVID- 19 pandemic. To keep others safe, only those with essential business should attend the Courts during the pandemic. The video details the measures the Courts have taken, in partnership with the Chief Justice and the judiciary, to ensure that cases are conducted in line with Government and HSE guidelines, requirements and protocols. The COVID- 19 Court Users Video can be accessed here\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Further measures to facilitate social distancing\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Measures have been introduced to encourage social distancing through both Judicial practice directions and practices or changes introduced by the Courts Service.  The measures in respect of the District Court include:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tNo requirements for bailed defendants to appear;\n\tBlock adjournment of lists introduced with dates emailed to solicitors and posted in various places in the CCJ;\n\tCustody list produced and posted outside the courtrooms;\n\tOne solicitor at a time being dealt with in courtrooms;\n\tJury assembly area open and available to be used as a waiting area;\n\tJudges sitting earlier to hear informations\/requests for warrants;\n\tSitting at 2.30pm and 4.30pm in addition to the morning sitting to prevent the build-up of cases for the evening Court;\n\tFloor markers to indicate the required distance while queuing for Court and the Bail Office;\n\tJury minders manning each courtroom door to monitor numbers going in with a runner to call parties when required;\n\tPA system reminding users of the need to socially distance while conducting business in the CCJ;\n\tHand sanitisers available;\n\tAdditional cleaning of touch points carried out daily;\n\tJury minders call AGS members to court from jury room waiting area as required.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition to the above, sittings of the Circuit Criminal, Central Criminal, Special Criminal and High Courts are subject to similar judicial practice directions. The Courts Service has applied the same practices in those courts as well as using overflow Courtrooms and the Jury assembly area to facilitate social distancing, as required.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Throughout this time, there have been consultations with stakeholders about the proposed changes in CCJ safety arrangements, both before and after introduction. These consultations have continued as a means to explore additional measures as issues arise. The procedures introduced are working well, and there are no plans to revisit this policy at this time. However, the Courts Service contingency planning group is reviewing and updating plans on a daily basis, in consultation with key stakeholders.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Family Law - Access Court Orders\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Court orders in relation to access remain in place and, in general, parties are obliged to keep to them.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, acknowledging that there might be some issues or concerns about travelling for visits, on 27th March, the President of the District court clarified that parents could come to mutually agreed arrangements for alternative contact, which could involve phone calls, or skype etc. Such agreement should be recorded by email or text message. The best interests of the child should be the key consideration.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If parties cannot agree on an alternative arrangement, mediation services are still available and should be used, and at all times the welfare of the child will be paramount.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Regulations made by the Minister for Health, which came into effect on 8th April, recognise the right of a parent, guardian, or person having a right of access to a child to leave their home in order to give effect to arrangements for access by that person or for another parent, guardian or person having such right of access and explicitly provide for an exception to the travel restrictions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Family and Child Law Committee of the Law Society has prepared some guidelines for practitioners and parents on family law matters during COVID-19, such as access, maintenance, child protection and domestic violence, which can be found at  www.lawsociety.ie\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In cooperation with the Department and its Agencies, a UCC Family law COVID-19 information hub has been launched as a useful resource for people seeking guidance on family law issues during these challenging times. www.ucc.ie\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Probation Service\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the measures announced by the Government on the 12th March 2020, the Government advised that where possible people work remotely, avoid interface meetings and maintain health and safety practices.  Following that advice, the Probation Service is working remotely, where possible, with most offices closed for public business. Staff are adapting their practice, working with offenders using telephone contact and linking with key partner organisations to support community safety. Every team across the country have identified those who are most at risk of offending or posing harm to others, and specific targeted  responses have been developed for this cohort as a priority.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Prison work by Probation Service teams based in prisons is continuing. Probation Service staff are supporting the Irish Prison Service at this particularly challenging time by primarily providing welfare advice and contact for prisoners and their families. Working in partnership with the Irish Prison Service, children detention centres and the Courts Service, the Probation Service is also prioritising the preparation of remand-in-custody reports for the Courts in cases that are ongoing. Video link interviews from designated Probation Service Offices are being facilitated in each prison.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As the Covid 19 pandemic crisis continues to evolve with developing responses as the situation changes, Probation Service practice and actions may change accordingly. There will be regular updates through internal communications with all Probation Service personnel and for persons subject to supervision, as necessary, and well as updates on the Probation Service website www.probation.ie\n and Twitter @probation_irl\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            A Special focus on Tackling Domestic Violence\/Abuse\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Recognising the particular risks of domestic violence\/abuse presented by the current situation, the Department has established a cross-sectoral group comprising AGS, Court Services and Legal Aid officials, linking directly with TUSLA representatives. An action plan has been developed to respond to the increased risk and incidence of domestic violence as a consequence of the COVID-19 measures taken and the resulting enforced proximity of abusers and their victims.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The action plan is divided into three strands of work:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tMaintaining and prioritising services for those who need to access them;\n\tEnsuring that victims can access the courts and seek protection from perpetrators;\n\tRaising awareness that services and supports will be available throughout the COVID-19 emergency for those experiencing domestic abuse.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has established Operation Faoiseamh to specifically address this issue. AGS is maintaining its response to any reports of domestic abuse as a top priority and victims of incidents recorded in 2018-2020 are being contacted. Those at high risk will be visited. Garda\u00ed will respond quickly and robustly with a pro-arrest intervention policy to any report of domestic abuse despite the current Covid-19 emergency.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department of Justice is engaging with NGOs to ensure that they coordinate between one another to maintain helplines and other supports for victims. The Department has also provided additional funding of over \u20ac196,340 to community and voluntary groups to support their response to COVID-19. This includes:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tWomen\u2019s Aid: \u20ac63,000 for additional resources to extend the Support and Referral Service (SRS), and the High Risk Support project;\n\tRape Crisis Centre Network Ireland: \u20ac50,000 to support the work of local centres in relation to the provision of a confidential, data compliant service, and to manage information flows on advice and guidance to and from front line trauma support workers;\n\tRuhama: \u20ac8,000 for additional support packs for women seeking to exit prostitution;\n\tMen\u2019s Development Network: up to \u20ac39,340 for an extension of the Male Advice line, extra telephone support for the Men Ending Domestic Violence programme, and to deliver a promotional campaign;\n\tSafe Ireland: Funding of \u20ac36,000 is provided to Safe Ireland.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Tusla has identified domestic violence as one of three critical service areas that the entire energy of Tusla and its partners would focus on during this public health emergency. The CEO engaged directly with over 60 organisations, including refuges to hear first-hand about challenges faced by the sector, and proposed solutions to keep refuges operational and sustainable. Since then, senior Tusla staff have been liaising directly with each refuge provider and other organisations in the domestic, sexual and gender based violence space to provide support and address issues faced.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has announced changes to make Rent Supplement available more easily to victims of domestic violence. The announcement follows proposals from Safe Ireland for such assistance. Under these changes, victims of domestic violence can get immediate access to Rent Supplement for a three month period to ensure that they are not prevented from leaving their home because of financial concerns. The usual Rent Supplement means test will not apply for this three month period. The process will work based on referrals from Tusla-funded services; referrals from An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the HSE will also be possible. After the three-month period, a further three-month extension may be provided, subject to the usual Rent Supplement means assessment. After six months, if the tenant has a long term housing need, they can apply to their local housing authority for social housing supports and, if eligible, will be able to access HAP.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Legal Aid Board is giving priority to domestic violence and childcare cases. The Legal Aid Board\u2019s office at the Dublin District Family Court in Dolphin House remains open and applications for legal aid for domestic violence cases can be made there. While the Board\u2019s law centres are largely closed to personal callers, each centre is contactable by phone or by email. Contact details are available on the Board\u2019s website. Applications for legal aid can also be made using the Board\u2019s on-line applications facility. If a person experiences difficulty in getting in touch with the Board\u2019s office in Dolphin House or a law centre she or he can contact the Board\u2019s Legal and Mediation Information Helpline \u2013 details on www.legalaidboard.ie\n (which also contains other information that may be of use). Subject to a person meeting the financial eligibility criteria, an applicant can be advised on her or his position and assisted in making an application for a domestic violence order. An eligible applicant can also be represented in court in an application to take or defend an order.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Probation Service in its management of offenders is emphasising the risks of the current situation and the need for people to understand and manage their own triggers. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The risk assessment criteria applied by the Irish Prison Service in deciding temporary releases take account of convictions relating to domestic abuse, breach of barring orders etc.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Courts Service is continuing to give priority to domestic violence. Each district will continue to have a court open to hear applications for protection, interim barring orders and emergency barring orders. Court offices are open for essential business by appointment only. Domestic violence applicants will be facilitated. Offices are contactable by telephone or email with contact details available on the website. Out-of-hours procedures are continuing as normal and learning from this has informed contingency planning. A list of experienced Court Registrars available to travel to attend Courts where and when required has been compiled. A step-by-step guide for Court Registrars with domestic violence procedures and forms is available on the Courts Service intranet for all staff, supported by a basic registrar training programme which will allow for rapid upskilling in the event of significant staff shortages.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In order to ensure victims are aware of the services, the Minister for Justice has also launched a public awareness campaign, building on the existing \u2018What Would You Do\u2019 campaign against domestic violence which ran from 2016-2018. The powerful ads, which feature examples of domestic violence occurring in the context of the public health restrictions, will run for a number of weeks. One of the radio ad depicts a mother trying to reassure her child that their effort to hide from their abuser is just a game of \u2018Hide and Seek\u2019 while the TV ad features a woman\u2019s attempt to keep in contact with her friends through Zoom being interrupted by her abusive partner.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This campaign has been coordinated with relevant NGOs so they can communicate the message to their networks and be available to talk to TV and radio programmes. Further information is also available on the Department\u2019s new website for the campaign, www.stillhere.ie\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            COVID-19 Related Oireachtas Queries\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        A new COVID-19 related queries system for TDs was introduced on the 7th April by the Oireachtas Business Committee.

Your family is defined as your spouse and your children who are under 21 years of age (or older if they are dependent on you) and their spouses, as well as your parents and your parents-in-law, if they are dependent on you.

An independent Chair and membership of the NIMC will be appointed in the coming weeks.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The refreshed national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision \u2013 a Mental Health Policy for Everyone 2020-2030, was published in June 2020.\n The policy sets out a progressive shift in mental health service delivery from volume of supports provided to outcomes achieved for people using the services. Sharing the Vision will build on the achievements of A Vision for Change, with a focus on cross sectoral and inter- departmental commitments to improving the mental health outcomes of Ireland\u2019s population, across the lifecycle. The policy seeks to enhance mental health services across a continuum of supports, from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist services, aiming to place the needs of the individual at the centre of service delivery. Establishment of the NIMC is an essential first step to oversee implementation and to monitor the recommendations in Sharing the Vision.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly TD, said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"Mental health is a priority for this government, especially in these uncertain and stressful times. The establishment of the NIMC is a significant milestone on our journey to change the landscape of our mental health services.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister for Mental Health and Older People, Mary Butler TD said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"As we continue to live with COVID-19, the successful implementation of Sharing the Vision is critical in providing a framework to enhance our mental health system and enable our mental health sector to rise to the challenges we face now and those that are to come. To that end, today on World Mental Health Day, I am delighted to establish the NIMC, as it will be crucial to maintaining momentum throughout the 10-year lifetime of the policy.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition to the establishment of the NIMC, Minister Butler is also launching a mental health support leaflet for young people today, the result of a collaboration between the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills, with assistance from the HSE.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This leaflet will signpost and provide details of a number of HSE funded national organisations that provide various mental health supports and services to young people and their parents around the country. The leaflet will be circulated to 4,000 schools and will be available online to download for those working with young people. Details of these services and more are also available on www.yourmentalhealth.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister Butler said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"There are many organisations that do a fantastic job around the country helping young people with their mental health. We are living in a time of unprecedented worry and anxiety in Ireland and I want to make sure that information is available for young people. I am hopeful that many will find the help they need when they need it and that this additional information source will be of assistance.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister for Education, Norma Foley TD, said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"The promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health for all of our children and young people is a whole-of-government issue and this is more important than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools play a key role here by providing supportive and protective relationships, fostering a sense of belonging and connectedness and supporting the development of adaptive skills. We know, however, that some students may need additional support and therefore I am pleased that this mental health support leaflet is being made available to school communities.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ENDS\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Notes\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The purpose of the National Implementation and Monitoring Committee structure (NIMC) will be to drive reconfiguration of our mental health services, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on the commitments set out in the policy.

It is available to employees who lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020 as a direct consequence of COVID-19. It is also available to self-employed people whose income from self-employment ceased or reduced as a direct consequence of the pandemic to the extent that they would be available to take up full-time employment. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment replaced the Pandemic Unemployment Payment that was introduced on 16 March 2020 in response to the global health emergency. To enable the Pandemic Unemployment Payment to be made quickly and regularly to the large number of people and households affected by the unprecedented downturn in economic activity as a consequence of the pandemic, the department relied on section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005\n as amended, which provides for payment of Supplementary Welfare Allowance in an urgent case, as the legal basis for the payment. Further information on the pandemic unemployment payments made under section 202 in the period from 13 March to 4 August 2020 is available here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Social Welfare (COVID-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 (No. 12 of 2020)\n, which was signed into law on 5 August 2020, put the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment on a discrete statutory footing as a social welfare benefit in its own right. Except where otherwise stated, these guidelines refer to the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment that was introduced on 5 August 2020.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Legislation\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is provided for by section 11 of the Social Welfare (COVID-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 (No. 12 of 2020) which inserts Chapter 12B in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as amended.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 6 of the Social Welfare Act 2020 (No. 30 of 2020)\n provides that self-employed people in receipt of the COVI-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment can engage in limited self-employment and earn up to \u20ac960 over a rolling eight-week period and continue to maintain entitlement to the payment. The Social Welfare Act 2020 also provides that where a person in receipt of the COVID-19  Pandemic Unemployment Payment dies, the payment may continue for a period of 6 weeks after death in certain circumstances.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        SI 370 of 2020\n specifies the way in which average reckonable weekly income is calculated and sets out the rates of payment from 17 September 2020. SI 572 of 2020\n makes changes to the way in which reckonable earnings for employed contributors are calculated from 2 October 2020 and puts in place an additional payment band for people whose average weekly earnings were \u20ac400 or more from 16 October 2020. SI 573 of 2020\n specifies the social welfare payments which can be paid concurrently with the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and also specifies the prescribed time for making a claim for the payment, the circumstances in which late claims will be accepted and the process where a person\u2019s claim is not approved or where payment is made at less than the maximum rate. SI 574\n sets out the circumstances in which people will be regarded as genuinely seeking work for the purposes of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Administration\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is administered by the Department of Social Protection.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Pandemic Unemployment Payments Section is responsible for the operation of the scheme.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Jobseeker\u2019s and Farm Assist Policy is responsible for policy management in relation to the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Information\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Information on the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is available here\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            PART 2: QUALIFYING CONDITIONS\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Qualifying Conditions in Summary\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        To qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment in a given week, a person must meet the following conditions:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tThey must be aged 18 years or over and be under 66 years of age (i.e. under pensionable age);\n\tIf they are an employee, they must have lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020 as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\tIf they are self-employed, they must be able to demonstrate that their reckonable income or reckonable emoluments ceased or were reduced on or after 13 March 2020 as a direct consequence of COVID-19 to the extent that they would be available to take up full-time employment;\n\tThey must satisfy the contribution conditions for the payment; and\n\n\tThey must be capable of work and be genuinely seeking work.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition, in the relevant week, they must not\n be:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tA person who is in insurable employment; \n\tAn employee whose employer is in receipt of the COVID-19 Employer Refund Scheme\n or the Temporary Wage Subsidy\n; \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        or\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tA person who is in receipt of a COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment paid by way of Supplementary Welfare Allowance\nunder section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as amended.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Note: People who were in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment paid by way of Supplementary Welfare Allowance immediately before 5 August 2020 will be paid the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, provided that they meet the qualifying conditions set out above.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Qualifying Conditions in Detail\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Aged 18 years or over and under pensionable age\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        To qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, a person must be aged between 18 and under 66 years of age (i.e. under pensionable age).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        People aged under 18 are not eligible for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        People aged 66 years of age and over are not eligible for the payment. Where a person is in receipt of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment turns 66, their entitlement to the payment ceases. People can apply for a state pension on reaching 66 years of age (i.e. pensionable age).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Employees\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        To qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, an employee must:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tHave been an employed contributor in the week immediately before they ceased to earn an income from the employment concerned; and\n\n\tHave lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020 as a direct consequence of COVID-19.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Employed contributor\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, an employee must have been an employed contributor in the week immediately before they ceased to earn an income from their employment.  An employed contributor means a person who is insurable employment. See also separate guidelines on Scope \u2013 Insurability of Employment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Employees who were not in insurable employment (e.g. people who were employed by their spouse or by a prescribed relative) are not eligible for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In general, employees would be expected to have a recent contribution record on the department\u2019s IT systems. However, payslips may be accepted as evidence that the person is an employed contributor where the Deciding Officer is reasonably satisfied that the payslip is genuine. These cases may be referred to a Social Welfare Inspector for follow-up action to ensure that the person\u2019s social insurance record is in order. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Note: Employees who are due to return to work after sick leave, maternity leave or other statutory leave but cannot do so as a direct consequence of COVID-19 are treated as if they were employed contributors who meet the contribution conditions for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. The date on which the employee\u2019s sick leave, maternity leave or other statutory leave ends should be treated as the date on which they lost their employment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On or after 13 March\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, a person must have been in insurable employment in the week immediately before they ceased to earn an income from their employment and they must have lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020 (as a direct consequence of COVID-19). \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Pandemic Unemployment Payment is therefore open to people who were employed contributors in the week immediately before 13 March 2020. People whose insurable employment ceased before that week are not entitled to the payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The person must have lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020. However, there is no requirement that the person must have been in employment before 13 March 2020. People who take up employment after 13 March 2020 and subsequently lose their employment are entitled to the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment provided that they meet the other eligibility conditions for the payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Lost employment as a direct consequence of COVID-19\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To be eligible for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, an employee must have lost their employment as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \u201cdirect consequences\u201d of the pandemic should be interpreted broadly to include:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tThe adverse effects of COVID-19 on their employer\u2019s business (e.g. reduced demand, supply chain issues);\n\tThe adverse effects of measures required to be taken by their employer to comply with \u2013 or as a consequence of \u2013 Government policy to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of COVID-19 (e.g. restrictions on pubs, restaurants and the entertainment sector, reduced footfall due to requirements of social distancing).\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For example, where an employee is instructed by their employer not to attend work because they are a \u201cclose contact\u201d of someone who may test positive for COVID-19, the employee can be regarded as having lost their employment \u201cas a direct consequence of COVID-19\u201d. They are therefore entitled to the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment provided they meet the other conditions for eligibility. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Similarly, where schools and childcare facilities are closed due to public health restrictions, people who are unable to make alternative arrangements and have to take time off work to care for children can be treated as having lost their employment as a direct consequence of the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, people who have not lost their employment as a result of the current health emergency \u2013 for example, people entering the labour market for the first time, recently released prisoners \u2013 are not eligible for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. Similarly, unemployed seasonal workers and other unemployed people who have not been able to take up work due to the pandemic are not entitled to the payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is not payable where an employee has lost their job because of their own misconduct or where they have left their job voluntarily. A person cannot choose to leave their employment in order to claim the payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment payment is not available to people who voluntarily leave their employment because they are concerned that they might catch the virus from colleagues or because they reside with people who are elderly or vulnerable. (People in these circumstances may qualify for other social welfare payments.)\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        People who refuse an offer to return to their employment and people who refuse an offer of suitable employment with another employer are not eligible for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. Similarly, people who fail or neglect to avail themselves of any reasonable opportunity of obtaining suitable employment are not eligible for the payment.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        People who fail or neglect to avail themselves of an offer of support from the department to enable them to improve their prospects of obtaining employment are not eligible for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Self-employed \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        To qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, a self-employed person must:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tHave been in insurable self-employment in the week immediately before the start of their claim;\n\tBe able to demonstrate that their reckonable income or reckonable emoluments from self-employment ceased or reduced on or after 13 March 2020 as a direct consequence of COVID-19 to the extent that they would be available to take up full-time employment.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \u201cReckonable income\u201d means, in effect, the net profit declared by self-employed people under the self-assessment system. \u201cReckonable emoluments\u201d typically refer to the salary a company director might take from their company. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In insurable self-employment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To be eligible for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, a self-employed person must have been in insurable self-employment in the week immediately before the start of their claim. Where a person\u2019s insurable self-employment cannot be established from their contribution history, the following may be accepted as evidence of insurable self-employment:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tA Notice of Assessment provided by the person;\n\tEvidence that the person has registered as self-employed with Revenue;\n\tEvidence of registration with the Companies Registration Office;\n\tA set of accounts provided by the person.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where a person is in receipt of Back to Work Enterprise Allowance\n or Short-Term Enterprise Allowance,\n they are accepted as being in insurable self-employment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        On or after 13 March\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, a self-employed person must have been in insurable self-employment in the week immediately before the start of their claim and their reckonable income or reckonable emoluments from self-employment must have ceased or reduced on or after 13 March 2020 (as a consequence of COVID-19).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is therefore open to people who were in insurable self-employment in the week immediately before 13 March 2020. People whose insurable self-employment ceased before that time are not eligible for the payment. However, they may be entitled to jobseeker\u2019s benefit (self-employed).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Income from self-employment ceased or reduced as a direct consequence of COVID-19\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To be eligible for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, a self-employed person must be able to show that their reckonable income or emoluments ceased or reduced as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \u201cdirect consequences\u201d of COVID-19 should be interpreted broadly to include:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tThe adverse effects of COVID-19 on the person\u2019s self-employment (e.g. reduced demand, supply chain issues);\n\tThe adverse effects of measures required to be taken by the self-employed person to comply with \u2013 or as a consequence of \u2013 Government policy to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of COVID-19 (e.g. restrictions on pubs, restaurants and the entertainment sector, reduced footfall due to requirements of social distancing).\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Income from self-employment ceased, or reduced, to the extent that the person would be available to take up full-time employment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, a self-employed person\u2019s income from self-employment must have ceased, or reduced, to the extent that the person would be available to take up full-time employment. Typically, this will mean that the person has no current trading income from their business (though they may be able to take drawings from it). A self-employed person must be able to demonstrate that their income has ceased or reduced since the onset of the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        People who are self-employed do not need to have permanently ceased their trade or profession to be eligible for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. They may, for example, engage in once-off, sporadic or emergency work. However, they must \u2013 at least for the time being \u2013 be available to take up other full-time employment if it were offered to them. Self-employed people who would not be available to take up full-time employment are not eligible for the payment. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Self-employed people may earn up to \u20ac960 gross over an eight-week period and still retain their full COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. The \u20ac960 limit is based on gross income (before tax and PRSI) less expenses.

The highest average earnings figure from the three reference periods is used to determine an employee\u2019s weekly rate of payment.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where an employee commenced employment on or after 1 October 2020 (and has no previous earnings in any of the three reference periods), their earnings cannot be used to calculate their weekly rate of payment. They are therefore paid at the basic rate of \u20ac203 per week.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where a person was in receipt of a \u201ccasual\u201d jobseeker\u2019s payment immediately before claiming the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, they are paid at the maximum rate.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Note: Weeks for which an employer received the temporary wage subsidy for a person should not be counted when calculating the number of weeks for which the person had reckonable earnings.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Note: The January-September reference period for the calculation of employee earnings was introduced with effect from 2 October 2020. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Self-employed\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For self-employed contributors, average reckonable weekly income is calculated on the basis of their  reckonable income or reckonable emoluments for the 2018 income tax year divided by 52 (i.e. the number of contribution weeks in the period) or\n their reckonable income or reckonable emoluments for the 2019 income tax year divided by 52, whichever is greater. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A self-employed person\u2019s reckonable weekly income is assessed on the basis of income and emoluments that have been notified to Revenue and have been subject to PRSI.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A self-employed person\u2019s average weekly income can be determined based on their contribution history, which is available on the department\u2019s IT systems, or on the basis of a Notice of Assessment provided by the person. Where a person\u2019s self-employment is established on the basis of other evidence \u2013 e.g. evidence of registration as self-employed with Revenue, a set of accounts provided by the customer \u2013 the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is paid at the basic rate of \u20ac203 per week. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where the evidence of self-employment only relates to 2020, the \u20ac203 rate is also applicable, regardless of when in 2020 that income was earned or of how much was earned.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where a person is in receipt of Back to Work Enterprise Allowance or Short-term Enterprise Allowance, the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is paid at a rate of \u20ac203 per week.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Income from both employment and self-employment in 2019\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where a person\u2019s reckonable weekly income in the 2019 income tax year includes both income from employment and income from self-employment, their reckonable weekly income is calculated as the sum of their income from employment and self-employment, divided by the number of contribution weeks in the income tax year (i.e. 52).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Note: Reckonable weekly income is assessed based on earnings, income and emoluments that have been notified to Revenue and have been subject to PRSI.

But in that time the WRC, working with its stakeholders, and using the IT platforms now familiar to everyone, successfully re-shaped its adjudication service to a position where it is now scheduling hearings at a level that is over a third higher than were scheduled before COVID-19, provided an uninterrupted information service, continued to mediate and conciliate disputes, monitored and enforced compliance with employment standards and assisted in the safe opening of work for staff and public generally.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Mr. Kelly concluded by saying the difficulties presented are undiminished but thanked the Minister, the department and the WRC stakeholders for their support over the period.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The report outlines the response of the WRC in continuing to deliver its services whilst observing public health guidelines and travel restrictions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            WRC Information and Customer Services Unit:\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Operating remotely, the WRC\u2019s information line dealt with 53,000 calls in 2020.

Very early in the pandemic, the Adjudication service carried out an extensive consultation process with stakeholders as to how a remote approach could be delivered securely and consistent with fair procedures and constitutional justice, and following this consultation, rolled out incrementally a new service delivery model, which comprised a mix of written procedures, virtual and face-to-face hearings. Similarly, conciliation and mediation were provided, primarily remotely over a variety of platforms, but also in-person as circumstances allowed.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Report also states that:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \ta new Mid-West regional office was opened in Ennis, Co.

It is to the credit of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na that a consistent theme identified in this engagement is a desire that the current focus on community policing is maintained after we emerge from this pandemic.

Similar advice is in place in very many countries around the world.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We have to remember that the public health advice is there to save lives and protect people. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thousands of lives have already been saved as a result of the Irish people observing public health guidelines on social distancing, personal hygiene, and restricting their movements. We can continue to save lives by following the advice.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Secondly, implementation of the Roadmap follows a risk-based approach. Any changes to the current restrictive social distancing measures must be slow and incremental. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This approach is essential, as going too far could also result in a sudden surge in infections. We need to know how we are getting on, phase by phase. That is why the phases are separated by 3 weeks \u2013 so we can assess the impact on the virus of each set of measures.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The government continues to make regular assessments of the existing restrictions. It also looks at the economic and social implications of the continued restrictions. However, they will remain in place for as long as they are needed to save more lives.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The government has also been working closely with employer and trade union representatives through the Labour Employer Economic Forum on a shared approach to a gradual re-starting of economic activity in a safe and measured way.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The approach to reducing measures will evolve as more information becomes available and in line with international learning and experience, in particular from countries ahead of Ireland in terms of their outbreak, to assess closely the effectiveness of their approaches to easing restrictions. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, the advice for now is that social distancing guidelines continue to recommend a two-metre distance.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Retail - appointments Store Trading Guidelines\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are aware of recent queries on whether selling by appointment is allowed for product categories not included in the list of essential retailers under Phase 1 of the Roadmap.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        At the moment, the overriding objective is for people to stay at home except for essential purposes.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Appointments to shop for homewares, furniture and other non-essential items are not part of the Phase 1.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The focus should remain on online ordering and delivery for those not opened in Phase 1.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Taxation\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        We would like to clarify the situation regarding the PUP and Taxation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Generally speaking, most income is liable to tax.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The amount of tax an individual pays depends on the amount of income they earn, on their personal circumstances and the tax credits they are entitled to.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the main, payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) are taxable sources of income unless they are specifically exempt from tax.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        They are subject to Income Tax (IT) but not Universal Social Charge (USC) or Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a taxable source of income.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Depending on an individual\u2019s overall income during a year, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment may affect their overall tax liability for the year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The payment is not taxable at the time of receipt from DEASP, however, the individual will be liable for tax on the PUP amount received at the end of the year when Revenue automatically reviews their tax position.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        When an end of the year review takes place for a PAYE taxpayer, it may be the case that they have unused tax credits that will cover any tax owing that may arise.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Where a PAYE taxpayer owes tax, it is normal Revenue practice to collect any tax owing in manageable amounts by reducing tax credits for a future year or years in order to minimise any hardship. Additionally, if an individual has any additional tax credits to claim, for example health expenses, this will also reduce any tax that may be owing.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Finally\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Today is Africa Day with celebrations this year taking place online. This year Irish Aid has teamed up with local authorities and community groups across Ireland to celebrate the links between Ireland and Africa. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Keep an eye on Twitter @AfricaDay, on Facebook at facebook.com\/africadayireland\n and on Instagram @africadayireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Details about more Africa Day activities will be announced on the Africa Day website at africaday.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","c52496ba58e8ea6c7a1982e6f7cdc971d0a16b5bff0bfa93402152eddd5401b1":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        \tcustoms is a recognised priority for most companies\n\n\thowever, more than 40% yet to decide how to pay customs charges\n\n\tmore than 30% yet to decide who will manage customs procedures\n\n\tcompanies urged to address key customs issues now\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        With just 35 days to Brexit, new survey results released by Enterprise Ireland raise concerns over customs readiness ahead of Brexit.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A survey by IHS Markit of 600 companies on the PMI panel in Ireland, along with analysis of companies which have completed Enterprise Ireland\u2019s Brexit Readiness Checker, reveals a worrying lack of customs preparedness of Irish companies.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The survey of 600 companies demonstrated that, while more than half (52%) of companies view customs and logistics as a priority, only 42% feel they are significantly or fully ready. Of the 600 companies surveyed 22% were still figuring out what they need to do in relation to top priority issues.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As the 1 January deadline fast approaches Enterprise Ireland, in conjunction with the Local Enterprise Network, is holding a series of five regional webinars for all business commencing 7 December next (details below).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition to the IHS Markit data, analysis of companies who have completed the Brexit Readiness Checker reveals specific evidence of this lack of preparation business:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \t50% have yet to decide who will manage all documentation and procedures when their goods arrive in the UK (excluding Northern Ireland)\n\tmore than 30% yet to decide if customs procedures will be managed in-house or through a broker\/intermediary\n\t44% have not decided how they will pay customs charges\n\tmore than 50% have yet to determine the potential tariff of their goods\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Responding to the analysis, T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Leo Varadkar, TD said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"This year has been devastating for many business owners. It would be understandable if Brexit was the last thing on their minds. However, Britain leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year will bring major changes. There is a real risk of delays and loss of income, which would be really damaging for any business. We are appealing to businesses to get ready now. There is a lot of help available. A good first step is to use our Brexit Readiness Checker, which will show you exactly what you need to do for your own business. I know there has been a huge amount to contend with this year already, but I really urge businesses to prioritise getting ready now and use the help that is there. There are 35 days left until the end of the year and time is of the essence.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister of State with responsibility for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, Robert Troy, TD, urged businesses to get \u2018Brexit-ready\u2019 and to revisit their Brexit plans.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        He said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"I know that this comes at a time of ongoing and extreme pressure on businesses as they work through the current pandemic and may not be trading as they normally would have. The government stands with business, ready to assist in managing the coming change. I am very concerned by recent reports from Revenue that there are significant numbers of business who trade with UK but have not yet registered for an EORI number, the first basic step needed to trade with the UK. Businesses need to devote time to take this first step and to decide how to manage their customs overheads from 1 January. If they don\u2019t, they will simply be unable to transact business with the UK. There are supports available to help businesses with customs which I urge them to explore, such as Enterprise Ireland\u2019s \u2018Ready for Customs\u2019 grant which provides up to \u20ac9,000 per employee engaged in customs work. I strongly encourage businesses to learn about the options available to them and to consider availing of them.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Damien English TD also urged businesses to act, saying:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"Brexit will become real for many Irish businesses who trade into and out of the UK from 1 January 2021. While many have finalised their customs preparedness plans there is still time for businesses to determine if there have any vulnerabilities due to Brexit on this aspect of their trading activity. As we approach the last month of the transition period I urge businesses to ensure they are customs compliant and if necessary to engage with their supply chain to seek the assurances they need to ensure a continuity of supply of goods for their operations and their customers. I would also urge businesses to register and log on for the regional Brexit webinars that Enterprise Ireland are running from 7 December. These will highlight the vital areas where business needs to take action and signpost how companies can take action now to avoid disruption on 1 January.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Giles O\u2019Neill, Manager of Enterprise Ireland\u2019s Brexit Unit, stated:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"The Enterprise Ireland online Brexit Readiness Checker outlines the areas where preparation is vital and provides information and resources on how to take action. The key questions companies need to address now to be ready for customs include:\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \thave you secured your EORI number?\n\thave you determined the commodity code for your products?\n\thave you identified who will manage customs procedures and paperwork \u2013 will it be in-house or through a broker\/intermediary?\n\thave you determined who will have responsibility for all documentation and processing your goods moving to, from or through Britain?\n\thave you the trained personnel in place to manage your customs processes and have you applied for the Ready for Customs grant to support these staff?\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Giles O\u2019Neill emphasised the degree of urgency about customs readiness:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"The results of this analysis are concerning. Irrespective of the result of EU\/UK negotiations, customs procedures will be a reality for Irish exporters from 1 January. This means that any Irish company moving goods to, from or through the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) will have to complete customs procedures. Even if they use a customs intermediary there are important aspects of the customs process they will be responsible for and need to have trained staff in place.

State aid rules have been extended to cover the CAP transitional period, which will be up to the end of 2022.\n\tThe EU Green Deal, which includes measures to tackle soil and water pollution, and a new EU forest strategy.\n\tThe development of a new Forestry Programme which will seek to position forestry as a complimentary farm enterprise, aligned with other agricultural schemes and activities and with the principle of sustainable forest management at its core.\n\tThe Climate Action Plan 2019 and the Climate Bill currently going through the Oireachtas.\n\tThe Programme for Government commitments on forestry, including the development of a new strategy to expand afforestation and the undertaking of a land-use review.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The main priority is to increase afforestation in a sustainable manner, as it is only through this that the many benefits of forests can be achieved, but it is also clear that reaching the 8000ha per year target set out in the Government\u2019s Climate Action Plan is going to be a major challenge. Farmers have disengaged from the forestry programme schemes for a variety of reasons e.g. bad publicity on forestry, good prices for leasing land, land tied up in GLAS. The challenge now is to get farmers interested and get their participation levels up again, which have slipped from 96% in 2014 to 30% currently.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There is already widespread awareness among society at large of the many goods and services that forests provide. In addition to providing timber products they act as a carbon sink, prevent soil erosion and flooding and provide recreational spaces. However, in recent years, forestry as a land-use in this country has become increasingly divisive, with arguments sometimes fuelled by misinformation or misunderstandings. It is therefore crucial to ensure that forestry policy is informed by facts and science, communicated  effectively through  co-ordinated and targeted campaigns.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Outline of Call for Proposals\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In order to encourage farmers and other land owners to plant and to raise the profile of forestry as a public good and a commercially viable enterprise,  the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (\u2018DAFM\u2019) is inviting applications for funding for projects which support and highlight forestry under the four following themes:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        1)\tSupport and highlight the environmental benefits of woodlands.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        2)\tSupport and highlight the benefits of woodlands, focussing on farmers, and\/or community engagement and\/or general wellness\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3)\tSupport and highlight productive forestry and timber products, in the context of climate action and the bioeconomy.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        4)\tSupport and highlight sustainable forest management among forest owners (targeted at organisations already active in this area with established programmes in operation).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This competitive process is open to all. Please note however that applications under theme 4 are confined to groups or organisations already active in the area, with an established track record.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Terms and Conditions of the Call for Proposals competitive process\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.1.\tAll applications will be evaluated with reference to the marking scheme outlined in the application form. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.2.\tApplications will also be assessed in relation to the degree of collaboration with other organisations and we would encourage groups to work together in the design and delivery of their proposals. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.3.\tAs the budget is necessarily limited, applicants are advised to keep expenditure to a minimum. Where possible, large projects should be split into two or more smaller projects, as part of a project may qualify for funding while the full project may not, due to budget limitations or duplication\/overlap with other projects. Part-funding may also be considered.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.4.\tDelivery of the proposed actions and materials should fall within the period June 2021 \u2013 December 2022. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.5.\tAspects of projects that have a \u201clife\u201d after the proposed event and will still be useful at a later stage should be highlighted e.g. educational tools and other media or material assets. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.6.\tAssets funded under this call for proposals will be owned by the Department and may be made available to other entities within the Sector. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.7.\tProposals must not replace actions that are currently taking place without State funding or can be considered part of normal business practice e.g. advertising, attendance at agricultural shows or other marketing actions. Actions must have the potential to benefit the sector as a whole and must be additional to what is already being undertaken. Any project results must be made available to the public.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.8.\tProposals will only be supported where these actions would only have been undertaken with funding from the Department (the incentive effect). Other State aid rules may apply in the case of large companies. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.9.\tAll grant funding will be subject to the conditions set out in Circular 13\/2014 (Appendix 2) issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) in relation to the provision of grant funding to all bodies.  This means that all grants or grant installments will be paid on the basis of vouched expenditure only.  No advance payment of grants or installments will be possible and applicants must take this into account in proposing projects for funding. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.10.\tThe extent to which proposals will be funded will depend on the budget available at a given time. Not all proposals that have been submitted, evaluated or have exceeded the minimum threshold of 60 marks will be funded. Confirmation of funding will be formally notified in writing.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.11.\tMore than one proposal per applicant can be submitted but the same proposal can only be submitted under one theme.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.12.\tProposals should remain valid throughout the extended period of the 2014-2020 Forestry Programme, i.e. 2021 and 2022. Proposals for funding may cover either 2021 or 2022 or both. Funding may be allocated for either year, depending on budget availability.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        3.13.\tAn Evaluation Plan is to be submitted with each project at application stage, clearly setting out the intended inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts of the project. An updated evaluation of the outputs of the successful projects, with performance indicators where possible, will be required with each request to draw down payment, together with an assessment of the likely projected outcomes and impacts arising from the project in the long term. However, the project evaluations will not affect the provision of funding and are for information purposes only, to inform future campaigns and strategy development.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Themes for Proposals\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Theme 1 - Support and highlight the environmental benefits of woodlands.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This theme has been included to encourage individuals or groups with a specific interest in the environmental role of forestry, to submit proposals which raise awareness of the value of woodlands  and the many ways in which trees and forests contribute to achieving our environmental goals.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Proposals submitted should convey a strong message that Ireland\u2019s trees and woodlands provide a wide range of environmental resources and services which benefit society as a whole. Proposals should focus on the role played by the forest resource in climate change mitigation, biodiversity and water quality. Within this theme, the Department recognises that there are many different opinions about forestry among the various interest groups and we would particularly welcome proposals which seek to inform and unite opinion in relation to how forestry can contribute to enhanced environmental benefits. The target audience for successful projects under this theme should therefore be all sectors of society as the environmental benefits of woodlands are shared and valued equally by all.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Theme 2 - Support and highlight the benefits of woodlands, focussing on farmers, and\/or community engagement and\/or general wellness\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The target audience under this heading includes the general public, schools, community groups, land-owners and farmers and is particularly aimed at encouraging tree planting. Proposals under this theme should highlight the extent of consultation and engagement with these groups and could include the development and distribution of promotional material, photographs and videos, social media campaigns, information packs, surveys, quizzes, competitions, art\/illustration\/animation, on-line publications and activities such as webinars and the promotion of forestry as a career opportunity. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Proposals should focus on the cultural heritage of Ireland\u2019s forest resource, the contribution that trees make to our landscape as well as the recreational and health benefits that woodlands provide.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Theme 3 - Support and highlight productive forestry and timber products, in the context of climate action and the bioeconomy.  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This theme targets landowners, both farmers and non farmers, users of wood and harvested wood products, architects and builder\u2019s providers. It seeks to encourage greater use of wood, participation in sustainable forest management of existing forests, and increased afforestation, particularly among those who have not yet planted. Projects marketing the climate benefits of using wood can be aimed at a wider audience also, to highlight the importance of sustainable forest management for the whole of society, as a source of timber and timber products and as part of the national effort to tackle climate change through increased carbon sequestration and carbon storage. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Proposals submitted under this heading could include measures that focus on the economic benefit of forestry for farmers, the role played in diversifying farm income, the associated tax benefits and the fact that forestry can work alongside the existing farm enterprise.  Other possible topics could include the benefits of forestry for rural communities through the economic activity of associated businesses such as contractors, saw mills and manufacturers of timber products. In this Call we are particularly looking for projects which promote the role of timber in the bioeconomy and in displacing other materials, such as concrete and steel in construction, to help lower our carbon footprint.  Trees sequester and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, both the trees and the soil act as an important carbon store while the use of timber in buildings also locks up carbon. Using sustainably produced biomass instead of non-renewable fossil fuels leads to significant carbon savings on emissions. Actions that promote the establishment and conservation of native woodlands and the promotion of agro forestry could also come in under this theme. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Theme 4 - Support and highlight sustainable forest management among forest owners (targeted at  organisations already active in this area with established programmes in operation).\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Groups and representative organisations who operate in the area of sustainable forest management, forest certification or who are engaged in raising awareness of best practice in afforestation and felling processes may apply for funding under this theme.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Actions can include information transfer projects such as publications, award schemes, newsletters, field trips, site visits, seminars, website development and other educational actions that benefit existing forest owners and timber end users.  Projects targeting the use of wood energy and biomass can be submitted under this heading also. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Project Assessment and Selection Process\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The marking scheme to be used to evaluate and rank the submissions will be as follows:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \tCriteria\tTotals marks available\n\tQuality and experience of individuals who will deliver proposals; A wide range of skill-sets to deliver on actions will receive additional marks.  For theme 4 applications only\n, the track record of the organisation in delivering similar activities in the previous three years will form part of the assessment.\t\t25\n\tThe extent to which the applicants seek to co-ordinate actions with other groups and other initiatives to create a wider impact including networking, formal engagement with other groups and creation of synergies and partnerships.\t\t25\n\tQuality and relevance of actions and projects proposed in terms of addressing the requirements for the theme.\t\t25\n\tValue for money in terms of achieving the objectives for the theme.\t\t25\n\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        5.1\tFollowing the evaluation process, proposals will be ranked, with each proposal being given a \u201cranking number\u201d (1 being the first ranked proposal). Where proposals have received the same marks, the cost of each proposal will be used to decide the final placing, with the lower costing proposal being place ahead of the proposal with a higher cost. Thereafter proposals will be allocated to one of four tables, each table representing one of the four themes; within these tables, proposals will be listed according to their \u201cranking number\u201d.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        5.2\tProposals must achieve a minimum of 60 marks before being considered for funding but all proposals will be ranked. Depending on the available budget not all proposals achieving the minimum number of marks (60 marks) will be funded. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        5.3\tThe formal approval process will begin with approving the top ranked proposal under each theme. At this stage where the budget does not provide for all four proposals, only those projects that can be funded will be selected (according to cost, with lower cost proposals being selected ahead of those with a higher cost, exclusive of VAT).

Our national vaccine programme is well underway. Last week, Ireland reached the milestone of one million vaccines administered. As of last Saturday (10 April), 19.3% of Ireland\u2019s adult population (aged 16+) have had at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The positive impact is already being felt \u2013 for example, the percentage of COVID-19 cases in healthcare workers has been decreasing significantly and is down from 10% of all cases notified at the start of December to less than 2% of cases in the latest 14-day report.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are also seeing good progress in the trajectory of the disease. Case numbers reported on Sunday were the lowest reported since mid-December. This is further proof that our collective efforts continue to make a real difference. The average number of close contacts has held remarkably low and steady over the last month, and this is proving critical to preventing the spread of the virus. At the end of January 2021, the average number of deaths being reported over a seven day period was 49 per day, by the end of March it was 8 deaths per day.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is the result of the extraordinary commitment and social solidarity shown by everyone. We may all have had times when we\u2019ve been thoroughly fed up with the restrictions, but we have really stuck with it. And the benefits are real and tangible.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Our children have now all returned to school after a difficult time of home-schooling and remote learning. I would like to acknowledge the work of our teachers, parents and entire school communities to get to this point. It has not been easy, we know that.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Monday saw the easing of the 5km travel restriction which means that people can now move freely around their county or 20km from home if crossing county boundaries. We have seen people being able to get to the sea, and if they are brave, enough even swim in it\u2026 and many people are getting to explore the beauty spots they missed.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We can now meet one other household outdoors, although not in gardens. We must keep our outdoor meetings as low-risk as possible, with continued social distancing and other safe behaviours. Masks should be worn if in a busy outdoor setting such as a park or playgrounds.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This week also sees the return of residential construction meaning thousands of workers in the sector can get back to sites around the country. From next Monday, we will see a return of elite sport and training for adult inter county National Gaelic Games Leagues, not including minor or under 20 competitions.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All of these relaxations are the result of the hard work we have all put in over the past few months. If we can continue to keep the virus numbers under control, while rolling out the vaccine, we can look forward to further lifting of restrictions over the coming weeks and months. In order to progress, we must continue to stick with the plan and the basics which we know work: - handwashing, cough and sneeze etiquette, staying 2 metres apart, wearing masks in busy places, opting for outdoors over indoors and if you are indoors making sure the space you are in is well ventilated.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Workplaces\/Remote Working\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In particular for the coming weeks, we need to continue to work from home unless carrying out essential work which requires our physical presence. With daily new cases still in the mid-hundreds, there remains a real risk of new outbreaks occurring if large numbers of people return to the workplace.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There is clear evidence that some people are drifting back to the office or the workplace, and new data from the CSO this week shows that more people are moving beyond 10km of their homes.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is important that nobody feels pressure to return to work. Remote working has played a huge part in containing COVID-19. It will be one of the most effective tools as we enter the next stage. We know a lot of people are tired of working from home and are keen to see colleagues again, but we have to stick with this for a few more months. When we go back to the office, we want it to be in a safe and sustainable way.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are just not at that point yet.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Social Gatherings\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        What is quite concerning at this point in the amount of organised social gatherings being reported by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. Over 3,300 fines have been issued to date for people attending or organising house parties. Such gatherings put at risk not only those attending, but everyone they come into contact with after including loved ones, neighbours, colleagues and the local community. This is a small minority of people -so please think twice before organising or attending such events.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Walk In Test Centres\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Testing continues to be another important part of our toolkit when it comes to managing the pandemic. While vaccines are of course very important, testing too plays a role in helping us to recover and to reopen.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        To further curb the spread of COVID-19 in our communities, walk in testing centres have been established in areas where case numbers are high. As part of the HSE\u2019s enhanced COVID-19 testing for local communities, two of the existing static test centres, will now also facilitate COVID-19 tests without requiring an advance appointment for those who are symptom-free on a pilot basis.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        From today, 14 April for one week (9am to 5pm) the static testing centres in St Loman\u2019s Hospital Campus in Mullingar and in the Randal \u00d3g GAA Club in Dunmanway will offer COVID-19 testing to asymptomatic people in these communities.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are five other walk-in\/no appointment necessary temporary COVID-19 testing centres open until 17 April. They are in Finglas, Mulhuddart, Ballyfermot Sports Complex, Crumlin GAA club, Limerick City and Waterford City.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These centres open every day from 11am-7pm for those over the age of 16, who have no symptoms and who haven\u2019t had COVID-19 in the last 6 months. You will only need to provide photo ID and a mobile phone number.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        By the end of last week, we had identified over 600 positive COVID-19 cases through these centres and identified new outbreaks. This has enabled those positive cases take the necessary actions to protect those around them. If you live near one of these centres, please do avail of them. They have been established to keep communities safe.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A list of current centres operating is available on hse.ie.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Updates - Supports\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are currently 49,000 employers registered with Revenue for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. To date, a total of over \u20ac2.7 billion in subsidies has been paid to 48,500 employers. An additional \u20ac453 million in employer PRSI has been forgone due to the reduced rate of PRSI on wages paid which are eligible for EWSS.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Covid Restrictions Support Scheme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition, to date 22,000 businesses have registered for Covid Restrictions Support Scheme with Revenue.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Pandemic Unemployment Payment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This week, the Department of Social Protection has issued weekly payments to over 421,000 people in receipt of Pandemic Unemployment Payment. This payment is valued at \u20ac125.52 million.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Since last week\u2019s payment, some 7,300 people closed their PUP claim, with almost 6,000 of these stating that they were doing so because they are returning to work\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The quickest way to make a claim for PUP or to close a claim is to do so online and to log on here.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Enhanced Illness Benefit Payment\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A reminder again not to forget the Enhanced Illness Benefit Payment is available if you need to self-isolate or restrict your movements. This week, just over 2,000 people under the age of 66 have been medically certified for receipt of this benefit.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Scam Phone Calls and Texts\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department of Social Protection wishes to alert people to scam phone calls and scam mobile phone text messages they may receive.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The latest scam text messages contain a link for the recipient to claim a payment of \u20ac350. The fraudsters rely on the fact that some people may click on the link and then provide their confidential social welfare information. Please do not click on or reply to links which appear suspicious.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In addition, scam phone calls continue to be made claiming to be from an official of the Department of Social Protection and can come from a wide range of phone numbers, one of which is the department's helpline number 1890 800 024.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The department is currently not engaged in contacting customers or members of the public through its helpline number. The number is available for customers to contact the department for assistance. Please do not engage with these calls or share any personal information with the callers.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If you have received such a call from this number please report it to the Garda\u00ed immediately. The Department of Social Protection\u2019s staff will never ask you for your Bank details if they should have reason to call you over the phone.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These are sophisticated scams. We urge you to be extremely cautious if you receive a call or a text message and always ensure that you are using official departmental websites.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Updates \u2013 Education\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Then just a reminder for Out of School Learners in respect of the Leaving Certificate Accredited Grades.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Leaving Certificate 2021 students studying one or more subjects outside of school, must submit evidence in order to receive Accredited Grades.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Students must find a host school or centre to oversee the submission of estimated marks on their behalf. It must be the school or centre where they have arranged to sit the written examinations.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These students are required to complete and return an Initial Information Form to their chosen host school or centre- the deadline has been extended by one week to Thursday 22nd April 2021. This form is available at gov.ie\/leavingcertificate.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        An Accredited Grades aide from the relevant host school or centre will then follow up with students in early May.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            And finally\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Today, as I said, we have many reasons to be hopeful. However, while significant progress is being made in controlling the disease and in rolling out vaccines, we still have a high level of infection, we are dealing with a much more transmissible virus than last year, and the absolute number of people fully protected through vaccination remains low.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This means that the risk that COVID-19 poses is still with us. Ireland could experience a further wave of infection if public health restrictions are eased too quickly or if we don\u2019t stick with the plan. The priority must, for the coming weeks, remain on maintaining control over the disease, as vaccination offers a widespread population level of protection.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thank you again for all your hard work and perseverance to this point. We have a lot done and still some more to do. As I said these few weeks are crucial \u2013 so far, the careful approach is working, we are still on track, which means even brighter days and further easing restrictions won\u2019t be too far away.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We will get there. Stay safe.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thank you.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","ce86449facd36f6b249a9fe1f5fcc1c20dafea18c38eca46914f7a0c66fc0571":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            403,000 receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment this week, a decrease of over 17,600 on last week\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \u20ac119.9 million in PUP weekly payments to be paid into bank accounts today\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Over \u20ac7.3 billion paid in PUP to date\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            14,500 close their PUP account to return to work\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            1,653 people currently in receipt of Enhanced Illness Benefit\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            People returning to work should close their claim on their first day back in work by logging on to www.MyWelfare.ie\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Public warned about Scam Phone Calls and Scam Texts from callers claiming to be from the Department of Social Protection\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        This week, the Department of Social Protection has issued weekly payments valued at \u20ac119.9 million to 403,095 people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The figures published today are in addition to the 183,096 people who were on the Live Register at the end of March.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        All COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payments issued will be in recipients\u2019 bank accounts or at their post office today, Tuesday 27 April.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dublin is the county with the highest number of people who are receiving PUP this week at 131,233.

Most employees are entitled to four weeks\u2019 paid annual leave per leave year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Depending on time worked, employees' holiday entitlements should be calculated by one of the following methods:-\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \t4 working weeks in a leave year in which the employee works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment)\n\t1\/3 of a working week per calendar month that the employee works at least 117 hours\n\t8% of the hours an employee works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks).\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        If more than one of the methods above is applicable, the employee is entitled to whichever method provides the greater entitlement. However the maximum statutory annual leave entitlement of an employee in a leave year is four of their normal working weeks.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The employer determines the timing of an employee\u2019s annual leave, taking into consideration work and personal requirements and should consult them or the relevant union in advance.

These impacts can be enormous.  For example the olive industry, valued at 10\u2019s of millions of Euro, in particular in Italy has been devastated by Xylella fastidiosa , a disease of South American origin, thought to have been brought into Europe on coffee plants from South America.  The risk pathways for entry into Ireland for these quarantine pests and diseases include commercial and private travellers.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine carries out physical checks on all regulated and high risk consignments of commercial products from outside the EU, however it is not physically possible for DAFM to check every piece of hand luggage that comes through the airports and ports.  Therefore, by educating the public of the risks by targeting the commercial importer to the amateur gardener to the window box herb grower, we will generate awareness of the serious issues and hopefully reduce the number of unchecked plants and plant products stowed away in people\u2019s luggage.

I thank Senators McDowell and Mullen for bringing this matter to the attention of the Seanad. The situation in Xinjiang is of great importance, and it deserves attention in Ireland and in the Oireachtas.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Senators are right in highlighting Ireland\u2019s proud history of supporting the protection of human rights across the world. It remains a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy and in my contribution I will set out where Ireland has been active on this particular issue.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The motion notes that freedom of religious belief is enshrined in our constitution.  I know that for many of our citizens, their religious faith is a cornerstone of their lives, and they could not imagine, nor countenance, a situation where this aspect of their lives were impinged by the State. Yet, we have seen reports of just such occurrences in Xinjiang.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Additionally, of course, there are very worrying reports of arbitrary detention, widespread surveillance, forced labour, and even forced sterilisations and birth control in the region.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For many of us in Ireland, the reports from Xinjiang carry unsettling echoes from our own history and it is clear from the level of media reporting and public concern, including here in the Oireachtas, that the situation in Xinjiang has struck a chord and is of increasing concern to the Irish people.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        It is also disappointing that this issue is impacting negatively on what is a positive and growing relationship between Ireland and China. The motion already outlines the level of trade between the two countries; but there is much more to the engagement between us. The 2016 population census found that nearly 20,000 Irish residents identified themselves as being of Chinese ethnicity. In 2018, Tourism Ireland estimated that 100,000 Chinese tourists visited Ireland. In the same year, there were more than 3,500 Chinese students attending third-level education in Ireland. These are real, concrete, person-to-person ties, and they can serve as a foundation from which to address our concerns with China. And we should not forget that in the depths of the COVID-19 crisis earlier this year, China became an important and reliable source of PPE and other essential equipment for Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Our relationship with China has been a positive one and it is a relationship with great potential for Ireland.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Nevertheless, given the parallels with our own history and the centrality of our values, it is unsurprising that the situation in Xinjiang has been viewed with great concern in Ireland. And it is in the nature of Irish people that when we see an issue such as this, we make our feelings known.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        But it is not simply a question of raising our voices in protest. We must make our views known in a manner that has the prospect of improving the situation of the people of Xinjiang. We must also ensure that, in seeking to challenge Chinese policy in Xinjiang, we make it clear that we do not, in any way, seek to undermine Chinese sovereignty. Our motivation is a positive one. We are pro-human rights, not anti-China.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Similarly, this house will recall that China has in recent years faced the threat of Islamic extremism, including the horrendous attack on Kunming railway station, in 2014 where 31 civilians were brutally stabbed to death. So, when the Chinese government states that its actions in Xinjiang are in response to this threat, there is something behind it. However, in recognising the reality of terrorist threats in China, and of the very real need for the Chinese Government to protect their citizens, we must not lose sight of their obligation to respond appropriately, proportionately and in a manner that respects the human rights of the Uyghur people.  The reports we have seen suggest that this is not the case.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The best way to argue for a change in Chinese policy in Xinjiang is to engage with Chinese authorities and convey our position in relation to what we understand to be happening in Xinjiang.  It is also important that we work in cooperation with like-minded states. Along with our EU partners, Ireland has been vocal about highlighting the issue of the deterioration of the human rights situation in Xinjiang. This was most recently raised by EU leaders with the Chinese leadership on 14 September. Ireland fully supports this EU position, and we see the EU as an effective platform for engagement with China on human rights issues.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We must also note the existing engagement Ireland has had at the UN on the issue of Xinjiang. This week, Ireland was one of 39 countries, including 20 from the EU that made a joint statement on Xinjiang in the UN Third Committee. The statement was delivered by Germany, which currently sits alongside China in the Security Council, and expresses grave concern \u201cabout the existence of a large network of \u201cpolitical re-education\u201d camps where credible reports indicate that over a million people have been arbitrarily detained. We have seen an increasing number of reports of gross human rights violations. There are severe restrictions on freedom of religion or belief and the freedoms of movement, association, and expression as well as on Uyghur culture. Widespread surveillance disproportionately continues to target Uyghurs and other minorities and more reports are emerging of forced labour and forced birth control including sterilization.\u201d  The statement calls on China \u201cto allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and her Office.\u201d\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is the latest expression of our concern and builds on previous occasions where Ireland has spoken up on this issue.  In our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 25 September, Ireland reiterated our deep concern regarding the treatment of ethnic Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, and urged China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Prior to this, Ireland was also one of 27 states to issue a Joint Statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 30 June, which also called on the High Commissioner to provide regular information about the situation in the region.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ireland has previously supported a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee in October 2019, and a Joint Letter at the UN Human Rights Council in July 2019, which called for the Chinese Government to urgently implement eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang and to uphold its international obligations and respect human rights in Xinjiang.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We have supported calls for immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers because we believe that such a development would be in the interests of all parties. It would allow us to better understand what is happening in Xinjiang through reporting by neutral and non-partisan observers. The reports from Xinjiang carried by RTE last week were a fair attempt to present unbiased information to the Irish public.  However, it was clear from those reports that Xinjiang is a very difficult location to access information. A more cooperative approach from the Chinese authorities might have helped allay some of our concerns.  In contrast, the closed attitude and clear surveillance of the reporter only served to underline them.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ireland and the many other countries who feel strongly about Xinjiang will continue to raise the matter with China and will seek further opportunities to improve the situation of the Uighurs.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A Cathaoirleach, the motion before the house includes a call for the Government to use all available trade and diplomatic channels to insist on the observance of basic human rights protections for the Uyghur Muslim population.  I believe I have shown that this government is indeed using all available diplomatic channels to advance this issue. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However as members will know, particularly given the recent extensive coverage of Brexit, external trade falls under the EU\u2019s common commercial policy and is an exclusive competence of the European Commission, not Member States. It is not within the Irish Government\u2019s power to prohibit or sanction the importation of goods and services at Member State level. To introduce such measures on an EU-wide basis would require consensus among EU Member States, and I do not believe that the political will for such a policy currently exists.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Additionally, we must be realistic about what trade measures can achieve, even if introduced at an EU level. Accordingly, I must dissociate the government from that element of the motion before us that calls upon the Government to use all available trade channels in this matter.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I believe that continued engagement, constructive but frank, is the best approach to raising our concerns, and effecting real change.  We must build upon the considerable common ground in the growing relationship between Ireland and China as I set out earlier in my contribution.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A Cathaoirleach, a Sheanad\u00f3ir\u00ed, this Government takes the plight of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang seriously, we are concerned, and we regularly express this concern to our Chinese counterparts in both bilateral and multilateral fora. Ireland has a wide-ranging relationship with China, which covers political, economic, cultural, and people-to-people links. We share strong links in a number of areas, but there are nevertheless a number of differences in our relationship. This is one. The protection and promotion of human rights remains a core pillar of Ireland\u2019s foreign policy. In our bilateral relations with China and through our participation in multilateral organisations, Ireland will continue to pursue this matter and seek better protection of their human rights for the Uyghur people.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","dcf5be2176371ab201204418bb1b892ee1d652806a71e72118c979f1e2a9c490":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        The Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael McGrath, TD today (Tuesday), gave a detailed update to Cabinet on the end of March expenditure position, including an update on expenditure performance of Departments against profile and a year on year comparison, and a briefing on the expenditure outlook for the months ahead. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The additional expenditure reporting requirements that Minister McGrath brought to Cabinet recently will come into effect later this month as a number of Ministers bring forward memos on their departmental spending to date, and plans for expenditure over the remainder of the year. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Overall gross voted expenditure by Departments to the end of March 2021 was \u20ac19.5 billion.

This reflects the continued significant expenditure on Covid-19 schemes in the Department of Social Protection such as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In relation to capital expenditure, restrictions on construction activity as a result of Covid-19 will have impacted on infrastructure delivery and related spend and this has resulted in gross voted expenditure being \u20ac120 million or 11.3% below profile and \u20ac264 million (21.9%) below the same period last year.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister McGrath said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"I am determined to push forward on capital plans, and in that regard, completing the review of the National Development Plan in the coming months will be a key priority. Capital investment will help our economy to rebound from the damage of Covid-19. At a new all-time high of \u20ac10.8 billion in 2021, investment in infrastructure will provide stimulus and employment at this important juncture of our economic recovery. \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThe aggregate expenditure to the end of March this year on the EWSS and PUP was nearly \u20ac3 billion. In total, \u20ac12 billion more was spent in the Department of Social Protection in the twelve months to end-March 2021 than over the previous 12 months, reflecting the combined supports to business and incomes of the TWSS, EWSS and PUP. Careful management of public expenditure will help to steer the economy way out of this difficult period, and I want to reassure people once again that there will be no cliff edge to these supports. \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cIn the coming weeks, the government will make and announce decisions about the future of the economic supports for the period post end-June.

The voice of people who use our mental health services, and their families is of paramount importance when developing policies and legislation. While the review of the Act is based on the 2015 Expert Group report, which included a public consultation, and garnered widespread support, I am delighted to be able to give the public another opportunity to share their views.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Speaking on the development of the legislation, Minister Butler added:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"The review of the Act, being led by the Department of Health has been ongoing for the past several years, and since producing a first version of draft heads to amend the Act in July 2019 has carried out extensive engagement with the Mental Health Commission and the HSE. The Act sets out the care and treatment of some of our most vulnerable in society. Furthermore, it is a considerably large and very complex piece of legislation with over 120 sections. It has taken time to ensure that the Act and its review, and the impact of any legislative changes on service users, were properly and fully considered. The review has also had to take account of new and emerging legislation, including the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and any interdependencies or interactions with the 2001 Act. We are preparing legislation that is person centred and which takes a human rights approach to the care and treatment of mental health service users.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Speaking on the future of the review, Minister Butler noted:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"The review of the Act is nearly complete, and this public consultation is the final piece needed to inform the review. Every submission received from the public will be considered by department officials and will help inform the final version of the legislation. The public consultation will run in parallel with a legal review of the general scheme of the bill, an essential component to the legislative process. In effect, no further time will be lost due to this consultation, which will inevitably bring significant value to the review, and the legislation will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas without delay. I expect the review of submissions from the public to be completed in a matter of weeks following the close of the deadline and the legislation to be finalised shortly thereafter. I will then bring the legislation to amend the Mental Health Act to Cabinet for approval and work with my colleagues across the Oireachtas to ensure the timely passing of the bill.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"I committed to ensuring the complete review of the Mental Health Act so that people\u2019s rights are fully protected if and when they access acute inpatient mental health care.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Notes\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Mental Health Act 2001 (the Act) sets out the care and treatment of people who need inpatient mental health care, with a particular focus on procedures for involuntary detention.

The Expert Group\u2019s report was informed by a public consultation, expertise among the group and specific engagement with stakeholders. The report contains 165 recommendations, with the majority related to reform of the Act. A small number of new sections were recommended for inclusion. The government of the day accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations and in a July 2015 decision, called for a general scheme of a bill to be drafted to amend the Mental Health Act, reflecting the recommendations of the report.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Department of Health has been leading on the review of the Mental Health Act. The department has considered in depth the 165 recommendations of the 2015 report, recent Private Members legislation such as the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018, among many others, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the 2018 ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the context of revising the Mental Health Act. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In July 2019, the department sent an initial draft of a general scheme to the Mental Health Commission for their expert opinion. The Commission provided a detailed submission to the department in March 2020. Following a redrafting of the general scheme, the department sought the advice of the HSE, as the main provider of mental health services in the State, in August 2020.

The Minister for Justice has no responsibility for the licensing process for gaming machines. The only function of the Minister is in the setting of stake and prize amounts for such machines.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The 2019 Act does not make any changes to sections 12 and 13 of the 1956 Act concerning the power of Local Authorities to adopt resolutions permitting gaming in their administrative areas. The District Court may issue a certificate authorising the issuance of a licence permitting gaming at an amusement hall or funfair where such a resolution has been adopted. With that certificate, the operator may apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a gaming licence for machines and premises.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 5 amends section 14 of the Principal Act to increase the maximum stake and prize limits for licensed gaming machines from 3 cent to \u20ac5 and 50 cent to \u20ac500, respectively. Those limits had not been updated since 1956.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The revised Section 14 also makes it an offence to accept a stake from a player under the age of 18 years.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 6 amends section 15 of the Principal Act to provide that the District Court, in granting a certificate for licensed gaming machines, may attach conditions limiting the hours of operation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 7 inserts a new section 19A into the Principal Act to provide for a register of gaming licences (in relation to gaming machines under Part III of the 1956 Act) to be maintained by the Revenue Commissioners.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 8 substitutes a new section 26 into the Principal Act and makes it an offence to promote lotteries without having secured a permit or licence. (This is a restatement of the existing law).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Lotteries\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 9 inserts a new section 26A into the Principal Act to provide for lotteries that do not need a permit or licence. These lotteries must be for a charitable or philanthropic purpose only and can have a total prize limit of \u20ac1,000, a maximum ticket price of \u20ac5, and a maximum of 1,500 tickets permitted for sale. These lotteries can only be held once in every 3 months.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 10 inserts a new section 27A into the Principal Act to provide for a lottery held in conjunction with certain events. If the lottery is part of a marketing promotion, for example, a person is given or buys a product and are entered into a draw to win a prize, it does not require a permit or licence. The total value of the prizes allowed is \u20ac2,500. There can be no charge to a participant, other than the price of product if such purchase is required. Nor can there be a charge for redemption of any prize won.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Section 11 inserts a new section 27B into the Principal Act to provide for lotteries (including bingo) promoted under permit. The following new conditions will apply:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \ta modernised system of lottery permits is provided\n\tgreater information is required of the applicant, including the intended beneficiary of the lottery\n\tpermits would be issued by the Garda Superintendent for the relevant district\n\tthe Permit, once issued remains valid for 12 months\n\tthe maximum ticket price is \u20ac10\n\tthe maximum weekly prize fund limit is \u20ac5,000. (This is no change from current law)\n\twhere a lottery prize reaches the \u20ac5,000 maximum for a weekly event (draw\/raffle\/ticket sale\/bingo) it must be held at that amount. (The lottery permit holder is not explicitly prevented from offering some type of bonus not directly related to the prize amount if they so choose)\n\tif the lottery is for a charitable\/philanthropic purpose, a maximum of 5% of the proceeds may be retained by the permit-holder to cover any expenses incurred.

The value of the Irish gambling market annually has been estimated at \u20ac8-10 billion. The industry is large, complex, growing and evolving from a largely land-based manifestation to an online one, increasingly without reference to national boundaries.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Programme for Government commits to establishing \u2018a gambling regulator focused on public safety and wellbeing, covering gambling online and in person, and the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps. This commitment is clearly directed towards the protection of the public and the regulator will have a major role in this regard.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Work on the preparation of comprehensive new gambling legislation is underway in the Department of Justice.

The UN system has been warning clearly of the risk of famine \u2013 that the country is speeding toward it. The World Food Programme tells us there are 350,000 Yemenis on the verge of famine, and as many as five million people in places threatened by famine.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"It is essential that the world responds to provide humanitarian assistance to a people who are facing multiple threats to their wellbeing \u2013 from conflict, disease, flooding, a collapsed economy, and hunger.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In announcing Ireland\u2019s pledge of \u20ac5 million to the UN\u2019s Yemen Humanitarian Fund, the Minister stated:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"Yemen is home to the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. While the search for a political solution continues, we cannot lose time in addressing the devastating consequences of the conflict for the 24 million people in urgent need of assistance.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister Coveney also paid tribute to humanitarian workers in Yemen, recalling the tragic deaths of four staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) at Aden airport in late December. He called for all parties to the conflict to respect international law.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Notes\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The humanitarian crisis in Yemen remains the worst in the world, with more than 20 million people in need of assistance and protection. Years of conflict, economic decline, and institutional collapse have created enormous needs in all sectors. The risk of large-scale famine has never been more acute. At the same time, Yemen continues to grapple with the effects of epidemic disease, notably cholera and COVID-19, forced displacement, and a range of other challenges.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Yemen Humanitarian Fund, managed by the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, allows donors to efficiently contribute to the UN-led humanitarian response to the crisis in Yemen. Nearly 200 aid agencies are working together through the UN\u2019s response plan to provide life-saving assistance to more than 10 million people across the country every month.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        These programmes are saving lives and can prevent famine \u2013 we know because they already have. Two years ago, a massive scale-up of international aid prevented a large-scale famine and rolled back the world\u2019s biggest cholera outbreak. Ireland is playing its part to ensure that the international community acts on the same scale again.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ireland has provided direct funding of over \u20ac28 million to the Yemen crisis since 2012. The additional funding pledged today will bring Ireland\u2019s support since 2012 to a minimum of \u20ac33 million.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ireland\u2019s policy for international development, A Better World, outlines Ireland\u2019s vision of a more equal, peaceful, and sustainable world. It charts a clear way forward to achieve this vision, shaping and protecting our stability, our prosperity, our shared interests, and our common future.

Good animal health underpins livestock farming and the agrifood industry. Animal Health Awareness Week provides the opportunity to remind all stakeholders that our positive animal health status as a country cannot be taken for granted. It also provides an opportunity to communicate important messages on animal health to stakeholders.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The connection between the health of animals, humans and the environment is effectively captured in the \u201cOne Health\u201d concept. Many diseases of animals can also affect humans, or to look at it from the opposite point of view, many human diseases have reservoirs in the animal population. Good animal health contributes to public health, the profitability of individual farms as well as the sustainability of our livestock farming. It means that less greenhouse gases are produced per unit of output. Good animal health also contributes to the very high animal welfare standards found on Irish farms, and helps us to counter the threat of antimicrobial resistance. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister McConalogue added \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cThe Department would like to acknowledge the contribution and engagement of a wide range of stakeholders from across the agri-food industry and the education sector, for supporting the Animal Health Awareness Week and helping to make it a success.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Minister continued, \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \u201cOur positive animal health status cannot be taken for granted. All other things being equal, better animal health leads to better human health, especially in groups of people who work with animals such as farmers and vets. Covid-19, although a disease of humans, holds many lessons for keepers of animals in relation to biosecurity.\u201d \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Biosecurity is a vitally important tool in the national effort to prevent and suppress disease. The key role of biosecurity in delivering good animal health is underlined by the launch of Ireland\u2019s first National Farmed Animal Biosecurity Strategy on Wednesday 25th November, as part of Animal Health Awareness Week 2020. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Ministers of State also endorsed the Animal Health Awareness Week.

She said,\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \u201cThe link between good animal health, food production, and human health cannot be understated. Keeping our farm animals healthy, with a reduced need for animal health products, has beneficial effects on many aspects - from soil microbiology, animal welfare, and public health. Sustaining optimal animal health will benefit farmers' pocket too, not only in terms of reduced input costs, but also because healthy animals are more productive.\u201d\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         Notes for Editors \n:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Livestock production is at the heart of our agri-food industry and contributes hugely to the development of our Regions.

Recognising that human health, animal health and ecosystem health are inextricably linked, \u2018One Health\u2019 seeks to promote, improve and defend the health and well-being of all species by enhancing cooperation and collaboration between physicians, veterinarians, other scientific health and environmental professionals and by promoting strengths in leadership and management to achieve these goals.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        What is an \u201cexotic disease\u201d?\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        An exotic disease is one which is believed not to be present in our country.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        What is an endemic disease?\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Endemic diseases can be thought of as diseases which are present, established or common in an animal population. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In epidemiology, an infection is said to be endemic in a population when that infection is constantly maintained at a baseline level in a geographic area without external inputs.

This initiative will include awareness raising measures on social media and in key transport hubs, to convey the messages that human trafficking is a crime and that anyone can be exploited and to empower the public to recognise the signs of human trafficking. It is being undertaken with the support of a number of other state agencies and non-state organisations.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Launching the initiative, Minister McEntee said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"I am acutely conscious that the crime of human trafficking occurs in all countries in the world \u2013 and that Ireland is no exception. We need to be more alert to this. It is happening and it is not a phenomenon limited to our big cities. The terrible reality is that victims of human trafficking may potentially be hidden in plain sight, in any community in Ireland.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Minister McEntee continued:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and other state agencies, including in particular the health authorities, are already taking significant steps to address this terrible crime and respond to the needs of victims. But I am determined to ensure that together, we all play our part in fighting this scourge. We all need to understand that anyone can be exploited. We must also educate ourselves so we can recognise the signs of human trafficking and are equipped to take the appropriate steps if we encounter possible cases in our everyday lives.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Speaking on behalf of the UN Migration Agency (IOM), Lalini Veerassamy, Chief of Mission, said:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \"COVID-19 has brought a devastating impact upon the household security and health of billions of people all over the world, which heightens vulnerability and risk of exploitation. IOM has learned, as have our Member States, that it is imperative to partner with the private sector, trade unions, supply chain auditors, and recruitment agencies to put in place practices to reduce the risks of trafficking and exploitation. However, nothing can be more powerful than an engaged and informed public, one that can significantly support in addressing these human rights abuses. Anyone is at risk in the world we live in today, including Ireland.\"\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The overall objective of the initiative is to raise public awareness around the reality of human trafficking and to alert the public to its signs and indicators. Information will be made available on how to report suspicious activity, as well as tips on being a conscious and responsible consumer.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A new website is also being launched, in conjunction with this initiative, to highlight the availability of supports and services for victims from the state as well as community and voluntary organisations active in this sector. A public webinar hosted by IOM Ireland and the Department of Justice was held on 1 October to discuss and address the importance of effective national referral mechanisms for victims of trafficking which served as a good introduction for the Campaign.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The campaign will be visible on social media platforms from 9 October and will continue in the run-up to European Anti-human Trafficking Day on 18 October which is an important awareness raising day in the calendar and seeks to increase the exchange of information, knowledge and best practises among actors working in the field of Human Trafficking. The Campaign will also launch poster adverts at Dublin Airport, ports, and other transport hubs from 19 October which will continue for the rest of the month.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        More information and materials are available on the campaign website www.anyonetrafficked.com.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Further resources on anti-human trafficking are also available on a website maintained by the Department of Justice and Equality - www.blueblindfold.gov.ie\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        ENDS\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Media Contact\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        International Organisation for Migration:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \tphone: 01 676 0655\n\temail: iomdublin@iom.int\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Notes\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Information on work to counter trafficking\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Significant efforts are being made by the government at home and with our partners abroad to combat human trafficking.

 \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Introduction\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        I thank the Chairperson and the Committee for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the draft Stability Programme Update.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Stability Programme Update \u2013 the SPU \u2013 sets out the Government\u2019s macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for Ireland for the next five years.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The final version will be submitted to the EU Commission later this month.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        At the outset, I will stress that this is a purely technical document, with the projections based on existing government policies.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In accordance with the requirements under European legislation, the macroeconomic forecasts set out in the SPU have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Government response\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Speed and scale of response to the supply and demand shocks created by the pandemic have been the theme of the Government\u2019s economic response. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Since March last year, we have moved rapidly, using the strength of our public sector balance sheet, to replace lost private sector demand in order to ensure that firms, workers and incomes were supported and protected through wage subsidies, deferrals of liabilities and income supports.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Our overarching objective has been to support households and firms, as well as to limit the \u2018scarring\u2019, or permanent, effects of the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        And as we look towards a cautious reopening of the economy over the weeks and months ahead, it is clear from the Stability Programme Update that the relationship between economic activity and public health restrictions has weakened over each successive wave of the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Certain sectors of our economy have been better able to adapt to living with Covid.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The adaptability and innovation shown by businesses and consumers is borne out by the high frequency, real-time economic data published by my Department, which shows that the impact of the current set of restrictions is around half that of the spring 2020 lockdown. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Much of this is down to the flexibility of our domestic enterprises.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Firms and consumer have innovated and adapted. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Last month\u2019s VAT data, up 8 \u00bd per cent on the first quarter last year, shows that people have altered their behaviour.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        They are buying local, buying online and have shifted their consumption habits.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, the pandemic has not impacted everyone equally.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Those in contact-intensive employment have suffered the most, while many others, especially those with the ability to work from home, have had very little or indeed no reduction in income and \u2014 financially speaking \u2014 are as well off as before. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Equally, those who have continued to work have continued to pay income tax and many businesses that have been able to operate through the public health restrictions continue to pay corporation tax.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The strength of these revenues, as well as the extraordinary easing of monetary policy by the ECB, have enabled the Government to support jobs, incomes and businesses throughout the crisis.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is only right, as the disproportionate impact of the crisis has demanded a forceful response from the Government.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is what we have done.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Support measures\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The overall budgetary strategy remains one of providing strong, counter-cyclical budgetary support to the economy.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Government has used the full suite of budgetary tools available to it, including direct public expenditure, tax expenditures and \u2018below the line\u2019 supports, such as loans and guarantees.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        With a value of almost \u20ac38 billion, or nearly a fifth of national income (GNI*), the budgetary support provided by Government has been extraordinary. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We are only in a position to do this because of the sensible and sustainable management of the public finances over recent years.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The total value of payments made to-date under the Government\u2019s three main support schemes \u2013 the PUP, EWSS (or the TWSS prior to that) and the CRSS is around \u20ac13 \u00bd  billion, or nearly 6 \u00bd per cent of national income (GNI*).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We have spent over \u20ac7 billion on Pandemic Unemployment Payments, around \u20ac5\u00bd billion on wage subsidies, as well as introducing a whole host of business supports aimed at keeping businesses going, maintaining employment links for employees and making it easier for firms to re-open when it is safe to do so. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        While the response has been both appropriate and necessary, the cost continues to be significant.  Last year, a general government deficit of \u20ac18\u00bd billion, or 5 per cent of GDP, was recorded.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Vaccination Programme\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In the medium\u2014term, the speed at which the economy can recover will, of course, depend on the success of our vaccination programme.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A consistent theme of the IMF and World Bank Spring meetings that I attended recently is that vaccine policy is economic policy.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        And our vaccination programme will be the touchstone for the domestic recovery.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The programme is being accelerated over the coming months. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Of course there will be week-to-week fluctuations, and vaccine supply remains volatile, but we must keep in mind the bigger picture; we are on-track to vaccinate a large majority of the adult population by the end of this quarter.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This rising vaccine coverage should allow for a more significant easing of containment measures over the summer, and with that a sustainable recovery can begin.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A conditioning assumption underpinning the projections in the SPU is that low levels of public health restrictions will be in place in the second half of the year, with minimal restrictions next year, which should allow economic activity to normalise.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, it is likely that this \u2018new normal\u2019 may be somewhat different to the pre-pandemic norm. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Short-term economic outlook\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Based upon this scenario, Modified Domestic Demand (MDD)\u2013 what we see as the best indicator of economic trends \u2013 is projected to increase by 2\u00bd per cent this year.  This will accelerate to 7\u00bd per cent next year.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The release of pent-up consumer and business demand will be the key driver of the economy in the near-term.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The recovery in consumer spending next year is also assumed to be supported by an unwinding of part of the excess household savings built up during the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Of course, given the degree of uncertainty at present, the margin of error around these projections is sizeable.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Labour market\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The economic fall-out from the pandemic is most evident in the labour market. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        When those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment are added to the standard unemployment rate, the unemployment rate is projected to average around 16\u00bc per cent this year, before declining to 8\u00bc per cent next year as the economy is fully re-opened. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The level of employment is projected to increase by around 80,000 this year and 225,000 next year, though the level of employment will still remain below its pre-crisis peak until 2023.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Medium-term outlook\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Over the medium-term, an important but still open question relates to the extent of any permanent destruction to the economy\u2019s productive capacity from the pandemic, so-called \u2018scarring\u2019 effects. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        At this stage, the evidence base is extremely limited and the scale of \u2018scarring\u2019 will only become clear over time, as more data become available. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Indeed my Department published a short note on this topic in its most recent Economic Insights release last week.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As a very preliminary estimate, my Department is projecting domestic demand to grow at around 3 \u00bd per cent over the medium-term.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This means that, notwithstanding a reversion to trend growth over the medium-term, domestic activity would still be lower by the end of the projection period than the level suggested by the pre-pandemic trend, with employment also lagging. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Risks\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        But let me reiterate, the outlook remains highly uncertain, not least as it pertains to vaccine supply and efficacy, including against variants, both domestically and internationally. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        For instance, under a more severe scenario, one where the current, stringent restrictions need to remain in place for a prolonged period, the Irish economy would be approximately 4\u00bd per cent smaller by the end of next year than it would under the main scenario. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Fiscal developments\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Turning to the fiscal outlook, on a technical basis, a deficit of \u20ac18 billion, or 4.7 per cent of GDP, is estimated for this year. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This is based on existing Government policies but I would repeat what I have said previously, namely that there will be no \u2018cliff-edge\u2019 to the most important supports.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Any extension to these supports will, of course, worsen the deficit. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        This year\u2019s deficit will bring our overall debt levels to just under \u20ac240 billion, or almost 112 per cent of national income (GNI*). Let me put this another way: our public debt is approaching a quarter of a trillion euros.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        So, once the worst of the pandemic has passed, it will be necessary to address this by eliminating the deficit over time in a way that balances supporting the economy with continued fiscal sustainability. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A deficit of just under 3 per cent of GDP is projected for next year, on the basis that most of the temporary supports will have been withdrawn. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Beyond 2022, all Covid-specific supports are assumed to have been unwound.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        With a recovering economy, withdrawal of these supports should be sufficient to better align revenue and expenditure by the mid-part of the decade. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        In other words, economic growth \u2014 via increased tax revenues \u2014 will be enough to close the gap between what that State earns and what it spends. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        There are, however, clear downside risks for the public finances. In particular, international corporate tax reform could weigh more heavily on this revenue stream than is currently assumed. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Having said that, the public finances are in a much better position to absorb the expected shock to corporate tax revenue than, say, a decade and a half ago.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The tax base is much wider than prior to the global financial crisis and, importantly, there is time to build up the resilience of the public finances before international reforms move to the implementation phase.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Conclusion\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The pandemic has taken a severe toll on the domestic economy and the public finances. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        However, the continuing progress of the vaccination programme and the collective effort of the Irish public provides reason for optimism. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        We entered into this crisis from a position of strength and our economic model has proven its resilience. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Together, we will overcome the pandemic, rebuild our economy and return our people to work. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Thank you. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Ends\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n","ee5d6693101268f77a3c88c96506bd35d4644cc1397a3df814138c816e5487f3":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n\n                \n                    \n                        \t\n                            1.

Some 137,500 farms producing over \u20ac8 billion in output, over 770,000 hectares of forest, and over 2,000 fishing vessels and aquaculture sites producing fish with a value of \u20ac770 million underpin the sector.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Agri-Food Business\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Liquidity and Access to Finance supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses, including farmers and fishers\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Liquidity\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        In order to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Government has engaged with the banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses.

As recovery begins, many COVID-impacted businesses will require additional liquidity and working capital facilities. The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is designed to incentivise finance providers to continue to support economic activity by providing liquidity and finance agreements to businesses.  The Scheme is targeted towards businesses which have experienced an adverse impact of minimum 15% in actual or projected turnover or profit due to the impact of COVID 19 and have difficulties in accessing credit.  The CCGS will provide an 80% State-backed guarantee on bank lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. The scheme will be administered for the State by the SBCI and SMEs will be able to go directly to the banks. The guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between \u20ac10,000 and \u20ac1 million, for terms between 3 months and 6 years.

Agri-food tourism may involve staying on farm or touring food trails and events, participation in agricultural endeavours or buying produce direct from a farm or market.  It also encompasses local food, farmer and artisan market schemes that support and are paired with local and seasonal food producers and artisan crafts.  The development of agri-food trails allows promotion of regional or specialist cuisines, the growth and development of local or regional food and drink producers, traders and artisans whilst supporting diversification of rural producers within a wider framework of tourism. These operations are run in a number of settings ranging from working family farms, local community initiatives through to more institutional frameworks at the County or inter-County level.  Experience has shown that well run operations provide an opportunity for inclusion of agricultural produce, local food artisans and producers, and local rural markets into tourism more broadly.

Separately, and in accordance with the Statistics Act, 1993, the CSO also hosts a secure COVID-19 Data Research Hub which contains individual level administrative data sets obtained from the Health Service Executive (HSE).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        The datasets within the Research Hub contain pseudonymised individual level data on those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, been referred for testing, been treated in hospital for COVID-19 or have been identified as being a close contact of a confirmed case.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            What is changing\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Previously, only certain CSO staff had access to this data for statistical purposes and it was shared with named individuals involved in the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group (IEMAG) of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). After extensive consultation, the Health Research Board (HRB) is collaborating with the Department of Health (DoH), and the CSO to make this data available for research too. Now, registered researchers from registered research organisations can now apply to access this pseudonymised data after a rigorous application process. Central to this initiative is the establishment of the Research Data Governance Board (RDGB).\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            What the RDGB is\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The RDGB is an independent body and a key safeguard in this new mechanism to facilitate access to data in the CSO COVID-19 Research Hub, and is an independent body established jointly by HRB and the CSO, in close collaboration with the DoH. The RDGB acts as a central point for application receipt, screening, review and prioritisation of data requests, prior to applications being assessed by the CSO, and oversees a transparent process to facilitate secure and controlled access to this COVID-19 data for research. The RDGB Secretariat is provided by the HRB and supports the RDGB in all aspects of its work.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Why researchers can now apply to access these sets of data\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Health research has played an important role nationally and globally during the current public health emergency. From rapid reviews of existing evidence to expedited research projects to clinical trials of new treatments and vaccines, Ireland is playing a key role on the international stage, facilitated greatly by the work and support of the HRB.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Using the best available research evidence and data to guide public health and health systems decisions is integral to an effective and efficient response in public health emergencies. Enabling approved research projects involving the processing of relevant COVID-19 data for statistical purposes in compliance with the Statistics Act and data protection law can ensure that researchers have the potential to enhance our understanding of the epidemiology, progression (or decline) and implications of this disease in Ireland and internationally and guide optimal interventions and decision making.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The role that researchers have in this public health emergency\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Researchers have an important role to play during the current public health emergency. Facilitating access to these data for researchers allows for research enabling linkage of health and social care data that could support clinicians, service managers, policy makers and researchers further understand and better tackle COVID-19. For example, trends and associations between COVID-19 interventions and patient outcomes might be identified, as well as the cost effectiveness and impact of such interventions. This data sharing is also expected to inform evidence-based decision-making and public policy in Ireland during the pandemic.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            What researchers will have access to the information\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Only registered researchers from registered research organisations in Ireland can apply to access the COVID-19 Data Research Hub for valid research purposes.

Separate approvals from the Research Data Governance Board, Research Ethics Committee(s), and a consent declaration from the Health Regulations Consent Declaration Committee will be needed before the CSO will consider final approval. The Director General of the CSO will only then make a determination as to whether the research project is in the public interest and within the scope of the Statistics Act, 1993.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            The legal basis upon which researchers can access these data\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The legal basis for this is Section 20(c) of the Statistics Act, 1993, and the Data Protection Act 2018\/Health Research Regulations 2018.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Whether these approved researchers will be able to see personal information\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        No. All direct identifiers such as names, addresses and date of birth will have been removed. This process is referred to as pseudonymisation. Additionally, once in receipt of HSE data, the CSO converts the identifier numbers in each dataset that remain to a Protected Identifier Key (PIK). The PIK is a unique and non-identifiable number which is internal to the CSO. Using the PIK enables the CSO and approved researchers to link and analyse data for statistical purposes, while protecting the security and confidentiality of the individual data.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            What is being done to protect an individual\u2019s data protection and privacy rights\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Only registered researchers from registered research organisations in Ireland are permitted to apply for access to these data.

The CSO technology in facilitating secure access to microdata is in keeping with best practice internationally. The RDP is a locked-down Citrix environment from which no data can be extracted without the approval of the CSO. The researcher logs on using a unique username, PIN and password. As well as this, the researcher\u2019s access may be restricted to a specific IP address. The microdata always remains on a CSO server.

As with all researcher data, there is a time gap between data availability and the ability to share it given the stringent data protection protocols involved. The CSO also provides documentation describing the data to researchers which can take some time to prepare for new data sources.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Whether researchers in other countries have similar access to health information\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Yes. Ireland has lacked the infrastructure and services required to support an environment that exploits health information to its full potential and so is an outlier in this area. The type of infrastructure which this initiative proposes is modelled on best international practice and has been available for many years in the UK, most European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It aims to maximise the value of national data sets - particularly in the area of health where there is much sensitive data.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Has a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) been prepared\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Yes, to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation a DPIA and a Transparency Notice have been prepared.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Whether there been consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner\u2019s Office\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Yes, there has been consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner\u2019s Office, and the Office is satisfied with the researcher access proposal subject to the implementation of the Data Protection Impact Assessment and the safeguards outlined therein.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Have individuals given their consent to this use of their data\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Individuals have not given their consent for the use of their data that is held within the COVID-19 Data Research Hub, for health research purposes. To seek such consent would not be practicable or possible for researchers.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        As explicit consent from an individual is a mandatory safeguard under the Health Research Regulations, all RMF researchers must therefore apply to the Health Research Consent Declaration Committee (HRCDC) for a lawful consent declaration where explicit consent of the individual is not possible or practicable, and where the public interest in carrying out the research significantly outweighs the public interest in requiring the explicit consent of the individual.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A consent declaration shall only be made by the HRCDC for a research study, when it is satisfied that all the data protection safeguards and technical and organisational measures have been met, and the public interest in carrying out the health research significantly outweighs the public interest in requiring the explicit consent of the individual who owns the personal data.
