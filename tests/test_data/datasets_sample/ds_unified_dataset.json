The evaluation assesses to what extent the objectives of each area of the Strategy, detailed in section 2.1.2, have been achieved and to what extent the actions for achieving these objectives have been implemented. In addition, the evaluation highlights strong points and weaknesses in the implementation of the Strategy and provides overall conclusions. The scope of the evaluation is largely focused on the actions undertaken by the EU institutions and the European Commission in particular, and only to a limited extent on actions undertaken at Member State level. This limitation has highlighted the need to address in the future also the progress at national level. As the Strategy is the policy framework for implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD, the Convention) 3 at EU level, the evaluation has also assessed how the Strategy has influenced the implementation of the Convention at EU level. The evaluation covers all five criteria set out by the Better Regulation requirements, namely effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value. This document largely relies on an external supporting study 4 (the Study), and on input gathered via a broad stakeholder consultation process described in Annex 2. The geographical scope of the evaluation is the EU in its pre-Brexit composition (28 Member States). The time span covered by the evaluation is November 2010 to December 2019. However, a few references to policy developments beyond this timeframe have been included in this Staff Working Document for the sake of completeness 5 . The Strategy will end in 2020. In line with the \"evaluate first\" principle, which is part of the Better Regulation 6 regulatory policy, the results of the evaluation will be used as a basis for the formulation of the Commission's future priorities and initiatives in the field of disability. 2.Background to the intervention 2.1 Description of the intervention and its objectives 2.1.1 Need for action The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) 7 requires the EU to combat discrimination based on disability when defining and implementing its policies and activities (Article 10) and it gives it power to adopt legislation to address such discrimination (Article 19). The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 8 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability (Article 21) and recognises the right of persons with disabilities to independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the life of the community (Article 26). Since 1983, the Commission has supported the development of a European disability policy through a succession of action programmes 9 . In 2003 the Commission launched a disability action plan for the period 2003-2010 10 . While important steps were taken in this period to improve the lives of persons with disabilities in the EU, the external contractor in charge of the action plan evaluation also reported critical views of stakeholders on the adequacy of the existing policy and regulatory frameworks at the EU level to address the needs of people with disabilities 11 . Building on the results of the action plan, the European disability strategy was adopted in 2010, while the process for the ratification by the EU of the UNCRPD was underway. Through the ratification, the EU committed to comply with the Convention's obligations and set up the necessary coordination and implementation mechanisms for its implementation. The Strategy was conceived as the policy framework through which the EU would deliver the commitments made under the UNCRPD in line with the respective competences provided for in the Treaties. 2.1.2 The Strategy The Communication 12 which set-out the Strategy in 2010 presented it as \"a framework for action at EU level, as well as with national action to address the diverse situation of men, women and children with disabilities\". The overall purpose of the Strategy was to \"promote a barrier-free Europe and to empower persons with disabilities so that they can enjoy their rights and participate fully in society and economy\". Achieving those objectives required policies and actions at the level of the EU and of the Member States, with due regard to their respective competences. The Strategy identified eight key areas for improvement with the following specific objectives: 1)Accessibility: making goods and services accessible to persons with disabilities and promoting the market of assistive devices 2)Participation: ensuring that persons with disabilities enjoy all benefits of EU citizenship, removing administrative and attitudinal barriers to full and equal participation, promoting the provision of quality community-based services 3)Equality: eradicating discrimination on the grounds of disability in the EU 4)Employment: enabling many more persons with disabilities to earn their living on the open labour market 5)Education and training: promoting inclusive education and lifelong learning for pupils and students with disabilities 6)Social protection: promoting decent living conditions for persons with disabilities 7)Health: fostering equal access to health services and related facilities for persons with disabilities 8)External action: promoting the rights of persons with disabilities within the EU external action The Strategy also included four instruments to support its overall implementation: awareness raising; financial support; statistics, data collection and monitoring; mechanisms required by the UNCRPD. The instruments, like the areas, pursue specific objectives: a)Awareness raising: raising society's awareness of disability issues and foster greater knowledge among persons with disabilities about their rights b)Financial support: optimising the use of EU funding instruments for accessibility and non-discrimination and increasing visibility of disability-relevant funding possibilities in post-2013 programmes c)Statistics, data collection and monitoring: supplementing the collection of periodic disability-related statistics with a view to monitoring the situation of persons with disabilities d)Mechanisms required by the UNCRPD: establishing mechanisms at EU level for the implementation of the UNCRPD An annex to the Strategy included the \"list of actions\" 13 to be implemented during the period 2010-2020 for achieving the Strategy's objectives. 2.1.3 The UNCRPD The Strategy is closely linked with the UNCRPD. The Commission adopted the Strategy in November 2010, shortly before the EU ratified the Convention in December 2010. By 2018, all EU Member States had also ratified the Convention. The UNCRPD is a legally binding human rights treaty. Consequently, at the EU level, its provisions are an integral part of the EU's legal order and all existing and future legislation must be in line with the UNCRPD. As parties to the Convention, both the EU and its Member States are obliged to implement their obligations under the Convention according to their respective competences. However, the scope of the Convention is very broad and it covers all the aspects of the life of persons with disabilities for their full inclusion in society. The Strategy, through its eight areas and its four implementation instruments, covered part of the scope of the UNCRPD. 2.1.4 The competences of the EU The EU has only the competences conferred on it by the Treaties and may only act within the limits of its competences 14 (principle of conferral). Based on this principle, the EU and the Member States are obliged to implement their obligations under the UNCRPD according to their respective competences. The Council Decision concerning the conclusion by the EU of the UNCRPD 15 declared the extent of EU competences with respect to the matters governed by the Convention 16 , and a secondary legislation was identified and listed in a declaration in annex to illustrate the extent of the area of EU competence. The Decision explains that the scope and the exercise of EU competence are, by their nature, subject to continuous development and that the EU will complete or amend the declaration, if necessary, in accordance with Article 44(1) of the UNCRPD. This division is also reflected in the scope of the Strategy which includes fields where the EU and the Member States have \"shared competences\", and fields where the EU has only a \"supporting competence\". In the fields falling under shared competences, both the EU and the Member States have the power to adopt legislative measures. Fields of shared competence broadly include internal market, transport, social policy, employment, equality, development cooperation and humanitarian aid. In the fields where the EU has supporting competences, the EU can only supplement, support, and coordinate the actions of the Member States. Areas where the EU has supporting competences include health, education and training. In order to comply with the principle of conferral and with the obligation for the EU to only act within the limits of its competences, the Strategy was issued in the form of a communication, so that its content, although binding for the Commission, did not directly commit other EU policy makers or the Member States. Member States were obliged to follow-up on the Strategy's actions only when those actions have a binding nature. This was the case, for example, of the European Accessibility Act 17 , the Web-Accessibility Directive 18 , the Audiovisual Media Services Directive 19 , or the European Electronic Communications Code 20 , which were part of the Strategy's implementation plan and, once adopted, are binding also for the Member States. As a result, the evaluation focuses on the actions taken by the EU and the Commission in particular, in relation to the Strategy and, to some extent, on actions taken at Member State level to implement EU decisions. This limitation showed the need for a broader view about national action and progress in the future. 2.1.5 Intervention logic In the years prior to the Strategy the proportion of persons with disabilities across the EU was about 16 % of the working-age population 21 , and there was general agreement that demographic trends (i.e. ageing population) would lead to an increase in the number of persons with disabilities 22 . Evidence showed that persons with disabilities were poorer than the average European, less likely to have a job, and they faced barriers in accessing goods and services such as education, healthcare, transport, housing and technology 23 . The Strategy aimed to mobilise or establish several policy instruments and governance structures (inputs) for achieving its goals. This includes Commission staff time and financial resources to deliver specific actions. Specific EU level actions were devised for each of the eight areas of action and the four implementation instruments (the actions are described in a \"list of actions\" 24 published in annex to the Strategy). The Strategy intended to supplement and support Member State actions. In that regard, Member States contributed toward achieving the Strategy objectives through using national resources, such as national, regional, and local funds, in combination with the EU funds and by implementing policy initiatives at national level. Implementation of specific actions of the Strategy can be observed in the form of outputs and results \/ impact. The key outputs entail the adoption and transposition of EU legislation on disability, the development of toolkits for the implementation of EU disability-related policies, the organisation of awareness-raising sessions and dialogue events with regard to disability rights, the pursuit of research studies on disability, and the overall mainstreaming of disability considerations in EU and national policies. The expected results and impacts of the intervention were the gradual removal of disability barriers and the improvement of the situation of persons with disabilities in the specific areas of the Strategy. Impacts and results were therefore expected at an individual level, and the increase of the capacity of the Member States to improve the lives of persons with disabilities at a system level. The achieved outcomes from these interventions were expected to generate sustainable and lasting effects in the inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities, increasing their capacity to fully enjoy their fundamental rights and freedoms. The intervention logic was reconstructed in the Study and its graphical presentation is included in Annex 3. 2.2 Baseline and points of comparison The Strategy pursued its objectives through the implementation of a \"list of actions\" to be carried out and completed during the Strategy's ten-year period. This list of actions serves as baseline for the Strategy. The extent to which the actions have been implemented is the main point of comparison to evaluate how the Strategy was implemented over time. The Strategy did not have a clear method for qualitatively assessing the progress of each action. As a result, evaluating the extent to which actions were implemented has required the definition of a specific methodology, which is reported under Section 4 and Annex 4 of this Staff Working Document. 3.Implementation \/ state of Play 3.1 Description of the current situation The abovementioned \"list of actions\" 25 constitutes the operational implementation plan across the Strategy's thematic areas. The implementation plan comprises 150 measures legislation and other related policy instruments such as soft law measures, standards and research\/studies and was initially intended for the first five years of the Strategy. The mid-term review of the Strategy 26 published in 2017 confirmed the relevance of the actions also for the remaining period of implementation. In general, the findings of the supporting Study show that 101 actions of the Strategy (67% of total) were fully implemented throughout the whole implementation period. 40 actions (27% of total) were partially implemented and 9 actions (6% of total) were not implemented. Figure 1: Implementation of the Strategy overall Source: ICF analysis Figures 2.1 and 2.2: Implementation by thematic area (number and percentage) Source: ICF analysis The areas with the highest level of implementation were Participation, Equality and Employment. The area with the lowest level of implementation was External action. In relation to the implementation instruments, all the actions were fully or partially implemented. Only one action was not implemented for the implementation instrument of Statistics, data collection and monitoring (name of the action: \"Work towards a legal basis for a health and social integration survey implementing Regulation (EC) 1338\/2008 on public health statistics\"). Figures 3.1 and 3.2: Implementation by implementation instrument (number and percentage) Source: ICF analysis The detailed overview with the level of implementation of each action is reported in Annex 5 of the Staff Working Document. 4.Method 4.1 Short description of methodology The evaluation of the Strategy is based on a set of evaluation questions linked to the five assessment criteria defined by the Better Regulation guidelines (effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value). These questions were broken down into sub-questions and developed as operational questions appropriate for stakeholder responses. An evaluation framework describing this process is included in the Study 27 . In addition, the analysis of the criteria built on the intervention logic is represented graphically in Annex 3 of this Staff Working Document. In line with the Better Regulation provisions 28 , the evaluation has first to provide answers to each evaluation question and then provide conclusions about the overall implementation of the Strategy. 4.1.1 Sources of information The Roadmap for the evaluation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 29 was published on the European Commission 'Have your say' web portal 30 from 28 September 2018 until 26 October 2018. An external and independent supporting study (\"the Study\") was conducted to support the evaluation, between March and December 2019. The main objective of the Study was to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value of the Strategy and assess the extent to which the Strategy has reinforced the implementation of the UNCRPD. The methodological approach to the Study combined quantitative and qualitative data that have been systematically gathered and triangulated to assess the implementation of the Strategy and to formulate judgements for answering the evaluation questions and providing conclusions on the Strategy. Evidence has been gathered during the whole evaluation process through different methods and from different sources: -Desk research: analysis of existing studies, policy documents, position papers and legislative acts related to the Strategy and to EU disability policy. -Targeted consultations: structured interviews and focus groups with 182 selected stakeholders at EU and at Member State level. An inclusive research methodology has been adopted to allow participation by the widest possible numbers of stakeholders. -Online public consultation: an internet-based consultation (running from 31 July until 13 November 2019) open to all EU citizens and stakeholders was published in the Commission 'Have your say' web portal. 2,547 respondents took part in the consultation. 573 (22.5%) responses were from organisations, whereas 1,974 (77.5%) were from individuals. -Online dedicated consultations: online surveys targeting organisations representing persons with disabilities and representatives of Ministries responsible for disability policy at national level. -Public events: gathering of feedback from participants to EU high-level events dedicated to disability policy and to the evaluation of the Strategy. Further information about the consultation work is included in Annex 2. The information collected through these different methods has been analysed and compared in order to test its validity and internal consistency (triangulation). The results have been consolidated and combined with analytical techniques to detect possible trends and patterns. The implementation plan of the Strategy did not include indicators or benchmarks for measuring the level of implementation of the actions or the level of achievement of its objectives. As a result, the evaluation of the Strategy required a method for determining to which extent the actions of the Strategy have been implemented and its objectives achieved. Each action of the Strategy has been analysed and assessed against a scale of possible outcomes. Actions have been assessed as: -Fully implemented -Partially implemented -Not implemented Explanations about the criteria for determining the outcomes are reported in Annex 5. The extent to which objectives were achieved is strongly determined by the level of implementation of the underlying actions. However, also other elements were used for the assessment of the objectives such as the perceived relevance of the actions, the relative state of play in 2010 and in 2019 (when statistical data is available), the feedback from stakeholders, or the influence of decisions taken by other institutions at Member State or EU level. The resulting judgements have been used to formulate answers to the evaluation questions and to draw conclusions about the implementation of the Strategy. 4.2 Limitations and robustness of findings Issues encountered during analysis: -Statistical data, and notably disaggregated data, for assessing the impact of the Strategy on the situation of persons with disabilities is not always available or updated. Nevertheless, data disaggregated by age and gender has been available on an annual basis in relation to prevalence of disability, employment, education and poverty risk rates. Health-related data has been available, also disaggregated by age and gender every several years. Where conclusions on the impact of the Strategy could not be fully supported through quantitative information, they were discussed with relevant stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations and Member States representatives, and submitted to expert advice, namely through the contractor's network of experts, to test their robustness and reliability; -The absence of specific indicators and benchmarks for assessing the Strategy's implementation and achievements in relation to the objectives made it necessary to develop an ex-post method for measuring the progress of the Strategy. However, there are indicators published annually on the gaps between persons with and without disabilities, in relation to the three headline targets of Europe 2020; -Some of the effects of the Strategy's actions are to materialise only after the end of the Strategy; -Improvement in the situation of persons with disabilities can result both from actions at EU-level and at national and regional level. As the evaluation of the Strategy focused on EU-level actions, the assessment of the effectiveness of the Strategy in improving the situation of persons with disabilities cannot be directly correlated. Therefore, an estimation was provided, mainly based on the extent to which the actions of the Strategy were implemented. This assessment was also integrated with expert advice, feedback received by relevant stakeholders, and, where available, analysis of statistical data; -In relation to efficiency, the Study made efforts to estimate the costs of the Strategy and to quantify its results. However, such an estimation is difficult to assess in objective terms. Therefore, conclusions about the efficiency of the Strategy also relied on elements such as professional judgement, expert advice and stakeholder feedback. Despite these limitations, the analytical framework and the data collected were adequate with regard to quality and breadth of representation from different categories of stakeholders. Where available data was limited, the evaluation extended its research base. Where shortcomings could not be mitigated fully, the Study relied on the contractor's professional judgment, expertise and stakeholders' feedback as the basis for providing assessment and conclusions. At the end of the evaluation exercise, this allowed for methodologically robust findings and conclusions. More details on the methodology adopted and on how issues were mitigated for each analytical task are reported in Annex 4. 5.Analysis and answers to the evaluation questions 5.1 Effectiveness The conclusions about the effectiveness of the Strategy and about the extent to which its overall objective, as well as objectives per key areas and implementation instruments have been achieved rely mainly on: the extent to which actions in the relevant areas have been implemented; expert advice; feedback received by relevant stakeholders; and, where available, analysis of statistical data. Overall, the Study suggests there has been good progress since 2010 in the participation of persons with disabilities in society and economic life, in the promotion and protection of their rights, and in the implementation of the UNCRPD across the EU. 56% of respondents to the public consultation carried out during the evaluation, agreed or somewhat agreed that the situation for persons with disabilities improved between 2010 and 2020 in their Member State (31% somewhat disagreed or disagreed). 46% of all respondents agreed or somewhat agreed that the situation for persons with disabilities improved over this period across the EU (11% somewhat disagreed or disagreed). The targeted stakeholder consultations in the Member States show that in the large majority of countries, the situation of persons of disabilities is seen as having improved at least to some extent over the last ten years. Table 1: Views on whether the situation for persons with disabilities improved in the Member States over the last ten years Agree Somewhat agree Neither agree nor disagree Somewhat disagree Disagree DE, DK, EE (3) AT, BE, CY, CZ, ES, FI, FR, EL, HR, IE, LT, LV, MT, PT, SK (15) BG, HU, IT, LU, NL, RO, SE, SI (8) PL (1) UK (1) Note: a) The Study national experts' assessment is based on the information gathered from the stakeholder interviews and focus groups carried out in Member States. b) The table indicates the most common selection across all areas of action for each country; where there was no consensus among stakeholders, 'neither agree nor disagree' was selected. Source: Member State analysis performed by national experts in the context of the Study There is less agreement on the extent to which the Strategy helped to improve the situation for persons with disabilities. The Study's national experts in seven Member States agreed that the Strategy has helped (BE, DE, EE, NL, PT, CZ, RO). But in ten Member States they disagreed (BG, ES, FI, SI, HU, IE, LT, MT, PL, SE) and in eleven Member States the experts expressed neither the agreement nor disagreement (AT, CY, DK, FR, EL, HR, IT, LU, LV, SK, UK). On the other hand, many EU-level stakeholders consulted during the Study, and especially the umbrella organisations representing persons with disabilities at EU level, agree that the existence of such a strategy at EU level is in itself crucial, as the adoption of a high-level EU policy document explicitly dedicated to disability has helped placing the disability agenda higher among the EU policy priorities. In terms of implementation, the Study concludes that not all actions were fully implemented, and that they contributed to a different extent to the achievement of their objectives. For example, in the area of Equality, almost all the actions were fully implemented. But the Study considered its objective as partially achieved because one of its most important actions (\"Support the negotiation in Council of the draft Directive on equal treatment beyond the field of employment\") did not lead to the adoption of the Directive by the Council. Another element that limited the achievement of the Strategy is the broad scope of its overall objective. The Study suggests that for ensuring full achievement the Strategy would have required a wider and more comprehensive set of instruments and actions than those foreseen 31 , including actions undertaken by Member States. The following sections present in more detail the implementation of the Strategy across each of its areas and implementing instruments. Additional sections are dedicated to mainstreaming, to the identification of success as well as of hindering factors and to stakeholders' engagement in the implementation of the Strategy. 5.1.1 Achievement of objectives and implementation the actions in eight key areas 5.1.1.1 Accessibility There has been on overall improvement in this policy area of accessibility whose objective was to ensure the accessibility of goods, services, including public services and assistive devices for persons with disabilities. 63% of actions in this area were fully implemented, including through legislation. The Study also suggests that the progress has been uneven across areas and that accessibility for persons with disabilities has been partially ensured. Accessibility is the area where the Strategy delivered its most visible legislative outputs, which reflect the level of competences of the EU: the adoption of the European Accessibility Act 32 and of the Web Accessibility Directive 33 , the adoption of the waterborne and bus and coach passenger rights Regulations 34 , the provisional agreement of the Council and the Transport and Tourism Committee of the European Parliament on the proposal of re-cast of the rail passengers' rights Regulation 35 , the revision of the Commission Regulation on the technical specifications for interoperability relating to accessibility of the Union's rail system 36 , the inclusion of accessibility provisions in the Audiovisual Media Services Directive 37 , the new European Electronic Communications Code 38 , the so-called \"Marrakesh\" Directive 39 , and the inclusion of mandatory accessibility requirements for projects financed through EU funds. Regarding the problems related to compensation claims concerning damages of mobility equipment when travelling, this is addressed now in all passenger rights Regulations except for air passenger rights, where the Commission has proposed to amend the rules accordingly 40 . The European Accessibility Act was a much-anticipated legislative action of the EU to ensure that goods and services including public services and assistive devices for people with disabilities are accessible, and it took four years to adopt it. All stakeholders considered its adoption as an important achievement of the Strategy and a positive step for improving the level of accessibility throughout the Union. Some stakeholders are critical about the voluntary approach to the application of the accessibility requirements for the built environment and see this as reducing the potential positive impact of the Act on the accessibility of goods and services by persons with disabilities. The limited progress in the field of built environment remains a challenge. This includes the scope limitations of the Accessibility Act (accessibility of the built environment is subject to voluntary adoption by the Member States) and the fact that most of actions of the Strategy related to the built environment (standardisation mandate on accessibility of the built environment, inclusion of accessibility in curricula of architect and engineers, inclusion of accessibility in the Lead Market Initiative for sustainable buildings) were not implemented within the timespan covered by the evaluation 41 . In the field of copyright, the \"Marrakesh Directive\" provides for a mandatory exception to copyright as regards printed works in formats accessible to persons with disabilities. As required by its Article 9, the Commission has started the preparation of a report on disabilities and on type of works which are not covered by the Directive. The EU level targeted consultations held within the evaluation (interviews with the academic network of experts, international non-profit associations, and independent network organisations) highlighted that actions in the area of accessibility tend to focus on visible disabilities. For non-visible disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities and psychosocial disabilities in general, many of the accessibility needs have not been fully addressed by the Strategy (simplified environments, pace and complexity of information provided to the public, mental health literacy of public officials, specific awareness raising initiatives dedicated to invisible disabilities). 5.1.1.2 Participation The Strategy's actions were directed at enabling persons with disabilities to enjoy all the benefits of citizenship, removing administrative and attitudinal barriers to full and equal participation and providing quality community-based services, including access to personal assistance. More than 80% of these actions have been fully implemented. The initiatives that most contributed to fulfilling the objective of this area are the following: -Activities in support of independent living, and notably EU funding legislation 42 allowing the Member States to support measures for the shift from institutional to community-based care 43 , which led to concrete results in different Member States. -Implementation of the European disability card 44 pilot project, conceived to address the issue of lack of mutual recognition in disability status among Member States and to ensure equal access to benefits across borders for people with disabilities, mainly in the areas of culture, leisure, sport and transport. A pilot of the card was launched in February 2016 in a group of eight EU Member States 45 By the end of 2020 the Commission will conclude the assessment on the implementation of this pilot project. -The Inclusion and Diversity Strategy 46 which promotes participation of young people with disabilities into Erasmus+ youth mobility projects. -Initiatives to promote participation into sports through funding for disability-specific sporting events, projects (through Erasmus+ 47 ), awareness raising actions (like the BeInclusive EU sport award 48 ) or events (such as the European Day of Persons with Disabilities conference 2019 49 where challenges encountered by persons with disabilities in sport were thoroughly discussed). In this area it is also important to mention the June 2019 Council Conclusions on Access to sport for persons with disabilities 50 . The majority of stakeholders consulted in the evaluation process considered that the Strategy helped improve participation of persons with disabilities in society. They also considered that the Strategy made an important contribution in supporting the process of de-institutionalisation via the EU funds, thus supporting persons with disabilities to live independently and with adequate assistance. However, the Study also suggested that the objective to achieve full participation of persons with disabilities in society was partially achieved, because, despite progress in this area, barriers to participation still persist. Among the main obstacles, the Study identified the following: -Stakeholders from organisations representing persons with intellectual disabilities and charities have expressed concerns about the limited strategic vision in Member States for the transition from institutional to community living, and specifically, the lack of assessment of the needs of persons with disabilities and of measures to ensure their social inclusion. These concerns point out that the inclusion of the ex-ante conditionalities in the context of ESI Funds may not always be sufficient to guarantee the swift transition from institutional to community-based services. Nevertheless, stakeholders acknowledge the overall benefits deriving from the ex-ante conditionalities as well as the EU efforts to ensure their application. This resulted in better funding for projects that contribute to the social inclusion of persons with disabilities. -There is still limited data collection on life conditions in residential institutions, and limited promotion of best practices on independent living. -The Strategy has limited focus on autonomy of persons with disabilities. The respect of individual autonomy is one of the general principles of the UNCRPD and it refers to the right of persons with disabilities to have reasonable life choices, to be subject to minimum interference in private life and to be legally entitled to make own decisions (including political participation), with adequate support if required. The Study points out that autonomy was not part of the Strategy's implementation efforts despite its importance for the overall participation objective. Although legislation on legal capacity is a national competence, the EU could have done more to promote the understanding of autonomy issues by public officers, especially among the judiciary and medical professionals. -Organisations of persons with disabilities advocating for independent living underline that there is limited attention at EU level about the promotion of personal assistance through ESI Funds. They consider that funding personal assistance would be effective for improving overall participation of persons with disabilities in society. 5.1.1.3 Equality The Strategy's objective in the area of equality was to eradicate discrimination on the ground of disability across the EU. The Study suggests that this objective, although highly desirable, is an ambitious target to be achieved during the ten year implementation period of the Strategy. The fulfilment of this objective would have required heavy changes (in terms of legislation, attitudes, social and economic conditions also at national and local level) that would have gone beyond the Strategy's possible scope for achievement. In terms of implementation, the Strategy proposed the adoption of eleven actions in the field of equality, and over 80% of the actions have been fully implemented (more details are available in Annex 5). The shared competences of the EU in this field make it possible to adopt legally binding acts. One of the key actions under this area was \"Monitoring the application and impact of Directive 2000\/78\/EC 51 for improving employment of persons with disabilities\". The action was fully implemented. In 2014, the Commission presented an implementation report 52 concluding that all Member States had taken the necessary measures to transpose the Directive into their legal orders. The report also highlighted that some Member States had faced initial difficulties in correctly transposing the provisions on reasonable accommodation. In its conclusions, the report highlights the importance of awareness raising to increase knowledge of the already existing protection and to ensure better practical implementation and application of the Directive. Another key action under this area was to \"Support the negotiation in Council of the draft Directive on equal treatment beyond the field of employment\". In 2008, the Commission presented a proposal 53 for a horizontal Directive on equal treatment (Equal Treatment Directive), but the proposal has since then been blocked in the Council because the required unanimity has not been reached so far. As a result, despite being partially implemented, the action did not lead to the expected results and the non-adoption of the Equal Treatment Directive has left a legal gap in terms of protection from disability-based discrimination. The Equal Treatment Directive The Commission adopted the proposal for an Equal Treatment Directive in 2008, which has not yet been adopted by the Council of the European Union, composed of all EU Member States. The proposed Directive would expand protection throughout the European Union against discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation to the areas of social protection including healthcare, education, and access to and supply of goods and services including housing. Many stakeholders consider that the adoption of this Directive is essential for prohibiting discrimination on the ground of disability. The remaining actions under this area focused on awareness raising and they were fully implemented. However, the Study suggests that these measures were not sufficient for eradicating discrimination against persons with disabilities. In relation to the area of equality, the Study suggests that the ambitious formulation of its objective, the non-adoption of the Equal Treatment Directive and the limited scope of the remaining actions, led to partial achievements in eradicating discrimination based on disability in the EU. 5.1.1.4 Employment The Study suggests that the Strategy has been effective in implementing employment policy tools, but that its impact in increasing the participation of persons with disabilities in the open labour market is not clearly measurable. In the area of employment 75% of actions were fully implemented, 19% partially implemented, and 6% not implemented. The Study suggests that the actions of the Strategy in the area of employment have been effective in relation to the following issues: -Use of EU funds for supporting employment of persons with disabilities. -Awareness raising about disability rights in the field of employment and specifically in the private sector. -Putting in place diversity charters and exchanges with employers on diversity. -Improving the statistical data on the situation of persons with disabilities in the field of employment. In relation to policy tools, the study highlights that the European Pillar of Social Rights 54 (\"the Pillar\"), in its principle 17 \"Inclusion of persons with disabilities\", explicitly asserts the right to services that enable persons with disabilities to participate in the labour market and in society, and to a work environment adapted to their needs. In relation to statistical data, the Study highlights that the creation of the 2011 Labour Force Survey 55 ad hoc module focusing on employment of disabled people 56 and the imminent inclusion of a proxy variable on disability every two years in all population surveys coordinated by Eurostat are important achievements from a policy point of view. These results, combined with the analytical work of Academic Network of European Disability experts (ANED) 57 , are particularly important tools for the formulation of adequate policies and legislative initiatives in relation to disability and employment. On the other hand, the non-implementation of a specific indicator on employment of vulnerable groups by the EMCO indicators' group appears as a major shortcoming in the evaluation. Despite these results, the stakeholders' views on the extent to which the Strategy enabled many more persons with disabilities to earn their living on the open labour market are significantly diverging. Organisations representing persons with disabilities, business organisations and citizens responding to the public consultation tended to consider employment among the worst performing areas of the Strategy due to the persisting gaps between persons with disabilities and without disabilities: only 40% of the respondents with knowledge of the Strategy to the public consultation agreed\/somewhat agreed that progress for persons with disabilities had been made in the area of employment. On the other hand, institutional stakeholders at EU and Member State level consider that the Strategy has brought positive effects in the field of employment thanks to the improvements in statistical data and awareness raising. In terms of general outcomes, there has been an increase in economic activity rates and employment rates for persons with disabilities since the adoption of the Strategy in 2010. The activity rate (age group 20-64) in the EU-28 increased from 56.1% (2010) to 62.4% (2018) and the employment rate for the same age group increased from 46% (2010) to 52% (2018). A similar trend is observed for persons without disabilities. In addition, the employment gap between people with and without disabilities has decreased only slightly over the years, from 26 percentage points in 2010 to 24.2 percentage points in 2018 in the EU 28. 58 Thus, the Study suggests that the actions of the Strategy, which complement the activities of the Member States, have not been decisive for significantly reducing the labour market participation gap. It should also be noted that the respondents to the public consultation have identified employment as one of the five most important topics to be considered for the future policy (together with accessibility of buildings and public services, ageing and disability, independent living and inclusion in the community, children with disabilities and their families). 5.1.1.5 Education and training The study suggests that, although the Strategy contributed to promote inclusive education and lifelong learning for pupils and students with disabilities, its impact in this area is not clearly measurable. In this area, the EU has supporting competences and no power to propose or enact fundamental changes through legislation. Therefore, the activities proposed by the Strategy were mostly focused on soft law instruments, funding, and awareness-raising (research data collection and dissemination). The actions related to funding were those with highest implementation rate, whereas those relating to awareness raising were partially implemented. In the area of Education and training 36% of actions were fully implemented, 55% were partially implemented, and 9% were not implemented. This makes Education and training one of the areas with lower implementation rates, with concerns over its effectiveness raised by the Study. There was consensus among different types of EU level stakeholders interviewed that the Strategy achieved some significant results in supporting programmes for the inclusion of children with disabilities into education, trainings for teachers, educators and staff who work with children with disabilities, as well as in raising awareness and promoting good practices. Such programmes and policies supported the actions of the Member States to implement the Strategy objectives. Stakeholders representing persons with disabilities pointed out that in relation to education the Strategy did not include specific measures for the assistance to persons with disabilities in the transition from education to the labour market. On the other hand, the Study highlighted that in terms of outcomes, educational gaps between persons with disabilities and persons without disabilities still persist. The share of early school leavers with a disability (age group 18-24) in the EU increased between 2010 and 2016 from 21.6% to 23.6%, with a decrease to 19.9% in 2018. Over the same period, the share of early school leavers with no disability fell (from 12% in 2010 to 11% in 2016 and 9.9% in 2018). The gap between persons with and without disabilities has not changed significantly over the years, slightly deteriorating from 9.6 percentage points in 2010 to 10 percentage points in 2018. 59 Data from ANED show that educational gaps also persist among persons having completed a tertiary or equivalent education. In 2010, 22.6% of persons with disabilities as compared to 34.7% of those without disabilities (age group 30-39) completed a tertiary or equivalent education. In 2018, 32.6% of persons with disabilities completed tertiary or equivalent education as compared to 43.2% of those without disabilities. Thus, the gap between the two groups has not changed significantly throughout the years, remaining at around 12 percentage points. 5.1.1.6 Social protection For the area of social protection, the objective of the Strategy was to promote decent living conditions for persons with disabilities. The Study suggests that, although living conditions of persons with disabilities are a predominant competence of the Member States, and despite persisting gaps in social protection in relation to disability, the EU action in this field has contributed to better living conditions of persons with disabilities. Its policy actions, including the European Pillar of Social Rights, have contributed to the promotion of more inclusive social protection systems. The organisation and financing of social protection systems is mainly a responsibility of Member States and governance tools at EU level are predominantly of a soft nature. Within the scope of its competence, the EU has carried out an important range of initiatives for the promotion of decent living conditions. In terms of implementation, 67% of the actions under this area were fully implemented and 33% were partially implemented. As concerns general outcomes in the area of poverty and social exclusion, the situation of persons with disabilities has not changed substantially over the years. The gap between persons with disabilities and persons without disabilities has widened. According to Eurostat EU SILC statistics, the rate of persons with disabilities at risk of poverty and social exclusion in the EU-28 was 29.6% in 2010 (20.8% for those without disabilities) and 29.1% in 2019 (18.4% for those without disabilities) 60 . This means that over the same period, while the risk of poverty and social exclusion decreased by 2.4 percentage points for persons without disabilities, it decreased by only 0.5 percentage points for persons with disabilities. The data also show that gaps between persons without disabilities and persons with disabilities as regards the risk of poverty and social exclusion persist (8.8 percentage points in 2010 and 10.7 percentage points in 2019). Opinions of stakeholders about the success of the Strategy in promoting decent living conditions are diverging, even within the main groups of stakeholders. Overall, the Study suggests that the Strategy's objective of this area has been partially achieved. In 2017, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission jointly proclaimed 61 the European Pillar of Social Rights, an overall policy framework meant to achieve better working and living conditions in the EU. The European Pillar of Social Rights allows for a better degree of coordination, integration and improvement of social policies across the EU, and it specifically recognises the right of persons with disabilities to inclusion. The European Commission has proposed legislation to advance with the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, including a Directive on work-life balance 62 that was meanwhile adopted by the EU legislator, setting new and improving existing leave rights for parents and carers, and a Council recommendation on access to social protection for workers and the self-employed 63 that also covers disability and invalidity benefits. As concerns financial support, the EU invested into social inclusion and related national reforms via its Funds and programmes, such as the European Social Fund (ESF and ESF+) 64 , the European Regional Development Fund, the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme 65 and the EU programme for Employment and Social Innovation 66 , as well as through the Structural Reform Support programme 67 , where persons with disabilities are amongst the target groups. These investments helped to improve the situation of persons with disabilities, as they contributed to the development of social services, community based services and social economy. These improvements are also closely linked to deinstitutionalisation, a process that requires to couple the planned closure of long-stay residential institutions with the development of individualised services, and with making general services available to persons with disabilities. 5.1.1.7 Health Health is mainly a national competence and the EU can only complement Member State action through initiatives such as policy monitoring, mutual learning and funding. The Strategy included twelve actions to foster equal access to health services and related facilities for persons with disabilities. Throughout the period 58% of the actions under this area were fully implemented, 33% were partially implemented and 8% were not implemented. Despite these results, the Study suggests that the Strategy did not fully achieve its objectives in this area. This is mainly due to the limited scope of the actions, the limited competence of the EU in this field, the limited availability of data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities and the lack of disaggregated data, which have prevented the development of appropriate policies and their monitoring. Among the respondents to the public consultation only 38% of those with a disability agreed or somewhat agreed that the Strategy helped to improve health for persons with disabilities. Consultations with the Study national experts reach similar conclusions, with fifteen Member State reports concluding that the Strategy did not have a significant impact on improving the situation of persons with disabilities in the field of health at Member State level. Despite these considerations, the Study suggests that the Strategy helped in mainstreaming disability considerations in legislation notably on cross-border healthcare (the Patients' rights Directive 68 ). The Strategy also supported the production of statistics, data collection and monitoring activities, notably: -The development of the 2011 EU-LFS 69 ad-hoc module on the employment of persons with disabilities 70 -The European Health Interview Survey 71 -The 2012\/2013 European Health and Social Integration Survey (dedicated disability survey) 72 Data from EU-SILC indicate that there has been some improvement with regard to self-reported unmet needs for medical examination for persons with disabilities, which decreased from 7.6% in 2012 to 4.5% in 2019. As concerns persons without disabilities, it was 1.9% in 2012 and 1.1% in 2019. 73 The study in particular the Member States analysis also points to the importance of EU funding to resource implementation, particularly in areas like health where the EU has limited legislative competence. 5.1.1.8 External action Overall, the actions implemented during the Strategy contributed to promote the rights of persons with disabilities within the EU external action. However, because only two of the eleven actions of the Strategy were fully implemented (all other actions were partially implemented), the evaluation suggests that the objective has been partially achieved. This seems also reflected in the results of the public consultation responses in relation to external action, which may reflect a low level of knowledge among respondents of the actions in this area of the Strategy. At international level, the inclusion of external action as an area of the Strategy, together with the ratification by the EU of the UN Convention, has raised awareness that the EU wants to engage with countries across the globe to improve the situation for persons with disabilities. There are several important actions of significance for the implementation of this thematic area, including the promotion of disability rights in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019 74 and the publication by the European Commission of an operational guidance on the inclusion of persons with disabilities in EU-funded humanitarian aid operation 75 . Disability considerations have been included in the 2017 European Consensus on Development 76 as well as in the 2014 Council conclusions on a rights-based approach to development cooperation, encompassing all human rights 77 . In terms of capacity building, the network of disability focal points in EU Delegations and Headquarters has been relaunched in October 2019, and information on disability matters has been integrated in the Rights Based Approach training addressed to the staff. The Study suggests that the EU initiatives in the field of external action follow the framework of the UNCRPD. However, the Study also suggests that there is limited evidence that EU initiatives undertaken in this field have been significantly influenced by the Strategy. A shortcoming in the field of external action is related to the lack of indicators for planning and monitoring interventions with specific reference to disability (disability markers). The absence of these markers has limited the capacity to quantify disability initiatives in external action, and the extent to which the rights of persons with disabilities were promoted. However, the new OECD transversal disability policy marker 78 , which is in use in the Commission services of development cooperation since January 2019, will allow to follow up and assess the disability inclusion in the future. Finally, a few stakeholders active in the field of international cooperation suggested that inclusion in the Strategy of further actions could have contributed to the achievement of the objectives of the Strategy to better reflect the EU's commitment to disability inclusion. Further actions could have included, for example, promoting the use of the Washington Short Set of Questions 79 by partner countries as well as the refurbishing of EU institution buildings including EU Delegations in partner countries to make them accessible. 5.1.2 Achievement of objectives and implementation of the actions for the implementation instruments 5.1.2.1 Awareness raising The objective of the Strategy in this field was to raise society's awareness of disability issues and foster greater knowledge among people with disabilities of their rights and how to exercise them. Out of the five actions included in the Strategy, four have been fully implemented and one has been partially implemented. Although further efforts are needed to promote positive and realistic images of persons with disabilities in all sectors of society, the Strategy has given a significant contribution to awareness raising, especially at EU level. The Study suggests that the Strategy has been instrumental in increasing the level of awareness about disability issues at EU institutional level, also leading to more inclusive EU policies and legislation. The two main public disability events organised by the European Commission, the Access City Award 80 and the European Day of Persons with Disabilities 81 have gained growing visibility and momentum among disability stakeholders. For the 2020 edition of the Access City Award 82 , 47 cities from across the EU sent applications. During its ten years of existence, 321 cities have participated in the Access City Award. However, only 33% of respondents to the public consultation declared having knowledge about the European Access City Award (30% of individual respondents and 56% of organisations). This suggests that knowledge about the Access City Award is common among institutional stakeholders, and not only at EU-level, but still limited among the general public. The European day of Persons with Disabilities is an annual international conference gathering over 400 participants from all over the EU to discuss specific themes of importance for persons with disabilities. The conference is an important forum for discussion at EU level. It is regularly attended by Members of the College of the Commission, members of the European Parliament and representatives of EU and international institutions (such as the Fundamental Rights Agency and the United Nations), as well as umbrella organisations representing persons with disabilities at EU level, and persons with disabilities themselves, invited by the Commission. In the public consultation, 65% of respondents declared having knowledge of the European Day of Persons with Disabilities (59% of individual respondents and 85% of organisations). Major awareness raising campaigns have been organised throughout the European Union about topics related to disability. An example is the #EUvsDiscrimination campaign 83 on combating discrimination in the workplace. One of the main strands of the campaign addressed reasonable accommodation in the workplace for persons with disabilities (videos were produced and several events were held in Member States where the employment gaps between persons with and without disabilities are the largest). Based on feedback from experts and stakeholders, the Study suggests that there is growing awareness in society about disability and about rights of persons with disabilities and that this is strongly related to the adoption by all EU Member States of the UNCRPD. The Study also suggests that in the area of awareness raising, the Strategy has been complementary to the UNCRPD and has contributed to its implementation. 5.1.2.2 Financial support The objective of the Strategy in this field was to optimise use of EU funding instruments for accessibility and non-discrimination and increase visibility of disability-relevant funding possibilities in post-2013 programmes. The Study suggests that the objective has been partially achieved. The Strategy proposed the adoption of eleven actions in the field of financial support. Over 80% of the actions have been fully implemented. All stakeholders agree on the positive effect of EU funding for the implementation of Strategy, which in some key areas such as deinstitutionalisation was essential for its progress. The Study also pointed out some weaknesses of the EU financial support system. Funding was limited and not adequate for the full implementation of the Strategy. Financial resources allocated to social issues usually did not include dedicated budget lines for disability. Stakeholders also pointed out that funding is not fully accessible for persons with disabilities due to inaccessible procedures and administrative burdens, and that there is insufficient involvement of the disability community in funding programmes. 5.1.2.3 Statistics, Data Collection and Monitoring The objective of the Strategy in this field was to supplement the collection of periodic disability-related statistics with a view to monitoring the situation of persons with disabilities. The Study suggests that the objective has been partially achieved. The Strategy proposed the adoption of thirteen actions. Over 80% of the actions proposed in this field by Strategy have been fully implemented. Prior to the development of EU-wide statistics on disability, national definitions varied, as they were primarily used for determining benefit entitlements or for specific policies. The Study highlights that the work of Eurostat on incorporating disability considerations in their data collection especially regarding the incorporation in 2021 of a 2-year proxy variable on disability in all population surveys coordinated by Eurostat 84 is a significant step towards a more effective data collection on the situation of persons with disabilities in the EU. In addition, the work of the Fundamental Rights Agency on indicators on the types and characteristics of institutional and community-based services in the EU could provide valuable information on how to improve community-based living. However, in relation to overall indicator development and data collection, the Study suggests that there is a need for better data collection across the key priority areas of the Strategy and that statistics and data collection relating to the Strategy are insufficient, especially in relation to disaggregated data. This opinion has been expressed by several umbrella organisations representing persons with disabilities at EU level. While several important steps were taken to improve the measuring of the situation of persons with disabilities in the EU, there are still challenges in this field that have not been addressed by the Strategy. The Study suggests that the main challenges are: 1) No concrete targets for the Member States or indicators for measuring their progress when implementing disability-related policies within the European Semester; 2) No single uniform approach to measuring access to healthcare across the EU; 3) No disaggregated data on disability. 5.1.2.4 Mechanisms required by the UNCRPD The objective of the Strategy in this field is to establish a governance framework in line with Article 33 85 of the UN Convention on implementation and monitoring. The Study suggests that the objective has been achieved. The Strategy proposed the adoption of four actions in this field, which have been fully implemented. As a result, a mechanism for the coordination and the monitoring of the implementation of the UNCRPD has been established at EU institutional level. However, the Study also highlights that the mechanism does not include focal points at Directorate-General level within the European Commission as well as in other EU institutions. This somehow hindered the development of disability-related knowledge and the mainstreaming of disability considerations in EU legislative or policy actions. 5.1.3 Mainstreaming of disability issues in EU policy and legislation The Study shows that, overall, the Strategy achieved positive results in mainstreaming disability issues in EU policy and legislation and that one of the main achievements of the Strategy was the placement of the disability agenda higher among the EU policy priorities. At a strategic level, key EU policy initiatives such as the Europe 2020 strategy 86 , the European Pillar of Social Rights 87 , or the European Semester process 88 refer to disability issues and contain significant commitments to address the needs of persons with disabilities. Disability issues are also reflected in other strategies, such as the EU Health Strategy 2008-2013 89 , the EU Digital Strategy 90 , the mid-term review of the Education and Training 2020 (ET2020) framework 91 , the Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area 92 , the EU Youth Strategy 93 , the EU's Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 94 and the 2020 Communication re-launching the European Research Area 95 , as well as the Communication on Achieving the European Education Area by 2025 96 and the Digital Education Action Plan 97 . Recent policy documents such as the EU Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025 98 and the EU Action Plan against racism 2020-2025 99 point to the need to address intersectionalities between disability and other grounds of discrimination. Importantly, the Strategy was also instrumental in mainstreaming disability into the European Semester and several Member States received recommendations explicitly targeting disability. At a legislative level, the Strategy promoted greater change in areas where the EU has more competences. Initiatives with disability-related provisions include the European Accessibility Act, the passengers' rights regulations and the adoption of legislation in EU investment and structural funds regulation stating the obligation that services and infrastructure financed through EU funds should be accessible to persons with disabilities. Nevertheless, the Study also concludes that there are areas of improvement, particularly with regard to the mainstreaming of disability considerations in the field of consumer protection. The Study also suggests that, despite improved mainstreaming of disability in policy and legislation, overall awareness about the UNCRPD within the EU institutions is still limited. Lack of consideration for disability-related issues since the outset of policy initiatives has sometimes resulted in burdensome adaptions and amendments during the policy-making process or in non-inclusive policies. 5.1.4. Success factors in implementing the EU Strategy In relation to the effectiveness of the Strategy, the Study has identified the following elements as success factors for its implementation: -Use of different types of actions: the list of actions of the Strategy included a mix of different types of legislative and non-legislative initiatives, which have been complementary in achieving the Strategy's objectives. Legislative initiatives are binding in nature but have long implementation periods. Non-legislative initiatives (such as awareness raising, exchange of best practices and peer reviews) although non-binding, tend to yield results within shorter periods. -Integration with existing policy and legislative instruments: the Strategy leveraged on existing instruments to implement and mainstream disability at EU level. oIntegration with EU funds: funding legislation for the period 2014-2020 introduced a set of pre-conditions to be met by national authorities before funding, and requiring administrative capacity for the implementation and application of the UNCRPD and of anti-discrimination law and policy in the field of EU Funds. This resulted in a strong engagement at local level for more inclusive funding, especially in the field of accessibility. oIntegration of European Pillar of Social Rights and European Semester: the inclusion of disability in these two soft policy instruments allowed to further increase the visibility of disability policy at EU level and to issue specific disability-related recommendations in the context of the European Semester, thus creating stronger coordination between EU and Member States on disability policy. -Exchange of good practices and awareness-raising: the needs of persons with disabilities are similar across all countries. The exchange of good practices allowed individuals, organisations and governments to rely on a wide array of experiences and knowledge at EU level. Awareness raising activities allowed to reach types of stakeholders who are not always fully aware of disability issues (such as employers and companies). At international level, the ratification by the EU of the UNCRPD and the inclusion of external action as an area of the Strategy have made international stakeholders aware that the EU wants to engage with countries across the globe to improve the situation of persons with disabilities. -Joint effort with civil society: the implementation period of the Strategy saw an increased level of joint work and cooperation between civil society groups and EU institutions to deliver the Strategy, both through formal institutional governance arrangements and informal activities. The joint effort resulted in positive synergies especially in the following aspects: better understanding of problems and issues at stake, development of more inclusive policies and legislation, better awareness about disability issues at institutional level. 5.1.5 Gaps and challenges that hindered achievement of the objectives The evaluation has identified the following elements as hindering factors for the implementation of the Strategy: Design issues: -Lack of a comprehensive set of indicators and benchmarks: the Strategy had no comprehensive indicators and benchmarks to assess the degree to which its objectives were achieved. This makes it difficult to provide an objective evaluation of its progress and to set up adequate monitoring mechanisms. -No monitoring framework: the Strategy had no structured and operative framework for regularly monitoring or evaluating its implementation. A first assessment of the Strategy progress only took place in 2017 on the occasion of the mid-term review, when the Strategy was well under way. The implementation of a monitoring framework (with a dedicated baseline, data collection tools, a clear timeline and measurable objectives) would have allowed regular evaluation of its progress, early detection of delivery gaps and identification of possible mitigating actions. Such a framework, if implemented, would have also allowed the provision of regular and transparent information to external stakeholders about the progress of the Strategy. -Limited focus on non-visible disabilities and children's rights: actions, particularly in the area of accessibility, mostly focused on visible disabilities. The needs of persons with intellectual disabilities and with non-visible disabilities in general, have been taken into account to a lesser extent. These considerations also apply to children's rights, which were not adequately included in the Strategy. -Limited scope in relation to the UNCRPD: several stakeholders consider that the Strategy's scope did not capture the full range of rights of persons with disabilities, and that the Strategy should be aligned with the UNCRPD. The Strategy does not cover topics such as right to life, freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse, respect for privacy, respect for home and the family, and does not address women and children with disabilities, as well as people with disabilities from a minority or with a migrant\/refugee status. Some stakeholders, especially at Member State level, consider that an alignment with the UNCRPD would have made the Strategy more impactful. However, the Study also suggests that full alignment of the Strategy with the UNCRPD might have been difficult considering that many competences in the field of disability are the responsibility of Member States. Implementation issues: -Uneven knowledge of disability issues at EU institutional level: despite positive results in mainstreaming disability issues in policy and legislation, general knowledge about disability and about the UNCRPD across the European Commission as well as across other EU institutions is still uneven. The Study suggests that the absence of dedicated focal points in the Commission services has limited the understanding of crosscutting issues and, ultimately, the effectiveness of the Strategy. -Limited inclusion in policy-making process: disability considerations are not applied at all stages of the policy or the legislative procedure, while they should be considered since the early stages of the process. -Limited training: the evaluation suggests that occasional training on disability has been provided to personnel working in the EU institutions, but that the training did not result in adequate general awareness on disability and in adequate knowledge among persons directly involved in disability policy-making. -Varying capacity of Member States and Regions to implement disability policies: due to the split of competences between the EU and the Member States, a broad range of factors influenced the general outcomes and important parts of the Strategy's impact (and achievement of the Strategy's objectives) depended on Member States action. Following the global financial crisis and the recession, there were widespread public spending cuts, which reduced the capacity of some Member States to implement actions related to the Strategy. -Limited knowledge sharing at stakeholder level: there has been a significant volume of research and information on good practice generated since 2010 across the eight areas of action. However, coordination of relevant partners at EU level and between Member States in mutual learning has been carried out only to a limited extent. Better knowledge sharing would have maximised the impact of available information and would have created better awareness and stronger connections between policy-makers and experts. 5.1.6 Engagement of stakeholders in the Strategy's implementation The Study suggests that Member States, EU institutions and organisations representing persons with disabilities have been adequately engaged in the Strategy's implementation via institutional mechanisms, public events, public consultations and informal meetings. These initiatives bring together a high number of stakeholders. They facilitate the exchange of information and ideas on policies and practices, and they stimulate the creation and the consolidation of disability networks. The Study suggests that the most effective fora for engaging with stakeholders at EU level are the following: -Disability High Level Group: meeting twice a year, it involves representatives of Member States' institutions, the Commission, the Council of Europe and civil society on issues relating to disability and aims at facilitating the exchange of information, experiences, and good practices in the areas of disability and the implementation of UNCRPD as State Parties. -Work Forum on the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the EU and the Member States: is an event organised annually since 2010. The Forum involves persons with disabilities through their representative organisations, focal points, coordination mechanisms, monitoring mechanisms of the UNCRPD from the Member States and the EU and relevant international bodies. It specifically focuses on the implementation of the UNCRPD through exchanges on concrete measures undertaken by the States Parties and dissemination of information. -Strategic Dialogue Meetings: these meetings are organised on a monthly basis with civil society organisations, notably the ones active in the field of disability pursuing collective interests, and aim at advancing ideas in the field of disability in the areas of employment, inclusion and social affairs. -Annual Conference for Inclusive Growth: organized once a year, it is an action-oriented platform bringing together civil society organisations and policy-makers active in the field of employment, inclusion and social affairs to discuss how to achieve truly inclusive growth. The conference systematically includes a workshop related to specific disability issues related to the main topic of the annual conference, in order to ensure that the disability angle is taken into account in the debates and conclusions. -European Day of Persons with Disabilities: annual international conference gathering over 400 participants (persons with disabilities and their families, organizations representing persons with disabilities, experts, EU officials, politicians) from all over the EU to discuss specific themes of importance for persons with disabilities and ensure awareness-raising about disability policies at the EU and Member States levels. In terms of wider participation and in line with the Better Regulation provisions, the launch of the evaluation of all major EU policy and legislative initiatives (including the launch of the Strategy, its mid-term review, its final evaluation and the launch of any initiative having impact on disability) includes a wide consultation process involving all relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, private citizens are given the opportunity to express their views through regular on-line public consultations published on the 'Have your say' section of the Commission website. The online public consultation launched in 2019 on the occasion of the final evaluation of the strategy saw an increased participation by citizens and organizations compared to the mid-term review of 2017 (2,547 participants in 2019 versus 1,518 participants in 2017). In 2019, 1,237 respondents were persons with disabilities or caring for a person with disabilities. In 2017 their number was 563. Consultation with all relevant stakeholders, when carried out, has proven beneficial for both the stakeholders and the Strategy by providing a constant flow of feedback, opinions and ideas about all aspects of Strategy's implementation, with important insights for the preparation of the future disability policy. However, in terms of stakeholder engagement, the study has also identified the following shortcomings: -Civil society organisations have not always been involved throughout the whole lifecycle of disability-related initiatives, especially in their conception phase. -Current fora do not always involve stakeholders representing the interests of persons with disabilities in the workforce (such as trade unions and support organisations of workers). -Meetings of the Disability High Level Group do not provide for sufficient space for exchange of experiences, benchmarks and good practices. More information on stakeholders' consultation activities in the context of this evaluation is available in Annex 2. 5.2 Efficiency 5.2.1 Cost-effectiveness of the Strategy An overall assessment about the cost-effectiveness of the Strategy is difficult to quantify in objective terms. The Strategy is a soft-policy instrument with no dedicated budget and its results, which concern the participation of persons with disabilities in society and economic life, cannot easily be measured in economic terms. Moreover, most of the actions and objectives of the Strategy are carried out by different actors. As a general conclusion, the evaluation found that the Strategy was designed and implemented efficiently. This conclusion is based on the analysis of the costs of the Strategy and on feedback provided by relevant stakeholders in relation to its effectiveness. The evaluation also suggests that EU funds were effective in promoting and implementing de-institutionalisation as well as in supporting accessibility and social inclusion for persons with disabilities. As for other financial resources, grants to organisations representing persons with disabilities at EU level and funds for organising public events (such as the European Day of Persons with Disabilities, the Annual Conference on Inclusive Growth or the Access City Award) have proven highly effective in stimulating debate and in raising awareness about disability at EU level. 5.2.2 Adequateness and proportionality of resources The Study suggests that the resources allocated to the Strategy were not fully adequate and proportionate. Many stakeholders expressed the view that resources were not adequate for achieving the Strategy's objectives. This opinion was more common among persons who declared having limited knowledge of the Strategy rather than among individuals having knowledge of the Strategy and among organisations representing persons with disabilities. On a positive note, the Study suggests that the Strategy has contributed to the increase of overall resources for disability-related issues, by raising general visibility and awareness on disability. EU funds remain the main source of funding, but the lack of clear and binding links between the Strategy and the EU funds was sometimes detrimental to the proportionate allocation of resources and their use for disability-related initiatives. In fact, many EU-funded initiatives, once implemented at national level, followed a broad-based approach aimed at solving general social problems rather than focusing on specific issues. As a result, disability-specific needs were sometimes overlooked during the implementation of those initiatives. 5.3 Relevance 5.3.1 Relevance of the Strategy in addressing the needs of persons with disabilities The evaluation suggests that the Strategy has been relevant and continues to be relevant in addressing the rights and needs of persons with disabilities and in influencing EU law and policy processes. The EU's ratification of the UNCRPD means that the Convention is part of the EU legal order. All EU Member States have also ratified the Convention. The Strategy, as the main instrument to implement the UNCRPD at EU level, helps to ensure that EU policies and initiatives relevant for persons with disabilities are designed and implemented in line with the UNCRPD provisions. Member States are also required to present their strategies to implement the Convention within the areas for which they are responsible and competent. The European Pillar of Social Rights and the European Semester are policy instruments used to coordinate economic and social policy processes across the EU. The Strategy has been instrumental in shaping and giving practical implementation to many principles of the Pillar, and specifically to principle 17, dedicated to the inclusion of persons with disabilities 100 . In relation to the European Semester, the Strategy has provided a policy framework for identifying actions and recommendations to be included in the Semester's process and for pursuing the overall goal of the Europe 2020 strategy to create 'smart, sustainable and inclusive growth'. As persons with disabilities experience significant barriers in education, employment, and social protection, the Strategy has been relevant to pursue the European 2020 headline targets relating to employment, education, poverty and social exclusion. The Study suggests that the Strategy remains relevant in addressing the needs of persons with disabilities because it guides EU work in the implementation of the UNCRPD and it ensures mainstreaming of disability across all EU policies. However, the Study also suggests that the content of the Strategy had a strong operational nature due to the emphasis on detailed and numerous implementation actions, and that the role of its policy provisions was rather limited. 5.3.2 Relevance of the Strategy for its different stakeholders The Study suggests that the Strategy was highly relevant for institutions and stakeholders at EU level, due to its role in implementing the UNCRPD at EU level, but had limited visibility at Member State and citizen's level. EU level stakeholders also widely agree that the areas of the Strategy remain relevant also for the future (with a relatively lower score for external action, that might be due to the fact that external action in the disability area is a priori less visible and impactful for EU stakeholders). Figure 4: Relevance of the current areas of action for future disability strategy Source: ICF analysis On the other hand, key policy-makers at Member State level seem to have prevalently some familiarity or no familiarity with the Strategy, which suggests a relative influence of the Strategy at this level. The table hereunder provides a breakdown about the level of familiarity with the Strategy among policy-makers and organizations representing persons with disabilities in the Member States. Table 2: Familiarity with the Strategy in the Member States How familiar with the Strategy are the policy makers (government) in your country? Very Familiar Somewhat familiar Not familiar PT, UK BE, BG, CY, CZ, DE, DK, EE, FR, EL, HR, LU, MT, RO, SI, SK AT, ES, FI, HU, IE, IT, LT, LV, NL,PL, SE How familiar with the Strategy are organisations representing persons with disabilities in your country? Very Familiar Somewhat familiar Not familiar DK, RO AT, BE, BG, CY, CZ, DE, EE, ES, FR, EL, HR, PT, SE, SK, UK FI, HU, IE, IT, LT, LU, LV, MT, NL, PL, SI Source: Member State analysis performed by national experts in the context of the Study 5.4 Coherence 5.4.1 Internal coherence of the Strategy The evaluation suggests that there was a good level of coherence among the eight thematic areas and the four implementation instruments from a policy design perspective as they incorporate key issues relevant to improve the situation of persons with disabilities in the EU. From a policy design perspective, the Strategy combined well actions to remove barriers and empowering persons with disabilities to participate in society. It covered the fundamental issues of accessibility, participation, and equality. Removal of barriers in these areas are pre-conditions for success of specific measures related to employment, education and training, social protection and health. In this sense, the Strategy provided a coherent, stepwise framework to address issues that prevent persons with disabilities from playing a full role in society. The implementation instruments have proven to be a valid support for implementing specific measures included in the Strategy. For example, improved statistics helped improving targeting and assessment of the impact of particular actions, and funding supported delivery of particular actions. However, the Study suggests that, from an operational perspective, the objectives are not always coherent with the related actions of the Strategy because some of them are formulated in ambitious terms. If taken literally, their achievement would have required actions with a much wider scope, funding and strength, in terms of capacities as well as of outreach potential, than those of the Strategy. This consideration particularly applies to the overall aim of the Strategy (empower people with disabilities so that they can enjoy their full rights) and to the objectives in the areas of participation (achieve full participation of people with disabilities in society by enabling them to enjoy all the benefits of EU citizenship, removing administrative and attitudinal barriers to full and equal participation, providing quality community-based services, including access to personal assistance) and equality (eradicate discrimination on grounds of disability in the EU). 5.4.2 Coherence of the Strategy with other EU policies\/ actions (Europe 2020, the European Pillar of Social Rights, the European Semester, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the EU funding provisions) In relation to external coherence of the Strategy, it is important to distinguish between instruments that pre-date the Strategy (e.g. the Charter of Fundamental Rights) and those that were adopted after the Strategy (e.g. the European Pillar of Social Rights). Considering that the EU ratified the UNCRPD in 2010 and that the Strategy provided a clear policy framework in the same year, EU policies and actions adopted after 2010 are generally aligned with the Strategy. However, it is important to note that the Strategy was not updated after its mid-term evaluation in 2016, therefore policy developments (e.g. Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development) or the Concluding Observations of the CRPD Committee were not incorporated in the Strategy. -Europe 2020: is the EU's economic strategy for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth covering the same period as the Strategy. In general terms, the degree of correlation between the two instruments is not strong. In fact the only mention of disability in Europe 2020 is under the flagship initiative European Platform against Poverty, where Member States are called to define and implement measures addressing the specific circumstances of groups at particular risk, including persons with disabilities. However, the disability angle, although not highlighted in Europe 2020, is particularly relevant from an inclusive growth point of view because persons with disabilities are usually at a higher risk of poverty, exclusion and unemployment. It can be concluded that, in relation to Europe 2020, the Strategy played an important complementary role by helping to focus on the achievement of Europe 2020 objectives from a disability point of view. -The European Pillar of Social Rights: was proclaimed in 2017 to serve as a compass for delivering new and more effective social rights for citizens. Principle 17 on inclusion of persons with disabilities states that \"persons with disabilities have the right to income support that ensures living in dignity, services that enable them to participate in the labour market and in society, and a work environment adapted to their needs\". The Pillar therefore has a high degree of coherence with the Strategy and it thus provided a broader context for the implementation of the Strategy actions and for mainstreaming its impact for several areas of the Strategy (social protection, accessibility, participation, employment). -The European Semester: is the EU's annual cycle to monitor economic and social progress, launched in 2010. During the first years of the cycle disability issues were not frequently referenced. Some recommendations, particularly those oriented towards reform of social protection and austerity measures, have actually been detrimental to reaching the objectives of the Strategy because they led to a reduction of public expenditure. However, considerations on disability have increased in recent years and were included in country reports and in the recommendations addressed to Member States. It can be concluded that in the early years provisions of the European Semester were not coherent with the overall purpose of the Strategy and have partly hindered its implementation. However, in recent years the European Semester has increasingly aligned its provisions with the aims of the Strategy, thus providing a good level of coherence. -The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union mentions disability in Article 21 on Non-discrimination and Article 26 on Integration of persons with disabilities. Article 21 prohibits discrimination on several grounds, including disability. Article 26 states that \"The Union recognizes and respects the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration, and participation in the life of the community\". The Strategy is coherent with the Charter, and plays a complementary role for the practical implementation of its principles. -The EU funding provisions: the implementation period of the Strategy covers two Multi-Annual Financial Frameworks (MFF), the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020. In the current period, there are provisions on requiring that EU Funds are used to promote accessibility, non-discrimination, and respect for human rights of persons with disabilities. The European Social Fund (ESF) supports the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the areas of employment, training, social innovation, social services through specific objectives, and particularly thematic objective 9 on social inclusion. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) prioritizes the promotion of social inclusion, de-institutionalization and the fight against discrimination, while considering the specific needs of persons with disabilities in the area of accessibility. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme promotes the rights of persons with disabilities and non-discrimination through specific funding to EU level disability organizations, research, and training and awareness-raising actions. The evaluation suggests that there is a strong level of coherence between the Strategy and EU funds. 5.4.3 Coherence of the Strategy with the UNCRPD The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 was adopted on 15 November 2010, several days before the EU acceded to the UNCRPD in December 2010. This means that technically the Strategy does not implement the UNCRPD. Nevertheless, the Convention guided the drafting process of the Strategy and policy-makers of the Commission were well aware of the UNCRPD when preparing the Strategy. As result, the Strategy is fully aligned and coherent with the principles of the UNCRPD and the eight thematic areas covered in the Strategy closely link to specific provisions of the UNCRPD. The Strategy does not cover all the areas of the Convention. Many stakeholders consider that this reduces the level of coherence between the two policy tools. But many aspects of disability policy are, to a large extent, of Member States competence and the Strategy's scope focuses on areas where EU action proves more effective. Coverage of the full scope of the Convention would have required a broader scope of the strategy with the coverage of actions and policies for which the Member States are primarily responsible. 5.4.4 Coherence of the Strategy with the related policy measures in Member States In general, national priority measures were coherent with EU level actions under the eight thematic areas of the Strategy. There were some differences among areas, with the highest level of coherence in the area of Accessibility and the lowest level of coherence in the area of Social protection. Figure 5: Alignment between national priority measures and the areas of action of the Strategy Source: ICF analysis of public consultation Specific statement: The national priority measures of your Member State are in line with the 8 areas of action of the Strategy In the area of Accessibility, consistency between the Strategy's objectives and the policy measures at Member State level was reinforced through the adoption of binding legislative acts such as the Web Accessibility Directive, the European Accessibility Act, the passengers' rights regulations and the EU funds regulations. On the other hand, in relation to social protection, the economic policies adopted by the Member States during and after the financial crisis have generally reduced public spending, thus also reducing expenditure for social protection. This resulted in limited coherence between the objective of the Strategy in the area of social protection and the actions implemented at Member State level in this field. The evaluation points out that the most influential policy framework for Member States' disability policy is the UNCRPD. The overall coherence between Member States' policies and the Strategy is due to their adherence to the principles of the UNCRPD. The table hereunder reflects the most common responses from Member State reports across each area of action. Table 3: Examples of Member State policies and comparison with the objectives of the Strategy Areas of Action In what way are policy objectives coherent with the Strategy? In what ways do trends in Member States differ from the Strategy's objectives? What are the most influential policy frameworks? Accessibility National accessibility measures adopted based on European Directives such as the European Accessibility Act and Web Accessibility Directive. Accessibility not fully achieved in accordance with EU legal standards; Member State reports mention lack of access to transport services, buildings, housing and lack of universal design. UNCRPD, the European Accessibility Act and the Web Accessibility Directive. Some reports also mention national disability strategies and domestic laws on accessibility. Participation Programmes for transition from institutional to community-based care. As well as, national initiatives and legislation promoting participation in elections, cultural activities, public administration and employment. Insufficient development of community-based services and persistence of institutionalisation. Equal participation has not been achieved e.g. low labour market participation, shortage of personal assistance services and limited agenda for independent living. UNCRPD and national acts\/legislation related to equal rights and participation. Equality National anti-discrimination and equal rights legislation covering persons with disabilities. Persons with disabilities deprived of legal capacity under guardianship systems. Discrimination towards people with disabilities has not been eradicated. UNCRPD, European anti-discrimination legislation (e.g. Directive 2000\/78\/EC) and the Strategy. A few countries mentioned national policies for equal opportunities for persons with disabilities. Employment National policies for increasing participation of persons with disabilities in the open labour market including reforms in national legislation supporting employment of persons with disabilities and use of European Social Fund for employment of persons with disabilities. Failure to substantially increase the employment rate of persons with disabilities and lack of transition mechanisms from education to employment.

Figure 6: Extent to which the Strategy has delivered added value in implementing the UNCRPD Source: DG EMPL survey of Disability High Level Group (DHLG) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) Specific statement: The Strategy has delivered added value in helping eliminate barriers for persons with disabilities and in helping implement the UNCRPD compared to what would have been achieved without it. In fact, the ratification of the Convention by the EU and its Member States created momentum for a more ambitious and effective disability policy, and the absence of a strategic framework on disability would have left the decisions regarding implementation of the UNCRPD to the agendas of single services, with possible negative effects in terms of internal coherence. As a result, the main added value of the Strategy was to provide coherence to the implementation of the UNCRPD at EU level. At Member State level, the evaluation suggests that the Strategy had a more limited effect, mostly due to the limited competences of the EU in a number of policy fields relevant to disability (for instance health and education and training) and to the limited knowledge of the Strategy by national policy-makers. An exception to this is the European Semester, a process whereby individual Member States receive recommendations on economic and social measures to be implemented. During the last years, a growing number of recommendations regarding disability has been included in the recommendations addressed to Member States. On top of the actions put in place by the Member States to implement the recommendations, an important side effect of these recommendations was the promotion of policy debate about disability and about the UNCRPD in the Member States. Overall, it is not easy to quantify to what extent the Strategy has translated into significant impact in the elimination of barriers for persons with disabilities. The lack of disaggregated data on disability and the long-term effect of some of the Strategy's actions make it difficult to assess progress in the situation of persons with disabilities. However, based on the feedback received by stakeholders and on the results of the public consultation, it appears that the majority of stakeholders agrees that EU action has helped to improve the situation of persons with disabilities in the last ten years. Figure 7: Role of EU initiatives in improving the situation of persons with disabilities in the last ten years Source: ICF analysis of public consultation Specific statement: Overall, EU initiatives have helped to improve the situation of persons with disabilities in the last ten years 6.Conclusions The objective of this evaluation was to review the implementation of the European disability strategy 2010-2020 and to assess to which extent the Strategy translated into sound policies and planned changes, as well as the way it influenced implementation of the UNCRPD at EU level. The evaluation covered the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value of the Strategy. These criteria were examined in an external study, and built upon by the information gathered through consultation activities, including an open public consultation, targeted consultations and interviews with a range of relevant stakeholders and various other secondary sources. Overall conclusion The evaluation concludes that the Strategy made a significant contribution to the implementation of the UNCRPD at EU level and to the implementation of several important legislative and policy instruments in the field of disability. However, not all the actions of the Strategy were fully implemented, and its objectives were partially achieved. Main achievements The Strategy had a positive impact on overall disability policy, as it contributed to a change towards a human rights-based approach in this area. The existence of a high-level EU policy document in this field significantly contributed to placing the disability agenda higher among the EU policy priorities and it opened the EU institutional space to persons with disabilities. Being the tool for implementing the UNCRPD at EU level, the Strategy has supported the implementation of the Convention by translating its principles into practical objectives and actions. During its 10 year implementation period, the Strategy was a driver for including disability in EU legislation and policy. The influence of the Strategy on legislative and policy instruments was particularly visible in the areas of accessibility and passengers' rights, with the adoption of the European Accessibility Act , the Web Accessibility Directive and legislation on the Rights of Passengers with Reduced Mobility . There was also visible impact through EU funding in the area of support to de-institutionalisation, as well as of accessibility, support for social inclusion and promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities. Key outputs included awareness raising and civil dialogue events contributing to the promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities. The Strategy was a driver for helping in mainstreaming disability issues at EU institutional level. Examples of disability mainstreaming include development cooperation, standardisation, State Aid, copyright legislation, education programmes. Disability was also mainstreamed throughout the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights and the disability-related Country Specific Recommendations under the European Semester, thus supporting Member States in applying the principles of the UNCRPD at national level. The Strategy, through the establishment of the Mechanisms required by the UNCRPD, made an important contribution to ensuring the involvement of persons with disabilities and their representative organisations in the EU decision-making. The resulting exchange of feedback, opinions and ideas about disability policy contributed to a better understanding of problems and issues at stake, the development of more inclusive policies and legislation, and an increased awareness about disability issues at institutional level. Main shortcomings The main shortcoming of the Strategy is related to aspects of its design. The Strategy, since its conception, did not include a comprehensive set of benchmarks and indicators for measuring the extent to which its actions were carried-out and its objectives achieved. It was also missing an operative framework for regularly monitoring its implementation. The absence of those two elements, together with the limited availability of regularly collected and disaggregated data in all areas of disability, prevented the regular evaluation of the Strategy's progress, the early detection of delivery gaps and the identification of possible mitigating actions. Such a framework, if implemented, would have also allowed the provision of regular information to all involved stakeholders and its absence is one of the reasons for the partial achievement of the Strategy's objectives. Despite the cross-cutting nature of disability policy and the ratification of the UNCRPD by the EU, knowledge of disability issues across the EU institutions remained uneven. Despite the European Commission's role as focal point for implementing the UNCRPD at EU level, awareness of the UNCRPD and of the needs of persons with disabilities are not equally present across its different services; similar considerations on the need to improve knowledge and awareness around disability can be made for the other EU institutions. As a result, UNCRPD provisions and needs of persons with disabilities were not always fully taken into account in the EU policy-making processes. Actions, particularly in the area of accessibility, mostly focused on visible disabilities. The needs of persons with intellectual disabilities, and with invisible disabilities in general, have been taken into account to a lesser extent. These considerations also apply to children's rights, which were not adequately included in the Strategy. Overall, the Strategy achieved partial results in implementing the foreseen actions and in reaching the set objectives. Only two thirds of the actions were fully implemented, and the majority of the objectives for the areas of the Strategy were not fully achieved. The main reasons identified in this respect are: -The lack of a framework for regularly monitoring the Strategy's progress prevented a regular review of implementation and the adoption of corrective actions. -Some of the actions, although implemented, did not bring the expected results. -Some of the objectives, especially in the areas of equality, were rather ambitious, notably because they were supported by actions that were not always sufficient for their achievement. -Some of the EU actions were conceived to supplement and support Member States action and part of the Strategy's impact (and achievement of the Strategy's objectives) depended on Member States. However, following the global financial crisis and the recession there were widespread public spending cuts that reduced the capacity of some Member States to implement actions related to the Strategy. -The financial resources available at EU level for disability-related actions were not adequate and proportionate. -In spite of the different benefits of EU funding, the lack of clear and binding links between the Strategy and the EU funds was sometimes detrimental to the proportionate allocation of resources and their use for disability-related initiatives. In fact, initiatives having a clear purpose (such as, for example, funding de-institutionalisation) were more effective in addressing disability issues than those focusing on general social issues. Lessons learned Realistic objectives supported by adequate actions: the Strategy included certain ambitious objectives which were not always supported by equally ambitious actions. This sometimes resulted in implementation gaps between the objectives of the Strategy and the achieved results. Objectives and actions should thus be better aligned. Measurable policy indicators: it is necessary to ensure a comprehensive set of quantitative indicators, of a clear timeline and of a monitoring mechanism for measuring progress of the Strategy in order to create a momentum for addressing delays and weaknesses in the course of the implementation of the Strategy. Statistics and data collection: a comprehensive framework of statistic indicators covering all the key priority areas of the Strategy is needed to identify gaps, to measure progress in the situation of persons with disabilities in the EU and to set clear targets for the Strategy. In general terms, EU-wide disaggregated data on persons with disabilities would be an important tool for monitoring and evaluating European policies aimed at improving the situation of persons with disabilities. Disability knowledge: knowledge by policymakers at EU institutional level about disability issues and about the UNCRPD has to be equally present across services. Unequal knowledge proved to be an obstacle for inclusive and efficient policymaking. Involvement of persons with disabilities: consulting and involving persons with disabilities (and notably organisations representing persons with disabilities) from the start of any legislative and policy initiative relating to persons with disabilities is a key element for delivering effective and inclusive policy making. Progress at national level: a comprehensive overview and monitoring of progress regarding the situation of persons with disabilities requires an evaluation of EU-level action as well as of national-level action. Limitation of the evaluation of the current strategy to EU-level action had consequences for the implementation results of the Strategy. This element will have to be taken into account in future policy decisions.

Most of the consultation activities were carried out by an external contractor 108 on behalf of DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL). Prior to the evaluation, an Evaluation Roadmap 109 was published for consultation between 29 August and 26 October 2018. The 13 respondents to the consultation included 10 non-governmental organisations, 2 business associations, and 1 private citizen. The feedback received on the Roadmap suggested that: -EU Disability Strategy should recognise there are different forms of disability which impact on citizens in various ways, requiring varied and personalised forms of intervention and support; -Persons with disabilities should be involved in the evaluation and they should be consulted in the drafting of the online consultation; -Targeted consultation should offer ensure full accessibility in terms of languages as well as of disability-related needs, in order to reach a larger number of respondents; -In terms of proposals for a new European Disability Strategy, the role of the social economy in integrating persons with disabilities into society and the economy should be promoted. These aspects were considered in the design and delivery of the evaluation. The consultation activities undertaken during the evaluation were the following: -A public consultation published on the European Commission's 'Have your say' portal and open to all EU citizens and organisations; -Semi-structured interviews with EU stakeholders, selected by the contractor in cooperation with Commission services. This included the following types of stakeholders: European Institutions, UNCRPD Coordination Mechanisms and Monitoring entities, Organisations representing persons with disabilities, Non-governmental organisations, Social partners, Academia and education, Service providers\/ private business representatives, and Equality and human rights bodies; -Semi-structured interviews with Member State stakeholders and focus groups with Member State stakeholders. 1.Target groups and consultation undertaken for the evaluation Three different target groups were established for the evaluation: 1.The general public 2.EU level stakeholders 3.Member State level stakeholders Each method targeted specific stakeholders to collect particular forms of data. An overview of the target groups, consultation methods, and those consulted is provided below in Figure 1. Figure 1: Consultation methods and their target groups Source: ICF analysis 2.Public consultation The public consultation was launched on 31 July 2019 and was closed on 13 November 2019. It was hosted on the European Commission website. The public consultation collected views from a wide range of respondents (including stakeholder organisations and interested citizens living in the EU) on their perceptions of the European Disability Strategy, its implementation to date, and their opinions on important future priorities in disability policy. The questionnaire was developed based on discussions with DG EMPL and pertinent Commission services to ensure that the public consultation would meet the requirements of the evaluation and provide the European Commission with a useful evidence base on which to base further actions in the disability policy area. To disseminate the public consultation, the contractor worked with Member State experts to promote the public consultation to key stakeholders and their networks at both EU and Member State levels. In addition, the contractor worked with the European Disability Forum (EDF), an umbrella organisation of persons with disabilities, to promote the public consultation. This was done through the creation of social media posts in different EU languages and by sending these out through the EDF social media channels. Figure 2: Public consultation respondents per country of origin Source: ICF analysis of public consultation A total of 2,547 responses were submitted from all EU Member States. Respondents included Academic\/research institutions, Business and Consumer organisations, Environmental organisations, Non-governmental organisations (NGOs), Public authorities, Trade unions and other forms of stakeholders. A total of 573 (22.5%) responses were from organisations, whereas 1974 (77.5%) responses came from individuals. Two versions of the questionnaire, a standard version and an easy-to-read version, were published, each accessible in all 24 official EU languages. In addition to the responses received to the public consultation questionnaire, a total of 107 position papers were received. Among the position papers, 37 were in English and 70 were in other EU languages. A process for examining each of these documents was followed, with the documents analysed by a native speaker to determine their relevance to each evaluation criterion. Of the one hundred and seven documents were submitted, forty-nine contained relevant information for the evaluation. Key point summaries were prepared for useful documents that could be incorporated into the evaluation's evidence base. Results from the public consultation Effectiveness The public consultation provided some useful data with which to understand overall progress for persons with disabilities and the contribution of the Strategy: -Overall, 56% of respondents agreed or somewhat agreed that the situation for persons with disabilities improved over the past 10 years in their Member State, with 52% of respondents agreeing or somewhat agreeing that the contribution of the Strategy helped in this improvement. -Among persons with a disability 52% agreed or somewhat agreed that the situation for persons with disabilities improved in the past 10 years in their Member State, 48% agreed or somewhat agreed that the Strategy contributed to improving the situation. -74% of organisations and 51% of individuals agreed or somewhat agreed that the situation of persons with disabilities improved over the past 10 years in their MS. 63% of organisations and 47% of individuals somewhat agreed or agreed that the Strategy has helped to improve the situation for persons with disabilities in their MS. -Of those stating they had knowledge of the Strategy 33% agreed or somewhat agreed that the situation for persons with disabilities had improved over the last 10 years in their Member State, 52% of such respondents agreed or somewhat agreed that the Strategy helped to improve the situation for persons with disabilities. The table overleaf summarises the effectiveness results from the public consultation for different areas of the Strategy. Key points which emerge from this analysis: -The area of accessibility (66%), followed by participation (55%), education and training (54%), and equality (51%) are the areas where most respondents identify that greatest progress has been made in improving the lives of persons with disabilities. -The areas of employment (40%) and health (41%) are the areas of action where lowest levels of progress for persons with disabilities were observed by survey respondents. In the area of health 46% of persons with disabilities disagreed there had been improvement, with 5% stating the same in the area of Employment. -For each area of action, a greater number of respondents with no disability agree or somewhat agree that there has been progress for persons with disabilities than those with a disability.

The proportion of respondents who \"agreed\" or \"somewhat agreed\" that the resources were adequate varied between 15% (for the area of external action) and 26% (for the area of accessibility). -The proportion of respondents that did not agree that funding for the Strategy was adequate ranged from 28% (for the area of action \"external action\") and 44% (for the area of employment). -Respondents with disabilities or those caring for someone with a disability were more likely to disagree that the Strategy was adequately resourced than those with no disability. Additionally, a higher share of organisations than individuals agreed that the Strategy was adequately resourced. Coherence In relation to the coherence of the Strategy with measures established in Member States, data analysis of public consultation responses shows that: -Around 40% of the respondents agree, or somewhat agree that the national priority measures of their country are in line with the 8 areas of action of the EDS. This view was most frequently expressed by organisations (50%) and least frequently by individuals (30%) and those with disabilities (35%). -When looking at the different areas of action of the Strategy there is significant difference in the views of survey respondents between the areas of the Strategy: -In the specific area of accessibility, a greater share of respondents (51%) than for other areas of the Strategy agreed\/somewhat agreed that there was alignment between national policy and the Strategy. -Of those respondents that disagreed\/somewhat disagreed that national priorities were aligned with the Strategy (36% on average), the most common areas of the Strategy that were identified as lacking coherence with national policy were: employment (43%) and social protection (40%). Relevance Analysis of the responses from the public consultation found that the thematic areas of the Strategy are still considered relevant for the future. Around 66% of the respondents of the public consultation found 7 of the 8 areas of the Strategy still relevant for the future, whereas 55% considered external action also relevant. Added value From the public consultation, the following findings emerge from this analysis: -At Member State level, 52% of respondents agreed or somewhat agreed that the Strategy had helped to improve the situation for persons with disabilities, compared to 53% who stated the same for the effect of the Strategy at EU level. -Relatively few respondents stated that the Strategy had not helped to improve the situation of persons with disabilities (27% stated they somewhat disagreed or disagreed it had at Member State level, compared to 11% answering the same in relation to throughout the EU). -Interestingly, there were a high level of respondents stating that they do not know whether the Strategy had helped to improve the situation for persons with disabilities at EU level (20%) and worldwide (38%). Important topics Respondents were also asked to express their views about the most important topics in the area of disability. Accessibility, ageing, independent living, children with disabilities and employment were considered the most important. Figure 3: Public consultation important topics identified by respondents Source: ICF analysis of public consultation EU stakeholder interviews Consultations with EU stakeholders took place in the form of interviews and occurred face-to-face and via telephone to accommodate availability and preference of interviewees. Interviews were conducted from September 2019 to December 2019 and lasted between 45 to 90 minutes. These interviews with EU stakeholders helped further develop findings of the desk research and allowed stakeholders to provide evidence to answer the research questions. The semi-structured interviews used a topic guide covering key issues to inform the evaluation framework. Individual questions were formulated to assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and added value of the European Disability Strategy, to understand the current situation of people with disabilities in the EU and to gather opinions on the future direction of EU disability strategy. Interview questions were tailored according to the type of stakeholder consulted. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with EU-level stakeholders. An initial list of relevant stakeholders was identified through desk research and refined based on suggestions from the Inter Service Steering Group established by the European Commission to oversee the evaluation. The semi-structured interviews included 17 organisations, 10 of which are directly involved in addressing the needs of persons with disabilities in general or aiming to support the needs of persons with specific types of disabilities. In general, one individual was interviewed per organisation. However, two individuals were interviewed from the European Disability Forum and three individuals from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA).

Focus groups were generally organised through national councils for persons with disabilities (or similar organisations in Member States where such organisations do not currently exist). Member State experts also conducted semi-structured interviews face to face and via telephone. Both interviews and focus groups were conducted between September 2019 and December 2019, with national representatives and key stakeholders for persons with disabilities, to supplement evidence gathered through desk review. The stakeholder consultations at Member State level aimed to build on the information gathered through desk review. More specifically, to gather further information and opinions on the progress of implementation in specific areas of action, particularly focusing on national level actions motivated by the Strategy. Outputs from these activities (i.e. desk review, semi-structured interviews and focus groups) were recorded by Member State experts in a standardised country report template. The interviews and focus groups adhered to a topic guide focused on assessing the extent of change in Member State in the issues covered by the Strategy since 2010, particularly relating to Accessibility, Participation, Equality, Employment, Education and training, Social protection and Health. In addition, the topic guide included questions to understand drivers of change in national disability policy and changes attributed to the European Disability Strategy. A total of 162 interviews and 18 focus groups were conducted with Member State stakeholders. 4.Issues encountered and actions taken during the consultations Throughout the course of the evaluation some challenges emerged in relation to the consultation methods. This section describes the issues and the actions taken by the team of the external contractor for each of the consultation activities. Public consultation -During the public consultation, there were particular access issues that inhibited the ability of respondents to answer questions. These included language defaulting to EN after some filter questions. Some stakeholders reported that the requirement to register prior to completing the public consultation deterred them from taking part to the consultation. In addition, stakeholders reported technical issues such as being unable to fill-out certain required fields, which deterred them from submitting their response. In order to mitigate the issue, the mandatory on-line authentication was de-activated. -Low response rate in some Member States. This issue was mitigated by contacting the relevant Member State experts and urging them to encourage stakeholders to complete the public consultation and publicise it through their networks. EU stakeholder interviews Some stakeholders mentioned they had taken part in the public consultation and felt additional involvement through interviews was redundant. Moreover, stakeholders cited that they have been extensively involved in the previous evaluation and felt further involvement would provide no added value. These issues were flagged to DG EMPL immediately and a clear communication channel (via email, telephone and face-to-face meetings) was maintained to ensure timely response, to effectively identify and approach other relevant EU-level interviewees. Member State stakeholder interviews and focus groups Member State experts pointed to several issues that hindered their research activities. The timing of the evaluation was cited as an issue as Member State experts found it difficult to secure interviews or focus groups with stakeholders during the summer holiday period. In addition, some national experts mentioned that stakeholders were initially hesitant to take part assuming that their identity would be disclosed. This issue was easily mitigated by assuring both Member State experts and relevant stakeholders that their identity will be kept anonymous. To fit in which the schedule of interviewees the interviews were kept as succinct as possible, with interviewees also permitted to provide written information if that was there preferred method. In addition, some stakeholders refused to participate due to issues related to accessibility (e.g. not wanting to travel long distance or not having access to accessible technology to participate in the interview or focus group). The Member State experts who raised such issues were provided additional resources (i.e. cost of renting accessible venues and travel costs) to hold focus groups in accessible venues and hold interviews face to face in locations easily accessible for interviewees, though this was only required in three cases. 5.Lessons for future consultations -In order to identify and prevent accessibility difficulties and technical issues, extensive piloting of the public consultation questions should be conducted involving Disabled Persons Organisations and other relevant stakeholders. This could be done through, for example, a soft launch where a small sample of stakeholders receives an invitation to complete the public consultation before it is made openly available. -To ensure the public consultation reaches as wide as possible an audience and to obtain a good response rate, efforts can be taken to extensively promote the public consultation prior to publication. This consultation was promoted after through established social media platforms of stakeholder organisations that were familiar to persons with disabilities such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter Annex 3: Intervention logic Annex 4: Methods and analytical models This annex describes the methodology used to undertake the evaluation. It firstly outlines the way in which an inclusive research methodology was applied in the evaluation and how analysis was conducted. The section then provides a brief description of the approach taken for each of the four main research tasks included in the evaluation, identifying specific issues and the way in which they were mitigated. The research adopted an inclusive methodology The evaluation required a range of consultations with different types of stakeholders operating at both EU and Member State level. This involved EU level stakeholder interviews, Member State level consultation (interviews and focus groups), and e-surveys such as a public consultation (the consultation was published on the European Commission's 'Have your say' portal). On-line surveys were also undertaken among Non-governmental organisations (ONGs) and Member State representatives on the Disability High Level Group (DHLG). When undertaking these consultations it was important to ensure that a wide range of persons with disabilities and stakeholder groups had the opportunity to provide input into the evaluation. An inclusive research methodology for enabling consultees to participate through forms of consultation that were appropriate for them was delivered in the following ways: -When arranging and conducting EU level and Member State level interviews, plain language was used to describing the purpose and requirements of consultees in all forms of consultation. -For interviews, consultees were offered the opportunity to provide input according to the most suitable method (e.g. in written format, via skype call, telephone, teleconference, or face-to-face interview). -Where focus groups were conducted in Member States, they involved organisations representing persons with disabilities to discuss the Strategy and future EU disability strategy. Focus group attendees were provided with information prior to focus groups. This information outlined the purpose of the study and the key issues to be discussed during the focus group. -Prior to focus groups, an assessment of participant requirements was undertaken by Member State experts to understand accommodation and participant requirements. This involved assessing the need for, and organising sign language and\/or hearing loop facilities. Where appropriate, consultees in Member States were also offered the opportunity to participate in the evaluation through providing written answers or comments on the evidence assembled by Member State experts. -The public consultation included an easy-to-read version of the questions, having a limited number of questions expressed in simple terms to enable as many persons as possible to answer the questions. An evaluation framework was used to guide research and analysis An evaluation framework was established during the inception stage of the evaluation. The framework used the individual evaluation questions to develop specific judgement criteria used to answer the research questions, it then identified relevant evidence and indicators (qualitative and quantitative) that would be required to make these judgements. The framework then identified specific research tasks and methods that would be used to generate the required evidence. For each of the research questions a similar process of triangulation was followed in order to combine the results from different sources and analytical techniques. The first step in the process of analysis was to analyse the relevant information collected from each research tasks\/source (document review, public consultation, member state research, EU level interviews). -Individual sources of information were then analysed and organised by evaluation question so that they could be compared, and analysis of emerging messages and trends was undertaken. -At the same time an assessment of the clarity of each evidence base was undertaken, though mitigating measures to address this were taken during the fieldwork stage, for example: -encouraging more respondents to the public consultation, -approaching more interviewees in the MS research and EU level interviews when needed, -undertaking further document review -Comparison of trends and patterns to understand the extent to which data sources produce similar findings has been undertaken to produce a set of emerging messages from the data analysis. Additionally, the extent to which diverging messages emerged between sources and types of stakeholders has been examined. -The final step was to develop answers to research questions and to produce conclusions and recommendations linked to the evidence base. The answers to research questions and the conclusions and recommendations has been discussed with disability experts included in the research team and the ISG. This process was important for this evaluation due to the range of sources of information needed to be included in the analysis (for example, views of persons with disabilities; documents such as reports, analysis, and legal instruments; consultations with stakeholders at EU and Member State level). There were a number of issues during the research, which required mitigating action to ensure that the evidence was as reliable as possible and the findings transparent and robust. These are outlined below for different research tasks. They included, difficulty in engaging with key stakeholders; analytical challenges related to the design of the Strategy, its objectives and actions; limited information upon which to base assessment of the Strategy's achievements and influence; and, different levels of specificity in the available evidence. Specific research tasks, issues encountered and mitigating measures Task 1: Mapping the progress of objectives and key actions of the European Disability Strategy The aim of this task was to assess the progress in delivering EU level actions and to identify the extent to which the Strategy supported and supplemented Member State actions. The research has been undertaken through both desk research and targeted consultations. At EU level this involved extensive desk review and interviews with key stakeholders and consultation with the Inter-Service Steering Group to ensure that the evidence gathered during the mapping exercise was accurate. At Member State level, detailed desk research, interviews, and focus groups were undertaken. The results of the mapping are contained in Annex 5. The results of the mapping inform the answers to various evaluation questions and are the used as evidence to answer research questions. Issues encountered and mitigating measures The following issues emerged, with mitigation measures put in place during the research process: -It was not always clear from desk review and consultations the degree to which progress had been made for some of the actions, because many of the actions were not specific and measurable. This was addressed through consultation with ISG members and further targeted consultations with EU level stakeholders assisted in gaining clarification on factual matters related to implementation. It was not, however, possible to gain comprehensive information on the impact of EU level actions. In part, this is because impact may depend on timeliness and comprehensiveness of Member State level implementation. -Dependencies between different actions of the Strategy are not always explicit, and it is not possible to provide robust evidence of the long-term impact of delivery or non-delivery of particular actions on other actions. -In general, there is a lack of data to understand the impact of the actions and clear attribution of those impacts to the Strategy. The reasons for this are: some actions began prior to the publication of the Strategy; many actions are also influenced by other policy drivers; impact depends on implementation at Member State level and\/or impact is likely to be measurable over the longer term. These issues could not be fully mitigated; therefore, the evaluation uses the assembled evidence base to provide an overall assessment of the Strategy. Task 2: public consultation The public consultation collected feedback from a wide range of respondents (including stakeholder organisations and interested citizens) on their perceptions of the Strategy, its implementation to date, and their opinions on important future priorities in disability policy. It ran from 31 July to 13 November 2019. The overall number of responses was 2,547; this is significantly higher than the previous public consultation undertaken for the mid-term evaluation of the EU Disability Strategy, which received 1,518 responses. The external contractor worked with DG EMPL to develop the questions and question formats for the public consultation so that it would align with the requirements of the evaluation. An important priority for DG EMPL was to publish the public consultation before the summer so that the consultation could be completed and analysed prior to the European Day of Persons with Disabilities at the end of 28-29 November 2019. The external contractor worked with the European Disability Forum (EDF) to promote the public consultation through their social media. To make this as engaging as possible, the external contractor created social media posts in different EU languages, with the purpose of encouraging as many responses as possible from members of the public. The European Commission also encouraged non-governmental organisations to publicise the public consultation. A process for examining each of these documents was followed, with the documents analysed to determine their relevance to each evaluation criterion. A total number of one hundred and seven documents were submitted, forty-nine of which contained relevant information for the evaluation. Issues encountered and mitigating measures There were some initial issues related to respondents accessing the public onsultation that were encountered immediately following its launch. These included: -The language defaulting to English after the initial language filter questions and some respondents not being able to enter data into some of the fields. -A more significant issue reported by respondents was that they could not respond to the public consultation without an EU login. This requirement was removed by the European Commission. This requirement is a mandatory feature of public consultations undertaken by the European Commission and this exception required approval by the Chief Operating Officer of the Commission. -The public consultation was launched during the summer and was initially attended by low number of respondents. As described above, the external contractor worked with Member State experts and with the European Disability Forum (EDF) to promote the public consultation as widely as possible. Task 3: Targeted consultations DG EMPL undertook targeted consultations held with non-governmental organisations (strategic dialogue) and MS representatives (Disability High Level Group) prior to the external contractor. These consultations were conducted using the EU survey tool, analysis of findings from these consultations are included in the evidence base used to answer the study questions. The external contractor undertook targeted consultations at both EU and Member State level. Additionally, focus groups were arranged where possible through National Councils for Persons with Disabilities or similar organisations. At EU level, consultations were undertaken through semi-structured interviews. The purpose of these consultations was to deepen the evidence base assembled through the desk research. The consultations provided an opportunity to also gather stakeholder opinions regarding the overall impact of the Strategy and their views on what future disability strategy should prioritise. 2,547 participants took part in the public consultation and 182 interviews were undertaken for the study (20 at EU level and 162 and Member State level). Several types of organisations were interviewed at Member State level. A full list of interviewees and focus group participants is included in the Synopsis Report. Issues encountered and mitigating measures Consultations were undertaken through Member State experts who provided the external contractor with bi-weekly progress reports. This enabled any issues encountered during the consultation to be understood and dealt with in a timely manner. Common issues encountered during the Member State research were: -a low level of knowledge of the Strategy and its content; -lack of time to participate in interviews (initially interviewees were approached over the summer period); and -ensuring interviews (and subsequent Member State reports) remained on topic and did not focus on highly context specific issues that were beyond the scope of the evaluation. Issues encountered during the consultations at EU level were: -Interviewees stating that they had a lack of time to conduct interviews and stating that they felt able to contribute to evaluation of the Strategy because they had communicated their views to the Commission. -Some potential interviewees were reluctant to take part in interviews when they felt they did not have the knowledge to discuss each of the Strategy's areas of action. -A belief among some stakeholders that it was not appropriate for them to participate in the evaluation (for example, where they were engaged in design and delivery of the Strategy or in separate evaluation activity). To mitigate this, interviews were focused only on areas that interviewees were comfortable expressing an opinion and\/or alternate interviewees were agreed with DG EMPL. Task 4: Analysis by evaluation criterion This task consisted of analysis of the available evidence generated through the research undertaken in order to answer research questions for each evaluation criterion. This followed the following process: -Evidence was organised by research activity (document review, public consultation, stakeholder interviews, Member State research). Evidence was further broken down by evaluation criterion (effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value). -To develop and test the emerging findings from the study, the external contractor presented selected analysis along with emerging conclusions at the European Day of Persons with Disabilities in Brussels in November 2019. -Analysis and synthesis of the evidence for each individual research question was undertaken to determine the answers to each. Answers to study questions were then tested through consultation with experts and presented in this report. -A summary of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis was produced for the study. Issues encountered and mitigating measures A number of factors made evaluating the Strategy actions a challenging exercise. This is partly due to the nature of the objectives and actions included in the Strategy, for example: -There are no clear performance measures for the objectives established for the overall performance of the Strategy of for its areas of action. -Typically, the EU level actions included in the Strategy do not include explicit time-bound targets for their delivery -Observing the effects of many actions is likely to take many years as they rely on removal of barriers\/increased access, which may take a longer period for corresponding up-take to produce the desired results. For example, establishing legal instruments requires subsequent transposition and effective implementation at Member State level, there may be a similar time-lag for established tools and codes of conduct. Annex 5: implementation status of the actions of the Strategy This annex includes an overview of the extent to which actions have been implemented during the Strategy. The information gathered during the evaluation has been used to assess the extent to which actions of the Strategy were implemented based on some judgment criteria reported in the table hereunder. Each action has been associated with one of the following three categories: -F = Fully implemented: are actions adopted without major delays and in accordance with the objectives set out in their inception. This category also includes actions that were less ambitious than their original objectives suggested, but were adopted in a timely manner and actions that were not adopted in a timely manner (had some delays), but were matching or surpassing their original objectives. -P = Partially implemented: actions not adopted timely, did not match their original objectives and were not implemented as they were envisaged. This category also includes recurrent actions that were implemented only once. -N = Not implemented: actions that have not been adopted by the end of the evaluation.

INTRODUCTION 1. On 7 June 2018 the Commission submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council its proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Programme for single market, competitiveness of enterprises, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and European statistics and repealing Regulations (EU) No 99\/2013, (EU) No 1287\/2013, (EU) No 254\/2014, (EU) No 258\/2014, (EU) No 652\/2014 and (EU) 2017\/826 (1) ('the Programme'). 2. The European Economic and Social Committee delivered its opinion on 17 October 2018 (2), whilst the Committee of the Regions adopted its opinion at its 5 December 2018 Plenary (3). 3. The Council (Competitiveness), at its meeting on 29 November 2018, adopted a partial general approach on the proposal (4). The partial general approach did not include a number of elements, in particular provisions with budgetary implications or of horizontal nature, or provisions relating to pending discussions in other Council preparatory bodies on other legislative proposals. Such elements were marked in the text with square brackets. These elements were left outside of the scope of the negotiations at that stage, as more progress at horizontal level, including political guidance of the European Council on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027, was needed first for the Council to be able to establish its position on these parts. 4. In the European Parliament, the report on the Commission's proposal was voted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) on 22 January 2019 and confirmed in Plenary on 12 February 2019. At that time, the European Parliament adopted its position at first reading (5). The European Parliament passed the file on to the next legislature. On 8 October 2019 the IMCO Committee formally adopted the mandate to start inter-institutional negotiations on the proposal. 5. Trilogues took place on 23 October 2019 and 18 November 2019, with the aim of reaching a common understanding on the non-bracketed parts of the proposal. The Presidency participated in these trilogues with the partial general approach adopted in November 2018 as its mandate. 6. On 3 December 2019, the European Parliament informed the Council about its decision to provisionally freeze negotiations at political level. Negotiations resumed in the second semester 2020, with a third trilogue taking place on 28 October 2020. 7. On 18 November 2020, the Permanent Representatives Committee gave the Presidency a revised mandate as a basis for the negotiations at a fourth trilogue on 25 November 2020 and a fifth trilogue on 8 December 2020. 8. A provisional agreement on a compromise text was reached between co-legislators at the trilogue on 8 December 2020. The Permanent Representatives Committee, at its meeting on 18 December 2020, confirmed this final compromise text with a view to agreement (6). 9. On 11 January 2021, the European Parliament's IMCO Committee endorsed the final compromise text. Subsequently, on 15 January 2021 the Chair of the IMCO Committee sent a letter to the Chair of the Permanent Representatives Committee indicating that, should the Council formally transmit to the European Parliament its position as agreed during trilogues, she would recommend to the Plenary that the Council's position be accepted without amendment, subject to legal-linguistic verification, at Parliament's second reading. II. OBJECTIVE 10. The Programme is proposed to be established for the period of the MFF 2021-2027. It is part of the sectoral proposals complementing the package of horizontal proposals on the MFF for that period. 11. The objective of the Programme is to strengthen the governance of the internal market and to enable citizens, consumers, businesses and public authorities to take full advantage of the market integration and opening by enforcing Union law, facilitating market access, setting standards and promoting human, animal and plant health and animal welfare, whilst respecting the principles of sustainable development and ensuring a high level of consumer protection, to support the competitiveness of enterprises, in particular micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to establish a framework for programming and financing of European statistics. 12. The Programme brings together activities financed during the previous MFF period under six predecessor programmes (European statistical programme; COSME; Consumer programme; Programme supporting specific activities in the field of financial reporting and auditing; Regulation relating to the food chain, animal health and animal welfare, plant health and plant reproductive material; Regulation supporting the involvement of consumers and other financial services end-users), and also includes some new initiatives. III. ANALYSIS OF THE COUNCIL'S POSITION AT FIRST READING A. General observations 13. The Council and the European Parliament conducted negotiations with the aim of concluding an early second reading agreement on the basis of a Council first reading position that the European Parliament could approve as such. The text of the Council first reading position fully reflects the compromise reached between co-legislators. B. Specific observations 14. During negotiations in November and December 2020, co-legislators were able to reach a compromise on the following outstanding issues: Duration of the Programme: The Council and the European Parliament agreed that the Programme is established for the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027 and that the duration of the Programme is aligned to the duration of the MFF. Technical and administrative assistance for the implementation of the Programme: Co-legislators agreed that the total costs of administrative and technical support shall not exceed 5 % of the value of the overall financial envelope available for the implementation of the Programme. Designated beneficiaries representing consumers interest at the Union level: It was agreed that the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in relation to the representation of consumers interest at the Union level to amend the list of entities that may be awarded a grant under the Programme without a call for proposals. National reference laboratories as designated beneficiaries, and their accreditation: Agreement was reached on the possibility for national plant health reference laboratories and national animal health reference laboratories to benefit as designated beneficiaries from grants awarded under the Programme if the actions by those national laboratories that are supported by the Programme represent Union added value, and if sufficient funding is available under the Programme to support these actions. Comparable conditions are foreseen for the determination of the designated beneficiaries and for their accreditation. Co-financing rules in the area of plants, animals, food and feed: The Council and the European Parliament agreed on a fixed co-financing rate of 50 %, that is exceptionally increased to 75 % and 100 % under certain conditions. It will be possible for the Commission to adopt an implementing act to set a lower co-financing rate where that is necessary on the grounds of budgetary availability, insufficient implementation of the Programme or the emergency measure, or the phasing-out of the co-financing of actions against animal diseases or plant pests. Delegated acts, implementing acts and committees: Co-legislators agreed that work programmes are adopted by implementing acts intended to give effect to the rules already laid down in the basic act and in accordance with related sectoral legislation where applicable. Actions set out in Annex II shall be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223\/2009 on European Statistics. With regard to delegated acts, it was agreed that the power to adopt delegated acts shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of 7 years, and that it shall be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension. Retroactivity: It was agreed that the Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, and that it shall apply from 1 January 2021. IV. CONCLUSION 15. The Council's position at first reading on the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme for the internal market, competitiveness of enterprises, including small and medium-sized enterprises, the area of plants, animals, food and feed, and European statistics fully reflects the compromise reached in the negotiations between representatives of the Council and of the European Parliament, facilitated by the Commission. This compromise is confirmed by the letter that the Chair of the IMCO Committee addressed to the Chair of the Permanent Representatives Committee on 15 January 2021. (1) Doc. 9890\/18 + ADD 1.

The report is to be based on the annual reports submitted by the national authorities on their control activities 2 and on the results of Commission controls carried out in Member States. This staff working document provides further detail on Commission controls in the areas of food and feed safety, animal and plant health, animal welfare, pesticides, organic farming and quality schemes 3 . The following chapters present issues of particular interest from the above mentioned controls undertaken by Commission services during 2017 and 2018. The Better Training for Safer Food (BTSF) programme is one of the tools used by the Commission to share information on conclusions, good practices or lessons learned during its control activities. 2.Commission controls in Member States Within the framework for European Union (EU) controls, Commission services undertake audits to verify compliance with feed and food law, animal health and welfare, and the requirements for official controls. The Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety establishes a multi-annual audit and analysis programme in line with the key Commission strategic priorities. The 2017-2018 audit and analysis programmes focused on: antimicrobial resistance (AMR) management; better preparedness, prevention and response to human, animal and plant health threats; safe and sustainable food and food production systems; effective implementation of EU food legislation; a sustainable food production that improves the welfare of animals; effective, efficient and reliable controls. Audit reports contain recommendations to address identified shortcomings. The audit reports, Member States' action plans to address the recommendations, and country profiles documenting progress with the delivery of these plans are published on the Commission website 4 , providing stakeholders and citizens with a factual and transparent account of how Member States deliver on correct implementation of EU law. In addition, overview reports are produced for most audit series. Their purpose is to provide a comprehensive picture of controls carried out by Member States in a given area, and to identify issues that are relevant to all Member States. Moreover, they highlight good practices as well as difficulties encountered with the implementation of the relevant legislation. These overview reports are published and an overview and links can be found online 5 . In 2017 and 2018, the Commission published 22 overview reports on its audit and non-audit activities in the areas of food safety and quality, animal health and welfare, and plant health: Use of slaughterhouse data to monitor welfare of broilers on farm Educating professionals on animal welfare Study visits on rearing pigs with intact tails Hazards and management of risks in the feed sector Rabies eradication in the EU Pesticide residue control in organic production Animal health controls in zoos and laboratories Audits of official controls in EU-Member States Authorisation of plant protection products Antimicrobial resistance monitoring in zoonotic and commensal bacteria Marketing and use of plant protection products Identification and response to new plant health risks Sustainable use of pesticides Official control systems in place for food additives and smoke flavourings Welfare of dairy cattle Private assurance schemes in the feed sector Mitigation measures in place for Campylobacter spp. in poultry Welfare of commercially farmed rabbits in the EU Antimicrobial Resistance - Prudent use of antimicrobials in animals Third countries' National Policies and Measures on Antimicrobial Resistance Veterinary Preparedness for Natural Disasters Animal Health Controls for Bivalve Mollusc Aquaculture 2.1.Horizontal issues National audit systems: audits of official control systems Between 2016 and 2018, the Commission Services conducted a series of 25 audits in Member States, to evaluate their systems for auditing 6 their official control programmes. The vast majority of relevant competent authorities had put audit arrangements in place covering most official control activities concerned, and, in some cases, going beyond this scope. The overall conclusion of the audit series was that effectively implemented audit arrangements contribute to ensuring the quality, and improving the consistency and effectiveness of official controls, if there is strong management commitment to the follow-up of audit recommendations. The audit series showed that competent authorities still faced some challenges in optimising audit arrangements to provide credible, reliable results that have a positive impact on the effectiveness and consistency of official controls. The Commission audits were well accepted and appreciated by the auditees and the outputs were helpful to improve the consistency and effectiveness of official controls. The identified areas for improvement were ensuring the independent scrutiny of the audit process, auditing effective implementation and suitability of official controls, effectively following-up audit results, planning the audit programmes using a risk-based approach and guaranteeing transparency of the audit process outside the organisation. Improvements in these areas would further contribute to the credibility, reliability, relevance and impact of national audit systems. In addition, the overview report 7 highlighted useful practices, which may be of interest to the Member States. The outcome of this audit series influenced the forthcoming revision of the guidelines for the conduct of these audits of official control systems 8 . 2.2.Food safety Fipronil During 2017, and in the wake of the fipronil contamination incident 9 , the Commission services carried out four fact-finding missions. The main objective was to gather information regarding the incident, the operation of official controls and the actions taken by the Member States during this incident. The missions also sought to identify the challenges and difficulties encountered by the Member States concerned, including the communication with other relevant Member States and with the Commission. The overall aim was to contribute, with information obtained on-the-ground, to a complete picture of the incident and to identify the lessons to be learned with a view to improving, where necessary, the tools 10 available at EU level for the management and containment of similar incidents. In the four Member States concerned, the contingency plans in place satisfactorily addressed the incident. Equally, and despite considerable difficulties, traceability of eggs back to the farms of origin was overall successful. Nonetheless, certain factors affected the speed of response to the incident, notably initial delays in communication between Member States and subsequent difficulties, at different stages of the incident, including the need to rapidly respond to and disseminate updated information. These factors may have contributed to the extent of the impact of this incident. Competent authorities as well as food business operators devoted significant efforts to address the incident. A number of key challenges encountered throughout the management of the incident included the interpretation of laboratory results, the handling of large amounts of information updates, and issues related to the destruction of the contaminated products and materials. The Commission introduced a number of concrete initiatives aimed at supporting and ensuring a harmonised approach among Member States in the management of the incident. These initiatives, agreed by the Member States at the Ministerial conference that took place in Brussels on 26 September 2017, addressed a number of the challenges as subsequently confirmed by the fact-finding missions. The initiatives included the enhancement and coordination of the risk assessment, risk management and risk communication for such incidents, the development of provisions to strengthen the existing flexibility in residue monitoring, the enhancement of the exchange of information and maximising the potential of the RASFF and AAC systems at EU level. Slaughter hygiene The slaughter hygiene project, which concluded in 2017, consisted of study visits in 15 Member States and Norway and a series of associated workshops attended by representatives of Member States, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority. The project identified and shared a number of competent authorities' working practices with a positive impact on slaughter hygiene, and thus on consumer protection. The study visits and workshops presented working practices in place in the countries visited, aimed at addressing problems encountered by all competent authorities and ensuring optimal slaughter hygiene and minimum levels of carcass contamination. The experts reported that they appreciated the opportunity to see how other competent authorities worked and to share ideas and experiences. The Commission noted that some particularly effective working methods were subsequently taken up by a number of Member States. The participating Member States shared a number of their working arrangements and practices to support their verification and controls such as: \"clean livestock policy\" 11 , on-line clipping of livestock, carcass contamination recording systems, official verification procedures for carcass contamination, pooling technical and managerial responsibilities, sampling and analysis performed by competent authorities on microbiological criteria, risk profiling of slaughterhouses and publication of official control results. In addition, this series of study visits highlighted a number of key elements found in environments that are conducive to good slaughter hygiene. These elements include among others the existence of well-organized and committed processors' associations, the availability of strong vocational education in the sector and company policies to retain skilled staff. Also underlined was the importance of slaughterhouse operators having well thought-out and developed slaughtering techniques, and for competent authorities to be aware of these and to have a positive attitude towards new developments in this area. Labelling The objective of this audit series, carried out in eight Member States, was to obtain an overview of the performance of Member States' official control systems on the implementation of the relevant national and EU legislation 12 on food information to consumers and nutrition and health claims made on foods at producers, importers and all points of entry in the market. While the majority of the Member States audited perform official controls in this area, in a number of cases, the coverage of such controls on food information was limited. In some cases, there were no controls on nutrition and health claims at all or not to the extent necessary for a satisfactory assessment that the claims used comply with EU rules. This can lead to the non-detection of relevant non-compliances and consequently lack of subsequent enforcement measures. This could in turn lead to insufficient protection of consumers from fraudulent practices. The individual audit reports identify the reasons, ranging from issues related to the designation and organisation of competent authorities to insufficient training and knowledge of officials. In practice, the authorities perform official controls at all stages of the food chain both on prepacked and non-prepacked foods. The assessment of food information provided and nutrition and health claims made can be very time-consuming. In addition, it requires specific knowledge and experience due to the complexity of these areas. The verification of the correlation between the content and the information provided for foods is only possible if all relevant supporting documentation and records related to the raw materials used as ingredients and semi-finished products are available. In addition, sampling and analysing for different parameters can be of assistance for verification purposes. National legislation for substances causing allergies and intolerance in non-prepacked foods and on country of origin information for certain foods is in force in several Member States. However, two Member States did not follow the notification procedures of these to the Commission. Ready-to-eat (RTE) During 2017 and 2018, the Commission experts undertook a targeted series of five audits in the RTE area, due to the number and significance of foodborne outbreaks linked to such foods. The findings of these audits point to some common areas among the official controls systems of most of the Member States audited that need to be reinforced in order to achieve effective systems. The most significant issues fall into two main areas: a)the under-detection of non-compliances, mainly due to controls not effectively targeting these riskier foods, making limited use of systematic audits and reviews during these controls and particularly the lack of or ineffective training of and understanding by inspectors of the requirements and of the impact of certain detected issues in RTE food production; and b)ineffective actions taken to ensure the timely correction of non-compliances, mainly due to issues related to the classification and weighting of non-compliances (including those relating to procedures to prevent cross-contamination), not taking the specific risks linked to RTE food products into account and inadequate procedures which either limit or do not support effective follow-up of inspection results. The audits also identified an array of good practices that could be helpful for competent authorities in the design and implementation of the official control system, including guidelines and advice for food business operators and authorities in the implementation of key legal requirements; access by officials at local level to experts in complex technical areas such as shelf life studies assessment; availability of adequate information to officials supporting the evaluation of product process validation; use of guidelines, set by the EU reference laboratories, for sampling of processing areas and equipment and specific support for the evaluation of operators' compliance with the required microbiological analytical methods. E-Commerce E-commerce in the EU has grown steadily in recent years. Today the EU is one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world. The online marketplace offers all kinds of food, including fresh meat and fish. Moreover, an ever-increasing variety of food supplements is available online. Among those are products that regularly give rise to serious health concerns. The range of products available and the fast growth of internet sales of food create challenges for the official control of food sold via this medium. Therefore, the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety undertook a number of actions aimed at assisting Member States in their control tasks and to contribute to enhanced cooperation, effective controls and enforcement. As part of these actions, a series of fact-finding missions in seven Member States, carried out in 2017, evaluated how the competent authorities had integrated controls on the sales of food via the Internet into their official control systems. The competent authorities in all Member States visited recognised the necessity to enhance their controls related to the online sales of food, and had taken steps to adapt their traditional inspection activities in order to verify that food supplied online is safe and subject to an appropriate level of official controls. The approach taken varied in the Member States visited due to different set-ups and priorities. The missions showed that official controls of food sold online are relatively limited, and mainly focused on the registered food business operators. Non-compliances identified during controls mostly related to labelling and health claim requirements. A few cases revealed the online marketing of dangerous substances as food supplements. The identification of non-registered food business operators with an online presence has proven challenging due to the relatively limited resources assigned to this area, and the fact that a considerable number of these operators can easily and rapidly enter and exit the online marketplace, without being aware of their responsibilities. Moreover, the presence of online sellers who actively try to avoid official controls by changing their digital identity is an additional hurdle for competent authorities. Cooperation and intelligence sharing between different authorities within and across Member States was shown to be crucial. Finally, enforcement and cooperation with non-EU countries have proved, so far, to be the main constraints for an effective control of food sold via the Internet. Nonetheless, the competent authorities in the Member States are making continuous efforts to respond to the challenges brought about in the food sector by the digital economy, and are equally eager to share their experiences and to learn from others. The mission series provided an opportunity to bring together all involved in these types of controls. Some Member States have carried out exchange visits for their staff and are cooperating successfully. The published overview report 13 provides more detail on this matter. Food contact materials (FCM) With a series of fact-finding missions and audits in seven Member States in 2017-2018, the Commission evaluated the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and added value of EU legislation concerning FCM. The objectives were to establish how Member States have integrated FCM controls into their official control systems and to identify challenges, good practices, as well as any measures needed to improve these official controls where necessary. A Commission workshop complemented the series in 2017. The series established that, in general, the Member States visited have designated competent authorities and official control laboratories in charge of FCM, and that some competent authorities have set up a registration system to identify the business operators involved in the FCM chain. As with controls over E-commerce, approaches vary, partly depending on the level of priority given to this area. Furthermore, the series found that in terms of effectiveness, controls in this area face some serious challenges, crucially the lack of laboratory analytical methods and technical knowledge and expertise amongst official control staff, in what is acknowledged as a very technical area. In addition, health risks associated with FCM are perceived as relatively low, with an associated minimal level of priority being attributed to this area. Therefore, controls are generally limited to a verification of the presence of generic declarations of compliance or indication of suitability for use. This, in combination with an absence of systems for hands-on training for control staff, leads to inspectors not being able to build up technical knowledge. Hence, they are not in a position to evaluate specific and relevant details of the declarations of compliance and supporting documentation, as required by legislation. As a result, fundamental aspects may be and, indeed, are, overlooked during controls. Together with the already relatively low frequency of controls, this results in limited findings and consequently, in a failure to identify potential risks. This hampers risk-based and targeted controls and reinforces the perception that it concerns a low-risk or in any event low priority area. Currently, in the majority of the cases, inspectors cannot reliably establish compliance with the general requirements of the relevant EU legislation 14 covering the safety of FCM, or provisions in EU legislation for specific types of FCM and substances used, or in national legislation. This does not mean or suggest that the products are unsafe, but that the official control systems in place are not or, at least, not sufficiently capable of identifying non-compliances and their associated food safety risks. 2.3.Feed safety Risk-based official controls in the feed sector In 2017, the Commission services carried out nine fact-finding missions in Member States on the risk-based approach implemented by competent authorities for the organisation of official feed controls. A 2016 overview report 15 based on a series of audits carried out between 2012 and 2014 had concluded that in a general context of resource constraints, risk prioritisation of official controls in the feed sector was weak or at an early stage of development. The fact-finding missions sought to establish whether there had been positive developments in the application of risk-based principles and identify any examples of good practice or mechanisms, which, if adopted by more Member States, would improve the risk-basis for official controls on feed. The overall conclusion of these missions was that Member States largely apply a risk-based approach for organising official controls, although with a variation in how the different criteria set out in the legislation form the basis for these assessments. The inspection frequency and feed sampling programmes are mainly based on the risk inherent in the activities of the operator and to a lesser extent on other criteria (such as past record of compliance, reliability of own-checks or participation in private quality assurance schemes). While many Member States established advanced risk-scoring systems for compound feed producers, risk scoring applicable to other operators (primary producers or traders) is less developed. A BTSF workshop in September 2018 enabled a discussion with Member States representatives on the outcomes of this series, including good practices identified. Evaluation of official controls on feed additives, their ingredients and traceability In 2018, the Commission audited five Member States' implementation of official controls on feed additives and ingredients for their production in the EU. Feed additives and their mixtures (premixtures) are the essential ingredients in modern compound feed manufacture. A substantial quantity of feed additives and ingredients for their production is sourced from third countries and it is important to be able to demonstrate that such imports do not contain undesirable substances. The main issues detected during these audits concerned the competent authorities' assessment of operators' HACCP 16 -plans, actions taken to correct and prevent non-compliances, implementation of appropriate sampling protocols and labelling. Recommendations were made accordingly and corrective actions undertaken to improve the effectiveness of the control systems in place. Evaluation of the implementation of hygiene, traceability and trade requirements of processed animal proteins, including exports, imports and intra-union trade In 2018, a series of five audits evaluated the measures put in place by Member States' competent authorities to verify and ensure that relevant business operators implement the legal requirements on the hygiene, traceability and the trade of processed animal protein (PAP) 17 . The audits focused on PAP produced and traded between Member States, imported and exported to and from the EU and on the traceability and trade of organic fertilizers and soil improvers. Attention was paid to the practical implementation of the export procedure of PAP containing ruminant protein following a relaxation of the feed ban rules in July 2017. Common problems identified included poor or limited implementation of official controls on channelling of consignments of ruminant PAP intended for export and as regards intra-union trade of PAP, failure of the competent authority of destination to inform the competent authority of origin on the arrival of PAP consignments, thus undermining traceability of these consignments. The audit series established that corrective actions were taken to improve the effectiveness of the control systems in place in the Member States visited. 2.4.Animal health African swine fever This animal disease with important social and economic impact entered the EU in 2014 and spread to several EU countries. The Commission audited affected Member States to verify the effectiveness of the control measures applied by national authorities and to trigger constant improvement. The audits indicated that most Member States were applying appropriate measures to contain the disease. The audits have an important role in reassuring trade partners about the reliability of the EU system for regionalisation 18 . The Commission also started fact-finding visits to Member States at risk but free from the disease (i.e. with common borders with affected countries) to get an overview of their preparedness and response capacity, especially in the areas related to wild boar. Highly pathogenic avian influenza The Commission carried out two projects in this area. The first (2017) covered surveillance and preparedness for the disease. The results of the fact-finding visits and meetings fed the discussions of experts for the implementing and delegated acts related to the disease, developed under the Animal Health Law (AHL) 19 . The published overview report provides more detail 20 . In the second project (2018), The Commission audited Member States affected by the avian influenza epidemics in 2016-2017 to check the effectiveness of the measures they took to control outbreaks of the disease. The audits also looked at what lessons the authorities learned from that crisis and if they used them to improve their contingency plans. Bivalve mollusc aquaculture In 2018, a project based on fact-finding missions to the main EU producing countries assessed the implementation of the EU animal health rules in this 1 billion EU sector. The project also assessed the legislation and possible improvements for appropriate prevention, surveillance and control measures of diseases in bivalve molluscs facilitating safe movements within EU waters. The analysis of the findings provided a solid basis to identify what was working or not, in relation to the enforcement of controls and the implementation of legislation within this area. This fed the drafting of the new delegated and implementing acts of the AHL. The main findings are currently being reviewed in the process of drafting the new delegated and implementing acts of the AHL. The Commission published an overview report 21 . 2.5.Animal welfare Animal welfare during transport The Commission carried out a project (2016-2018) focused on the transport of live animals destined for export outside the EU. It covered road and sea transport. For road transport, the project had a significant impact: The export of live animals by road to Turkey decreased significantly (72% decrease in two years). Most Member States took actions to limit transport of live animals during hot days 22 . The number of animal welfare incidents at the Bulgarian-Turkish border during the summer months decreased, having zero incidents in 2018. The compliance rate (measured at the last EU border) increased, reaching over 97% in 2018. There are still big challenges regarding monitoring and enforcing EU rules for the non-EU part of the journeys. There are no systems to check the actual route followed by livestock trucks and Member States have no means to check the availability and adequacy of resting points along the route outside the EU. The published report 23 provides an overview of the good practices and problems that the project identified. Regarding sea transport, the project included audits on the official control systems to ensure welfare of live animals transported in livestock vessels. The results showed a defective system of checks in most Member States, ineffective to minimise animal welfare issues during the trip. The Commission is working to get the European Maritime Safety Agency involved in the checks for livestock vessels, with the aim to improve the quality of the checks, increase compliance of livestock vessels with the relevant EU legislation 24 and improve communication between Member States in this area. For sea transport of animals, there are currently no mechanisms to gather information about the welfare of the animals during the journey and at arrival. This makes it impossible to establish the welfare quality of the journeys and hinders continuous improvement. The Commission published an overview report that contains the good practices and main problems identified during the project 25 . Animal welfare on farm Pigs The Commission made pig welfare one of its priorities for enforcement and implemented a two-year work programme in this area. There are 26 Member States that routinely tail dock pigs, although the EU legislation prohibits this as a routine 26 . The 26 non-compliant Member States presented and refined action plans to move towards compliance, which constitutes a shift in the correct direction. Even though the quality of the plans is highly variable, there is some progress and some Member States have started to trial rearing batches of pigs with intact tails. Member States are not near full compliance and conditions on farm must improve if the number of tail docked pigs is to start to decrease. The biggest challenge for stopping routine tail docking of pigs is serious and uniform enforcement. Another challenge is the very active internal market for live pigs. Member States' authorities and producers are afraid of losing competitiveness if they enforce before others who are competitors and\/or clients. Rabbits Following a request from the European Parliament 27 , information was gathered during 2017 about the health and welfare of farmed domestic rabbits. The objective of this work was to further understand the rabbit production sector and identify good practices relating to the health, welfare and housing of rabbits reared for meat production. It showed that the actual size of rabbit farming in the EU is just over a third of previously available figures and it is highly concentrated in Spain, France and Italy. The overview report 28 outlined the factors that contribute to the animal welfare of rabbits at the time of production and their impact in the different production systems. It included pros and cons for animal health and welfare of the different rearing systems and it concluded that the rabbit farming sector is broadly in line with existing EU legislative requirements regarding protection of rabbits at the time of production. 2.6.Plant health Plant health is of global importance for sustainable agriculture and horticultural production, food security and protection of the natural environment. These are all at risk from the combined effects of the increasing globalisation of trade in plants and plant products and climate change, which increases the likelihood of introduction and establishment of pests not previously present in the EU. To verify that EU rules are adhered to, the Commission services continued conducting a wide range of audit and analysis activities in the field of plant health. EUROPHYT-Interceptions Based on data from the EUROPHYT-Interceptions 29 system, to which Member States and Switzerland notify the occurrence of pests in imported consignments of plants and other objects, and a monthly alert list 30 , audits were focused on those non-EU countries from which a high number of import consignments containing pests were intercepted. The impact of Commission measures and audits based on the EUROPHYT-Interceptions system may be illustrated by the trend in the number of interceptions made due to the presence of pests. Thus, the number of annual pest interceptions indicated by the mentioned trade alert list has been reduced by over 30% over the five years (from 2,310 on the first list in 2014 to 1,597 on the list for 2018). The annual EUROPHYT-Interceptions reports present further statistics and analysis of the interceptions of consignments 31 . Europhyt-Outbreaks There is a continuous need for better identification and assessment of the risk factors and for better targeting of the Member States activities, in particular in the light of new outbreaks and spread of pests in the EU. In relation to the identification of pests in Member States, a new module under the EUROPHYT system was developed for Member States to notify outbreaks in the EU. The launch of the web-based notification system EUROPHYT-Outbreaks at the beginning of 2017 and the development of a common protocol for notifications facilitated rapid reporting and fostered the harmonisation of practices to control the outbreaks between Member States. This in turn has contributed to timely decision-making at EU level for an increased level of protection of the EU territory against phytosanitary risks. The annual reports on the outbreak notifications are available online 32 . Import Controls on plant health The EU's import controls on plants and plant products aim to minimise the plant health risks, using a combination of prohibitions on import of pests and the highest-risk commodities, imposition of special requirements for other commodities to be certified by the plant health authorities of the exporting countries and including official checks on their import into the EU. A project was organised to evaluate Member States' capacity and performance of import controls on plant health against the requirements of the relevant EU legislation, and to identify and promote best practices across the EU. The findings of the project were taken into account during the negotiation process of the Plant Health Law and Official Controls Regulation. The project findings also shaped many of the implementing and delegated acts for the application of the import procedures and controls provided for under the new legislation. An overview report on the project is available online 33 . Export controls for plants for planting and seeds from non-EU countries An overview report describes a further project 34 to evaluate the official plant health controls for the export of plants for planting and seeds from non-EU countries to the EU. Many quarantine pests of concern are widespread in the exporting countries. The production technologies in non-EU countries audited can reduce the plant health risk but cannot ensure that the places of production or the consignments are free from pests. The majority of the exporting countries audited did not adequately observe the EU requirements, and there is a plant health risk that quarantine pests are present in the growing medium of the imported plants. Additional efforts are needed to inform the exporting countries about the EU rules in commonly understandable form and about the practical aspects of achieving conformity. To protect the health of plants in the EU, the Commission services continue to conduct audits in these countries, train staff from exporting countries and regularly update EU legislation to limit the potential risks. Xylella fastidiosa Xylella fastidiosa, is a destructive bacterium that has done serious damage to olive and almond trees in Italy and Spain. The pathogen has a wide host range and endangers many agricultural, horticultural and forest species, in particular in the southern and central regions of Europe. The Commission has closely followed this pest's outbreaks in various Member States, not least by frequent audits since the first discovery in Italy at the end of 2013. The audits' results and the Commission services' follow-up have contributed significantly to improving the controls in the countries with outbreaks and also contributed to the improvement of the relevant EU legislation. As the Italian authorities failed to control the spread of the pest, the Commission sent Italy two letters of formal notice in 2015 and 2016 and a reasoned opinion in July 2017, and in May 2018 it referred Italy to the Court of Justice of the EU 35 . In September 2019, the Court declared that Italy had failed to comply with its obligation to implement measures to prevent the spread of the bacterium 36 . The Commission services continued their audit and follow-up activity in Italy and other Member States to address this plant health risk. 2.7.Pesticides Authorisation of Plant Protection Products (PPPs) and controls on their marketing and use An overview report 37 on an audit series carried out in 2016 and 2017 showed delayed or reduced access to new pest control tools for growers, due to Member States failing to use the zonal authorisation system envisaged in EU legislation 38 , and failing to meet legal deadlines in a majority of cases. In addition, it showed that the re-evaluation of PPPs already on the market, in light of new scientific and technical knowledge, was delayed and finally, that delays in processing requests for authorisation contributed to more emergency authorisations being granted by Member States. In order to help Member States address the weaknesses in the system, the Commission services created two working groups, on PPP Formulation Analysis and on PPP enforcement. Representatives of over twenty Member States routinely attended the meeting of the Working Group for PPP Formulation Analysis and the three meetings of the PPP Enforcement Working Group organised by the Commission in 2017 and 2018. The Sustainable Use of Pesticides The broad range of measures set out in the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides (SUD) 39 provides the basis for reducing the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment, in particular by promoting the use of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and alternatives to pesticides. In 2017, the Commission submitted a report to the European Parliament and the Council on Member States' National Action Plans (NAPs) and on the implementation of the SUD 40 , which concluded that despite the substantial progress made by Member States, significant gaps remained. As IPM is a cornerstone of the SUD, it was of particular concern that Member States had not yet set clear targets for its implementation. More generally, the report noted the need for Member States to improve the quality of their NAPs, primarily by establishing specific and measurable targets and indicators for a long-term strategy for the reduction of risks and impacts from pesticide use. In response to the weaknesses identified, the Commission has taken various actions aimed at improving implementation of the SUD. In 2017, these included the establishment of the SUD web-portal 41 to provide a source of relevant information and to facilitate the exchange of information. Following an assessment of NAPs, letters were sent to all Member States highlighting where improvements should be made. In 2018, further letters were sent to some Member States and four targeted audits on the implementation of SUD were carried out. In addition to the audits, web-based surveys are used to collect data on SUD implementation. In December 2018 a survey was organised to collect additional information on NAP implementation and experience gained by Member States. Two meetings of the SUD Working Group were organised each year to discuss and exchange information on SUD related issues. In late 2018, a BTSF programme was launched on the control of IPM implementation at farm level, with 14 training sessions to take place between December 2018 and June 2020. Harmonised risk indicators Following the commitment given in response to the European Citizens Initiative \"Ban glyphosate and protect people and the environment from toxic pesticides\" and, as required by the EU legislation 42 , Harmonised risk indicators have been established. These indicators provide a basis for quantifying trends over time in reducing the risks associated with the use of PPP. The first Harmonised risk indicator is based on the quantities of PPP placed on the market (sold) in each Member State, while the second is based on the number of emergency authorisations granted by each Member State 43 . Both indicators include weightings that reflect the intrinsic properties of the different active substances. A three-year baseline is used in calculating these indicators to take account of yearly fluctuations in the quantity and type of PPP used due to variations in the extent and severity of pest outbreaks between years. Member States are obliged to calculate and make available to the public their harmonised risk indicators and links to this information, along with the overall EU harmonised risk indicators, are published on the Commission's SUD webportal 44 . A number of Member States are not making their information available to the public. The Commission has repeatedly reminded Member States of their obligations in this area. The Harmonised risk indicator I for the EU28 results show there has been a 20% reduction in risk in the period from 2011 to 2017 even though the quantity of PPP placed on the market during this time remained relatively constant 45 . The Harmonised risk indicator II results show a 50% increase from 2011 to 2017. However, it is problematic to calculate and interpret this indicator, as there is no harmonised way to record information on the quantities of PPP used under each emergency authorisation, so this can vary substantially. Biocides Biocidal products are substances or mixtures of substances used to control harmful organisms in areas other than those related to agricultural production. Biocides include a wide range of products commonly used by both professionals and non-professionals, such as disinfectants, wood preservatives and those for pest control such as rodenticides. They comprise products containing both chemicals and microorganisms as active substances. The Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) 46 that became applicable from 1 September 2013 regulates the marketing and use of biocidal products. The majority of biocidal products on the market are currently undergoing re-evaluation for approval of all biocidal active substances used in them under the BPR. Transitional arrangements allow the availability of biocidal products containing biocidal active substances that have not yet been re-evaluated on the market in Member States 47 . In 2017 and 2018, fact-finding missions in Hungary, Germany, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands assessed their implementation and enforcement of the BPR. The main objective was to collect information about why the re-evaluation of biocidal products is slow. The main challenges identified were the complexity of the review processes, poor quality of dossiers submitted by applicants, the lack of synchronised procedures and insufficient staff resources including resources wasted on applications withdrawn during the evaluation process. The use of planning and forecasting tools and improving the quality of dossiers through awareness raising and additional pre-submission meetings with applicants were some of the potential good practices found to have minimised delays. Further enhancing cooperation and coordination within and between the authorities involved with biocides and adopting additional harmonised EU guidance would facilitate the evaluation process and save time and resources in the long run. In the meantime, triggering consultations between Member States would help to establish a harmonised approach and avoid disagreements at a later stage. The significant amount of biocidal products which are not authorised for the market where they are available shows that further attention should be paid to the enforcement of the BPR, particularly aimed at products containing active substances still under evaluation in the Review Programme. More information can be found in the published overview report 48 . 2.8.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) The development of AMR poses a rising threat to human and animal health. Each year, drug resistant infections result in a significant number of patient deaths and cause substantial healthcare and productivity losses in the EU. The urgent need for concerted action to limit its development and maintain an arsenal of effective antimicrobials is recognised worldwide. In 2015, the European Commission published guidelines for the prudent use of antimicrobials in animals 49 . These define the prudent use of antimicrobials as leading to more rational and targeted use of these substances, thereby maximising their therapeutic effect and minimising the development of AMR. In June 2017, the Commission published a European One Health Action Plan against AMR with an emphasised 'One Health' approach 50 , acknowledging the interconnections between animal health, human health and the environment, as well as the common danger posed by the development of AMR. Two overview reports provide further background and information on the prudent use of antimicrobials in animals and on the systems for the monitoring of AMR in zoonotic and commensal bacteria 51 . The EU AMR One-Health Network, chaired by the European Commission, consists of government experts on human health and animal health, the EU scientific agencies (the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)) and Commission experts. This network holds bi-annual meetings that provide members with a platform to present national action plans and strategies and keep each other up to date on their progress, to share best practices, and to discuss policy options and how to enhance cooperation and coordination. The Commission and the ECDC organise One Health AMR joint country visits. The overall objective of these country visits is to assist the Member States in further developing and implementing their national strategies and policies to tackle AMR in a One Health context. The scope of visits encompasses the human health, veterinary and environmental aspects of AMR, as well as inter-sectoral coordination and cooperation aspects. 2.8.1.Monitoring of residues of veterinary medicinal products and environmental contaminants in animals and products of animal origin Veterinary medicinal products are widely used in animal breeding to either prevent or cure diseases. These substances may leave residues in the food products derived from treated animals. Member States implement annual monitoring programmes to verify that the use of veterinary medicinal products is in accordance with the applicable EU rules and to detect their potential misuse or illegal use. These programmes also include monitoring of environmental contamination, either from the use of pesticides or contaminants, to which animals may be exposed. Competent authorities take official samples from live animals or products of animal origin such as meat, eggs, milk, honey or aquaculture fish. In 2017, as part of these monitoring programmes, the 28 Member States took more than 410,000 samples to analyse for the presence of residues. The proportion of non-compliant results remained low (0.35%), at a level comparable to previous years. In the area of residue monitoring, the Commission actions are two-fold. Firstly, every year, the Health and Food, Audits and Analysis Directorate, together with the responsible European Union Reference Laboratories, reviews all the Member States' residue monitoring plans, making comments and recommendations to the Member States to ensure continuous improvement of the plans. The plans are then formally approved (by a Member States' vote) by comitology 52 . Secondly, Commission audits in Member States verify the implementation of the plans. Elements such as laboratory performance and effectiveness of follow-up investigations of non-compliant results are examined in detail. In 2017 and 2018, seven audits were carried out in Member States resulting in a relatively small number of recommendations to improve the control systems in place. 2.9.Organic production The area under organic farming in the EU has increased by 70% in the last ten years and currently covers 7,5% of the total Utilised Agricultural Area 53 . Imports of organic agri-food products are also significant, reaching 3.3 million tonnes in 2018 54 . The Commission continues to carry out an annual programme of audits of the control systems for organic products produced and\/or marketed in the EU. Imports from most non-EU countries are certified by private control bodies that are directly supervised by the Commission. Since 2017, the majority of the Commission audits in the organics sector have been dedicated to auditing these control bodies. Thus, in the period 2017-2018, 12 audits were carried out of control bodies operating in non-EU countries, while seven audits were of controls in Member States. In 2017 the Commission carried out audits in 3 MS (AT, BE and SI) and the same in 2018 (RO, IT and SK). A main difference between the two cases is that control bodies in non-EU countries may apply group certification if the group has an internal control system. This is mainly intended to facilitate exports from small farmers in developing countries that cannot afford individual certification. Many of the non-compliances found in non-EU countries relate to inadequate implementation of this system. In Member States, the audits found a variation of approaches as regards the organisation and implementation of controls and the national catalogue of measures in cases of non-compliances. The most frequent findings concern the supervision of control bodies, the respect of minimum control requirements from the control bodies, the notification of non-compliances of operators from the control bodies to the competent authorities and the enforcement of measures in cases of non-compliances. 2.10.Quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs and Spirit Drinks EU geographical indications legally protect more than 3,400 names of products in order to promote their unique characteristics and defend the traditional expertise of their producers. Each geographical indication has specific legal standards on how the product is made, while also serving as a guarantee for the quality and authenticity of the products. The Commission continued to carry out a limited annual programme of audits in Member States of their control systems for geographical indications. Thus in 2017-2018, six Member States were audited. The main issues found were weak market controls of products from other Member States and non-EU countries. For their own products, the Member States often failed to cover all the elements of the product specifications when carrying out controls at the producers. 2.11.Import controls The EU and its Member States are committed to ensuring that official controls on imports of animals and goods are fit for purpose and provide the necessary assurances to European citizens that imported animals, food and feed meet the same high standards as for animals and goods produced within the EU. Commission oversight of Member States' performance of import controls continued in the period 2017-2018, the results confirming Member States' efforts to continuously improve the way in which import controls are carried out. The Commission also continued to carry out inspections of new or modified border inspection posts in the context of their approval and subsequent listing 55 . In 2018, an overview report 56 on how Member States implement official controls on goods subject to special import conditions collated the main findings of audits in 12 Member States in 2015 and 2016. The audits focused on how Member States were implementing two particular types of import controls: \"enhanced controls\" 57 and \"re-enforced checks\" 58 . Whilst the overall results of these audits were positive, the overview report highlighted opportunities for improvement in the way in which certain Member States developed and implemented their monitoring plans used to target high-risk commodities for laboratory analyses. It also highlighted that recommendations made to the respective Member States had been acted on, resulting in strengthened import control systems in those Member States. The results were shared with all Member States in a Commission-organised workshop, designed to share experiences and good practices. 2.12.Genetically Modified Organisms Four audits assessed the official controls of genetically modified organisms (GMO) including their deliberate release into the environment. The audits looked into the organisation of the controls including staffing, planning, documented procedures, and the implementation of those controls including sampling, testing and enforcement measures. The audits concluded that the official control systems for GMO, including their deliberate release and cultivation, were well organised. Weaknesses were identified in the areas of sampling and testing. 3.BTSF BTSF is a Commission training initiative covering food and feed law, animal health and welfare and plant health rules and also organic farming and quality schemes. . BTSF held 275 training courses in the Member States covering a whole spectrum of subjects from food and feed law to animal health and welfare to plant health rules during 2017-2018. A range of courses is also offered in non-EU countries. Ten e-learning modules are available in five languages 59 . In this context, it is worth highlighting the awareness-raising work done on AMR. A series of 15 workshops on the prevention and control of AMR in the context of an overall \"One Health\" approach 60 started at the end of 2017. The workshops aimed to spread knowledge to government officials in all EU countries working in the human health and veterinary sectors with the following main objectives: spreading knowledge on methods of prevention and control of AMR in the veterinary and human medicine sectors with a \"One health\" approach; further harmonising Member States' approaches and sharing best practices in the field of use of antimicrobials; increasing the efficacy of the competent authority in the field of AMR monitoring, reporting and control; increasing the compatibility of procedures and practices between public health authorities and veterinary\/food safety authorities across the EU. In December 2018, the Commission organised a workshop on preparedness of veterinary services for natural disasters. Based on the results of a questionnaire sent to all veterinary services in the EU and a fact-finding mission to two Member States 61 , representatives from all Member States were invited to discuss good practices, similarities and differences. The objective was to enable them to better prepare for the sometimes-devastating effects of natural disasters such as forest fires, floods and earthquakes. 4.Follow up of audit recommendations The focus of the Commission control activities in the Member States is to check whether their competent authorities have in place the necessary control systems and enforcement measures to ensure the safety of the food placed on the EU market, the respect of animal welfare rules, and to keep important animal and plant diseases under control. Audits are generally accompanied by recommendations for corrective action. Audit reports are published and provide important insight into the effectiveness of controls and whether the relevant Union legislation is fit for purpose. DG SANTE systematically follows up on actions taken by competent authorities to respond to recommendations made in audit reports. For the Member States, this is done mainly through package meetings known as General Follow-up Audits.

The economy is growing strongly, although more slowly than in recent years. The efficiency of the economy is improving, helped by previous structural reforms. The labour market has improved to record levels, with a continued increase in the employment rate accompanied by a decrease in both the overall unemployment rate and the long-term unemployment rate. However, investment remains below both historical and EU averages, dragging down productivity growth. Income inequality is low and other social indicators are good and improving further. The pace of reform has stalled recently despite the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to the pensions, healthcare and long-term care systems. These reforms are necessary to tackle the challenge of an ageing population and ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. In 2019, Slovenia's economic growth decelerated considerably, but remains robust. After growing by more than 4% in 2017 and 2018, the economy is expected to grow at the slower rate of 2.5% in 2019, and 2.7% in 2020 and 2021. This is somewhat below Slovenia's potential growth rate. There are also risks on the horizon. As a small, open economy, Slovenia remains vulnerable to the continued uncertainty at global level and a further decline in international trade dynamics. However, the economy's diversification should make it relatively resilient to sector-specific shocks. Growth is driven by domestic demand. Consumption is expected to continue to grow at a robust pace, supported by rising employment and disposable income. Although growth of investment in dwellings and other construction remains quite strong, investment growth in machinery and equipment has weakened substantially in 2019, primarily due to global trade uncertainty. With exports growing more slowly than imports, the external sector has a negative impact on growth. The inflation rate was 1.7% in 2019, and is expected to increase only slightly in 2020 and 2021. The unemployment rate is below its pre-crisis level. Helped by economic growth, the unemployment rate fell to 4.6%in 2019, and is expected to stabilise at 4.2% in 2020 and 2021. The long-term unemployment rate continued to decline in 2019, falling 2.2%, well below the euro-area average. However, the long-term unemployment rate of older workers remains a concern, and at the same time certain sectors face labour market shortages. Fiscal policy was pro-cyclical in 2019. The general government budget was in balance in 2017, and reached a surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 2018. The surplus fell to 0.5% of GDP in 2019, and is expected to remain broadly stable over the medium term. Although revenues continue to increase due to economic growth, this effect is more than offset by expenditure increases and tax reductions. Public debt is forecast to fall from 70.4% of GDP in 2018 to below the 60% of GDP threshold in 2021, after having peaked at 82.6% of GDP in 2015. Further investment in innovation and infrastructure (environmental, transport and energy) remains necessary to keep Slovenia on a sustainable growth path. The innovation potential of the economy is hampered by: rather low public investment in research and innovation, limited science-industry cooperation and uneven innovation and digital capacities among firms. Waste is well managed overall, but urban wastewater and water losses are still causes for concern. Sustainable transport connections, in particular rail, are not sufficiently developed to fully support a carbon-friendly modal shift or the economic development of lessdeveloped regions. However, investment in sustainable transport is increasing. The share of renewable energy remains low. The ageing of Slovenia's population means that significant investments are necessary to ease pressure on the healthcare and long-term care systems. The transition away from coalmines and coal-powered electricity production is at an early stage. Overall, Slovenia has made limited progress in addressing the 2019 country-specific recommendations ( 2 ). This assessment does not take into account the contribution of the EU 2021-2027 cohesion policy funds. There has been some progress in the following areas: Older and low-skilled workers - Slovenia implemented a number of measures to increase the employability of low-skilled and older workers. Others measures are being discussed, awaiting adoption, and awaiting implementation. Business environment - Slovenia has taken measures to reduce the costs of compliance with regulations, in particular by promoting e-procedures and e-services. Public procurement - Slovenia adopted reforms to strengthen the independent oversight of public procurement, and also continued to train procurement officers. Focus investment-related economic policy on research and innovation Slovenia has not fully implemented its research and innovation strategy, and there is little harmonisation among different policies and strategies. Focus investment-related economic policy on sustainable transport, in particular rail Slovenia published an investment plan for transport to increase the funding of railways and sustainable mobility in the period 2020-2025. It also adopted an action plan for alternative fuels in transport that set specific objectives and outlined specific measures. Privatisations Another 10% of the shares of the largest bank, Nova Ljubljanska Banka, have been sold. The sale of Abanka, the third largest Slovenian bank, was also finalised in 2019. Both these measures were expected under State aid rules. However, other privatisations have come to a halt. There has been limited progress in the following areas: Pensions - Although some measures have been adopted to improve the adequacy of pensions, no measures have been taken to ensure the long-term sustainability of the pension system. Equity markets - Slovenia tries to support equity markets financially, mainly by using EU funds. However, other factors hampering the development of equity markets have not been addressed. Healthcare - Slovenia has not yet presented a legislative proposal, but some other measures on improving the performance of the system are ongoing. Focus investment-related economic policy on the low-carbon and energy transition - Slovenia received about 90 million for climate change adaptation from the cohesion policy for 2014-2020. The selection and implementation of projects has improved. However, a comprehensive climate change strategy covering all sectors has not yet been drawn up. A more specific regulatory framework for adaptation to climate change is planned to be included in the Environmental Protection Law, which is currently being adopted. The use of low-carbon energy is limited. The implementation of low-carbon projects in the fields of transport and power generation is lagging behind. Slovenia took the necessary steps to upgrade its draft National energy and climate plan, but failed to submit it by the deadline. Focus investment-related economic policy on investment in environmental infrastructure Slovenia accelerated the implementation of the EU co-financed wastewater projects but investment gap still prevail in this sector. In addition, the integration of environmental aspects, particularly, nature considerations, into planning and implementing infrastructure projects, is challenging. To tackle the challenges in the water sector, the Government proposed an amendment of the national water legislation in December 2019. There has been no progress in the following areas: Long-term care A proposal was not publicly available by the end of 2019. However, the Ministry of Health announced that one would be ready for early 2020. On the indicators of the Social Scoreboard supporting the European Pillar of Social Rights, Slovenia is performing well. Income inequality is low and the risk of poverty and social exclusion has decreased in recent years. The early leaving rate from education and training is very low but significant gender gaps exist, with males achieving worse educational outcomes at the age of 15 and lower tertiary attainment rates. The labour market participation of older workers and low-skilled workers is low, and old-age poverty remains a challenge. Slovenia is making good progress towards its national targets under the Europe 2020 strategy. It has already achieved or is well on track to achieving national targets for employment the early school leaving rate, tertiary educational attainment, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the 2020 target for R&D and renewable energy are not likely to be reached. Slovenia is performing well on the SDGs ( 3 ). On most sub-indicators, in particular the social ones, Slovenia is performing better than the EU average. Slovenia performs particularly well in sub-theme inequality within countries of SDG10 (see Section 3.3.3). However, there are a few indicators where Slovenia is below the EU average and on a deteriorating path. From a macroeconomic perspective, investment as a share of GDP (SDG 9) is also worth mentioning. It stood at 19.2% in 2018, below the EU average of 20.9%, and has been falling in recent years. The key structural issues analysed in this report that point to particular challenges for Slovenia's economy are set out in the paragraphs below. The ageing of the population is putting a strain on the pension, healthcare and long-term care systems. Age-related expenditure is expected to increase by about 6% of GDP between 2016 and 2070, one of the largest increases in the EU. Notably, pension expenditure is expected to increase from 10.9% of GDP in 2016 to 14.9% of GDP in 2070. A reform aiming at improving pension adequacy and encouraging workers to work longer was adopted in November 2019. The Fiscal Council estimates that this reform will increase pension expenditure by 1pp. of GDP by 2040. At the same time, no concrete action has been decided for the second pillar of the reform, intended to improve the sustainability of the system. Furthermore, the use of long-term unemployment and long-term-sick-leave schemes as \"bridges\" to retirement put a further strain on the sustainability of the pension system. Overall, healthcare outcomes are good, but expenditure is rising, and public healthcare financing is strongly cyclical. There is therefore a risk that revenues might not cover increased expenditure in an economic downturn. The government is currently re-initiating the process for a comprehensive reform of the healthcare system ( 4 ). Slovenia does not have an overarching law that covers long-term care. Slovenia's ageing population means that chronic conditions will be more prevalent in the future. This will make it necessary to: (i) devise new care models; (ii) place greater emphasis on sickness prevention; and (iii) ensure the integration of the healthcare system with the long-term care system. The government intends to present a legislative proposal covering long-term care in the first half of 2020. Boosting investment could further improve potential growth and productivity. Labour productivity is now growing again, after a period in which it failed to close the gap with the EU average. This improvement has been driven primarily by efficiency gains, as past structural reforms are now paying off. However, investment remains below historical and EU averages, choking off a more rapid catchup towards average EU productivity levels. Potential growth is nevertheless expected to stabilise at a robust [3.5%] per year. The inactivity rates of older and less skilled workers are high while labour shortages are increasing. The inactivity rate of 55-64 year olds is significantly higher than the EU average. The unemployment rate, and the longterm unemployment rate in particular, are also above the EU average for this cohort. This early exit from the labour market is underpinned by several factors, including low participation in life-long learning and certain features of the unemployment and health systems. As the labour market tightens, labour shortages are becoming more acute, partly due to skills mismatches and insufficient digital literacy. The banking sector has improved steadily, but alternative sources of finance are not sufficiently developed to support innovation and growth. Banks' profitability, solvency and asset quality have improved significantly, although the low-interest-rate environment puts banks under pressure to reduce costs and increase revenues. Strong growth in consumer lending led the Bank of Slovenia to issue binding measures to mitigate risks. Slovenia's equity and venture capital markets are still not sufficiently developed and the market capitalisation of the national stock exchange is low. The underdeveloped equity markets, which partly reflect the small size of the economy, may stifle market entry and the growth of innovative and highpotential firms. Despite significant privatisation measures taken in 2018 and 2019, the State still plays a significant role in the economy. In 2018-2019, Slovenia further reduced its stake in Nova Ljubljanska Banka and fully privatised Abanka. However, the State still plays a dominant role in some crucial sectors, such as insurance and telecommunications, and there are plans to increase its role in the tourism sector. This could hamper competition and efficient resource allocation. Although the business environment has improved, problems remain regards public procurement and administrative\/regulatory burden. Slovenia has taken measures to gradually reduce administrative burden and regulatory restrictions, but both remain obstacles for businesses. The justice system continues to reduce its backlog but commercial court proceedings often remain lengthy and the prosecution of economic and financial crime faces difficulties affecting business decisions. Slovenia is implementing measures to improve professionalisation and strengthen remedy procedures in public procurement. However, competition in public procurement and tender aggregation in the health sector remain problematic, potentially leading to higher costs for the Slovenian taxpayer and lost opportunities for its businesses. Balancing trade-offs to achieve clean energy transition. The carbon intensity of the economy is rather high, primarily due to transport, electricity production, and heating. In order to reduce carbon intensity, the infrastructure for cleaner and renewable energy sources will need to be built, which could have an impact on the natural heritage, if not appropriately managed. A comprehensive strategy for climate change adaptation has not yet been drawn up. Severe socioeconomic impacts and environmental degradation can be observed in Slovenia's coalmining regions. The Commission's proposal for a Just Transition Mechanism under the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 includes a Just Transition Fund, a dedicated just transition scheme under InvestEU, and a new public sector loan facility with the EIB. It is designed to ensure that the transition towards EU climate neutrality is fair by helping the most affected regions in Slovenia to address the social and economic consequences. Key priorities for support by the Just Transition Fund, set up as part of the Just Transition Mechanism, are identified in Annex D, building on the analysis of the transition challenges outlined in this report. 1. Economic situation and outlook GDP growth In 2019, Slovenia's economy grew at a solid rate, but the current economic cycle appears to have already peaked. Slovenia's GDP is expected to have grown by 2.5%in 2019, after growth of 4.1% in 2018. The slowdown was primarily due to the declining contribution of the external sector, related to a global slowdown in trade. Over the first three quarters, exports grew by 4.6% (compared to the same period in 2018), slightly less than imports, which rose by 5.0%. Domestic demand remained the main driver of growth. Private consumption continued to rise, supported by the relatively strong increase in household disposable income. Investment growth was particularly strong in residential construction (12.2%), while investment in machinery and equipment increased by 3.1%. Graph 1.1:Composition of GDP growth Source: European Commission Winter forecast 2020 In the coming years, annual GDP growth is expected to remain at 2.7%. As in 2019, domestic demand is expected to drive economic development, with net exports making a negative contribution (Graph 1.1). Growing disposable income and employment will continue to support private consumption, which is expected to continue to increase at a relatively strong pace. Investment is expected to be driven by demand for new housing, which had been sluggish in previous years. At the same time, the uncertainty prevailing in global markets limits firms' willingness to invest, despite the tight labour market and high rate of capacity utilisation. In particular, investment in machinery and equipment is expected to continue growing at the relatively muted rate it recorded in 2019. In 2020 and 2021, the risks the country faces are mainly related to the external environment. However, the Slovenian economy may be relatively resilient as its export structure is diversified and not particularly strongly affected by sector-specific shocks. Graph 1.2:Composition of potential growth Source: European Commission Autumn forecast 2019 Slovenia's growth potential is increasing. Overall, potential growth is currently expected to stabilise at 3.5%. Although total factor productivity recovered quickly after the crisis, the contribution of capital accumulation remains low. Looking ahead, the contribution to potential growth from investment is expected to increase, while the contribution from labour is expected to decline after 2021 due to the ageing population. (Graph 1.2). Investment remains below the EU's and Slovenia's long-term average levels. Investment in R&D ('other investment') is growing at rather low rate. This is detrimental to the achievement of SDG 8 and 9. In absolute terms, investment in the manufacturing sector has increased compared to the pre-crisis period (driven by metal products, electrical equipment and motor vehicles) but it has decreased in sectors such as wholesale and retail trade, transportation and storage and even information and communication. Inflation Inflation remains moderate. After a deflationary period 2015-2016, prices in Slovenia developed closely in line with those in the euro area in 2017 and 2018. Yet, in 2019, inflation reached 1.7% markedly higher than the inflation rate of 1.2% in the euro area. Main driver of this growth, were the prices of services. Price increases, particularly in services, reflect also recent wage increases. For the coming years, it is expected that inflation will remain close to 2.0%, somewhat above the euro area inflation rate. Core inflation (net of energy and food prices) is expected to reach above 1.6% over the forecast horizon. Labour market The labour market continues to improve with rising employment and falling unemployment. The employment rate was 75.4% in 2018 and improved to 76.5% by the third quarter of 2019. It is forecast to further improve over the coming years. This, combined with an inflow of foreign workers, is expected to help alleviate labour supply constraints to some extent. The unemployment rate further declined from the 2018 average of 5.1% in 2018 to 4.6% in 2019. Over the coming years, it is expected to decline further. The tightening of the labour market has been accompanied by growing wage pressures. Nominal compensation per employee ( 5 ) increased by 3.9% in 2018 and is projected to continue growing by 3.6% in both 2019 and 2020 respectively. This is mainly due to the rise in public sector pay (agreed in negotiations with trade unions at the end of 2018), and the additional increase in the net minimum wage by 3.4% to 700, in line with the act adopted in December 2018 (European Commission, 2019 a). Real compensation per employee, which grew by 1.7% in 2018, is projected to grow 2% in 2019. In 2020 and 2021, the growth of real compensation would be slightly lower as inflation is projected to accelerate. Despite improved labour market conditions, structural challenges are still a concern. The working age population is decreasing, due to the rapidly ageing population. Challenges persist in the labour market participation of older workers (aged 55-64). Despite recent increases, their employment rate remained well below the EU average in 2018 (47.0% compared to 58.7% in the EU). The contrast is even starker for low-skilled older workers, who had an employment rate of 30.5% (compared to 44.0% in the EU) in 2018. Social developments Inequality is low and the share of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion has on average decreased, but remains high for the elderly. Slovenia is performing well on most indicators related to poverty and inequality. Income inequality is the lowest in the EU and the share of income of the poorest 40% of the population is one of the highest. In 2018, the at-risk-of-poverty-or-social exclusion rate (AROPE) decreased by 0.9pps to 16.2%. The decrease is due to a decrease in the severe material deprivation rate (-0.9pps) and a very low work intensity rate (0.8pps). The at-risk-of-poverty rate (AROP) was the same in 2018 as in the previous year (13.3%) and below the EU average for 2018 (17.1%). Yet, the rate of old-age poverty (24.4% compared to an EU average of 20.9% in 2018), which mainly affects women over the age of 65, remains a challenge. Competitiveness Slovenia's export market share was increasing, supported by moderate unit labour cost developments and a favourable destination mix. Slovenia's export market share increased by 4.7 pps back in 2018. This increase is expected to continue, for both goods and services, also supported by the relatively stable growth in Slovenia's destination markets. The nominal wage growth has led to an increase in nominal unit labour costs. Unit labour costs grew by 3% in 2018 and are expected to peak at 3.3% in 2019, still below that of other Member States in the region. Growth in unit labour costs is then expected to moderate gradually. Graph 1.3:Compensation per employee and labour productivity, annual % change Source: Eurostat External position Slovenia's current account has been in surplus since 2012. Slovenia's current account balance turned positive in 2012 and peaked at 6.1% of GDP in 2017. After posting a surplus of 5.7% of GDP in 2018, it is expected to have declined further in 2019, as imports are expected to have grown faster than exports due to stronger domestic demand. Although both goods and services balances are in surplus, the surplus in services is especially strong. The current account surplus is higher than might have been expected based on economic fundamentals ( 6 ). The same holds for the cyclically adjusted current account surplus, which exceeded 8% of GDP in 2018, and is projected to remain at comparable levels in 2019-2021. In addition to trade balance, the surplus is driven by public and private deleveraging, as well as low investment. The high current account surplus supported a rapid improvement of the net international investment position. Slovenia's passive net international investment position has broadly halved from 2012 to 2019 (Graph 1.4). In particular, the banking sector has built up net foreign assets since 2014 and has been able to maintain this position afterwards. Government liabilities have declined sharply since 2015. Non-financial corporations have maintained small liabilities since 2015. The net international investment position is expected to improve further thanks to the current account surplus and the fall in government debt. Graph 1.4:Net international investment position (NIIP) by sector Source: Eurostat Financial sector Slovenia's banking sector has improved significantly, showing better profitability, better asset quality and strong liquidity. The return on equity has increased and the ratio of non-performing loans has declined, reaching 4.5% in June 2019 (from 22.8% in 2014). Banks also enjoy a relatively stable funding basis and abundant liquidity. Despite the privatisation of a number of its bank holdings, the Slovenian state still plays a substantial role in the financial sector (see Section 3.2.1). Private debt The private indebtedness ratio continues to decline. Since the indebtedness ratio peaked in 2010 (at 115.2% of GDP), private sector debt fell to 72.8% of GDP in 2018, and was below both prudential and fundamental benchmarks ( 7 ) in 2019. Credit flow has turned positive and is supporting economic growth, but rapid nominal GDP growth until end 2018 still caused the private debt-to-GDP ratio to decline. In November 2019, the Bank of Slovenia in line with slowing economic fundamentals, adopted macroprudential measures to limit the growth of credit, especially consumer loans. These measures include the capping of consumer loan durations and limiting the ratio of annual debt servicing costs to a borrower's net income. Graph 1.5:Debt decomposition (1) * estimated figures using quarterly data Source: Eurostat Housing market The strong increase in house prices since 2016 has been mainly driven by the lack of supply of residential buildings. Since the summer of 2016, prices for residential buildings in Slovenia have been increasing strongly. In 2018, house prices recorded the highest pace of real growth since the financial crisis (7.4%, which is faster than wage growth), making Slovenia one of the euro-area Member States that registered the highest annual growth in house prices. The favourable economic situation and buoyant labour market have played a role, but the low level of investment in residential buildings was the major factor in pushing up house prices. Despite the favourable interest rates, credit growth has been less buoyant than in the run-up to the crisis. The banking system is less exposed and more resilient to potential shocks in the real estate market than during the last financial crisis. Banks' exposure is further limited by the recent macro-prudential measures taken by the Bank of Slovenia. House prices are still growing, but first signs of a slowdown were observed in 2019. A gradual slowdown in the demand for residential buildings (due to diminishing affordability) and an increase in construction have started to mitigate house price growth in 2019. It is expected that, with a further recovery in construction activity, house prices will continue to moderate in the near future. Regional disparities Regional and sub-regional disparities in Slovenia persist. Eastern Slovenia lags behind Western Slovenia (which includes the capital) in GDP per capita (71% and 103% of the EU average in 2017 respectively). However, the cross-regional coefficient of variation of GDP per head weighted by population is one of the lowest in the euro area. The disparities are pronounced at sub-regional (local) level. In particular, the role of the capital sub-region around Ljubljana in the economy is predominant: it produced 37% of national GDP in 2017, with 26% of country's population. Its GDP per capita in 2017 (120% of the EU average) was almost three times higher than in Slovenia's poorest region (Zasavska, 45% of the EU average). The population is growing in Western Slovenia but shrinking in the Eastern. Between 2000 and 2017, the population of Eastern Slovenia shrunk by 0.4%, while it grew by 7.7% in Western Slovenia. The sub-regional picture is more complex. Two of the least developed sub-regions (Pomurska and Zasavska) lost more than 7% and 5% respectively of their population due to both, natural population decrease (more deaths than births) and emigration. The population of the capital sub-region and the coastal Obalno-Kraska sub-region grew significantly (12% and 8% respectively). Although the capital sub-region experienced natural population increase and net immigration, population growth in other sub-regions was only due to net immigration. Graph 1.6:GDP per capita in Slovenian regions, 2017 Source: Eurostat Divergent population trends underpinned convergence in GDP per capita, despite the slow economic growth in the less developed region. Between 2010 and 2017, GDP grew faster in Western Slovenia than in the less developed eastern part of the country (1.7% annually against 1.4%). However, the fast growing population of the western regions (in particular the capital sub-region) resulted in convergence in GDP per capita (see Section 3.4). Public finances The general government overall balance is expected to remain in surplus. The general government surplus is forecast to have decreased from 0.8% of GDP in 2018 to 0.5% of GDP in 2019. This reduction was driven by the economic slowdown, a strong increase in government expenditure and the revenue-decreasing measures adopted by the Parliament. The surplus is expected to stay at 0.5% of GDP in 2020, due to further tax reduction measures, and to increase slightly to 0.6% of GDP in 2021. Slovenia's structural fiscal position is expected to improve gradually in the coming years. The debt-to-GDP ratio continues to decline but this trend could change again in the longer term. Thanks to the low interest rate environment, active public debt management, general government surplus and privatisation proceeds, public debt is forecast to decline below the reference value of 60% of GDP in 2021. This would help Slovenia achieve SDG 17. However, because expenditure on pensions, healthcare and long-term care is projected to increase significantly (due to both the ageing of the population and the pension measures adopted in 2019), the debt-to-GDP ratio could start increasing again in the longer term. Sustainable development goals Overall, Slovenia is performing well with regard to the SDGs. On most sub-indicators, in particular the social ones, it is performing better than the EU average. Slovenia performs particularly well with regard to SDG 10, sub-theme inequality within countries (see Section 3.3.3). There are, however, a few indicators, where Slovenia is below the EU average and showing a negative trend. From a macro-economic perspective, the share of investment in GDP (SDG 9) is worth mentioning. It stood at 19.2% in 2018, below the EU average of 20.9%. This challenge is discussed in Chapter 1. The Slovenian development strategy 2030 aims to reach the average EU emission productivity and achieve a 27% share of renewable energy sources in final energy consumption.

Progress with country-specific recommendations Slovenia has a good track record in implementing country-specific recommendations (CSRs). Since the start of the European Semester in 2011, there has been substantial progress or full implementation of almost 60% of all CSRs addressed to Slovenia (Graph 2.1). However, more than 10% of the CSRs addressed to Slovenia have recorded no or only limited progress in the implementation. Graph 2.1:Level of implementation of 2011-2019 Country-Specific Recommendations (CSRs) (1) The overall assessment of the country-specific recommendations related to fiscal policy excludes compliance with the Stability Growth Pact.

(3) The multiannual country-specific recommendations' assessment looks at the implementation until 2020 Country Report since the country-specific recommendations were first adopted. Source: European Commission The public debt ratio is decreasing rapidly but pressure on the longterm sustainability of public finances remains. The public debt ratio increased four-fold with the crisis, peaking at 82.6% of GDP in 2015. Also due to policy action, the ratio has rapidly decreased to 70.4% in 2018 and is expected to fall below 60% in 2021. In parallel, the fiscal framework has been strengthened. At the same time, fiscal policy has become pro-cyclical due to: (i) the expiration of temporary measures taken during the crisis; and (ii) further expansionary measures introduced recently. Due to ageing-related costs, particularly on pensions, the pressure on the long-term sustainability of public finances remains significant. The Slovenian banking sector has improved remarkably since 2014. Decisive policy action and the improving macroeconomic situation have helped the banking sector to recover rapidly since 2014. The non-performing loans ratio continues to decline. It reached 4.5% in June 2019, down from 7.4% a year earlier. At the same time, profitability increased and the average capital adequacy ratio is solid (18.1% in June 2019). The sale of shares of Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB) and Abanka in 2018 and 2019, stemming from the 2013 State aid commitments, will further help ensure the viability of the sector in the long term. Measures have been adopted to increase the employability of low-skilled and older workers. Since 2011, Slovenia has been recommended to take measures to increase the employability of low-skilled and older workers. The 2013 labour market reform and targeted active labour market policies somewhat increased employment opportunities for older and low-skilled workers. However, their participation rate remains low. The business environment has improved, although progress has slowed down recently. Slovenia has reduced the number of regulated professions significantly, but progress has slowed down in recent years. Measures have been taken to reduce administrative burden and efforts are continuing. A comprehensive framework for the governance of state-owned enterprises was put in place after the crisis. However, there is a risk that the capacity of the Slovenian Sovereign Holding is weakened after 2020 when its assets will be gradually transferred back to the state (see Section 3.1.5). With the use of national and EU funding, Slovenia tries to improve alternative funding for SMEs and fast-growing companies. In 2019, Slovenia made limited progress in addressing the first of the 2019 CSRs. Despite intensive discussions there is still no proposal for a comprehensive healthcare reform. The reform is expected to be discussed by the government only in mid-2020. Other measures were announced but these address the CSR only to a limited extent. A reform proposal for long-term care was announced for release in early 2020 but no details have been revealed or discussed with stakeholders. The pension reform adopted in November 2019 improves the adequacy of pensions but puts a strain on the sustainability of the pension system in the long term. At the same time, measures taken in 2012 to limit early retirement seem to be having some effect, but the early exit from the labour market remains a challenge. Slovenia also implemented a number of measures to increase the employability of low-skilled and older workers. Other initiatives (such as on digital literacy) are still at the proposal stage. Slovenia made some progress in addressing the second of the 2019 CSRs. Slovenia tries to support equity markets, mainly using EU funds but the still significant state ownership in some sectors and the regulatory framework continue to reduce the potential of Slovenia's capital markets to further develop (see Section 3.2.2). Slovenia continued improving the business environment. However, instruments like the Single Document, the regulatory impact assessments and the SMEs test are not fully effective yet (see Section 3.4.2). Slovenia also adopted an important reform of the National Review Commission, thereby strengthening independent oversight of public procurement. Slovenia is also training procurement officers and providing guidance to improve professionalisation of tendering authorities. There has been progress with e-procurement and the SME participation in tenders has increased. While the privatisation of state-owned or state-controlled banks, in line with obligations under state aid rules, was finalised in 2019 (see Section 3.1.5), other planned privatisations have come to a halt. Slovenia made limited progress in addressing the third of the 2019 CSRs. The country is adopting and implementing relevant strategies and developing investment plans. This assessment does not take into account the contribution of the EU 2021-2027 cohesion policy funds ( 8 ). To tackle the challenges in the water sector, the Government proposed an amendment of the national water legislation in December 2019. Upon request from a Member State, the European Commission can provide tailor-made expertise via the Structural Reform Support Programme to help design and implement growth-enhancing reforms. Since 2016, such support has been provided to Slovenia for about 40 projects. In 2019, several projects were delivered on the ground. The Commission, for example, facilitated the exchange of good practices on promoting supplementary pension savings. Support for improving the healthcare system also continued. Tools were developed to: (i) assess the performance of the health system; (ii) plan the healthcare workforce; (iii) assess patient safety; and (iv) measure the quality of care. In addition, Slovenia received assistance from the Commission for deploying integrated long-term care services and for updating the system for reimbursing hospital services. In 2019, work also started on promoting the labour-market integration of the long-term unemployed and those not in employment, education, or training. The Commission is also assisting the authorities in the preparation of the Strategic Environmental Assessment of the Slovenia's draft integrated national energy and climate plan.

Source: European Commission For CSR 3: The regulatory framework underpinning the programming of the 2021-2027 EU cohesion policy funds has not yet been adopted by the co-legislators, pending inter alia an agreement on the multiannual financial framework (MFF). Box 2.1: EU funds and programmes to address structural challenges and to foster growth and competitiveness in Slovenia Slovenia is an important beneficiary of the EU funds. The financial allocation from the EU Cohesion policy funds ( I ) for Slovenia amounts to 3.8 billion in the current Multiannual Financial Framework, equivalent to around 1.2% of the GDP annually. By the end of 2019, some 3.5 billion (around 93% of the total) was allocated to specific projects, while 1.6 billion was reported as spent by the selected projects ( II ), showing a level of implementation above the EU average. While bringing about a more harmonious development through reducing economic, social and territorial disparities, EU Cohesion policy funding also contributes to addressing structural challenges in Slovenia. The Cohesion policy programme for Slovenia has allocated EU funding of almost 1 billion to smart growth, almost 1.2 billion to sustainable growth and sustainable transport and more than 800 million to inclusive growth. EU Cohesion policy funding is contributing to major transformations of the Slovenian economy. It is doing so by promoting growth and employment through investments in areas such as research, technological development and innovation, competitiveness of enterprises, in low-carbon economy, sustainable transport, employment, social inclusion and education. By 2019, investments driven by European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund have already supported cooperation of 180 enterprises with research institutions, over 15,000 people are already benefitting from improved water supply and almost 320,000 square metres of public buildings were renovated to be more energy efficient. The funds have also supported flood protection measures, which will benefit almost 18,000 people. More than 950 educational institutions will be connected to wireless networks and more than 310 new export companies will be supported. The European Social Fund focuses on helping people to find a job, in particular for young people (23,460 young people) and low-skilled and older workers (25,000 people). It also contributes to the promotion of social inclusion and the fight against poverty (19,000 people). 42,900 participants will be involved in programmes to acquire new skills and to raise their level of education ( III ). Agricultural and fisheries funds and other EU programmes also support the investment needs. The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development makes available in total 1.1 billion and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund in total 30.2 million (including the national co-financing for both). Slovenia benefits also from other EU programmes, such as the Connecting Europe Facility, which allocated EU funding of 331 million to specific projects on strategic transport networks, and Horizon 2020 allocated EU funding of 257 million (including 153 SMEs with about 68 million). EU funding helps to mobilise important private investment. By the end of 2018, European Structural and Investment Funds ( IV ) supported programmes mobilised additional capital by committing about 333 million in the form of loans, guarantees and equity ( V ). This amount accounted for 8.8% of all decided allocations of the European Structural and Investment Funds. EU funds already invest substantial amounts on actions in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In Slovenia, European Structural and Investment Funds support 12 of the 17 SDGs and up to 95% of the expenditure is contributing to those. 3. Reform priorities 3.1.Public finances and taxation 3.1.1.fiscal policy The general government headline balance remains in surplus, and the public debt ratio continues to fall. According to the Autumn 2019 Economic Forecast, the budget surplus is expected to have decreased from 0.8% of GDP in 2018 to 0.5% of GDP in 2019, due to the economic slowdown and tax relief on the annual holiday allowance (European Commission, 2019 b). The surplus is forecast to remain broadly stable in 2020 and 2021. In structural terms, the government deficit is expected to have deteriorated from 0.7% of GDP in 2018 to 1.0% in 2019 but is expected to improve slightly in the coming years. Supported by the headline surplus, active public debt management, the low interest rate environment and privatisation proceeds, public debt is projected to fall from 66.7% of GDP in 2019 to below 60% in 2021. New tax measures adopted in October 2019 lower the tax burden on labour, while revenues from the recurrent taxation of immovable property and capital remain below the EU average. In addition to exempting the annual holiday allowance from income tax and social security contributions, the Parliament has adopted changes to the tax code to reduce labour taxes by lowering tax rates, increasing tax brackets and increasing the general allowance. The tax changes, which became effective at the beginning of 2020, mostly benefit middle-income and high-income earners, while low-income and secondary earners (spouses with lower labour income) keep facing a high labour tax wedge (European Commission, forthcoming). To compensate partially for the revenue loss, taxes on capital gains, rental income and corporate income have been slightly increased, and there are plans to improve tax collection. The government has withdrawn the new reform proposal on real estate taxation planned for 2020, although recurrent taxes on immovable property are considered to be less detrimental to growth than corporate taxes, and its revenues are currently low (0.5% of GDP compared to an EU average of 1.5% in 2018). Slovenia is also significantly below the EU average in its tax revenues from both capital stock and the various types of capital income (these tax revenues amount to 4.9% of GDP in Slovenia, ranking 21st among Member States, compared to an EU average of 8.5% in 2018), which should be part of a balanced and inclusive tax system. Public expenditure has been increasing strongly. In 2019, expenditure is forecast to have grown faster than revenues, due to: (i) a substantial public sector pay rise negotiated with trade unions in late 2018; (ii) a further relaxation of temporary consolidation measures in the area of social transfers; (iii) an additional increase of social transfers; (iv) indexation of pensions; and (v) an increase in public investment. For 2020, the restricted payment of the performance bonus, stricter conditions for receiving unemployment benefits and lower public investment are expected to attenuate expenditure growth. However, expenditure growth will still remain high. Ageing-related expenditure, particularly on pensions, puts pressure on the sustainability of Slovenia's public finances in the long term ( 9 ). The sustainability gap indicator S2 shows that a fiscal adjustment of 5.4% of GDP is required to stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio in the long term, pointing to medium risks to long-term sustainability ( 10 ). This result is primarily driven by the projected increase in spending on pensions (contributing 3.6% of GDP to the increase). It does not yet take into account the pension measures adopted in November 2019, which are expected to increase the gap further (see Section 3.1.3). Health care and long-term care expenditure also contributed to the sustainability gap. 3.1.2.fiscal framework Slovenia's independent fiscal institutions fulfilled their obligations mandated by law. The scope of the mandate of both the Fiscal Council and the macroeconomic forecaster IMAD is one of the broadest among the new Member States and close to the EU average ( 11 ). While the deviations of the annual budget from the medium-term budgetary framework are overall limited, the revised budgetary documents for 2019 are currently being reviewed by the Constitutional Court for not fully respecting the ceilings set in the adopted framework ( 12 ). The Fiscal Council assessed that fiscal rules will be complied with in 2020 and 2021. However, it also highlighted significant risks to compliance stemming from: (i) inconsistencies between the projections and the adopted or proposed measures; (ii) the possibility of adopting some pending measures with a negative budgetary impact; and (iii) risks related to the macroeconomic environment ( 13 ). In addition, the Fiscal Council has repeatedly pointed to the absence of comprehensive policies to ensure the long-term sustainability of Slovenia's public finances (see Section 3.1.1) ( 14 ). In response, the government confirmed its assessment that the draft budget for 2020 and 2021 is appropriate ( 15 ). 3.1.3.pension system The pension reform ( 16 ) in 2012 had positive short-term and medium-term effects on the adequacy and sustainability of pensions. The 2012 reform gradually increased the statutory retirement age to 65 for men (in 2016) and women (in 2020) and introduced higher penalties for early retirement. The 2012 reform also introduced bonuses for prolonging working lives (European Commission, 2017 a). The number of new old-age and other types of pensioners has been slowly decreasing since 2012, while the number of those contributing to the pension system has been increasing. The ratio between those contributing and those receiving pensions is thus improving. In 2018, it rose to 1.51, up from 1.38 in 2013. Another positive factor affecting this ratio is the inclusion of younger contributors in the pension and disability insurance system on the basis of student work (Government of Slovenia, 2019). The measures to limit early retirement appear to be successful. In 2018, 318 people retired early (less than 2% of new retirees) compared to 475 in 2017. Recent projections indicate a considerable increase in pension expenditure in the long term. The 2012 pension reform is expected to provide a stable pension environment for a ten-year period only. As a percentage of GDP, pension expenditure in Slovenia is projected to increase from 10.9% in 2016 to 14.9% in 2070, which is one of the largest increases in the EU (European Commission, 2018 a). This can mostly be explained by: (i) the early exit of workers from the labour force, itself largely a result of previous pension legislation; and (ii) the retirement of the largest age cohorts, which will also enjoy longer retirement due to increased longevity (Government of Slovenia, 2019; IMAD, 2018; MoLFSAEO, 2018). Further delaying a pension reform aimed at improving the fiscal sustainability of the system increases pressure on government expenditure. Even though the transfer from the state budget to pensions has declined in recent years as employment has improved, it still exceeded 1 billion (2% of GDP) in 2018 (IMAD, 2019 a). Graph 3.1.1:Pension expenditure as % of GDP Source: The 2018 Ageing Report: Economic and Budgetary Projections for the EU Member States (2016-2070), European Commission Long-term unemployment and long-term sick leave are often used as an early exit from the labour market and as a 'bridge' to retirement. Nearly 1 in 4 new retirees in 2018 previously had the status of an unemployed person in the year before their retirement. However, recent legislative changes imposed stricter eligibility conditions on unemployment benefits for older workers. Data indicate that long-term sick leave might also be used to exit the labour market early. The share of employees on long-term sick leave is increasing, and this is especially notable among women aged over 60. This development is not necessarily the result of severe illness. Instead, it may partly reflect the increase in the statutory retirement age introduced by the 2012 pension reform, which led to an increase in the number of older workers. Other features of the labour market, such as the absence of appropriate structural measures to adapt jobs to an ageing population and the lack of effective vocational rehabilitation of workers, may have contributed to this increase as well. These shortcomings potentially have a negative effect on the sustainability of public finances, through the pension and health funds (HIIS, 2018). Poverty among elderly people, especially among women, is still a concern. In 2018, the at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) rates for the age groups 65+ and 75+ were higher than the EU average (20.1% and 23.7%, respectively, compared to EU averages of 18.6% and 20.1%). These rates are especially high for women. Compared with the EU average, the Slovenian pension system produced, in 2018, relatively low aggregate replacement ratios (0.58 and 0.45, respectively) ( 17 ) and low median relative incomes of people aged 65+ (European Commission and Social Protection Committee, 2018). The fiscal consolidation measures adopted after 2012 considerably reduced current pensions as well as the minimum income provision for old people. In September 2019, around 8% of the old-age pensioners in Slovenia received net monthly pensions lower than 300 ( 18 ). The average gross old-age pension is substantially higher (about 640 in 2018) (PDIIS, 2018), but it still does not cover the full costs of care in a public nursing home, only basic care in public nursing homes (Republic of Slovenia, Court of Audit, 2019). The amendment to the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ-2G) adopted in November 2019 will improve the adequacy of pensions. The amendment has two main objectives, namely to support longer work activity without increasing the statutory retirement age, and ensure a decent income in retirement. Provided that the pension-qualifying period of 40 years of work has been attained, the pension rate for men will be raised to the level applicable to women (from 57.3% to 63.5% of the long-term average pay) by 2025, which should improve the pension adequacy of future pensioners. Furthermore, the pension rate for both men and women who have worked for a minimum period of 15 years is also being raised from 26% to 29.5% of the long-term average pay. Higher pension rates will improve the income adequacy of the most vulnerable groups within the pension system, in particular the recipients of the lowest oldage, invalidity and survivors' pensions. Higher pension rates will also increase disability insurance benefits. The new law also introduces an additional bonus (an accrual rate of 1.36% per child for up to three children), which would mainly improve pension adequacy for women. To encourage workers to work longer, major changes are envisaged in the so-called 'dual status'. Pensioners, who qualify for the old age pension and continue to work, would for 3 years receive 40% of the pension they are entitled to, in addition to their salary. After that, their pension will drop to only 20%, as is the case now. However, the new law does not improve the social situation of current pensioners. Nor does it address the longstanding issue that social security contributions of active self-employed persons may be calculated on the basis of the minimum income amount. Currently 80% of self-employed persons make use of this possibility ( 19 ). Unless they have saved for retirement purposes through other channels, they would have to depend on the minimum old-age pension after retirement. (European Commission, 2019 a). The amendment puts a strain on the sustainability of the pension system. The Fiscal Council has estimated that the new legislation will see pension expenditure increase by 1 pp. of GDP by 2040 and even more in the following years, further adding to long-term sustainability risks ( 20 ). Discussions have already started at the technical level between the government and social partners about a possible second reform step to improve the sustainability of the pension system. This second step may include updating the current indexation mechanism and\/or increasing the statutory retirement age. However, no concrete measures have been agreed yet. 3.1.4.healthcare and long-term care The projected increase in healthcare spending due to ageing is weighing on the long-term fiscal sustainability of the system. In 2016, Slovenia's public spending on healthcare accounted for 5.6% of GDP, which was below the EU average of 6.8%. However, driven by changes in demographic structure, public spending on healthcare is projected to increase by 1.0% of GDP between now and 2070 (EU: 0.9%) according to the 'AWG reference scenario' ( 21 ) of the Council's Ageing Working Group (European Commission, 2017 a). When taking into account the impact of non-demographic drivers on future spending growth ('AWG risk scenario' ( 22 )), healthcare expenditure is expected to increase by 2% of GDP between now and 2070 (EU: 1.6 pps). The share of health spending financed by the general government has been increasing, but remains below the EU average. The public share of total health spending has gradually grown since 2014 and reached 72.2% in 2017. This was still below the EU average of 79.4%. However, about half of private spending in Slovenia comes from voluntary healthcare insurance, which is almost a synonym for obligatory health insurance as the vast majority of citizens has taken out such insurance. Accordingly, voluntary healthcare insurance accounts for 14.3% of current health expenditure, the highest share in the EU. Other private spending comes almost entirely from out-of-pocket expenditure (12.3% of total health spending), which is one of the lowest shares in the EU (OECD\/EOHSP, 2019). Previous attempts to reform and broaden the funding sources for the health system have failed. The government relaunched the preparation of a new draft healthcare and health insurance act in autumn 2019. Given the current sensitivity of health sector revenues to labour market fluctuations, the draft act is expected to propose measures to diversify funding streams, such as replacing the current voluntaryhealthinsurance with a compulsory lump-sum contribution. The government intends to transform the health insurer into an active buyer of health services, promoting efficiency in contracting and quality. It plans to launch a consultation in mid-2020 and submit the proposal to the Parliament by autumn 2020. Slovenia has experienced an increase in life expectancy at birth in recent years and has achieved most of the targets of the United Nations' SDGs for health. Life expectancy at birth was 81.2 years in 2017, up from 76.2 years in 2000. Preventive measures and concerted efforts across policy areas have contributed to declines in preventable mortality, although preventable mortality rates are still above the EU average. Suicide rates in Slovenia have considerably decreased since 2000. The growing number of cases of lung cancer in women is still of concern, but Slovenia is progressing with the implementation of a smoking reduction programme and achieving SDG 3. However, in 2017, more than 12 of the almost 20 years of life expectancy gained for Slovenians aged 65 were on average years in which they would have disabilities (Graph 3.1.2). Primary care helps to limit hospital admissions but the number of physicians remains low. The primary care system contributes to low rates of avoidable hospital admissions compared to the EU average. However, the number of doctors in Slovenia (3.1 per 1,000 population) is well below the EU average and patients report difficulties registering with a general practitioner, even in densely populated urban areas. The authorities are trying to increase the attractiveness of working in the system, and more general practitioners are currently being trained. Graph 3.1.2:Dashboard on healthy ageing, 2017 (1) Chronic diseases include heart attack, stroke, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. (2) Basic activities of daily living include dressing, walking across a room, bathing or showering, eating, getting in or out of bed or using the toilet. Source: Eurostat database for life expectancy and healthy life years (data refer to 2017); SHARE survey for other indicators (data refer to 2017) Action is being taken to reduce waiting times. Some 3.3% of the population reported unmet needs for medical care in 2018, mainly due to long waiting times for medical treatment. Waiting times affect all income groups equally. Several measures are being introduced or planned to improve management and reduce waiting lists. These include a mapping of healthcare and long-term care resources (infrastructure, equipment and healthcare workforce), an ereferral scheme and restricting unnecessary referrals to specialists. This will contribute to the achievement of SDG 3. Inefficiencies in pharmaceutical spending exist despite recent efforts by the government. Spending on pharmaceuticals and medical devices is the third largest category of health expenditure in Slovenia and a major component of private spending on health (OECD\/EOHSP, 2019). The authorities consider pharmaceutical policies to improve the situation in some hospitals or the competition in off-patent medicines, including regular updates on pricing and reimbursement and alternative procurement methods (see Section 3.4.4). Slovenia has started a process to improve the governance of both the health system and the hospital financing system. New governance tools on healthworkforce planning at national and regional level have been available since the third quarter of 2019. A system to assess the performance of the health system has been designed and is being implemented. Slovenia has also taken a first step to update the hospital financing system. This step aims to better match the costs of hospital care with insurance reimbursement levels, setting incentives for providing appropriate levels of care. The European Commission is helping Slovenia to implement key healthsector reforms in these areas, including health system governance, hospital financing, quality of care, and long-term care. In addition, the European Structural and Investment Funds are supporting the shift from inpatient to outpatient treatment of mental health conditions. Regional disparities in the health of the population have somewhat decreased, but differences remain. From 2011 to 2017, regional disparities in life expectancy declined, which was mostly due to socio-economic factors. The Obalno-kraska region in Western Slovenia had the highest life expectancy at birth for women. In contrast, the life expectancy at birth for women in the Podravska region in Eastern Slovenia was more than two years lower. For men, the difference between the best and worst performing region was even more than three years (IMAD, 2019 a). Needs for long-term care are growing even faster than for regular healthcare, but under the current system, the integrated provision of long-term care community services are underdeveloped. In 2017, spending on the health component of long-term care was 9.8% of total health expenditure, significantly less than the EU average of 17% (OECD\/EOHSP, 2019). Furthermore, the share of outofpocket financing of long-term care costs has been steadily growing over the last decade and has reached almost 27% of these costs in 2017. In September 2019, the Slovenian Court of Auditors found that the state had failed to provide a viable, financially sustainable solution for long-term care during the last 10 years and to guarantee equal treatment for all. There is a risk that these costs will soon increase as the Slovenian population is ageing rapidly. Efforts to regulate long-term care as part of a unified system in Slovenia have been underway for over 15 years. This is due in particular to the complexity of the system, requiring the interconnection of activities under the purview of several ministries, and the unresolved issue of financing. In 2019, Slovenia, with assistance under the structural reform support programme, progressed for the design of core parameters of the future long-term care system. Pilot schemes testing the future rollout of the system at national level are ongoing. The government also announced that it would present a draft of a comprehensive law in April 2020 and that it expects the law to pass the parliamentary procedure by the end of 2020. 3.1.5.state-owned enterprises Since the financial crisis, the presence of the state in the economy has been reduced and the management of state shareholdings improved. The interlinkages between state-owned banks and state-owned enterprises and political interference in corporate governance were one of the main causes of the deep crisis that hit Slovenia in 2012-2013. Bold policy actions had to be taken in response. In the aftermath of the crisis, a list of state-owned entities for privatisation was set up and the management of state shareholdings was centralised. In 2015, a stateassetmanagement strategy classified state shareholdings into three categories: portfolio, important and strategic. The strategy considered that only the latter category should obtain or maintain a majority government stake. For 'important' entities, the state shareholding could be reduced to 25% plus one share, while 'portfolio' entities could be sold off entirely. Important results were achieved subsequently. The state reduced its shareholdings in several sectors of the economy, albeit with some delays. The average net return on equity in these state-owned bodies almost doubled compared to 2013. The governance framework for state-owned enterprises was also brought in line with the relevant international guidelines (OECD, 2015; Vitale, forthcoming). After two major divestments in 2019, the privatisation process is stalling and might even be partially reversed. In June 2019, the Slovenian Sovereign Holding (SSH) sold Abanka, the third largest bank in Slovenia, to a private investor and reduced the state's ownership in NLB, the largest bank, to 25% plus one share. The state remains by far the largest individual shareholder in NLB and can effectively control the bank. With these two sales, Slovenia has fulfilled commitments given to the European Commission in response to the State aid provided to banks in 2013 (as amended in 2018). No further relevant privatisations were conducted in 2019 or are planned for 2020 and beyond, despite the SSH's 2019 annual asset management plan (SSH, 2018), which still lists 25 'portfolio' and 19 'important' assets (including Abanka and NLB). Instead, the authorities ha implementing the government's tourism strategy, which envisages the consolidation and development of state-owned tourism companies. This would increase state ownership in the tourism sector, at least temporarily, although most of the relevant assets are classified as 'portfolio' or 'important'. At the end of 2020, the operational capacity of the SSH may be weakened. In 2017, a law was passed mandating that the ownership of strategic and important assets should be transferred from the SSH back to the state by the end of 2020. For SSH, this would imply the loss of dividends from its holdings, which have been hovering around 40 million a year in recent years. If sufficient funding for SSH is not ensured, this could impinge on its capacity to perform its duties effectively. It could also weaken the separation between the state's exercise of its ownership function and other - potentially conflicting - state activities, such as market regulation or industrial policy (OECD, 2015). The performance of state-owned enterprises was relatively good in 2018. With a 6.2% net return on equity on an aggregated basis, the performance of state-owned enterprises, that are fully managed by the SSH was slightly lower than in 2017 (6.5%) but above the target value of 6.1% set in the management plan (SSH, 2019). 3.2. Financial sector 3.2.1.banking and insurance Table 3.2.1:Financial soundness indicators, all banks in Slovenia (1) Annualised data. Source: European Central Bank - Consolidated Banking Data (CBD2); European Commission calculations The profitability, solvency and asset quality of the banking sector continue to improve. Return on equity reached 10.7% in 2018, up from 9.1% in 2017, mainly thanks to the net release of impairments. However, profitability might come under pressure when the current release of provisions comes to an end. The average capital adequacy ratio has slightly deteriorated (18.1% in June 2019) due to strong credit growth, but banks remain well capitalised. The non-performing loans ratio has improved further and reached 4.5% in June 2019, down from 7.4% one year earlier. Credit to households continues to grow at a dynamic year-on-year rate of 6.4% in July 2019, while lending to non-financial corporations is more moderate with a year-on-year rate of around 3.0%. With a loan-to-deposit ratio of 74.4% in June 2019, banks benefit from a substantial excess of deposits over loans. This ensures a relatively stable funding basis and abundant liquidity. However, the growing maturity mismatch between long-term loans and sight deposits makes banks vulnerable to a sudden rise in interest rates. Banks need to find new sources of income and control costs to maintain profitability. Current profitability is mainly driven by decreasing impairments and by the release of previous impairments. This is bound to change as new lending progressively generates new impairments. Bank profitability is also likely to come under pressure from persistently low interest rates and increases in compliance, prudential, supervisory and investment costs. One possible strategy to offset these negative factors is to focus on fee income and develop new lending products and services, while enforcing strict and prudent risk management practices. Banks could also opt for partnerships or acquisitions to reduce their costs and achieve economies of scale. Residential real estate prices grew strongly in 2018. As highlighted by the Bank of Slovenia, growth in residential real estate prices picked up in 2018, particularly in Ljubljana and Koper, and was among the highest in the euro area (Bank of Slovenia, 2019). There are first signs of a slowdown in 2019 (see Chapter 1). Consumer lending is a source of concern, due to its high growth and long maturities. Consumer lending grew by 11.8% year-on-year in July 2019, partly driven by the aggressive behaviour of some medium-sized banks underwriting non-purpose-specific consumer loans of longer maturities. Consumer lending represents 27% of the total stock of household loans, the highest percentage in the EU. The average maturity of consumer loans at approval has lengthened markedly over the last 3 years. The original maturity of new consumer loans averaged 7 years in the first quarter of 2019, and exceeded 9 years at certain banks. On 1 November 2019, the Bank of Slovenia activated binding borrower based measures to mitigate risks related to household lending. To prevent the relaxation of credit standards and to improve banks' resilience, the Bank of Slovenia had already decided on 22 October 2018 to expand the existing macroprudential recommendation for housing loans to all consumer loans (European Commission, 2019 a). Despite these measures, the risks associated with consumer lending remained elevated and banks continued to deviate significantly from the recommendations. Therefore, as of November 2019, the Bank of Slovenia changed the recommendation into a binding instrument, placing caps on the maturity of consumer loans (7 years) and on the debt service-to-income ratio for all household loans. The Bank of Slovenia has faced considerable public and political pressure to withdraw its macroprudential measures. The Banking Association, and some important members of the government have strongly criticised the macroprudential initiative of the Bank of Slovenia, some of them even asking the Bank of Slovenia to reverse it. Such pressures should not hamper the independency of the Bank of Slovenia. Non-performing loans (NPLs) have continued their downward trend. Declining NPLs are reported by both the Bank of Slovenia and the European Central Bank. The segment of the credit portfolio most heavily burdened with NPLs is non-financial corporations, despite the improving credit quality of this segment. According to the European Central Bank, NPLs to non-financial corporations fell from 16.3% in June 2018 to 9.3% in June 2019, thanks to a favourable economic environment, solid credit growth and resolute actions by the banks and regulators. Repayments, sales of claims, write-offs and collateral liquidation accounted respectively for 33%, 25%, 25% and 10 % of the reduction in non-performing exposures in 2018. Collateral liquidation is projected to grow in 2019 and 2020, while sales are likely to decrease significantly. The Bank Asset Management Company (BAMC) is progressing towards fulfilling most of its mandate, especially in terms of profitability and assets reduction. The state-owned BAMC, which bought up bad loans from the country's banks in 2013 and 2014, made a profit of 57.7 million in 2018 (compared with 67 million in 2017), after two years of moderate losses. This translates into an average annual return on equity of 28.9% in 2018. Between its inception in 2013 and December 2018, the BAMC generated cumulative cash flows of over 1.5 billion, representing about 74.1% of the transfer value of its assets. The last bonds issued to finance asset transfers were repaid in December 2017 and refinanced by bank loans. Its objective is to reduce its assets to 126.7 million by the end of its mandate in December 2022. The BAMC is confronted with a number of challenges. Firstly, achieving the cost efficiency ratio set by the government will become more and more difficult as residual assets are more costly to manage. Secondly, keeping skilled staff with knowledge of the files in a company with such a short life expectancy is challenging as their skills can sometimes be better remunerated elsewhere. Although it has significantly decreased, the stake of the Slovenian state in the financial sector remains substantial. The sale of 75% of the shares of Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB) and the privatisation of Abanka are steps in the right direction. However, the Slovenian state still controls a significant share of the financial sector through its stakes in NLB and Sava Re. The state directly or indirectly controls 60% of the insurance sector in terms of gross written premiums, an unusually high share in such a non-strategic sector and an outlier in the EU. Several attempts by a foreign insurance group to increase its stake in Sava Re were rejected. Maintaining a high level of state involvement may entail in the longer run risks for financial stability, economic efficiency and public finances (see Section 3.1.5). 3.2.2.access to finance for small and medium-sized companies In a context of very low interest rates, banks financing constitute the bulk of the external funding of SMEs. Credit lines, leasing and bank loans were more relevant and more used for Slovenian SMEs than on average in the EU. In Slovenia, bank loans were relevant for 52% of SMEs (and used by 23% of them), while credit lines were relevant for 60% (used by 40%). Leasing was relevant for 53% and equity for 17% (European Commission, 2019 c). Equity funding remains underdeveloped in light of the ambitions of the Capital Market Union. The limited availability of equity funding in Slovenia adversely affects its innovative start-up and scale-up environment. Slovenia lags behind other EU and central and eastern European countries (e.g. Czechia, Slovakia, Croatia) in the share of private equity funding for businesses (Invest Europe, 2019). Private equity is important for scale-ups, notably those that are looking for more than 500 000 of external funding. Venture capital remains scarce, partly due to an unfavourable regulatory environment and low inflows of venture capital from abroad. According to the European Investment Fund (EIF, 2019), venture capital investment in Slovenia as a share of GDP is one of the lowest in the EU. Slovenia also ranks low in terms of SMEs' confidence in talking about financing with equity investors and venture capital firms and in obtaining the desired equity, with only 9% of the respondents reporting that they felt confident doing this, which is significantly below the EU average of 22% (European Commission, 2019 c). Lack of financial and investment literacy among some types of SMEs and lack of trust in alternative financial sources and the continuity of public financial incentives are contributing to the challenge. The Slovenian capital market has limited effectiveness and attractiveness in bringing investors and companies together. The liquidity of the Slovenian stock exchange is limited ( 23 ). Low trading volumes lead to high per-trade costs. This may be one explanation for why Slovenia lags behind the EU average in its stock market capitalisation. The development of the local capital market could be stimulated by growth funds, further listings (including of currently state-owned enterprises), and allowing private and public pension funds to invest more in equity. Graph 3.2.1:Private equity investments as a % of GDP, average 2016-2018 (1) CEE: Central and Eastern Europe. Source: Invest Europe After a period of rapid growth, Slovenia's FinTech markets have entered a calmer period. Slovenian companies have had a high success rate on several international crowdfunding platforms. Slovenian companies also raised significant funding through initial coin offerings. In 2017, around 5% of funds raised in global initial coin offerings went to Slovenian projects. More recently, the FinTech scene has seen a period of calm, with less projects initiated. Slovenia is preparing a new regulatory framework for block-chain technology. This could include the creation of a regulatory sandbox to facilitate further FinTech innovation. Slovenia is actively beefing up its equity markets with the help of EU funds. According to the 2018\/19 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor survey, Slovenia ranks above the average of highincome countries in the support it gives to SMEs to access finance. The government supports the development of the capital market in particular through studies and pilot projects aimed at improving capital market conditions for SMEs. In August 2019, the Slovene Enterprise Fund (SEF) launched a public call \"Seed Capital Co-investment with private investors\", aimed at supporting innovative start-ups with high growth potential for equity capital, and at encouraging private investors to invest into the seed stage of company development. After favourable first experiences, the government plans to increase the scope of this investment fund in the coming years, mainly by using the EU cohesion policy funds. Furthermore, in 2018, the SEF invested 8 million in the Central European Fund of Funds with the aim of raising equity investment in SMEs. Slovenia's development bank (SID Bank) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) with EU guarantee (EFSI) back the Slovene Equity Growth Investment Programme, each providing 50 million. The programme supports Slovenian SMEs and midcaps (i.e. companies employing up to 3,000 employees), with equity investments aiming to support business growth and expansion, including internationalisation. 3.3. Labour market, education and social policies 3.3.1.Labour Market The labour market continues to record improvements, in line with economic growth. The employment rate continued to increase accompanied by a decline in the unemployment rate (see Chapter 1). The activity rate increased to 80.2% in Q3 2019, above the EU average of 78.8%. The long-term unemployment rate decreased to 2.2% in 2018, compared with the EU average of 2.9%. Labour market improvements are also evident for young people, as the youth unemployment rate decreased sharply (8.8% in 2018 from 11.2% in 2017). Slovenia is performing well on the gender employment gap, which in 2018 was 7.3 pps (against the EU average of 11.5 pps). However, the country is moving away from the SDG target to close 'the gender gap in the inactivity rate due to caring responsibilities'. Furthermore, as a result of the ageing population, challenges, in terms of labour market participation, still persist for older workers (employment rate of 48.9% in Q3 2019 compared to 60.2% in the EU), and, particularly, the low-skilled older workers (employment rate of 27.5% in Q3 2019 compared to 45.3% in the EU). The long-term unemployment of older workers remains a major challenge. In 2018, the long-term unemployment as a percentage of total unemployment of the 55-64 age group was 63.7% (versus an EU average of 58.9%). This is also because unemployment benefits and long-term sick leave are used as a 'bridge' to (early) retirement (see Section 3.2). The wage-setting mechanisms, where wages increase rapidly with seniority, may also contribute to reducing the employability of older workers (European Commission, 2017 a). The government focused its efforts on reducing the low employment rate of workers in the 45-54 and 55-64 age categories, by imposing stricter eligibility conditions for receiving unemployment benefits. The inactivity of people in these age categories has a direct negative impact on the sustainability of the pension and health systems (see Section 3.1.3). One of the remedial measures taken by Slovenia to tackle this issue was the introduction of a subsidy for employers that hire people older than 58 on a permanent basis, with priority given to the employment of recipients of unemployment benefits and cash social assistance. The measure is co-financed by the European Social Fund (European Commission, 2019 a). In 2019, the authorities continued their efforts to reform the unemployment benefit schemes. Following the amendments to the Labour Market Regulation Act passed by the Slovenian Parliament in November 2019, the minimum monthly unemployment benefit will significantly increase from 350 to 530 gross. This will bring it up to the same level as the net basic minimum income for single-person households, which is 402 net. At the same time, the eligibility conditions to access unemployment benefits have been tightened across the board. Consultation of social partners in the Economic and Social Council on legislative proposals has been standard for a long time, but some challenges remain concerning the practical effectiveness of social dialogue. In autumn 2019, the government and the Economic and Social Council agreed to widen the consultation of the social partners from legislative proposals of the government to all legislative proposals tabled in the Parliament. However, late involvement of social partners in the consultations and lack of resources rather often limit the social partners' ability to participate effectively in the social dialogue (European Commission, 2018 b). Active labour market policies are still not sufficiently effective in addressing long-term unemployment. In Q2-2019, the long-term unemployed accounted for 53.3% of all unemployed persons (ESS, 2019), but only for 30% of those included in active labour market policies, although they would have priority. Active labour market policies lack sufficient funding, and funding is not efficiently allocated across different measures and regions. The lack of flexibility in their design and delivery reduces the efficiency of these measures. As a result, current active labour market policies are not suited to address regional differences and specific needs, which limits their effective targeting. Furthermore, there are challenges in creating incentives for the unemployed to search for work. These challenges are partly due to a lack of consistency and policy coordination between the design of active labour-market policies and other related social-policy areas (notably the social protection system). Evaluations of active labour-market policies to date are not sufficiently formalised nor focused on long-term effects. Despite recent positive developments, the persistently high segmentation in the labour market for young people remains a challenge. The share of employees in precarious contracts ( 24 ) is at 3.7% (2018) significantly above the EU average of 2.1%. The employment recovery led to the creation of many permanent jobs, but young people are still more likely than other age groups to be employed in non-standard types of work. These non-standard types of work include self-employment; temporary or part-time jobs; involuntary part-time work; and low-paid jobs. While the share of temporarily employed young people has declined in recent years, it remains very high: 67% in 2018, significantly above the EU average of 43.5%. Labour shortages occur in all sectors. The share of employers reporting labour shortages in 2019 has been high across all sectors (Graph 3.3.1), particularly in construction and industry (40.1% and 38.0%, respectively). However, in both these sectors, it has declined compared to 2018. In the services sector, 22.8% of employers reported labour shortages in 2019 (an increase of 2.6pps compared to 2018). Graph 3.3.1:Labour shortages as reported by employers in the industry, construction and services sector, 2008-2019 Source: Eurostat As Slovenia's population ages, adult up-skilling and re-skilling assume considerable importance. Only 70,000 jobs are categorised as belonging to elementary occupations while the total number of adults with lower secondary qualification or less is around 210,000 and only around 1,000 adults acquire an upper-secondary qualification each year (European Commission, 2019 d). This highlights the need for a more substantial upskilling and reskilling effort. The participation of older employees in lifelong learning is also too low to facilitate adaptation to job digitalisation and automation or for bridging the knowledge and skills mismatch (IMAD, 2019 a). As a share of GDP, Slovenia spends less than a half as the OECD countries on average, on active labour market policies, including re- and up-skilling measures (0.24% compared to 0.52%, respectively, in 2016). 3.3.2.education and skills Participation in early childhood education and care is growing, but there are gaps for certain groups. Participation for children over 4 years was 92.1% in 2017, close to, but still below, both the EU benchmark of 95% for 2020 and the EU average of 95.4%. Participation is low among children from migrant and low socioeconomic backgrounds. These are precisely the children who could benefit substantially from the proven social, intercultural and educational impact of early childhood education and care. Since autumn 2018, kindergartens can apply for funds to offer short free programmes of 240 hours to children in their last year before primary education who have not previously participated in early childhood education (European Commission, 2019 d). The early-school-leaving rate is low, and the achievement of basic skills is good, but there is a large gender gap in reading skills. Slovenia's early-school-leaving rate of 4.2% (2018) is significantly below both the EU average of 10.6%, and Slovenia's own Europe 2020 national target of 5% (European Commission, 2019 d). It also ranks among \"best performers\" on the Social Scoreboard. The OECD's Programme for International Skills Assessment (PISA) shows that the share of underperformers in Slovenia is below the EU average in all three skills ( 25 ). However, the share of underperformers increased by 2.7 pps for reading while remaining largely stable for the other two skills. In December 2019 the Government adopted national strategy for the development of reading literacy 2019-2030. The share of top performers is above the EU average for mathematics and science, but below for reading (OECD, 2019 a). The gender gap in the share of low achievers in all three skills is above the EU average and growing, with boys performing worse, especially in reading (13.9 pps gap, 1.8 pps higher than in 2015, EU average: 9.4 pps). Migrant background and school characteristics significantly affect educational outcomes. The difference between the average performance of learners with a migrant background and that of native students is one of the largest in the EU and has grown since 2015. The gap between schools with many pupils with the migrant background often vocational schools- and other schools is one of the largest in the EU (OECD, 2019 b). The number of hours of Slovenian language lessons available to migrants significantly increased in 2019 from 35 hours to a minimum of 120 hours per pupil in the first year of education. Despite a post-crisis decline, education spending remains significantly higher than the EU average and is set to increase further in 2020. In 2017, general government expenditure on education was higher than the EU average, both as a proportion of GDP (5.4% compared to an EU average of 4.6%) and as a proportion of total general government expenditure (12.6% compared to an EU average of 10.2%) (European Commission, 2019 d). However, the GDP share is significantly lower than the 6.6% of GDP in 2009. The government has, in the coalition agreement, agreed to increase it to 6% of GDP. The government agreed a three-step increase in salaries in the public sector (including teachers) in 2019 and 2020, with a 4% increase for each step. The first two steps were implemented in January and in November 2019. A growing number of teachers are approaching retirement age and shortages are already appearing in certain fields. More than 50% of tertiary education teachers are over 50 years old. The proportion of teachers over 50 is somewhat lower at lower education levels. There is a shortage of special education experts, and in some rural areas also for teachers of subjects such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (European Commission, 2019 d). The proportion of teachers who feel well or very well prepared in using information and communications technology for teaching (67%) is much higher than the EU average (39.4%). The percentage of teachers who believe that teaching is a valued profession in society (5.6%) is one of the lowest in the EU (OECD, 2019 c). Tertiary attainment is high, but significant differences between men and women and between native-born and foreign-born raise concerns. The percentage of people aged 30-34 with tertiary qualifications in 2018 was 42.7%, above the EU average of 40.7%, but declined significantly from 46.4% in 2017, which might be partially due to the deadline for completion of pre-Bologna studies by 2016. This percentage is much higher for women (56.3%) than for men (31.6%), with the gap being the largest in the EU ( 26 ). This is detrimental to meeting SDG 5. There is also a very large difference between the tertiary attainment of native-born (45.3%) and that of foreign-born (22.1%) (European Commission, 2019 d). Slovenia has developed a graduate tracking mechanism that could help improve the labour market relevance of tertiary education. It should make it possible to monitor the careers of graduates (MIZS, 2019) and provide information on labour market needs for different disciplines to policy makers, universities and students. The discrepancy between the qualifications of the Slovenian labour force and the labour market needs has significantly increased in the last decade. In 2018, almost one in six (15.6%) highly qualified people in Slovenia were employed in occupations that do not require tertiary education (Graph 3.3.2). This share is lower than in the EU. It has, however, more than doubled since 2008 (7.1%), although this may be due to methodological changes in 2011 and 2014. Some skills anticipation activities take place in Slovenia, although there is no comprehensive and coordinated system in place. Although Slovenia ranks close to the EU average regarding digital skills, a major source of concern is the low level of inclusion of digital skills in the curricula of primary and secondary schools (European Commission, 2019 e). Slovenia did not advance in integrating digital skills into the educational curricula, but changes in this area have been announced and progress will be monitored. Development and assessment of digital competences is not yet comprehensively integrated into the curricula. The specific standards of knowledge for these competences, their assessments and the use of information and communication technologies for this purpose are still in the pipeline. Digital skills improve at tertiary level, with a share of graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics close to the EU average. The percentage of female graduates in these subjects is the highest in the EU at 20.5% (European Commission, 2019 e). According to a 2017 business survey of foreign investors in Slovenia, 64% of them encountered difficulties when searching for adequately skilled personnel (SPIRIT, 2017). However, this difficulty may partly be caused by brain drain. Graph 3.3.2:Share of graduate employed in occupations that do not require tertiary education (1) Breaks in the time series in 2011 and 2014 Source: Eurostat Regional differences in education and learning are not very pronounced. Indicators of regional disparities in education are less pronounced than for other indicators, such as GDP per capita or R&D intensity (OECD, 2019 d). However, Western Slovenia fares better than Eastern Slovenia, in particular concerning the share of adults with tertiary education and the participation rate in life-long learning. Disparities of the above-mentioned areas are higher at a more granular geographical level. The participation rate in life-long learning in Osrednjeslovenska is more than 15%, whereas it was less than 5% in Prekmurje (IMAD, 2019 a). Slovenia's 2030 strategy for development sets 2030 targets for sustainable development goals in education. Slovenia wants to significantly improve the participation rate in lifelong learning. From 12% in 2017 it should rise to at least 19%. The share of adults with tertiary education should rise from 32.5% in 2017 to 35% in 2030. This would contribute to SDG 4. 3.3.3.social policy Since the economic recovery, the risk of poverty or social exclusion has been falling, but remains higher in the eastern than in the western region. Two of the areas with the highest share of materially deprived people are in the eastern region. For both areas, the share of materially deprived people was above 19%. In 2017, almost 10% of households in Zasavska were receiving some form of assistance, which is five times more than the share in the regions with the lowest unemployment rates. There is a downward trend in the share of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion, except for the elderly. Compared to the previous year, the at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion rate (AROPE) ( 27 ) decreased by 0.9 pps to 16.2% in 2018, below the EU average of 21.9% (Graph 3.3.4). Slovenia has the lowest child (0-17 years) poverty rate (13.1%) in the EU. However, for people aged over 65, the AROPE rate increased from 18.3% in 2017 to 20.1% in 2018, well above the EU average (18.6%). This rate deteriorated even more evidently for elderly women, increasing to 24.4% in 2018, against an EU average of 20.9%. The drop in the at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion rate is due to the decrease in the severe material deprivation rate (by 0.9pps) and the very low work intensity rate (by 0.8pps). The at-risk-of-poverty rate (AROP) remained the same as in 2018 (13.3%), which is below the EU average (17.1%). Out of about 268,000 people in Slovenia, living below the atriskofpoverty threshold in 2018, 89,000 were retired (18.1% of all retired persons), of which 60,000 were women. (SURS, 2019). Graph 3.3.3:At-risk-of-poverty-or-social exclusion rate in its components Source: Eurostat, European Commission Overall, social benefits in Slovenia reduce both the incidence of poverty and its depth. In 2018, social benefits played a significant role in alleviating poverty by reducing the poverty rate by 43.16% and the depth of poverty rate by 67%. Sickness and disability benefits had the largest effect on both the poverty rate (reducing it by 28%) and its depth (reducing it by 45%). Box 3.3.1: Monitoring performance under the European Pillar of Social Rights The European Pillar of Social Rights is a compass for a renewed process of upward convergence towards better working and living conditions in the European Union. It sets out 20 essential principles and rights in the areas of equal opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; and social protection and inclusion. Slovenia performs relatively well on most indicators of the Social Scoreboard supporting the European Pillar of Social Rights. Strong economic growth contributed to the continued increase in employment and the further decrease in unemployment. The share of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion has further declined, although it remains well above the EU average for elderly people, and especially for elderly women. The income quintile ratio (S80\/S20) is well below the EU average, making Slovenia one of the most equal countries in the EU. The net earnings of a full-time single worker earning the average wage are slowly increasing but should be monitored. Self-reported unmet needs for medical care reached the EU average. The participation of older and low-skilled workers in the labour market remains a challenge. Despite positive trends in recent years, the activity and employment rates of these workers remain well below the EU average. Their participation rate in lifelong learning is also below the EU average. Slovenia developed a number of 'activation' measures to address this issue (see Section 3.3.1.). Slovenia is one of the countries leading the EU in the prevention of early leaving from education and training. With a rate of only 4.2% of early leaving from education and training in 2018, Slovenia continues to be well below the EU average (10.6%) and its Europe 2020 national target of 5%. The country has put in place preventive measures to identify students who are at risk of leaving school early; and to offer professional\/educational assistance and inclusion in the school counselling process. In addition, the ESFfinanced programme Project Learning for Young Adults targets the vulnerable group of young adults who leave school early and are not in employment, education, or training. Project Learning for Young Adults helps them to develop their potentials for successful participation in education; and to build professional identity to facilitate their integration into employment and the wider society. Slovenia also adopted many measures to create a supportive school environment for pupils with migrant backgrounds, a group with a higher rate of early school leaving than their non-migrant peers both in Slovenia and in other EU Member States. 3.4. Competitiveness reforms and investment 3.4.1.productivity enhancing investment Labour productivity growth is resuming after a period of rather limited convergence with euro area levels. Labour productivity grew by 2.3% in 2018, substantially more than the average of the EU and the euro area. This helped Slovenia's ongoing process of convergence towards the average level of productivity in the euro area (see Chart 3.4.1). Labour productivity growth in 2018 was especially concentrated in services, but was weak in manufacturing. Graph 3.4.1:Labour productivity in Slovenia as a ratio of labour productivity in the euro area (1) GDP per hour worked in purchasing power standard. Source: European Commission The recovery of productivity has been driven by efficiency gains, while investment remains low. Since 2012, total factor productivity has grown strongly, indicating that the economy is becoming more efficient. However, investment remains relatively low. In 2018, private investment accounted for only 15.7% of GDP, 2% of GDP pps above the trough of 2015, but still 2.4% of GDP below the euro area average. Investment has been particularly low in areas such as transport infrastructure and housing construction. Certain service sectors are rapidly catching up to the euro area average. Supported by relatively fast growth in foreign demand since the financial crisis, the strongest productivity growth has been recorded in transport and in technologically intensive and export-oriented manufacturing activities. However, productivity growth in manufacturing as a whole has remained broadly in line with the euro area average, leaving the gap almost unchanged. Certain service sectors (e.g. wholesale and retail trade; professional, technical and scientific activities) have seen rapid catching up with the euro area average. This is possibly due to the market-opening measures taken after the crisis (Graph 3.4.2). Significant productivity gains have also been recorded in administrative and support services. This is largely due to the rapid productivity growth in private employment agencies (IMAD, 2019 b). Two sectors have seen their productivity diverging further from the euro area average in recent years. The first of these is information and communication technology services, especially telecommunications. The second is the construction sector, which since 2009 has been faced with lower demand and structural changes. Graph 3.4.2:Productivity gap by sectors, 2009-2018 Source: Eurostat, European Commission The productivity gap between Western and Eastern Slovenia is closing, accompanied by declining employment in the east. Labour productivity in Eastern Slovenia grew by 1.4% annually between 2010 and 2017, considerably more than in the western part (1.0%) and the EU average (0.8%) (Graph 3.4.3). Productivity growth in the eastern region went with employment losses (-0.4% annually in the same period), which points to the restructuring process in the regional economy. On the other hand, the western region experienced growth in both productivity and employment. Eastern Slovenia still shows considerably higher employment concentration in industry (28% of total employment) and agriculture (11% of total employment), both with a lower productivity than the EU average. Productivity in Eastern Slovenia is lower than in Western Slovenia in all sectors except 'financial and other services'. Graph 3.4.3:Productivity growth (1) Unit: Real gross value added (GVA) in thousands EUR (2015 prices) per employed person. Source: Eurostat, European Commission Western Slovenia scores better than the eastern region across a number of economic and social indicators. Western Slovenia scores significantly better than the eastern region in the 2019 regional competitiveness index. The gap is considerable in all the areas that are important for the development of a modern economy. Eastern Slovenia has a lower share of people with tertiary education; a higher share of people with low educational attainment; lower public and private R&D investment; lower employment in high-technology sectors and knowledge-intensive services; and less internet use by individuals. Research and development Slovenian firms actively innovate, although certain indicators of innovation performance showed some decline in 2018. Slovenia has lost some ground on innovation performance: while Slovenia has ranked very high on the European Innovation Scoreboard since 2011, its performance fell in 2018 (European Commission, 2019 f). This fall can be attributed to decreases in specific indicators in areas like investment, human resources, linkages or sales of product innovations. As a result, Slovenia is no longer a 'strong innovator' but only a 'moderate innovator', a one-scale drop in the ranking. There is still a significant difference in innovation performance between the stronger western region and the weaker eastern region. However, there are innovation hubs not only in Ljubljana but also in the eastern cities of Celje and Maribor. Both employment in high-tech ( 28 ) and knowledge-intensive services ( 29 ) sectors are concentrated in the western region (European Commission, 2019 d). Domestic firms, notably SMEs, are on average less innovative than in the past. Half of Slovenian firms developed or introduced new products, processes or services in 2019. This is above the EU average and twice the share recorded in previous years. Furthermore, almost four in ten firms in Slovenia portray themselves as either active innovators or developers, more than the current EU average (28%). However, innovation activity of enterprises has declined across all size classes of company since 2010. In the past 3 years, small enterprises and the manufacturing sector recorded the largest decline (EIB, 2019; IMAD, 2019 a). Foreign-owned firms account for 39% of the country's total business enterprise expenditure on R&D. They perform innovation activities in the medium- and high-tech manufacturing sectors. More than half of the patent applications filed by Slovenian businesses with the European Patent Office in 2010-2018 were filed by large enterprises from these technological fields. Business R&D intensity is relatively high but public R&D expenditure is modest and the 3% R&D intensity target seems out of reach. R&D intensity was 1.95% of GDP in 2018 (EU average: 2.11%), returning to its 2010 level, after peaking at 2.56% in 2013. This has been driven by business R&D expenditure which stood at 1.45% of GDP in 2018 (above the EU average of 1.41%), also returning to its 2010 level, after peaking at 1.96% of GDP in 2013. The peak in 2013 followed the introduction of substantial R&D tax reliefs in 2010 ( 30 ). The subsequent decline can be explained by stricter controls on business R&D reporting and the termination of the financing of R&D in centres for excellence, competence and development, which were co-financed by the EU (IMAD, 2019 a). Business investment in R&D still represents about 75% of total R&D expenditure in the country, around 10 pps more than the average in the EU. Business expenditure on R&D is mainly concentrated in pharmaceuticals, machinery, computer technology and technologies related to electrical energy. Public expenditure on R&D is modest (0.5% of GDP), but in 2018 the government increased it, partly boosted by EU structural funds. In addition, the Slovenian government planned a gradual increase in public R&D investment for the period 2019-2021. However, the 3% of GDP R&D intensity target seems out of reach by 2020. Slovenia ranked average among EU countries in international co-publications in 2018. Investment continues to be unevenly spread between the two regions with the R&D intensity at 2.27% in the western region and 1.4% in the eastern one, resulting also in an unequal share of human resources in science and technology in the active population (51% in Western Slovenia against 40% in Eastern Slovenia in 2018). There is also regional discrepancy in co-publication activity, which is greater in the western region, both at public-private and at international level. There has been an increase in the number of researchers and the share of PhD graduates is very high. Since 2008, the number of researchers employed by businesses ( 31 ) rose considerably. Slovenia still leads the OECD countries in the share of PhD graduates in the population ( 32 ) (OECD, 2019 d). In 2018, there was a net inflow of PhD students into the country. While 104 left Slovenia, 163 moved in. More and better cooperation between science and industry could improve Slovenia's research and innovation capacity. Science-industry cooperation is limited mainly to the medium- and high-tech sectors (e.g. pharmaceuticals, machinery). The effectiveness of knowledge-transfer offices set up by research organisations and higher education institutions varies considerably. Several structural reforms to improve the governance and effectiveness of public R&D investment are still pending. Approximately 87% of the structural funds' support measures are aimed at scientific and technological excellence; research infrastructures; and science-business cooperation. However, an effective governance structure still needs to be fostered for cooperation in research and innovation among different ministries and agencies as well as for closer collaboration between players in research and innovation. The draft R&D law, which lays the foundation for the implementation of the research and innovation strategy 2011-2020, is yet to be adopted by the Parliament. The introduction of institutional-performance-based funding could facilitate their development and growth. Although the government is committed to structural reforms in this area, it has yet to address the recommendations of the European Commission's policy support facility for Slovenia (European Commission, 2018 b) on the internationalisation of the science base and academia-business cooperation. The government also plans for the smart specialisation strategy to become an integral part of the research and innovation strategy and the R&D law. Box 3.4.1: Drivers of Slovenia's research and innovation performance The fourth industrial revolution, i.e. the convergence of digital, biological, and physical technologies, poses a challenge for the Slovenian research community and economic performance in general. The technological disruption brought about by big data, the internet of things, artificial intelligence and robotics will have a significant impact on the Slovenian economy, its productivity and competitiveness as well as on the workforce. According to some estimates, up to 40-70% of jobs could be affected by automation (OECD, 2018). Some jobs might be replaced, the nature of many others might change significantly and new ones might be created. The net effect will also depend on how well Slovenia prepares itself for the industrial transition, including with changes in the science, technology and innovation policy mix (see Section 3.3). The development and implementation of digital technologies and new business models calls for increased research activities, improved engineering, mathematics and digital skills (see Section 3.4.1), for efficient changes in public and private R&D as well as its integration into the economy (see Section 3.4.1). While Slovenia's research and innovation performance remains below the EU average (ranked 'moderate innovator' in the 2019 European Innovation Scoreboard), the country has a competitive advantage in areas such as artificial intelligence and robotics (see Section 3.4.1). Slovenia has also an excellent track record in scientific and technological fields such as physics, materials, biochemistry and more recently in areas tackling climate-related challenges (e.g. development of new generation of batteries and cooling systems). The country has successfully conducted scientific research in artificial intelligence since the early 1970's. The first UNESCO-sponsored international centre for artificial intelligence will open in early 2020. The country is also aiming to develop a national artificial intelligence strategy, covering the entire innovative lifecycle and cross-sectoral up-take. While block-chain technologies are already used in the Slovenian FinTech sector (see Section 3.2), these technologies potentially have a much wider reach for the economy. Slovenia's dynamic start-up ecosystem in information and communication technologies, backed by solid business support services, is an important driver for the country's industrial transition. Academia-business linkages are particularly important for the successful translation of knowledge into innovation in the first place, and in the second place into industry and higher productivity and improved competitiveness performance of Slovenian economy. Several examples of fruitful public-private cooperation can be found within the framework of the Strategic Research and Innovation Partnerships (SRIP). The academia-business partnership led by the public Jozef Stefan R&D Institute brings together key stakeholders involved in developing breakthrough innovations for the factories of the future. A project in the field of control technologies, tooling, robotics, and photonics constitutes another example of successful public-private cooperation, where innovative solutions for production facilities were jointly developed by 13 companies and 6 research organisations (GOSTOP). By building on previous projects, the faculty of mechanical engineering in Ljubljana successfully launched the first \"smart factory demonstrator\" in 2019 supporting the inclusion of innovative 'Industry 4.0' solutions in production processes. Building on the lessons learnt in successful projects as well as ensuring stability and continuation of R&I support will be key for improving the country's research and innovation performance and a key driver of economic growth. To increase economic productivity and improve competitiveness of Slovene economy, the country should aim to approach the EU top performers in research and development. This would require an increase in public and private investments and a build-up of an adequate research infrastructure and research capacity, as well as to ensure that the potential is used to full capacity. In some sectors, this could be achieved relatively quickly as the infrastructure already exists and only needs to be upgraded and its usage optimised. The funding of research and innovation should reward performance, while gaps in the innovation system will have to be addressed. Policy design might give attention to: (i) the strengthening of the capacities of responsible decision-making and executive bodies, (ii) the (re)introduction of schemes for public-private agenda-setting, (iii) the support of clusters, of collaborations between universities, public research institutes and the private sector (for example through doctoral candidates in companies) as well as of start-ups and scale-ups of SMEs. Digitalisation The adoption of digital technologies and business models is generally well advanced, but some sectors are lagging behind. Slovenia ranks 16th among EU Member States in the European Commission digital economy and society index (European Commission, 2019 e). There is a growing awareness of the need to integrate digital technologies into business processes. 75% of Slovenian firms have implemented - either fully or partially - at least one digital technology ( 33 ). This is more than the EU average of 58% (EIB, 2019). However, the degree of integration varies considerably across different sectors of the economy. The digital transformation is strong in the automotive sector, e-commerce, tourism, innovation of composite materials and companies integrated into foreign value chains. Furthermore, Slovenia is strong in some niche areas such as robotics, fin-tech, cyber security and artificial intelligence (see Box 3.4.1). Slovenia is now implementing its national digital strategy ( 34 ) and currently drafting a comprehensive artificial intelligence strategy. Slovenia performs well in the data economy. Slovenian companies rank among the best in the EU in the re-use of public sector data, profiting from the wide scope of large databases that are open to the public. Slovenia is drafting a data strategy and plans an integrated data warehouse to make access to public sector data more user-friendly. Slovenia ranks in the middle of EU countries for digital public services. A wide range of basic online services for businesses is available in Slovenia (80% of such services are online). Citizens and companies have unique identification numbers (personal registration number, company's registration number, tax number, etc.), that are used for identification. However, these are not electronic identification means. At present, most of the e-services rely on qualified digital certificates issued by public or private sector used for authentication and e-signature. A significant reform was implemented in 2019 of sickness certificates, which can now be submitted fully electronically. The reform is expected to reduce administrative burden for businesses by 16 million per year. Fully electronic reporting of work-related accidents and injuries will follow in April 2020. (Ultra) fast and mobile broadband coverage is very high but other areas are lagging behind. Slovenia has improved its broadband connectivity, but it still ranks below the EU average for this measure. Although fixed broadband coverage remained stable with 98% of homes covered (EU average 77%), Slovenia increased its fast broadband (new generation networks that are capable of providing speeds from 30 to 100 Mbps) coverage to 86%, exceeding the EU average. About 80% of households in Slovenia are covered by ultrafast broadband (100 Mbps and above), outperforming the EU average by 20 pps. Slovenia increased its mobile broadband take-up to 74% of people, but remains well below the EU average of 96% (European Commission, 2019 e). Fast networks are comparatively new and take-up of fast internet is still below the EU average. Box 3.4.2: Investment challenges and reforms in Slovenia Section 1. Macroeconomic perspective Following rapid growth in 2017 and 2018, investment slowed down considerably in 2019, particularly for machinery and equipment. Investment in construction remains strong. At 15.7% of GDP in 2018, private investment was still 2.4 pps below the euro area average. Public investment relies significantly on EU funds. Private R&D investment is slightly above the EU average but insufficiently supported by the low levels of public R&D spending. Both private and public investment are influenced by EU funds. Section 2. Assessment of barriers to investment and ongoing reforms Despite some progress in recent years, barriers to investment still exist in many areas. The reduction of red tape remains one of the key challenges to boost investment. Other challenges to overcome include the high perceived level of corruption, in particular in energy, construction and urban planning; and the (perceived) legal uncertainty in public procurement. The significant role of state-owned or state-controlled companies risks distorting competition and resource allocation. Furthermore, poor transport connections between regions reduce productivity, as time is lost in traffic jams and delays in transport are expensive. Box: Investment challenges and reforms in Slovenia Selected barriers to investment and priority actions underway 1. The government of Slovenia makes considerable efforts to improve public procurement (see Section 3.4.3) including through the promotion of e-procurement and SME participation in public procurement. Some measures, like the professionalisation of public buyers, are only gradually being implemented and little progress has been made in public procurement in the healthcare sector (see Section 3.4.3). Overall, competition in public procurement remains very low. 2. Improvements in the transport networks, particularly in remote areas, would help to better integrate these areas into the economy. Economic activity would then be less concentrated in the capital (and a few other economic centres) with all the congestion costs for employees, companies, residents, and the environment\/climate, that come with it. A more effective transport network could therefore help to increase economic growth and reduce discrepancies across regions. Work on the next generation broadband network faces delays. All major operators are investing in very-high-capacity networks and the penetration of fibre-to-the-home technology is rising. The co-financing of investment in broadband infrastructure from EU funds amounts to approximately 35 million, which covers almost the entire costs of the project. Slovenia still lacks a dedicated comprehensive strategy for the management of the radiofrequency spectrum necessary for the timely assignment of the 5G pioneer spectrum bands and 5G deployment. 3.4.2.market functioning and business environment Entrepreneurship and scale-up Slovenia's business demography remains dynamic, masking some structural weaknesses. The number of nascent and new companies has increased over recent years. This positive development largely reflects the continued robustness of Slovenia's economic growth. However, the still relatively high regulatory density and administrative burden continue to hamper business entry and scale-up (IMAD, 2019 a; see below). Small- and medium-sized enterprises constitute a share of the economy in Slovenia that is higher than the EU average in terms of employment (72.0% compared to 66.6%) and valued added (64.5% compared to 56.4%) (European Commission, 2019 g). Smaller firms find it typically more difficult to cope with complex regulation. The proportion of female entrepreneurs remains among the lowest in the EU. Slovenia advanced in the field of women's entrepreneurship with the introduction of training programmes for unemployed women and subsidies for self-employed women. Between 2016 and 2018, the vast majority of participants in the training programmes started their own business. Despite this progress, the proportion of women entrepreneurs still remains among the lowest in the EU (European Commission, 2019 g; GEM, 2019). Regulatory and administrative burden Regulatory burden in Slovenia has been gradually decreasing but remains relatively high in some areas. Between 2010 and 2019, Slovenia's position in the World Bank's ease-of-doing-business index ranking (World Bank, 2019) improved from 53rd to 40th place. In the world competitiveness index of the International Institute for Management Development, Slovenia improved its ranking from the 49th in 2015 to the 37th place in 2019 among the 63 countries covered (IMD, 2019). The time it takes to pay taxes in Slovenia has decreased slightly (from 245 hours in 2018 to 233 hours in 2019), but this remains high in comparison with the EU average (172 hours) (European Commission, 2019 g). Companies still consider frequent unpredictable changes of legislation in Slovenia to be disruptive for the business environment. Moreover, SMEs still perceive administrative burden as significant and say it is being reduced too slowly (European Commission, 2019 g). Slovenia continues its efforts to reduce regulatory restrictiveness and administrative burden. The Single Document, the regulatory impact assessment and the SME test (mandatory since January 2017) are tools to reduce administrative burden and improve regulation. Business portals for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs (e-VEM and EUGO) have also been set up. In 2017, this system was integrated into the newly established national business point (Slovenska poslovna tocka, SPOT) portal. It is now easier to set up a business, and tax regulation for micro companies has been simplified. E-invoicing and a simpler system to pay compulsory duties have also been introduced (see Section 3.4.1). The overall effectiveness of Slovenia's burden reduction efforts suffers from implementation deficits. Most of the measures in the 'Single Document' are deemed to have been fully or at least partially implemented. However, SME representatives continue to complain that many measures are still pending and that the impacts of these measures do not always meet their expectations, even though the measures are reported as implemented. Public participation in devising burden-reduction measures under the Single Document is still rather low. The SME test is being used more frequently. Nevertheless, the SME test and assessments of impacts on business competitiveness are not yet applied to implementing regulations and rules. This may result in unnecessary burdens for SMEs (European Commission, 2019 g). Finally, there is still room for improvement in: (i) the often outdated or incomplete content on official websites; and (ii) the non-availability of fully electronic procedures for many services such as the recognition of professional qualifications. Challenges remain concerning the practical involvement of social partners and other business stakeholders in the drafting of legislative proposals and other reform measures. Slovenia has been consulting social partners (see Section 3.3.1) and outside stakeholders on legislative proposals for some time. These consultations, however, often take place late in the process, when there might be limited flexibility on the side of the administration to substantively change a draft. This contributes to the insufficient impact of their participation noted by businesses (IMAD, 2019 a). In spite of some improvements, key professions remain highly regulated. Slovenia has followed some of the Commission's recommendations from January 2017 (European Commission, 2017 b) and removed certain restrictions on the access to the professions of lawyers and real estate agents. Nevertheless, legal professions (lawyers and notaries) remain highly regulated in Slovenia, which is confirmed by the OECD's Product Market Regulation Indicator for 2018 ( 35 ). Slovenia notified comparatively few technical regulations between 2016 and 2018. Only 32 out of an EU-wide total of 2,196 draft technical regulations notified in the area of the Single Market Transparency Directive (Directive 2015\/1535) came from Slovenia (Technical Regulation Information System database). This low level of notifications may be related to the lack of awareness of the Single Market Transparency Directive and a limited administrative capacity. Barriers to trade affect economic growth and the functioning of the single market as a tool for competitiveness. Slovenia is thus missing an opportunity to further improve its integration in the single market and obtain the related economic benefits. 3.4.3.institutional quality and governance Public procurement Competition in public procurement remains an issue. Slovenia has a comparatively high number of single bids in tenders and a low average number of bids received per tender. Furthermore, the share of negotiated procedures without prior publication recorded in the TED database was high in EU comparison over recent years ( 36 ).Less competition, notably in a small country like Slovenia, typically leads to higher prices, less choice and may also facilitate collusion among bidders. Slovenian authorities are aware of these risks and are working with the European Commission and the OECD on a systematic review of the country's procurement approach. The proportion of procedures awarded only on the basis of the lowest price, although decreasing, remains higher than the EU average. Giving environmental criteria a higher importance in award decisions would help Slovenia in the transition towards a more sustainable economy (see Section 3.5). Slovenia has adopted reforms to improve the effectiveness of the remedy system. Slovenia introduced the possibility of challenging decisions of the National Review Commission before the Administrative Court. The National Review Commission's independence will be strengthened by the introduction of a consultative panel, with members of the Judicial Council. However, as part of the reforms, the non-appointment of a candidate member will in the future not be subject to judicial review, and the Parliament itself will have the power to appoint the consultative panel and decide on the dismissal of National Review Commission's members. Slovenia promotes SME participation in tenders, which also helps to increase competition. SMEs are awarded a significant share of public contracts: in 2018, 78% of contractors were SMEs. This can be taken as an indication that barriers preventing SMEs from participating in public tenders are comparatively low. Slovenia frequently divides contracts into lots, which makes bidding easier for SMEs. Many global firms have little or no presence in Slovenia, leaving more room for Slovenian firms. E-procurement software tools have increased transparency. An e-submission functionality for tenders has been widely used. The e-procurement system relies on structured data that is shared between different databases. Slovenia is currently preparing a data-warehouse of procurement data feeding into a new business analytics tool. This will make it possible for tendering authorities to get better information on price levels and bidders. Slovenia is professionalising its public buyers. In May 2018, Slovenia adopted an action plan on the professionalisation of its public buyers with 27 different measures that are now being implemented. Slovenia also plans to implement the European competency framework for contracting authorities. The framework identifies a set of skills required of contracting authority employees. Public procurement aggregation in Slovenia's health sector remains below its potential. Apart from the extension of a database on prices, not much headway was made in 2019 to improve procurement aggregation. An earlier plan to set up a specific central purchase body for the health sector has been abandoned. Slovenia instead opted for a looser structure of joint public procurement between different public hospitals with the support of the Ministry of Health. This set-up suffers from a lack of coordination between the different public hospitals over what supplies and services to procure jointly. So far, only the two largest hospitals, covering 60% of the market, agreed to publish joint tenders. Slovenia also lacks any strategy for procurement in the healthcare system. This limits its ability to harmonise tenders, share expertise and effectively mitigate the risk of bid-rigging (see Section 3.1.4). Corruption in public procurement remains a concern for Slovenia's businesses. In Slovenia, 78% of businesses consider corruption in public procurement managed by national authorities to be widespread, the highest increase amongst EU Member States since 2017 (+29 pps). Similarly, 72% of businesses consider it widespread in public procurement managed by local and regional authorities, a 12point increase on 2017. Although the share of businesses reporting they had experienced corruption in practice is quite low, 50% think that corruption has prevented their company from winning a public tender or a public procurement contract in the last 3 years (European Commission, 2019 h). Regulatory oversight The national competition agency still shows some operational weaknesses. The independence of the competition protection agency requires continued safeguarding when Slovenia transposes the European Competition Network+ Directive ( 37 ) into national law. While not underfunded as such, the agency lacks the means to procure the services of experts that can temporarily assist staff in complex investigations. This situation could severely limit the agency's capacity to investigate and prosecute competition cases efficiently. The Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (CPC) operates within a good legal framework but with limited resources. Although the legal framework safeguarding the independence of the CPC and the material conditions for its work are generally satisfactory, the CPC remains understaffed relative to its mandate. For asset verification, the CPC currently has two full time staff. This and other insufficiencies have been pointed out in evaluations by the Council of Europe. These resource limitations affect activity and output, with the number of CPC reports at its lowest since 2007. The CPC also suffers from a low level of trust, with 76% of Slovenian businesses of the view that measures against corruption are not applied impartially and without ulterior motives. Justice system and fight against corruption The justice system has continued to reduce backlogs, and new measures increasing its quality have been introduced, which contributes to the overall improved business environment. The 2020 EU Justice Scoreboard (European Commission, forthcoming a) shows continued efficiency improvements in nearly all categories of cases. In 2019, the total backlog of cases decreased by more than 7%, compared to 2018 (Supreme Court data). The courts again resolved more cases than they received (total clearance rate of 101%), despite resolving fewer cases than in the past. The average length of proceedings rose to around 13 months in litigious civil cases and stagnated at 11 months in litigious commercial cases, as older cases were prioritised. It still takes more than 12 months until the first hearing in a commercial case trial. On appeal, these cases are resolved quickly, usually in around 3 months. Nearly one quarter of litigious civil and commercial cases are resolved through a court settlement. However, it still takes between 14 and 17 months until a written judgment is delivered in those types of cases. The Judicial Council is also becoming more active in its efforts to improve the quality of justice (e.g. through evaluations, disciplinary proceedings, and improving remuneration and careers of judges). However, this work requires additional resources to increase the Judicial Council's administrative capacity, including resources to improve the reasoning in its decisions and opinions, and particularly in selecting national and international judges. Results of the internationally awarded Supreme Court's survey of court users are being used to further improve the quality of justice. The Supreme Court published brochures on proceedings before courts and manuals for new judges, and it offered focused training for court staff. The judicial map reform remains pending. Despite increased efficiency in resolving criminal notifications, challenges remain in prosecuting economic and financial crime, and court proceedings are lengthy. Despite some improvements, investigations by the police and the prosecution service into financial and economic crime can sometimes take several years, partly due to a lack of resources. These efficiency and quality challenges are being addressed through focused training (including on anti-money laundering); exchange of good practices; and analyses of prosecutors' efficiency. The State Prosecutorial Council still lacks staff, which means that it is unable to work on improving the general quality of the Prosecution Service. Criminal courts continued to resolve more cases than they received (clearance rate of 102%). However, the length of criminal cases decreased in local courts to about 9.5 months and increased in district courts (to more than 14 months). Although Slovenia's index scores have improved, corruption perception trends indicate diminished trust. The 2017-2019 government anticorruption plan focused on raising awareness amongst public officials, strengthening efficiency in the use of public funds and increasing transparency in regulations and procedures. Although Slovenia's score in the World Bank's control of corruption indicator has continued to improve since 2015, its corruption perception index score and rank fell in 2018. One issue of concern is that 90% of businesses consider that corruption is widespread, a 16-point increase on 2017. Moreover, only 10% of businesses feel that people and businesses caught for bribing a senior official are appropriately punished, the lowest percentage among EU Member States. Some anti-corruption reforms are still pending. No major developments have occurred in the legislation on conflicts of interest; whistleblowing; revolving doors between government and business; or a code of ethics for members of Parliament. The National Assembly has delayed the adoption of the amended Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act. Although the expected amendments will broaden the regulation of lobbying, shadow lobbying is still perceived as a major issue, because it does not cover third parties seeking to influence government decision making. Slovenia has also not implemented rules on contacts with lobbyists by members of the National Assembly and the National Council. This is all the more striking given that 76% of businesses in Slovenia consider that the only way to succeed in business is to have political connections. 3.4.4.energy and infrastructure The lack of a clear and predictable framework for investment in the decarbonisation of the energy sector increases the risk of stranded assets. Significant investments have been made in a new power unit using coal for electricity and heat production over the past years. The rapidly falling costs of generating electricity from renewable resources and the need for an ambitious decarbonisation of the energy sector are bound to affect the viability of such recent investments. About 30% of Slovenia's electricity is produced by coal plants, and 25% of the total electricity generation capacity of these coal plants is less than 5 years old (electricity production in Sostanj Unit 6 started in 2016). The gas and electricity infrastructure is well developed, but problems remain with storage and operational issues on the interconnections. Electricity interconnection in Slovenia is already above the minimum of 10% expected for 2020 as well as above the minimum target of 15% for 2030. Strengthening power interconnections with Croatia and Hungary could make it possible to solve existing operational issues. Moreover, Slovenia's existing energy storage is underdeveloped and thus fails to address the needs of the non-integrated local production of renewable energy sources. The draft energy concept of Slovenia has identified energy storage as one of the priorities for the country. Slovenia is increasing its efforts for a transition towards a circular economy. The government has drawn up a circular-economy policy framework. Slovenia also has a sound waste management system overall, with advanced rates of separate collection and a high recycling rate of 58.9% (EU average of 47 %) in 2018. In addition, Slovenia's overall eco-innovation index was 107 in 2018, placing it 10th in the EU (an improvement since 2015) and above the EU average of 100 (European Commission, 2018 c). At the same time, Slovenia's low material productivity and high-energy intensity are cause for concern. Some recycled materials cannot compete against cheaper primary resources. This is reflected in the circular (secondary) use of materials in Slovenia, which was only 8.5% in 2016, below the EU average of 11.7% (European Commission, 2019 i). Although the quality of water has improved, Slovenia faces difficulties with urban wastewater and water loss. Supported by EU funds, Slovenia has invested significantly in wastewater treatment. Water losses remain high: in 2018, 29% of water resources were lost in the distribution network (SURS, 2019), which is above the EU average of 23% and considerably higher than the best performers, which have leakage rates below 10%. Such leakages are a waste of surface and ground water, and they result in higher energy use for water treatment and distribution purposes. They also bring increased risks of water contamination. To tackle the challenges in the water sector, in particular the challenge of financing the municipal water infrastructure, the government proposed an amendment of the national water legislation in December 2019. Similar to other EU countries, the total external costs of road transport in Slovenia significantly exceed those of rail transport. A recent study published by the European Commission (CE Delft, 2019) estimates the total external costs of road and rail transport in Slovenia at 2.7 billion annually. This corresponds to 5.5% of Slovenia's GDP and is slightly below the EU average of 5.7% of GDP. In addition, the total infrastructure costs for land modes amounted to around 1.4 billion for 2016, of which around 1 billion for road and 400 million for rail. Road users pay a considerably higher share of their external and infrastructure costs in the form of taxes and charges than rail users (88% for passenger transport and 72% for freight, compared to 20% and 16%, respectively) (CE Delft, 2019). Slovenia is faced with challenges to promote sustainable mobility. Slovenia still has a high use of passenger cars. In 2017, car trips represented 86.5% of all passenger-kilometres travelled (5 pps above the EU average), with buses and coaches accounting for around 11.7% and trains for only 1.8% (European Commission, 2019 j). Use of public transport is very low by international standards, and is partially due to a lower rate of urbanisation; higher dispersion of settlements; and the outdated\/limited public transport options (IMAD, 2019 a). The modernisation and upgrading of the Slovenian rail network is progressing very slowly. Even though investment in rail infrastructure has been increasing in recent years, there is still an investment backlog, which contributes to the slow modal shift. Perceptions of the railway infrastructure are better than for roads. However, according to the 2019 World Economic Forum ranking, the efficiency of train services has further declined and is below the EU average. This is reflected in the low use of rail passenger transport services in Slovenia, which remains well below the EU average. The share of rail freight transport, however, is still significantly above the EU average (European Commission, 2019 k). At the same time, the perception of the quality of roads, which is below the EU average, improved between 2017 and 2018 (WEF, 2019). 3.5. Environmental Sustainability Main sustainability challenges Production and consumption patterns are putting pressure on the environment. The ecological footprint ( 38 ) of Slovenia has been increasing since the financial crisis and has reached 5.13 global hectare\/person in 2016, which is close to the EU average. Slovenia's target is to reduce it to 3.8 global hectare\/person by 2030 (IMAD, 2019 a). The conservation status of national habitats has deteriorated in recent years (EEA, 2019 a). However, the ecological deficit is above the EU average and amounts to twice the bio-capacity of Slovenian nature (Global Footprint Network, 2017; IMAD, 2019 a). Air pollution continues to raise concerns. The main contributing factors to air pollution are: (i) increasing road transport; and (ii) energy production as well as heat generation from solid fuels (European Commission, 2019 l). The exposure of the urban population to air pollution by particulate matter is above the EU average (Eurostat, 2017 a). The total (health and non-health related) costs of air pollution by road traffic in Slovenia in 2016, were estimated at 354 million (CE Delft, 2018). In addition, it is estimated that around 916 years of life lost per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016 were due to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is above the EU average of 800 years lost (EEA, 2019 b). Slovenia's economy is more carbon intensive than the EU average. Carbon intensity remains above the EU average and the rate of reduction in carbon intensity since 1990 is below the EU average (EEA (2019 c) (Graph 3.5.1). Regarding emission productivity ( 39 ), Slovenia belongs to the bottom quarter of EU countries. This raises climate concerns and means that the country might fall behind both the EU's decarbonisation targets beyond 2020 and its own 2030 development strategy goals. Public awareness of the climate challenges is high but policy plans to ensure a just transition are still to be developed. A broad societal consensus on climate change exists. According to a 2019 Eurobarometer, 76% of the respondents consider climate change a very serious problem (European Commission, 2019 m). Although the government is committed to a just transition to a low-carbon economy, the existing policy documents fail to explain how to achieve a high quality of life for all, including good employment and educational opportunities. While the overall level of environmental taxation is above the EU average, there may also be scope to improve its use to better support the policy objectives and to ensure a just transition. Graph 3.5.1:Greenhouse gas intensity of the economy, Slovenia and the EU Source: Eurostat Targets for 2020 and 2030 Slovenia will reach the 2020 greenhouse gas emission target but the achievement of the energyefficiency target is still uncertain. Slovenia has already achieved its Europe 2020 targets for energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission. However, energy consumption is above the EU average and increasing, putting the achievement of the EU 2020 energy efficiency target at the deadline under pressure. According to 2017 data, Slovenia's final energy consumption has been almost unchanged since 2011. This is mainly due to road transport (which includes transit transport), followed by industry, services and the residential sector all with energy consumption above the EU average. Further energy savings in the residential sector will be difficult, as energy poverty is quite widespread. Approximately 40% of the population spends more than 10% of their income on energy. This limits their scope to switch to equipment that is more energy efficient. This also impedes the achievement of SDG 7. Reaching the Europe 2020 target for renewable energy presents a significant challenge. The share of renewable energy sources in gross final energy consumption declined from 22.4% in 2013 to around 21.1% in 2018, against the target of 25%. The latest assessment of progress towards the 2020 renewable targets showed that Slovenia is falling behind the planned progress for 2017-2018 ( 40 ). The interruption of support to the use of renewables between 2014 and 2016 has slowed down their deployment. Traditional renewable energy sources such as wood and hydropower account for most of the renewable energy supply. Slovenia ranks towards the bottom of the EU for the use of sources like wind, solar and geothermal energy (IMAD, 2019 a). The renewable energy policies currently being implemented, and new initiatives appear insufficient to trigger the required volumes by 2020 from purely domestic sources. Slovenia's planned effort to increase the share of renewables energy by 2030 is limited. Both the Slovenian development strategy for 2030 and the draft national energy and climate plan 41 target an increase in the share of renewable energy by 2030 that is only by 2 pps above the 2020 target. This is 10 pps lower than the share of 37% resulting from the application of the formula presented in the Governance Regulation (Graph 3.5.2) ( 42 ). In 2020, the Commission will assess, the final national energy and climate plans submitted by the Member States. The European Commission assessment of the draft national energy and climate plan urges Slovenia to introduce specific measures to achieve the mandated share of renewables across all the different sectors indicated in the recast of the Renewable Energy Directive ( 43 ), especially transport, and heating and cooling. Almost 300 million of EU funds have been allocated to specific projects to ensure affordable and clean energy for all. Graph 3.5.2:Renewable energy: share in gross final energy consumption Source: European Commission Transport The transport sector is a large contributor of carbon emissions and air pollutants. In 2017, transport emissions were responsible for 38% of Slovenia's total CO2 emissions. This is well above the EU average of 26.5% and these emissions continue to rise. The share of road transport CO2 emissions in total transport emissions also remains high (98% in 2017) compared to the EU average (81% in 2017) (EEA, 2019 d). Road transport is also a large emitter of particulate matter (PM10), contributing to exceedances of EU limit values. Slovenia has made a commitment to solve this issue. There is also a high dependency on cars in Slovenia (see Section 3.4.4). Slovenia is gradually developing measures to reduce the energy and carbon intensity of transport. With 2.74% in 2017, the share of renewables in transport was lagging behind the 2020 target of 10% and was falling behind the EU average of 7.39% (Eurostat, 2017 b). The situation is expected to improve considerably due to the measures adopted in June 2019 (amendment to the Energy Law). Slovenia largely depends on imports of biofuels. Public fuelling points for the supply of biofuels are lacking, and there are no measures in place to address the issue. The share of cars using alternative fuels is still very low. However, several measures (including tax exemptions\/benefits, incentives and loans for alternative fuels vehicles) are in place or planned to help the country reach its targets for 2030 (Government of Slovenia, 2018 a). Furthermore, there are plans to set up hydrogen-charging points and publicly accessible compressed natural gas refuelling points (Government of Slovenia, 2018 a). Different measures for air quality improvement are being introduced. Public transport will be improved and outdated, small combustion plants that use wood for heating will be replaced. The government also adopted seven regulations to implement measures from the air quality plan and detailed programmes to reduce the emission of substances into the atmosphere from small and medium-sized combustion plants. Slovenia is nevertheless lagging behind in the transition to a zero-emission transport sector by 2050. The share of transport emissions in overall emissions from energy consumption continues to rise, and the share of road transport emissions remains high. For these reasons, the internalisation of external costs (see Section 3.4.4) will be important for the decarbonisation of transport. To ensure a comprehensive approach on sustainable mobility, including the improvement of energy efficiency and the reduction of emissions, Slovenia has started to implement a broad range of support measures. These measures, proposed in the draft national energy and climate plan for Slovenia (Government of Slovenia, 2018 a), include (i) a more efficient organisation of the mobility system; (ii) the promotion of public passenger transport and sustainable freight transport, and (iii) grants for sustainable mobility and rail transport infrastructure. Further efforts are needed to promote the coordination of measures targeted at inter-city and urban public transport. Energy Slovenia's current energy mix represents a challenge in the process towards decarbonisation. Out of gross inland energy consumption, 34% was accounted for by oil and petroleum products, 22% by nuclear energy, followed by solid fuels and renewables (14%) and natural gas (10%). Domestic sources covered half of Slovene energy needs in 2017. For the other half, Slovenia depended on imports of petroleum products, natural gas and coal of high calorific values. In 2017, nuclear energy was the primary source of electricity generation (accounting for 39%), followed by coal and renewable sources, mainly hydropower (29%). (European Commission, 2019 n). To achieve the EU's decarbonisation goals, increasing the use of national renewable energy sources, especially wind is key. Research shows that there is enough wind in the country to capitalise on wind energy investments and effectively implement wind power technology (GIZ Vetrne Energije, 2019). Currently, eight national spatial plans are under preparation. Renewable energy resource projects are also supported by the Slovenian Energy Agency's existing feed-in tariff scheme. Backing such initiatives in the national energy and climate plan could improve the feasibility of the projects and could incentivise further investments. Transition in the coal industry Coal plays a decisive role in the economy of one region of Slovenia. The Sostanj coal power plant produces 35% of national electricity production. The Savinjska NUTS3 region, more specifically its sub-region of Savinjsko-saleska, where the plant is located, heavily relies on coal as the main driver of its economy (see Annex D). Current plans by the Slovenian authorities assume a continuation of the coal-related activities until the late 2030s. The plant and coalmine employ directly around 1,600 workers. The closure of plant and mine could cause up to 29,000 job losses in Slovenia. The region's unemployment rate is already one of the highest in Slovenia. The unfinished transition of a coalmine in Zasavje has severe socioeconomic and environmental impacts on the region. After the shutdown of the coalmine in the Zasavje region, a coal power plant and a machine factory in the region were also closed. In 2000, when the act on the gradual closure was adopted, the GDP per capita of the region was 73.6% of the Slovenian average. Now, it amounts only to 53% of the average, making it one of the poorest regions of Slovenia (see Annex D). It is estimated that almost a third of the urban area in Zasavje is degraded and, thus, in need of environmental rehabilitation. The coal regions are characterised by several factors unfavourable for economic transition. High unemployment in coal regions is often accompanied by little economic diversification, lower productivity, and ageing populations. Educational attainment levels and adult participation in training in the affected regions is far below the EU average. Partially because of the coal industry, the regions are not attractive locations for direct investments and new companies. Therefore, the coal workers are less likely to find another job in their home regions than most other European workers in their home regions (Institute Jacques Delors, 2019). The economic transition of these regions requires a comprehensive set of measures. An assessment of future needs on the ground can be helped by a rethinking of social assistance, training, labour market policies and social policies (see Section 3.3), involving social partners and other relevant stakeholders. Applying the relevant smart specialisation strategy could also help. The reskilling of coal workers can take place in re-education activities of differing intensity. The wind and solar photovoltaic industries have been identified as particularly suitable for reemploying coal workers that have retrained but they require on average higher qualified employees than the coal industry (European Commission, 2018 d). The transition requires significant financial efforts in the area, which could be supported by EU funds. The European Commission has proposed a Just Transition Fund to support the people and the regions most affected by the transition away from the coal economy. Dedicated investment guidance for the Fund is provided in Annex D. The Slovenian authorities intend to have a national transition strategy adopted by the end of 2020. The strategy is intended to include anticipatory and mitigating measures for the regions where coal-powered energy production is to be phased out as well as mitigating measures for the regions where the transition is ongoing. The strategy will also lay out measures for the decarbonisation and diversification of the economy. Trade-offs Balancing trade-offs between the clean energy transition and nature conservation in Slovenia is demanding. Slovenia has a lot of potential to make a success of the clean energy transition. However, it is also faced with environmental constraints. Slovenia has an extraordinarily rich natural heritage, with more than 38% of its territory protected (e.g. by Natura 2000), an important element of SDG 15. Particular efforts will be needed to safeguard the rare and endangered species and habitat types in these areas as part of the transition to clean energy. Projects and plans must be assessed on a case-by-case basis to ensure that they do not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned. Sound planning and environmental assessments are particularly important given that the share of habitats and species with unfavourable conservation status has been increasing at the expense of habitats and species in a favourable conservation status (EEA, 2019 a). A comprehensive and consistent multi-sector strategic framework for sustainable development is lacking. While some relevant strategies already exist, like the Slovenian development strategy 2030 or the sustainable urban strategy, there is currently no medium- or long-term strategy for climate adaptation, the green energy transition or the coal phase-out. Early work is under way to begin drafting such strategies. These strategies would also be relevant to achieve SDG 13 and for the inhabitants, as significant share of the population lives in areas exposed to climate-change-induced floods ( 44 ), which have affected and caused economic damage in all regions since 2007 (Government of Slovenia, 2018 b). Annex A: Overview table Commitments Summary assessment ( 45 ) 2019 country-specific recommendations (CSRs) CSR 1: Achieve the medium-term budgetary objective in 2020. Adopt and implement reforms in healthcare and long-term care that ensure quality, accessibility and long-term fiscal sustainability. Ensure the long-term sustainability and adequacy of the pension system, including by adjusting the statutory retirement age restricting early retirement and other forms of early exit from the labour market. Increase the employability of low-skilled and older workers by improving labour market relevance of education and training, lifelong learning and activation measures, including through better digital literacy. Slovenia has made limited progress in addressing CSR 1 Achieve the medium-term budgetary objective in 2020. The compliance assessment with the Stability and Growth Pact will be included in Spring when final data for 2019 will be available. Adopt and implement reforms in healthcare Limited Progress The Member State has not yet presented the legislative act (Health Care and Health Insurance Act) in the governing or legislator body. The proposal is not been included in the 2019-2020 National Reform Programme. A new Health Care and Health Insurance Act is in the Work Programme of the Ministry of Health and is currently being worked on by the services. It is expected to be discussed by the Government of the Republic of Slovenia in mid-2020 (its adoption by the National Assembly is expected in the autumn of 2020). Other measures have been announced but these only address the CSR to a limited extent. The European Commission under the Structural Reform Support Programme helps Slovenia to implement key health sector reforms in the areas of health system governance, hospital financing, quality of care, and long-term care. and long-term care that ensure quality, accessibility and long-term fiscal sustainability. No Progress The reform is not included in the 2019-2020 National Reform Programme. The work programme of the Ministry of Health envisages the proposal of the act of long-term care to be submitted for public discussion in January 2020 and adoption potentially still in 2020. Ensure the long-term sustainability and adequacy of the pension system, including by adjusting the statutory retirement age restricting early retirement and other forms of early exit from the labour market. Limited Progress The pension reform adopted in November 2019 improves the adequacy of pensions but puts a strain on the sustainability of the pension system in the long term. At the same time, measures taken in 2012 to limit early retirement seem to be having some effect, but the early exit from the labour market remains a challenge. Increase the employability of low-skilled and older workers by improving labour market relevance of education and training, lifelong learning and activation measures, including through better digital literacy. Some Progress In 2019, Slovenia adopted amendments to labour market regulation act aimed at faster activation and higher social security of unemployed people. Changes in unemployment benefits will also likely influence unemployment levels of older people (prior to retirement). The authorities also implemented additional labour market measures that provide life-long learning and training measures relevant for labour market needs. There are also soft measures (through competence centres for human resources development; Support to Enterprises for active ageing of Labour Force) to improve employment of older people and long-term unemployed. Finally, ALMPs also appear to better target older people (31% until August 2019) and long-term unemployed (28%), though this still leaves room for improvement. Concerning the aspect of \"better digital literacy\", Slovenia has made only limited progress: Some projects for digital transformation of economy have been put in place and are at cruising speed through the Strategic Research and Innovation Partnerships. Further, there are several pilot actions in schools for improving digital literacy. However, no changes have been made into school curricula to enhance the teaching of digital skills in schools. Finally, no review or up-date of digital programme in existing curricula has taken place. CSR 2: Support the development of equity markets. Improve the business environment by reducing regulatory restrictions and administrative burden. Improve competition, professionalisation and independent oversight in public procurement. Carry out privatisations in line with the existing plans. Slovenia has made some progress in addressing CSR 2. Support the development of equity markets. Limited Progress Slovenia continued implementing support measures launched earlier on in order to strengthen its equity markets. Major new initiatives were not launched in 2019. Improve the business environment by reducing regulatory restrictions and administrative burden. Some Progress Slovenia continued to implement its burden reduction efforts, such as under the Single Document, the SME test and e-government. Slovenia has removed certain restrictions in the access to the professions of lawyer and real estate agent. Nevertheless, the legal professions (lawyers and notaries) remain highly regulated. Improve competition, professionalisation and independent oversight in public procurement. Some Progress Slovenia adopted an important reform of the National Reform Commission, thereby strengthening independent oversight in public procurement. Setting up the newly foreseen structures is still to be done. Slovenia also continued implementing its Action Plan to increase professionalisation. Competition benefits from e-procurement as well as from good efforts to facilitate SME participation in tenders, but remains a problem. Carry out privatisations in line with the existing plans. Some Progress Another 10% of the shares of NLB, have been sold, and the sale of Abanka has been finalised in 2019, in line with obligations under State aid rules; however, other privatisations have come to a halt. CSR 3: Focus investment-related economic policy on research and innovation, low carbon and energy transition, sustainable transport, in particular rail, and environmental infrastructure, taking into account regional disparities. Slovenia has made limited progress in addressing CSR 3. Focus investment-related economic policy on research and innovation, Some Progress Slovenia has not fully implemented its research and innovation strategy, and there is little harmonisation among different policies and strategies. low carbon and energy transition, Limited Progress Climate change adaptation received about 90 million for climate change adaptation from the cohesion policy for 2014-2020. The selection and implementation of projects has improved. However, a comprehensive climate change strategy covering all sectors has not been prepared yet. A more specific regulatory framework for the adaptation to climate change is planned to be provided in the Environmental Protection Law, which is currently being adopted. The use of low carbon energy remains limited and there are lags in the implementation of the programme the fields of transport and power generation. sustainable transport, in particular rail, and Some Progress Slovenia published an investment plan for transport to increase the funding of railways and sustainable mobility in the period 2020-2025. It also adopted an 'Action plan for alternative fuels in transport' setting specific objectives and measures for uptake of alternative fuels in transport. environmental infrastructure, taking into account regional disparities. Limited Progress Slovenia accelerated the implementation of the EU co-financed wastewater projects but investment gap still prevail in this sector. In addition, the integration of environmental aspects, particularly, nature considerations, into planning and implementing infrastructure projects, is challenging. To tackle the challenges in the water sector, the Government proposed an amendment of the national water legislation in December 2019. Europe 2020 (national targets and progress) Employment rate target: 75 %. Target achieved. Employment rate stood in 2018 at 75.4%, above the Europe 2020 target and the EU average (73.2%). R&D target set in the NRP: 3% of GDP In 2018, R&D spending was 1.95% of GDP, slightly below the EU average of 2.11%. Business R&D spending was 1.45% of GDP (EU average 1.41%) and public R&D spending was 0.5% of GDP. National greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target: max. 4% in 2020 compared with 2005 (in sectors not included in the EU emissions trading scheme) GHG emissions in 2016 were lower than the annual target by 9%. Projections indicate that the Republic of Slovenia will achieve its 2020 targets of a maximum 4% increase in GHG emissions compared to 2005. 2020 renewable energy target: 25% The target to achieve a 25% share of renewable energy resources (RES) in the final total energy consumption by 2020 is slowly drifting away In 2018, the share of renewable energy in final total energy consumption was 21.1%, significantly below the 22.4% of 2013. Energy efficiency, 2020 energy consumption targets: Slovenia's 2020 energy efficiency target is 7.1 Mtoe expressed in primary energy consumption (5.1 Mtoe expressed in final energy consumption) For 2018, Slovenia remains within the indicative target for 2020 for primary energy consumption. In 2018, primary energy consumption amounted to 6.7 Mtoe and decreased by 0.8% compared to the previous year. However, compared to the previous year the final energy consumption rose by 0.6% to 5 Mtoe, getting close to the level of 5.1 Mtoe corresponding to the 2020 energy efficiency target. Early school\/training leaving target: 5%. Target achieved. In 2018, the earlyschoolleaving rate in Slovenia was 4.2%, 0.8 pps under the national target and 0.1 pps better than in 2017. Earlyschoolleaving in Slovenia is among the lowest in the EU. Tertiary education target: 40% of population aged 30-34. Target achieved. Tertiary attainment was 42.7% in 2018, above the Europe 2020 target and the EU average, though it has decreased by 3.7 pps in relation to 2017. Target for reducing the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion, expressed as an absolute number of people: 40,000 (base year 2010: 360,000). In 2018, the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion fell for the fourth consecutive year. However, 326,000 people were still at risk of poverty or social exclusion (minus 34,000 compared to base year).

Annex D: Investment guidance on Just Transition Fund 2021-2027 for Slovenia Building on the Commission proposal, this Annex ( 46 ) presents the preliminary Commission services' views on priority investment areas and framework conditions for effective delivery for the 2021-2027 Just Transition Fund investments in Slovenia. These priority investment areas are derived from the broader analysis of territories facing serious socio-economic challenges deriving from the transition process towards a climate-neutral economy of the Union by 2050 in Slovenia, assessed in the report. This Annex provides the basis for a dialogue between Slovenia and the Commission services as well as the relevant guidance for the Member States in preparing their territorial just transition plans, which will form the basis for programming the Just Transition Fund. The Just Transition Fund investments complement those under Cohesion Policy funding for which guidance in the form of Annex D was given in the 2019 Country Report for Slovenia ( 47 ). In Slovenia, the Zasavska region is enduring a transition away from coal-related activities while the Savinjska region, in particular Savinjsko-Saleska, continues to suffer from significant challenges linked to the on-going extraction and processing of fossil fuels, mostly coal. Zasavska faces a significant challenge of unfinished transition. As a consequence of the almost finalised closure of the Zasavje coal mine and the closure of the region's coal-fuelled power plant, Zasavska has been facing social hardship (8.3% unemployment vs 7.4% nationally). Since 2013 approximately 5,000 jobs have been lost and GDP has been falling (53% of the Slovene average). Based on this preliminary assessment, it appears warranted that the Just Transition Fund concentrates its intervention on that region. The smart specialisation strategy ( 48 ) provides an important framework to set priorities for innovation in support of economic transformation. In order to tackle these transition challenges, priority investment needs have been identified for diversifying and making the regional economy more modern and competitive, as well as alleviating the socio-economic costs of transition. Key actions of the Just Transition Fund could target in particular: productive investments in SMEs, including start-ups, leading to economic diversification and reconversion; investments in research and innovation activities and fostering the transfer of advanced technologies in line with the Slovenian smart specialisation strategy; investments in the deployment of technology and infrastructures for affordable clean energy; investments in digitalisation; upskilling and reskilling of workers. Environmental pollution and degradation as a direct result of mining activities are visible in the area. Almost a third of the urban area of Zasavje is degraded and thus in need of environmental rehabilitation. In order to tackle these transition challenges, investment needs have been identified for achieving environmental sustainability and resource efficiency. Key actions of the Just Transition Fund could target in particular: investments in regeneration and decontamination of sites, land restoration and repurposing projects; investments in enhancing the circular economy. The Savinjska region has an operational coal mine and a coal power plant (Sostanj) generating 35% of national electricity production. Environmental pollution and degradation as a direct result of mining activities are visible in the area. Due to the caving-in of the ground in Savinjsko-Saleska, three lakes already formed on the territory of a few former settlements. The ground is still sinking, which puts additional settlements at risk. Based on this preliminary assessment, it appears warranted that the Just Transition Fund also intervenes in this region. In order to tackle these transition challenges, priority investment needs have been identified for achieving a low carbon transition, environmental sustainability and resource efficiency. Key actions of the Just Transition Fund could target in particular: investments in the deployment of technology and infrastructures for affordable clean energy; investments in regeneration and decontamination of sites, land restoration and repurposing projects; investments in enhancing the circular economy; upskilling and reskilling of workers. Coal-related activities in the Savinjska region (the mine, the plant and the related companies, subsidiaries and services) provide direct employment for around 2,200 people. Learning from the experience of the Zasavje region, such closures could have significant negative effects on the entire economy of the region. In order to tackle these transition challenges, investment needs have been identified for diversifying and making the regional economy more modern and competitive, as well as alleviating the socio-economic costs of transition. Key actions of the Just Transition Fund could target in particular: productive investments in SMEs, including start-ups, leading to economic diversification and reconversion; investments in research and innovation activities and fostering the transfer of advanced technologies, in line with the Slovenian smart specialisation strategy; investments in digitalisation; upskilling and reskilling of workers; active inclusion of jobseekers.

(1) () This report assesses Slovenia's economy in light of the European Commission's Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy, published on 17 December 2019. In this document, the Commission sets out a new strategy on how to address not only the short-term economic challenges but also the economy's longer-term challenges. This new economic agenda of competitive sustainability rests on four dimensions: environmental sustainability, productivity gains, fairness and macroeconomic stability. (2) () Information on the level of progress and actions taken to address the policy advice in each respective subpart of a country-specific recommendation is presented in the overview table in Annex A. (3) () Within the scope of its legal basis, the European Semester can help drive national economic and employment policies towards the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by monitoring progress and ensuring closer coordination of national efforts. The present report contains reinforced analysis and monitoring on the SDGs. A new annex (Annex E) presents a statistical assessment of trends in relation to SDGs in Slovenia during the past five years, based on Eurostat's EU SDG indicator set.

(5) () Total compensation of employees divided by the total number of employees. (6) () The benchmark is derived from reduced-form regressions capturing the main determinants of the saving-investment balance, including fundamental determinants (e.g. demography, resources), policy factors and global financial conditions. See also Coutinho, Turrini and Zeugner (2018). (7) () Fundamental-based benchmarks are derived from regressions capturing the main determinants of credit growth and taking into account a given initial stock of debt. Prudential thresholds represent the debt threshold beyond which the probability of a banking crisis is high, minimising the probability of missing the potential crisis and that of false alerts. (8) () The assessment of this CSR does not take into account the contribution of the EU 2021-2027 cohesion policy funds. The regulatory framework underpinning the programming of the 2021-2027 EU cohesion policy funds has not yet been adopted by the co-legislator, pending inter alia an agreement on the multiannual financial framework. (9) () For an overview of fiscal sustainability assessment in the short, medium and long term, see Annex B and European Commission, 2020. (10) () The following thresholds apply: (i) if the value is lower than 2, the country is assigned low risk; (ii) if it is between 2 and 6, it is assigned medium risk; and (iii) if it is greater than 6, the country is assigned high risk.

According to Eurostat, the term precarious work covers all forms of employment with a contract duration of less than three months. (25) () The 2018 results were as follows: mathematics: 16.4%, EU average: 22.4%; science 14.6%, EU average: 21.6%; reading: 17.9%, EU average: 21.7%.

They include the following: no legal, administrative, or budgetary measures have been announced in the national reform programme,in any other official communication to the national Parliament\/relevant parliamentary committees or the European Commission,publicly (e.g. in a press statement or on the government's website);no non-legislative acts have been presented by the governing or legislative body;the Member State has taken initial steps in addressing the CSR, such as commissioning a study or setting up a study group to analyse possible measures to be taken (unless the CSR explicitly asks for orientations or exploratory actions). However, it has not proposed any clearly-specified measure(s) to address the CSR.Limited progress: The Member State has: announced certain measures but these address the CSR only to a limited extent; and\/orpresented legislative acts in the governing or legislative body but these have not been adopted yet and substantial further, non-legislative work is needed before the CSR is implemented;presented non-legislative acts, but has not followed these up with the implementation needed to address the CSR.Some progress: The Member State has adopted measures that partly address the CSR; and\/or that address the CSR, but a fair amount of work is still needed to fully address the CSR fully as only a few of the measures have been implemented. For instance, a measure or measures have been adopted by the national Parliament or by ministerial decision but no implementing decisions are in place. Substantial progress: The Member State has adopted measures that go a long way towards addressing the CSR and most of them have been implemented.

It also empowers the Commission to adopt, by means of an implementing act, appropriate temporary measures necessary to contain risks to human, animal and plant health and animal welfare, if it has evidence of a serious disruption in a Member State's control system. (2) In order to address the specific circumstances due to the ongoing crisis related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020\/466 (2) allows Member States to apply temporary measures in relation to official controls and other official activities. That Implementing Regulation allows for official controls and other official activities on official certificates and official attestations to be performed on an electronic copy of such certificates or attestations, subject to certain conditions.

The main modifications relate to: possibility to fulfil concentration requirements either at national or at category of regions level (increased flexibility); limited relaxation of the requirements for the thematic concentration through the following: reduction of the applicable concentration thresholds for relatively less wealthy countries or regions (Member States with the gross national income ratio equal or below 100% of the EU average as well as for the transition and the less developed regions); on the other hand, for the more developed regions and countries a minimum requirement for policy objective 2 ('a greener Europe') of 30% has been set up; counting environment and climate-friendly expenditure under the Cohesion Fund towards the thematic concentration; exempting specific allocations for the outermost and sparsely populated areas from the concentration rules; shifting 'urban mobility' and 'digital connectivity' specific objectives from policy objective 3 to policy objectives covered by thematic concentration (policy objectives 2 and 1 respectively). The impact of such a shift has been mitigated by capping the maximum allowed contribution from those sectors to the thematic concentration requirements. In relation to the specific objectives, additional emphasis has been put on the integration of third country nationals, including migrants as well as investment in culture and sustainable tourism. In relation to areas excluded from the scope of support, the main change relates to the eligibility of support to fossil fuel-related investments, through a very limited eligibility of natural gas-related investments subject to certain conditions. Its impact has been mitigated by a restrictive definition of eligible investment, the capping of resources that may be used for supporting such investments (at less than 1% of the total ERDF and Cohesion Fund allocation) and time limitations. Some limited exceptions to the generally excluded areas have also been introduced, upon justification i.e. for targeted investment in airport infrastructure, waste management. The exclusions on investments in the area of broadband and rolling stock were eliminated - for these, the corresponding conditions under State aid rules will continue to apply in their entirety. A reference to the Stability and Growth Pact has been introduced. The Commission's implementing powers that could be triggered in exceptional circumstances have been restricted. The Treaty objectives of the Funds and their contribution to social, economic and territorial cohesion have been emphasised and the importance of disadvantaged areas, including rural areas and areas with natural or demographic handicaps has been stressed. In this latter respect, a dedicated provision has been introduced, providing for the opportunity to devote resources for disadvantaged areas in the partnership agreements prepared by Member States. The urban dimension has been reinforced, by raising the earmarking requirement for sustainable urban development actions from 6% to 8% of national ERDF resources under the Investment for jobs and growth goal. Furthermore, the new component of 'Interregional Innovation Investments' has been transferred from the Interreg regulation to the ERDF and Cohesion Fund regulation and its management mode was clarified. 4.Conclusion The Council position presents a balanced compromise that respects the equilibrium and the objectives of the Commission proposal.","4229":"Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Joint Committee established by the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Kingdom of Morocco, of the other part EUROPEAN COMMISSION Brussels, 11.12.2020 COM(2020) 794 final ANNEX to the proposal for a Council Decision on the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Joint Committee set up by the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Kingdom of Morocco, of the other part DECISION No 1 \/ [year] OF THE EU-MOROCCO JOINT COMMITTEE SET UP BY THE EURO-MEDITERRANEAN AVIATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND ITS MEMBER STATES, OF THE ONE PART, AND THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO, OF THE OTHER PART of... adopting the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee THE JOINT COMMITTEE UNDER THE EU-MOROCCO AGREEMENT, Having regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Kingdom of Morocco, of the other part, (the Agreement), and in particular Article 22(6) thereof, HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Sole Article The rules of procedure of the Joint Committee in the Annex to this Decision are hereby adopted.

This is an important step towards the EU disbursing \u20ac6.3 billion in grants under the Recovery and Resilience Facility. This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Slovakia's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Slovakia emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Commission has today adopted a positive assessment of Slovakia's recovery and resilience plan. This is an important step towards the EU disbursing 6.3 billion in grants under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Slovakia's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Slovakia emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF at the heart of NextGenerationEU will provide up to 672.5 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Slovak plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market. The Commission assessed Slovakia's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms set out in Slovakia's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience. Securing Slovakia's green and digital transition The Commission's assessment finds that Slovakia's plan devotes 43% of its total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. This includes investments in new renewable energy capacities, energy efficiency, greening of private and public buildings (including hospitals and schools), developing new infrastructure for electric vehicle charging points, public transport, the decarbonisation of industry and adaptation to climate change. The Commission's assessment finds that Slovakia's plan devotes 21% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. This includes investments in e-governance, the digital transformation of education and healthcare, together with support for enhancing the digital technologies available to businesses, particularly SMEs. Reinforcing Slovakia's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that Slovakia's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Slovakia by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. It includes measures that tackle long-standing challenges in the areas of education, childcare and healthcare. Research, development and innovation are also addressed with comprehensive measures that are expected to tackle the most important shortcomings. These include the low quality and inclusiveness of education, fragmented research, development and innovation policy coordination, insufficient public-private cooperation, and weak research, development and innovation performance. Additional measures proposed in the plan to improve the justice system, public procurement and the fight against money laundering have the potential to contribute to effectively addressing many underlying challenges. Several reforms are expected to improve the long-term sustainability of public finances, notably the planned pension reform. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Slovakia's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars of the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects The Slovak plan proposes projects in all seven European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects that address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the twin transition. For instance, Slovakia has proposed to provide 528 million to renovate at least 30,000 family houses to improve their energy and green performance, while reducing people's energy bills and greenhouse gas emissions as well as adapting to climate change with water retention measures. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The controls systems put in place by Slovakia are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said : President Ursula von der Leyen said: \" I am delighted to present the European Commission's positive assessment of Slovakia's recovery and resilience plan. The plan represents a significant effort by Slovakia to address the challenges it faces and ensure nobody is left behind as we secure the green and digital transitions. It includes a large number of reforms as well as many climate-relevant investments and will provide a boost to digitalisation. We will stand by you every step of the way to ensure that the plan delivers its full potential .\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" This is a strong recovery plan that will set Slovakia on the track to an inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and a more resilient economy with higher growth prospects. Ambitious investments and reforms in education, science and healthcare will increase the country's attractiveness for doing business and create more opportunities across the country. I welcome in particular the strong emphasis on green and digital projects, which will improve the competitiveness of firms and the quality of public services ultimately improving people's wellbeing too. The intense preparation of this plan bodes well for its implementation .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" Our positive assessment of Slovakia's plan brings the country a big step closer to benefitting from 6.3 billion in NextGenerationEU grants. This ambitious plan will help to boost investment in renewable energy, sustainable transport and decarbonisation in the Upper Nitra region. It will support reforms to improve education and healthcare, while also ensuring both the adequacy of pensions and the sustainability of the pension system .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide 6.3 billion in grants to Slovakia under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 823 million to Slovakia in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Slovakia. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

We will stand by you every step of the way to ensure that the plan delivers its full potential .\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" This is a strong recovery plan that will set Slovakia on the track to an inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and a more resilient economy with higher growth prospects. Ambitious investments and reforms in education, science and healthcare will increase the country's attractiveness for doing business and create more opportunities across the country. I welcome in particular the strong emphasis on green and digital projects, which will improve the competitiveness of firms and the quality of public services ultimately improving people's wellbeing too. The intense preparation of this plan bodes well for its implementation .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" Our positive assessment of Slovakia's plan brings the country a big step closer to benefitting from 6.3 billion in NextGenerationEU grants. This ambitious plan will help to boost investment in renewable energy, sustainable transport and decarbonisation in the Upper Nitra region. It will support reforms to improve education and healthcare, while also ensuring both the adequacy of pensions and the sustainability of the pension system .\" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide 6.3 billion in grants to Slovakia under the RRF. The Council will now have, as a rule, four weeks to adopt the Commission's proposal. The Council's approval of the plan would allow for the disbursement of 823 million to Slovakia in pre-financing. This represents 13% of the total allocated amount for Slovakia. The Commission will authorise further disbursements based on the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, reflecting progress on the implementation of the investments and reforms.

The envisaged contract with Sanofi-GSK would provide for an option for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine. It is envisaged that, once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission would have a contractual framework in place for the purchase of 300 million doses, on behalf of all EU Member States. The Commission continues intensive discussions with other vaccine manufacturers. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with a pharmaceutical company to purchase a potential vaccine against COVID-19. The envisaged contract with Sanofi-GSK* would provide for an option for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine. It is envisaged that, once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission would have a contractual framework in place for the purchase of 300 million doses, on behalf of all EU Member States. The Commission continues intensive discussions with other vaccine manufacturers. President von der Leyen said: \" The European Commission does all in its power to ensure that Europeans have rapid access to a vaccine that is safe and protects them from coronavirus. Today's step with Sanofi-GSK is a first important cornerstone of a much broader European Vaccines Strategy. More will follow soon. We are in advanced discussions with several other companies. While we do not know today which vaccine will work best in the end, Europe is investing in a diversified portfolio of promising vaccines, based on various types of technologies. This increases our chances to obtain rapidly an effective remedy against the virus. A vaccine would be a truly global good. We are committed to help secure access also for more vulnerable countries to find their way out of this crisis. \" Stella Kyriakides , Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \" A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is the surest exit strategy from the crisis. For that reason, we have been negotiating a united EU approach to secure doses of promising vaccine candidates in recent weeks. Today's announcement of the conclusion of exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK is the first important step in this direction, to provide equal access to the vaccine for our citizens.\" The exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies. The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost 16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery. The Commission is also ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world. Background The European Commission presented on 17 June a European strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission would finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements . Funding provided would be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen. Sanofi-GSK's vaccine candidate is planning to seek marketing authorisation from EMA in June 2021, following Phase III clinical trials yielding the induction of a promising immune response.

This is an important step towards the EU disbursing a total of \u20ac1.2 billion in grants and loans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility and will play a key role in enabling Cyprus to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Commission has today adopted a positive assessment of Cyprus's recovery and resilience plan. This is an important step towards the EU disbursing a total of 1.2 billion in grants and loans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility. This financing will support the implementation of the crucial investment and reform measures outlined in Cyprus's recovery and resilience plan. It will play a key role in enabling Cyprus to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. The RRF is at the heart of NextGenerationEU which will provide up to 800 billion (in current prices) to support investments and reforms across the EU. The Cypriot plan forms part of an unprecedented coordinated EU response to the COVID-19 crisis, to address common European challenges by embracing the green and digital transitions, to strengthen economic and social resilience and the cohesion of the Single Market. The Commission assessed Cyprus's plan based on the criteria set out in the RRF Regulation. The Commission's analysis considered, in particular, whether the investments and reforms set out in Cyprus's plan support the green and digital transitions; contribute to effectively addressing challenges identified in the European Semester; and strengthen its growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience. Securing Cyprus's green and digital transition The Commission's assessment finds that Cyprus's plan devotes 41% of the plan's total allocation to measures that support climate objectives. The plan includes reforms relating to the introduction of green taxation, the liberalisation of the electricity market, facilitating energy renovations in buildings and accelerating electric mobility. The plan further includes a broad range of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments targeting households, enterprises, municipalities and the wider public sector and non-governmental organisations ('NGOs'). The plan includes investments relating to the mass roll-out of smart meters as well as the EuroAsia Interconnector project, which should aid electricity generation from cleaner sources, in particular renewables. The Commission's assessment finds that Cyprus's plan devotes 23% of its total allocation to measures that support the digital transition. Measures related to the digital transition are spread out throughout the plan. The plan includes considerable investments in connectivity, through a series of measures aiming to ensure coverage with very high-capacity broadband. It promotes digital education and skills by enhancing digital infrastructure and curricula in schools, training teachers, and investing in digital skills training programmes. It also contains projects expected to promote the digitalisation of public services and the digital transformation of the courts system. Reinforcing Cyprus's economic and social resilience The Commission considers that Cyprus's plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to addressing all or a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Cyprus. The plan includes measures to strengthen the public employment services, with a particular focus on youth employment. It provides for measures to increase the quality of education and training. The plan also supports early childhood education and care by extending free compulsory pre-primary education from the age of four, investing in childcare centres accompanied by a national action plan on early childhood education that aims to foster equal opportunities for all children and fulltime labour market participation of carers, notably women. The implementation of the plan is expected to strengthen the capacity, quality and resilience of the health and civil protection systems through measures aiming at upgrading infrastructure and equipment and setting up dedicated information systems, next to promoting investments in communication systems and e-Health. The establishment of a National Promotional Agency and the introduction of funding programmes and schemes are expected to improve access to finance and liquidity, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Grant schemes for research and innovation as well as the establishment of a central knowledge transfer office are expected to increase investments in research and innovation. The plan aims to reduce risks in the banking sector related to the legacy non-performing loans through a dedicated action plan as well as through measures to improve the working environment for credit acquirers and credit servicers. The plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Cyprus's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars referred to in the RRF Regulation. Supporting flagship investment and reform projects The Cypriot plan proposes projects in all seven European flagship areas. These are specific investment projects which address issues that are common to all Member States in areas that create jobs and growth and are needed for the twin transition. For instance, Cyprus has proposed to invest 40 million to promoting energy efficiency investments in SMEs, municipalities and the wider public sector and 35 million on the expansion of very high capacity networks in underserved areas. The assessment also finds that none of the measures included in the plan significantly harm the environment, in line with the requirements laid out in the RRF Regulation. The control systems put in place by Cyprus are considered adequate to protect the financial interests of the Union. The plan provides sufficient details on how national authorities will prevent, detect and correct instances of conflict of interest, corruption and fraud relating to the use of funds. Members of the College said : President Ursula von der Leyen said: \"I am delighted to present the European Commission's positive assessment of Cyprus's recovery and resilience plan. The plan will have a real, meaningful impact on securing Cyprus's green and digital transitions. A significant part of the funds will be devoted to fight climate change, including the protection against forest fires. Further measures to promote energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, improve education and training and expand connectivity will leave Cyprus well placed to benefit from the opportunities and face the challenges that the twin transition present. I am proud that NextGenerationEU will provide 1.2 billion to support these crucial projects.\" Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: \" Cyprus has submitted a wide-ranging recovery plan. It contains significant reforms and investments to address its main socio-economic challenges and put the country onto a greener and more digital path. Cyprus intends to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy, improve its water and waste management, and contribute to the 'EuroAsia Interconnector' project to link its electricity network with the Greek one in Crete. It will make considerable investments to boost very high-capacity broadband coverage, promote digital education and skills and digitalise its public services and courts. On the economic side, we welcome its focus on addressing risks from non-performing loans held by banks, improving the working environment for credit acquirers and services, and increasing access to finance and liquidity for smaller businesses. The social dimension features strongly with support for early childhood education and care, along with measures to get more young people into jobs and to promote equal opportunities. Once put into full effect, this plan will allow Cyprus to emerge stronger from the crisis .\" Paolo Gentiloni , Commissioner for Economy, said: \" With the approval by the Commission of Cyprus's recovery and resilience plan, the country takes a step closer to accessing 1.2 billion in funding to support the renewal of its economy. Cyprus is seizing the opportunity offered by NextGenerationEU to make important progress with the climate transition and in boosting its digital competitiveness. Particularly beneficial to Cyprus will be the projects connecting the island to the Greek electricity and high-capacity broadband networks. I also welcome the commitments to addressing those features of Cyprus's tax system that facilitate aggressive tax planning \" Next steps The Commission has today adopted a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision to provide 1.2 billion in grants and loans to Cyprus under the RRF.

Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris TD said today (Friday): \"I want to pay tribute today to our further and higher education institutions, their staff and the students and learners who have been so profoundly affected by the global pandemic. It has not been easy, but they have managed to keep up their high standards, deliver a full schedule of classes online not only through Level 5 but since March, keep some in-person essential learning going and make sure that support was there for those who needed it. \"I and my officials have worked with institutions and with student representatives to enable more clarity around next semester before the end of this one. As we move to Level 3 as a country, I am very glad that we can set out plans and priorities for the time ahead. \"The health and safety of students, learners and staff must always come first, and we will adapt as the situation changes, in line with the public health advice. Every effort must continue to facilitate social distancing and limit congregation, adhering closely to the guidance to safeguard the health and safety of everyone. \"However, we have every reason to be optimistic, and while it is inevitable that large-scale learning, like lectures, will be online for the rest of the academic year, it is our shared intention that face to face learning on campus will increase for some priority groups. It is our shared intention that, as a priority group, first year students will be invited to have more on campus activity, in line with the best public health advice and if the first year student wishes. Other priority groups include those who do not have suitable facilities or the right environment to access learning remotely, vulnerable or marginalised students and learners, and those studying in disciplines that are dependent on in-person small group learning and discussion. \"We are also planning that as restrictions ease, there should be greater opportunity to provide increasing levels of small group learning, and that we can consider restarting activities like sports, clubs and societies. Of course, all these activities will be planned so as to facilitate social distancing and limit congregation. \"While the majority of the semester will remains online, this plan will allow our students and staff the opportunity to experience college life once again, albeit in a different way. \"A great deal of hard work has gone into developing this plan and identifying priorities, and I want to thank all involved for their cooperation and the spirit of collaboration and communication that my department intends to continue working in. \"Further and higher education providers will now make their own plans, within the framework we have agreed, for how they move forward, and will communicate with their students, learners and staff on what next semester looks like for them.\" ENDS Notes Information on the priorities for further and higher education across all levels of the government's Plan for Living with COVID-19 is available below: Priorities across the different levels of the Plan for Living with COVID-19 Download","4859":"Minister Harris welcomes investment in COVID-19 research The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris, has announced a 4.8m investment in a Trinity College Dublin-led research partnership through Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) to better understand COVID-19. The project will be led by Trinity College and will include researchers from the University of Limerick and University College Dublin. International collaborators will also take part from the US, the Netherlands, France, Hong Kong and the UK. The research will look to understand why some people are more susceptible to COVID-19 than others.

Unfortunately, we cannot do this tomorrow. \"The enormous effort that the entire country has put in to drive down the rate of infection is working. We have successfully reduced the pressure on our health service, and we are moving in the right direction, but we are at a crossroads. \"The variant that is now dominant in the country is much more contagious and therefore much more dangerous. We must keep it under control and I am hopeful that everyone will make a special effort to mark the day in a COVID safe manner. It is very important that people do not congregate or meet up for social gatherings in their homes or anywhere else. To do so would be to undermine all of the sacrifices we have made to date. \"The opportunity to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day will come again. Our vaccination programme continues to be rolled out and as supply increases, we will get them to people quickly.

The Fund will support social enterprises with small grants to help them expand their businesses and create jobs. It is specifically aimed at early stage social enterprises which have a clear ambition to impact a critical social issue. Announcing the Social Enterprise Start-up Fund, Minister Humphreys said: \"I am delighted to be in a position today to announce a 800,000 Social Enterprise Start-up Fund to run over two years, the purpose of which is to provide tailored supports to early stage social enterprises, a group that generally has difficulty accessing the more mainstream social enterprise supports. \"Twenty-five social enterprises from across Ireland will receive cash grants of between 9,500 and 12,000, as well as access to a six month tailored training programme. \"This announcement underscores my commitment under the National Social Enterprise Policy to growing and strengthening Social Enterprise right across the country. \"The programme itself comes under the Dormant Accounts Fund in my Department. It will be delivered by Rethink Ireland who have a great track record in administering supports to social enterprises.\" Deirdre Mortell, CEO of Rethink Ireland added: ''At Rethink Ireland we believe that social enterprises can play a pivotal role in supporting the transition to a more inclusive, sustainable and green economy. \"We're delighted to be partnering with the Department of Rural and Community Development to provide much-needed start-up funding and supports as part of today's commitment to the Social Enterprise sector in Ireland. Our research continues to show that this type of funding and support is critical to ensuring social enterprises have the best chance of reaching sustainability and maximising impact in their communities.'' Full details of the Social Enterprise Start-up Fund are available at: www.rethinkireland.ie ENDS Notes to editors: Social Enterprises Social enterprises are businesses that work primarily to improve the lives of people. Their core objective is to achieve a social, societal, or environmental impact. Like other businesses, social enterprises pursue their objectives by trading in goods and services on an ongoing basis. However, surpluses generated by social enterprises are re-invested into achieving their core social objectives, rather than maximising profit for their owners. They frequently work to support disadvantaged groups such as the long-term unemployed, people with disabilities, the Traveller community, etc., or to address issues such as food poverty, social housing, or environmental matters. National Social Enterprise Policy Ireland's first National Social Enterprise Policy for Ireland 2019-2022 National Social Enterprise Policy for Ireland 2019-2022 was launched by the Department of Rural and Community Development on 18 July 2019, with the objective of creating an enabling environment for social enterprise to grow and contribute more fully to Ireland's social and economic progress. The Policy is focused on three main objectives: 1. Building Awareness of Social Enterprise 2. Growing and Strengthening Social Enterprise 3. Achieving Better Policy Alignment Rethink Ireland Rethink Ireland is a national organisation supporting Ireland's best social innovations through cash grants and business supports. They administer the Social Enterprise Development Fund on behalf of the Department of Rural and Community Development, a fund which will deliver 3.2M in grants and supports to social enterprise between 2018 and 2022. Dormant Accounts Fund The Dormant Accounts Acts 2001-2012, together with the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003, provide a framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts in credit institutions (i.e. banks, building societies and An Post) and unclaimed life assurance policies in insurance undertakings. The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account or policy holders with their funds in credit institutions or insurance undertakings and in this regard, these bodies are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies. However, in order to utilise the un-used funds in dormant accounts and unclaimed policies to best effect, the legislation also introduced a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed from dormant accounts and unclaimed policies for the purposes of measures to assist: 1. the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; 2. the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged; or 3. persons with a disability. Social Enterprises work in many ways to assist people in these categories.","5048":"COVID\u201319 Guidelines Updated Guidelines in relation to Covid-19\/Coronavirus are available here Download a Covid-19 poster that includes key facts about the Coronavirus here","5111":"Office of Public Works Celebrates Innovation Week with a free to attend webinar event \u2018Progress and Preservation through Design\u2019 As part of its programme to celebrate Innovation Week in Ireland, The Office of Public Works (OPW) is proud to present a free to attend webinar entitled 'Progress and Preservation through Design,' which is taking place next Thursday 22nd October from 11am - 1pm. For almost two centuries, the design functions of the OPW have influenced many aspects of life in Ireland. Today, whether its pioneering landscape architecture that supports biodiversity and healthy ecosystems; the celebration of indigenous creativity through Ireland's World Trade Fair Expo 2021 or the continuous development of smart flood management schemes, the OPW's innovative work in the area of design continues to impact the everyday lives of the public it serves. Hosted by some of Ireland's most talented designers and planners, including Internationally recognised design guru Lorna Ross, guests will embark on a journey of discovery from Clonakilty to Dubai with unique insights into the creative minds and projects shaping our experiences and the important real-time and long-term role of accessible design in our response to a changing post-COVID world. Announcing the details of this informative free webinar, Mr. Patrick O'Donovan, T.D., Minister of State, with responsibility for the Office of Public Works (OPW) said Despite the many difficulties we may be experiencing today it is a good time to think about making changes that will benefit our future. Design and innovation are central to that ability-to shape the world around us. We must not lose sight of the many possibilities that creativity, knowledge and resolve can deliver and the OPW are delighted to present some of the fascinating work taking place across the country and beyond that demonstrate this experience. Commenting on her involvement in this exciting free event, Lorna Ross said The world is changing, but I truly believe that good design can direct that change in a conscientious way. For me design is inherently optimistic. You design to go forwards and not backwards, so I think this is a very timely discussion that will focus the minds on the vital role design has to play in the evolution of our new world as creatives collaborate with science to determine outcomes.

The Bill will ban the resale of tickets to live events, matches and concerts in designated venues, at a price above face value. There is an exemption for amateur sports clubs and registered charities for fundraising purposes. A person found guilty of an offence under the act will face a fine of up to 100,000 or up to two years imprisonment. The legislation is listed as priority legislation for this Dail term, meaning it is expected to be published before the end of the year. The Tanaiste said: \"Touts and reselling websites ruin gigs and matches for everyone making it harder to get a ticket in the first place and driving up prices. This is about making sure people aren't getting ripped off once live events, matches and concerts get up and running again, especially considering numbers are likely to be restricted to begin with. \"There is a specific provision in the Bill for the Euro 2020 championships next year, banning the unauthorised sale of tickets for matches. We want to make sure everyone gets a fair shot at getting tickets at face value. \"This legislation is also hopeful. We're planning for the time when we can go to gigs, festivals and matches again.\" ENDS Notes A Private Members' Bill brought forward by Deputy Noel Rock and Deputy Stephen Donnelly in 2017 and supported by the previous Government, provided for a ban on the above-cost resale of event tickets and was supported by all parties during its Second Reading in Dail Eireann in January and February 2019. This Bill came within the scope of Directive (EU) 1535\/2015 on the procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on information society services which requires Member States to submit legislative proposals in these areas to the European Commission for assessment of their compatibility with EU law and the Internal Market. On foot of Government approval at its meeting on 29 January 2020 (S180\/20\/10\/2333), the amended Bill was notified to the European Commission in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015\/1535 on 5 February 2020. The three-month standstill period for its examination by the Commission, Member States and interested parties concluded on 6 May 2020. No issue of compatibility with EU law or the Internal Market was raised by the European Commission or other Member States. Main provisions of the Bill Designation of venues The prohibition on the sale or advertising for sale of tickets and ticket packages above their original sale price would apply to events in designated venues with a capacity of 1,000 or more. The Bill sets out the procedures governing applications for designation by venue operators. Applying the legislation to known designated venues will facilitate the monitoring and enforcement of the prohibition on the above sale price resale of tickets. The Minister may designate a venue with a capacity of less than 1,000 if, after consultation with the venue operator, the Minister is of the opinion that the venue will hold one or more events which may give rise to the sale of tickets for a price exceeding the original sale price and that the designation of the venue would be in the public interest. Information requirement for primary ticket sellers Primary ticket sellers will be required to provide information that a ticket or ticket package is for an event in a designated venue and that its sale for a price exceeding the original sale price is prohibited unless it comes within the Act's exemption for charitable organisations and amateur sports clubs. Information requirement for secondary ticket sellers Secondary ticket sellers selling or advertising tickets for events in designated venues will be required to provide information on the original sale price of the ticket or ticket package and the location of the seat or standing area to which the ticket or ticket package entitles the holder to gain admission. The operators of secondary ticket marketplaces will be required to ensure that this information is provided by secondary ticket sellers. Exemptions Exemptions apply for the sale or advertising for sale of tickets for events in designated venues by or behalf of charitable organisations and amateur sports clubs. Contract terms excluding or limiting sale of tickets The Bill protects the right of ticket holders to sell a ticket for a price at or below the original sale price. This provision does not apply to tickets for the EURO 2020 Championship or for events where the sale or transfer of tickets is excluded or limited on grounds of safety, public health or public order. Offences and penalties The Bill provides for penalties for persons found guilty on summary conviction and also for proceedings and penalties on indictment and for additional penalties for a second or subsequent summary conviction and for continuing offences.","5363":"Statement from the Chief Medical Officer on hot weather health risks While people should get outdoors this week and enjoy the beautiful weather, it's important to do so in as safe a way as possible. Be SunSmart regularly and liberally apply sunscreen that has a sun protection factor of at least 30+ for adults and 50+ for children, wear light and loose-fitting clothing that covers your skin, wear a hat and sunglasses. Keep yourself cool and hydrated. Other risks to be mindful of during this spell of hot weather are heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat exhaustion is not usually serious if you can cool down within 30 minutes. Signs of heat exhaustion include headache, dizziness and confusion, loss of appetite and feeling sick, fast breathing or pulse, high temperature of 38C or above and being very thirsty. If not treated this can lead to heatstroke, which means the body is no longer able to cool itself down and this needs to be treated as an emergency. If you feel unwell, or you or your children display any of the above symptoms immediately move to a cool place, rest and hydrate. If needed, seek medical attention. Look out for others around you, especially individuals who may be more vulnerable to the effects of heat such as older people, young children and babies. Finally, please continue to follow relevant public health advice to keep you and those around you safe from COVID-19.

The Programme will aid 26 local authorities in implementing 432 road improvement projects across the country while building on the support provided under the 2020 July Stimulus Plan. The types of projects approved for funding include schemes aimed at alleviating flooding to roads, bridge strengthening and repairs, embankment stability measures to protect the road and prevent slippage, altering the level of the road to mitigate flooding and reduce road closure frequency, road edge protection measures and the replacement\/repair of seawalls or retaining walls which support regional and local roads. Among the projects are: Improving drainage works with a full overlay to replace severely damaged local road between Garrymore and Ballincarrig, Co. Wicklow. Replacement and repair of the sea wall in Belmullet, Co.Mayo. Install drainage network & upgrade to sections of the road in Lissyegan, Co. Galway to deal with extreme flooding situations. Drainage and embankment stability measures to protect the road and repair slippage in Ballyhar, Co. Kerry Increase hydraulic capacity at Breandrum Bridge in Co. Cavan Commenting on today's announcement Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan T.D., said: \"This funding will support local authorities across the country deal with the challenges of climate change and severe weather events. The upkeep of our road network is crucial in ensuring that our public transport, cyclists, walkers, car users can travel safely around the country.\" Minister of State, Hildegarde Naughton T.D., said: \"Well maintained roads, mean safer roads.

The National Drug and Alcohol Survey (previously referred to as the Drug Use in Ireland and Northern Ireland Drug Prevalence Survey) is funded by the Department of Health and managed by the Health Research Board. The survey provides information on alcohol, tobacco, and drug use amongst the general population in Ireland. It also looks at attitudes and perceptions of drug, alcohol and tobacco use and the impact on communities. The Department of Health has commenced a mid-term review of the actions in the National Drugs Strategy in consultation with stakeholders. The review will provide an opportunity to reflect on progress in implementing the strategy to date, the progress achieved under the current action plan and allow the identification of any new issues that have arisen and to consider the development of new actions to address emerging needs and challenges. The National Drug and Alcohol Survey provides important and timely data regarding drug use in Ireland, which will assist in ongoing policy development through the mid-term review. Minster Feighan said: \"I welcome the publication of National Drug and Alcohol Survey which provides us with up-to-date evidence to guide our ongoing policy development and service delivery. The publication of this important survey will play a key role in guiding the path forward and highlighting those areas which require our attention.\" The survey's findings include the following: overall, the use of illegal drugs has remained at a similar same level to that recorded in the 2014\/15 survey. An increase has been seen, however, in the use of cocaine and ecstasy cocaine use has increased across all age groups. Men aged 25 to 34 are most likely to report cocaine use in the last year. The findings of the 2019\/20 survey represent a significant increase in use when compared to the same cohort in the 2014\/15 survey ecstasy is the second most commonly used drug in the last 12 months after cannabis and has increased in prevalence from 1.8 to 2.2%. The recent use of ecstasy among 15 to 64 year olds has risen from 2.1% to 2.7% when compared to the findings of the 2014\/15 survey while cannabis is the most prevalent illegal drug in Ireland, the use of cannabis has shown a decrease from 6.5% to 5.9% when compared to the 2014\/15 survey. A significant decrease in the instances of Cannabis Use Disorder has also been recorded the majority of respondents, 70.9%, expressed disapproval or strong disapproval for smoking cannabis regularly and there is a low level of support (26.2%) for permitting cannabis for recreational use polydrug use has increased when compared to the 2014\/15 survey; in 2019\/20, one-quarter of those who reported illegal drug use reported use of at least three illegal drugs, compared with 15.4% in 2014\/15 Minster Feighan said: \"While it is positive to see the overall use of illegal drugs remain at a stable level, there are worrying trends regarding the increase in the use of cocaine, ecstasy, and the prevalence of polydrug use.These trends will be addressed as part of the mid-term review of our National Drugs Strategy.\" Minister Feighan added: \"The increase in the use of ecstasy underlines the need for effective harm reduction measures which make our night-time economy a safer place. The Department of Health has provided funding to the HSE to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use which will be publicly available later this year.\" Minster Feighan continued: \"I am pleased, however, to see a decrease not only in the use of cannabis, but also in the instances of Cannabis Use Disorder when compared to the 2014\/15 survey. I also note that that there is little support for permitting cannabis to be used recreationally; the dangers of this drug have been well documented\" When asked how those addicted to drugs were perceived, the most common response in the 2019\/20 survey was for them to be considered 'more as a patient' (46.6%) than as a criminal (8.5%). This response shows an increase when compared to the same question in 2014\/15 survey. This represents a strong endorsement of the health led approach as set out in the National Drugs Strategy which promotes a more compassionate and humane approach to people who use drugs, with drug use treated first and foremost as a public health issue. Minister Feighan said: \"I am committed to a health-led approach to drug use. The Department of Health is leading on the implementation of the Health Diversion Programme for individuals found in possession of drugs for personal use, which will offer compassion, not punishment, to people who use drugs. I look forward to the commencement of the Health Diversion Programme in 2021.\"","5552":"Government allocated \u20ac869.2m to research and development in 2020 - T\u00e1naiste 8.4% increase in previous year The Tanaiste and Minister for Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Leo Varadkar TD, has today (Wednesday 20 January) published the latest figures on government investment in Research and Development (R&D) for 2019 and estimated figures for 2020. The Tanaiste said: \"These results show that Government allocated 869.2m to Research and Development last year, a 8.4% increase in investment on the previous year. \"R&D is a really important driver of competitiveness, productivity and economic growth. We invest now and reap the rewards in terms of jobs and new technology in the future. \"This investment went towards finding solutions to problems facing business; creating the jobs of the future; testing new technologies and making Ireland a global innovation leader. We will continue to give R&D funding priority in years to come.\" Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris TD said: \"Investing in Research and Innovation is critical for the economy, our people and our future. \"We have made progress in the last two years, but we know we must do more. Ireland can become a global innovation leader. The new department will drive this agenda and will ensure research and innovation is at the centre of our economy recovery.\" The data is published in a report named: The Research and Development Budget 2019-2020. The publication is compiled from a comprehensive survey of thirty government departments and agencies. Government spend on R&D was 802.2m in 2019 an increase of 4.8% in expenditure over the previous year. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its Agencies (Science Foundation Ireland, InterTrade Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland) were responsible for over half (50.9%) of all government R&D investment in 2019 at 408.4m. It is estimated to have increased in 2020 by a further 8.4% with allocated funding of 869.2m. The report provides details of government funded research programs and highlights the extent and variety of R&D being carried out in the country. In addition, the report brings together the latest data on business, higher education and government agencies' spending on R&D in Ireland. In 2019, Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) across all sectors of the economy was 4.027 billion. The highest expenditure on R&D continues to be within the business sector, which accounted for an estimate 2.910 billion or 72.5% of total GERD. Following a Government decision to transfer certain research and innovation functions, the Research and Development Budget 2019-2020 Survey will be undertaken by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science from 2021 onwards.

The scheme provides grants for on-farm capital investment. The Minister commented \"I am delighted to announce the continuation of TAMS beyond the current tranche. The current Tranche 20 of the scheme is due to close this Friday and Tranche 21 will open immediately afterwards on Saturday 16th January. This is part of our transitional measures to provide supports to farmers across our RDP schemes this year and I am delighted to have been able to secure funding for this crucial scheme. I have been very clear that continuity is very important and this is part of that commitment. TAMS has been hugely successful to date with over 265m in grant aid paid out and I would encourage all existing applicants with approvals to submit their payment claims as soon as they are complete.\" The Minister also announced some amendments to the scheme for the new tranche opening 16 January which will have the following changes: The addition of investments for calf welfare. This means the investments previously available under the Calf Investment Scheme will be included under TAMS now; GPS spreaders to be now available for all categories of applicants. Previously these were only available to tillage applicants under the scheme; In line with the rules for derogtation farmers introduced last year, this cohort of farmers are no longer eligble to apply for support for LESS equipment. The Minister also announced some flexibilities for existing TAMs approvals in response to COVID-19 issues. These flexibilities are being introduced to make it easier for farmers and their agents to continue to participate in this important scheme where difficulties arise from the current public health restrictions in place. The Minister commented, \"It is essential that farming continues at this time while being mindful of the public health measures. I have introduced some flexibilities to the scheme arrangements to reflect the fact that certain practices are not possible at this time and alternative arrangements are required.\" The flexibilities included are as follows: flexibility on TAMS completion deadlines all TAMS projects due for completion (or approvals due to expire) between 1 January and 1 April 2021 may be extended by 3 months; the date for the submission of TAMS payment claims due to be submitted before 1 April 2021 may also be extended by 3 months. Approved participants who wish to avail of these extensions may contact the local office from which their approval issued who will provide approval for the required extension.

The two schemes, introduced as a direct response to the Pandemic, were due to expire on March 31st. Minister Humphreys also confirmed that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will remain open to new entrants. It will continue to be paid at four rates (350, 300, 250 and 203) which are linked to a person's prior income. This week, the Department of Social Protection issued weekly payments valued at 141.88 million to 473,413 people in receipt of the PUP. To date, over 847,000 people have received at least one PUP payment and over 6 billion has been paid out since the scheme was introduced last March. Meanwhile, the Enhanced Illness Benefit will continue to be paid at the rate of 350 up until June 30th, 2021. To date, over 136,000 people have been medically certified for receipt of a Covid-19 related Illness Benefit payment. The Enhanced Illness Benefit is available to people who are diagnosed by their medical doctor with the Covid-19 virus or who are required by their medical doctor to self-isolate. The rate of payment is 350 per week. Unlike the Department's general Illness Benefit, there are no waiting days attached to this payment, so it is paid from day one of illness or self-isolation. Speaking after today's Cabinet meeting, Minister Humphreys said: \"As the pandemic continues to impact on all aspects of our lives, I believe it is essential to extend the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Enhanced Illness Benefit until the end June 2021. \"These supports have proven vital in supporting workers who lose their employment, as well as those who contract Covid-19 and must self-isolate. \"This week, over 140m was spent on the PUP, supporting over 473,000 people. This brings the total PUP bill to date to over 6 billion, which demonstrates both the scale and the importance of this support. \"As I have said previously, as long as these restrictions are in place, the Government will continue to support workers and businesses. Minister Humphreys added: \"I am also pleased to secure Cabinet approval to extend the Enhanced Illness Benefit until June 30th, in line with the PUP. \"Once a person has been diagnosed with having the Covid-19 virus or are asked to self-isolate they can make an application for the Enhanced Illness Benefit online and their doctor will also submit the illness certificate. \"It is paid from day one of a person's illness or self-isolation and the rate of payment is 350 per week. \"So the message for anyone who contracts Covid-19 or displays symptoms of the virus is simple: Do not in any circumstance attend the workplace. The Enhanced Illness Benefit is in place to support you.\" Waiver on Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance Minister Humphreys also secured Government approval to extend the waiver on waiting days for Jobseeker's payments until the end of June 2021. Essentially, this means that when a person applies for either Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance, their payment is paid from day one. Ordinarily, when a person applies for either of these two payments, they are not paid for the first 3 days they are called 'waiting days'. Previously, the 'waiting days' requirement was waived at the onset of Covid-19, to facilitate people who got temporary work. This measure was due to expire at the end of March but will now be extended in line with the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Enhanced Illness Benefit. Minister Humphreys continued: \"I want to ensure that we are not placing any obstacles in the way of people who find temporary work at this time. \"So, a person who gets temporary work any time between now and the end of June will not be penalised with 'waiting days' when that work finishes. Their Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance will be paid immediately.\" ENDS Note to Editor: The quickest and easiest way to apply for the Pandemic Unemployment, Enhanced Illness Benefit or a Jobseeker's payment is online through www.MyWelfare.ie","5741":"Minister Donnelly welcomes update on Pathfinder Service Pathfinder is an alternative care pathway for the older community within the Beaumount Hospital catchment area in Dublin. Pathfinder is a Slaintecare funded project and sees the National Ambulance Service, Allied Health Professionals from Beaumont Hospital, and Dublin Fire Brigade working together to respond and treat older people in their home. When a 112\/999 emergency call is received, a staff member assess whether the response required meets the triage criteria to allow the call to access the Pathfinder Service. This innovative service enables staff treat and assess the patient as well as provide the appropriate supports and follow up care to the patient, so that the patient does not need to be transported to a busy Emergency Department to receive care. This is proving to be a much better experience for the patient as well as for staff, as they know that the patient has received appropriate care in a timely manner. To date Pathfinder has treated 178 older 999\/112 callers at home rather than transporting them to the Emergency Department. The average age of these patients is 82 years. Minister Donnelly said: \"I am delighted that this innovative service is allowing vulnerable patients in the Beaumont Hospital catchment area avoid an unnecessary attendance to the Emergency Department, and potentially, admission to hospital. \"Importantly, receiving treatment and support at home allows patients benefit from a mental health, clinical and functional perspective as required. This service keeps older persons in the comfort of the familiar surroundings of home where they can be managed safely and avoid unnecessary presentation to an Emergency Department.\" The service is funded through the Slaintecare Integration Fund and is changing the current model of care from one of transport to ED, to a model that treats people at the scene and provides therapeutic intervention at home and onward referral to appropriate agencies, thus avoiding an emergency presentation to hospital. Minister Donnelly said: \"The overwhelmingly positive feedback from patients and families confirm that this kind of service works for patients by addressing their care needs in a considered, compassionate way, in these unprecedented and difficult times. \"It relieves pressure within the Emergency Departments where our frontline workers are working so hard to deliver both COVID-19 and non-COVID care safely. The Pathfinder Service supports increased ED capacity to care for other patients, by supporting this cohort of complex, frail patients at home. The service is utilising a whole network of dedicated and expert community health resources, working together to ensure patients are managed safely at home. I want to thank all of the GPs, Community Intervention Teams, Public Health Nurses, Geriatricians, and NGOs who continue to deliver expert compassionate care to our vulnerable loved ones.\" Some of the feedback from patients includes: \"A wonderful service.\" \"Beautiful service for older people - If I ever had to be attended to again, I know I'll be in good hands.\" \"It meant a lot to me and my wife, especially the follow ups.\" ENDS Notes How the pathfinder service works The Pathfinder Service will see an Ambulance Team, comprising an Advanced Paramedic (AP) and a Clinical Specialist Occupational Therapist (OT) or Physiotherapist (PT) responding to 999 calls from frail, elderly patients. The Ambulance Team will treat the patient at the scene as an alternative to taking them to the ED, if appropriate. The Follow-Up team, comprising of Occupational Therapist and Physiotherapist staff, will support patients who remain at home by providing further assessment and interventions such as provision of equipment for the home, and linking the patient in with appropriate community health and social care services provided through the HSE or voluntary agencies operating in the area. Presentation to ED for elderly people increases the risk for elderly patients of experiencing an adverse event, such as pressure ulcer, infection, adverse drug event, functional decline, delirium or a fall. It can result in increased hospital length of stay, increased confusion and increased mortality. About Slaintecare Slaintecare is the plan to reform Ireland's health services. Slaintecare has cross-party political support, and therefore provides a unique opportunity to implement a joined-up solution to make sure people can get the right care, in the right place, at the right time. The goal of Slaintecare is that health and social care services will be built around the need of the people, such that most illnesses and minor injuries can be treated in the community. People will be able to stay healthy in their homes and communities, only attending hospital when necessary. This will result in shorter hospital waiting times for those who need to attend hospital. Slaintecare Integration Fund Budget 2019 provided 20 million for the establishment of a new ring-fenced Slaintecare Integration Fund to test and scale how services can best be delivered. The Slaintecare Integration Fund sought submissions with a focus on prevention, community care and integration of care across all health and social care settings. Finding, supporting and scaling innovative new ways of providing care is fundamental to delivering Slaintecare. The Integration Fund looked for initiatives that support the delivery of integrated care and the shift to community care in innovative new ways, helping to reduce and prevent hospital visits. This will support us in meeting our ultimate goal of reducing waiting lists and reducing waiting times. Applications were invited which: promote the engagement and empowerment of citizens in the care of their own health scale and share examples of best practice and processes for chronic disease management and care of older people encourage innovations in the shift of care to the community or provide hospital avoidance measures A total of 477 applications were received from a wide range of organisations. The process was very competitive with the fund being 9 times oversubscribed. 122 projects from across the country were successful. The successful projects are in more than 100 locations right across the country. The project partners range from hospitals, hospital groups, Community Healthcare Organisations, Community and Voluntary Organisations, Universities and Primary Care Centres. Many successful projects will be delivered in partnership between hospitals and Community Healthcare Organisations, or hospitals and community organisations, highlighting the emphasis on integrated care and shifting care to the community.","5804":"Statement from the National Public Health Emergency Team - Friday 16 April 1.

Measures to support an increase of 120 intern places from July 2021 2. Postgraduate Training Places 3. Post CSCST Fellowship Posts The Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly TD, is pleased to announce an increase of 120 medical intern posts plus additional postgraduate training places and Post CSCST Fellowship posts for July 2021. The Minister is committed to increasing the medical workforce and this approach is a positive step as it offers more opportunities for training doctors, including those at a senior level. Minister Donnelly has agreed that a permanent increase in intern posts cannot be considered in isolation and the full journey of postgraduate training needed to be considered to ensure alignment with medical workforce planning and the next steps in postgraduate training pathway. Minister Donnelly said: \"I am pleased that we are now in a position to significantly increase the medical training places in a more permanent way that is aligned with workforce planning and the future needs of our health and social care services. As we are coming out of the third wave of COVID-19 and the focus will return to the challenges of our health service, there needs to be a focus on the continued recruitment of senior doctors to meet demands.\" Measures to support an increase of 120 intern places from July 2021 The Minister has agreed the following measures to support postgraduate medical training in Ireland: an increase of interns for July 2021 to 854 places introduction of a period of an overlap of one week between exiting and incoming interns establishment of 12 De Novo Training Posts conversion of 40 Non-Training Posts to Training Posts permanent establishment of 40 Post CSCST Fellowships The new measures are estimated to cost approximately 11.4m over the next two years with 4.4m to be funded in 2021. The HSE Chief Clinical Officer, Dr. Colm Henry, welcomes the announcement from Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly TD, confirming an increase in medical intern posts plus additional post graduate training places and Post CSCST Fellowship posts for July 2021. Dr Henry says: \"The HSE is committed to increasing training posts while reducing our reliance on non-training posts and we will continue to work towards this goal through appropriate increases in the number of intern and post graduate training posts in line with medical workforce requirements while ensuring training capacity, supervision and standards are maintained.\" Postgraduate Training Places The increase in number of intern places will be supported with accompanying increases in postgraduate training places, the next step in the training pathway following completion of an internship. These increases in approved postgraduate training posts are in addition to the already approved increase of 114 training posts across postgraduate training programmes for the July 2021 intake. The additional training posts will provide enhanced opportunities for doctors in Ireland and will ultimately support the delivery of shorter waiting times, the reduction of inappropriate hospital admissions, improved patient flow, and earlier discharge of patients to the community. Post CSCST Fellowship Posts In November 2020, the HSE announced the establishment of 40 once off COVID-19 Era Posts CSCST Fellowships for July 2021. These Fellowships will be filled by senior doctors who have completed training to develop key skills within our health service as well as continuing to support the COVID-19 effort. Today's confirmation of the permanent establishment of these one-year Post CSCST Fellowships will enhance the training and skills of specialist trainees in a way that will benefit the health services in Ireland and creating opportunities to enrich training here and to retain the specialists Ireland needs. The introduction of these permanent Post CSCST Fellowships will bring the expected number of Post CSCST Fellowships opportunities in Ireland up to approximately 55 per year. Over the next number of months, the HSE will be undertaking a formal review of the number of intern posts and postgraduate training positions to ensure the number of intern places are in line with future medical workforce planning requirements of the health service. As part of this review the clinical sites where additional intern posts are most needed will be considered to ensure that the current configuration provides the most efficient and educationally appropriate model. Notes medical intern places are determined by HSE workforce planning requirements in line with current government policy. The national number of available intern posts available in 2020 and 2021 exceeded the recommendations of the Medical Education in Ireland: A New Direction report, known as the Fottrell Report (2006) in 2020 and 2021 in the past, the number of intern places was in line with the number of CAO applicants of the 734 posts approximately 680 are offered to CAO applicants annually. All eligible CAO entrants to Irish medical schools who are work permit exempt are guaranteed an intern post","6056":"Statutory Instruments 2021 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n        \tEuropean Union (Occupational Pension Schemes )  Regulations 2021 (S.I.

Revenue has outlined a number of measures, dealing with, among other things, VAT returns and tax clearance certs, as well as detailing advice aimed at assisting SMEs who may be experiencing cashflow and trading difficulties as a result of the impact of COVID-19. Similarly, the Central Bank of Ireland has outlined the impact the measures announced by the European Central Bank yesterday should have on those businesses and households who may be experiencing disruption as a result of the spread of the virus. The Bank will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that the financial system has the ability to respond to the needs of businesses and citizens during this time. For its part, the Department of Finance has, in the absence of the availability of timely information on the real economy, undertaken to monitor daily financial market data to assess the expected development on the broader economy. This covers financial market indicators such as the main equity markets, selected sovereign bond yields, exchange rates and oil prices along with key leading economic indicators such as purchasing managers indices (PMIs), retail sales, car sales and aggregate tax receipts. Minister Donohoe said: 'I welcome the statements by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners this morning outlining the measures that are being introduced at a national and international level to ensure that the negative impact of the fall-out from this disease are minimised. Acknowledging people's concerns is the first step in assuaging them. People should be reassured that Ireland is coming at this from a position of strength and that everything that can be done is being done to deal with this public health crisis. We can, and we will, get through this. 'It is true to say that both the societal and economic response to the COVID 19 outbreak is evolving rapidly. However, this is not reflected in the available economic data. Data on economic developments is published with a lag which can extend to be weeks or months depending on the indicator. With this in mind, my Department will be publishing a chartpack of a range of financial market data each month on the Department's website for the foreseeable future. This will ensure that we have access to the most timely information possible, allowing us to make the most informed and best decisions for all of our people.'

There were 2,350,600 people employed in Ireland in the fourth quarter last year after adjusting for seasonal factors, with a seasonally adjusted employment rate of 4.7 per cent, in line with the average seen over the period 2000-2007. Welcoming the figures, the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, Paschal Donohoe T.D., said: \"Despite a challenging year in 2019 due to Brexit uncertainty and a slowdown in international markets, I am very pleased to see today's figures which show the continued strength in our labour market.

The number of people at work reached another all-time high, with 2,350,600 people in employment in the fourth quarter last year. \"Employment growth remains broad-based, with annual gains recorded in 13 out of 14 economic sectors and all 8 regions in Ireland. I am particularly pleased to see a continued decline in the unemployment rate which now stands at a level last seen before the economic crash. Separate CSO figures published last week showed total goods exports of 152 billion in 2019, the highest year on record, with exports from our food and beverage sector up 6.5 per cent over the year. Overall these data provide further proof that recent economic policies have paid dividends for households and firms throughout the country. \"Ireland has faced and continues to face a highly uncertain macroeconomic situation with clear risks to our future economic growth, not least due to ongoing uncertainty associated with the future trading relationship with the UK. However we will face these challenges from a position of strength.\" Ends Note to Editors: On a seasonally adjusted basis, employment increased by 1.3 per cent (+30,500) between the third and fourth quarters in 2019, with a seasonally adjusted level of 2,350,600 in the fourth quarter. The average level of employment in 2019 (2,322,500) is calculated as the average unadjusted level across the four quarters. The largest sectoral employment increase in the fourth quarter (in annual terms) was in the ICT sector (+10.7 per cent or +12,300), with wholesale\/retail the only sector down (-0.5 per cent or -1,700). The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019, while the unadjusted unemployment rate was 4.5 per cent.

Cases by county The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has today been informed that 9 people with COVID-19 have died. There has now been a total of 1,763 COVID-19 related deaths in Ireland. As of midnight Wednesday 22 July, the HPSC has been notified of 7 confirmed cases of COVID-19. There is now a total of 25,826 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ireland. The HSE is working to identify any contacts the patients may have had to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread. Dr. Ronan Glynn, Acting Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health, said: \"Two weeks ago, we expressed our concerns about worrying trends in the progression of COVID-19 in Ireland. Collectively, people in Ireland responded to this call for action and together have broken chains of transmission. This is a further demonstration of the power of people working together and rising to the continued challenge of this unprecedented pandemic. What we need now is to hold firm and keep up the good work. \"I believe we can maintain the important progress we have made together, but only if we continue to heed the public health advice - physical distance of 2 metres between one another, frequent hand washing, wearing a face covering where appropriate and cough\/sneeze hygiene.\" Professor Philip Nolan, Chair of the NPHET Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, said: \"That the R value has decreased is welcome news. However, it is tempered by the fact that this novel virus is still with us, and it only needs our complacency to spread widely once again as it wants to do. This is a long game. As we head into the weekend and beyond, we must continue to remain vigilant in order to keep this progress up.\" Dr. Colm Henry, Chief Clinical Officer, HSE, said: \"The resumption of non-COVID-19 healthcare services is, and always will be, a top priority. The greatest enabler of this will be our ability to keep community transmission at a low level. We can all play our part in ensuring our hospitals and care settings resume their vital work by following public health advice.

Hence, in March 2020 national authorities and many local authorities strongly recommended use of home office when possible to reduce COVID-19 infection. Public and private companies largely followed the recommendations. A survey conducted in the last three weeks of April 2020 measured the use of home office and the use of digital solutions in Norway during the first months of COVID-19 pandemic. The survey included 1000 people of which 670 were employed. The survey weighted age and geography to correct biases.\r\rApproximately 80% of Norwegian employees have had their work situation significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Employers\u2019 instructions to employees to work from home are the most common. 52 per cent of the employees reported that they were instructed to work from home. Just over a quarter have been given other work tasks, 20 per cent have had their working hours increased and just as many have had their working hours reduced.\r\rDuring the second wave of COVID-19 in the autumn of 2020, the use of home office again became common after national authorities and many local authorities again strongly recommended it.  About half of the respondents worked from home offices in April 2020. The majority state that this mostly applies all week. A good number shared a home office with a spouse\/cohabitant or other adults.\r\r* Most people worked from a room where they sat alone, but only 38% had an adapted home office. A minority shared work space with others in the household.\r* 30% of those who worked from home have children in primary school age at home, and the majority of these supervised the children and assisted with the school work. Women took greater responsibility than men, even when both parents worked from home.\r* Almost half of the respondents answer that they have worked away from home four days or more a week, while 11% have worked from home two to three days a week. Of those who responded in the survey, 38% state that they have not worked from home office.

More specifically, until September 2020, only 11 collective labour agreements had been concluded. The vast majority of them (10 out of 11) do not include clauses relating to the pandemic. Only the occupational \/ local collective agreement of the tour guides in Crete and Santorini includes a condition that provides for the suspension of the agreement due to cases of \u201cforce majeure\u2019, including pandemic. On 9 July 2020, an occupational collective agreement was signed covering the tour guides working for the tourist offices of Crete and Santorini. The collective agreement was signed between the \"Association of Tourist and Travel Agencies of Crete\" and the \"Trade Union of Professional Guides of Crete and Santorini\".

This sets out the cases of \u201cforce majeure\u201d for which the collective agreement is suspended. Among the cases of force majeure is the pandemic. As long as the pandemic exists and there is low or no turnover of the companies, the implementation of the agreement is suspended.

Countries\u2019 borders were closed, which strongly affected the freight transport. It also had an enormous impact on tourism resulting in almost zero income for passenger transport companies. In Estonia, one of the largest passenger transport company is Tallink Group that operates in passenger water transport sector in Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Latvia. Tallink as well as freight road transport companies made use of the wage subsidy provided by the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund, but as the measure was temporary and the difficulties in the sector remain, additional auxiliary measures were needed to keep the business running and retain employment. \r\rTo keep the businesses afloat and retain employment, changes to collective agreements in the transport sector were made. There are two sector-level collective agreements concluded in the road transport sector \u2013 one for passenger transport and the other for freight transport, and there are several collective agreements concluded in water transport between Tallink Group and its subsidiaries and seamen's union.   In road transport sector, regarding passenger transport, on 13 January 2020, a new collective agreement for 2020-2023 was signed, which should have increased the wage of bus drivers as of April 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, it was agreed in April that the wage increase would be postponed until June 2020. Regarding freight transport, a collective agreement was signed in 2019 for 2019-2022, according to which the wage of truck drivers should have increased in May 2020. It was agreed, however, that the wage increase would be postponed by a year. \r\rIn passenger water transport, similar measures were used in Tallink Group by its subsidiaries. In case of service personnel the wage increase was postponed to 2022, but in case of technical personnel the postponement agreement was not reached. Additional changes included different aspects of different agreements. For example, it was agreed that shortening the work days length, changing the calculation periods for banked working time, paying hourly wage instead of daily wages, guaranteeing a gross monthly wage, and making sure the work time is divided as equally as possible. \r\rHowever, additional negotiations are on their way, as the condition for freezing the wage increase was that there would be no redundancies, and if redundancies would take place, the consent to postpone the wage agreement will become null and void. Tallink has now announced the dismissals of more than 1,000 employees, which is enormous number in Estonian context.  The collective agreements of Tallink Group and its subsidiaries cover more than 1,000 employees. \rIn road transport sector, the numbe rof employees was around 22,000 in 2019.

It supplies water and water recycling services to almost seven million people in the East of England and Hartlepool.\r\rIt describes itself as a purpose-led organisation and it was the first major utility in the UK to change its company constitution \u2013 the Articles of Association \u2013 to lock public interest into the way it runs its business, both now and for future generations. The organisation states that it works to bring environmental and social prosperity to the region it serves.\r\rAs a supplier of an essential service, the organisation's stated priorities throughout the pandemic were to keep water flowing to customers, to protect and support its employees and wider supply chain, and to offer help and advice to customers who found themselves facing challenges of all types.\r\rThe organisation also wanted to support its communities through the pandemic: it states that it is firmly embedded in those communities: the vast majority of its 5,000 employees live in the region, as do many of their friends and families. The organisation identified that in many cases, charities and small community organisations were running short of funds and practical help at the very time they were most needed them.\r\rThus, as part of its stated purpose is to bring environmental and social prosperity to its region of operation, the organisation wished to restore a sense of wellbeing and security among these communities, whether through practical support or support for emotional wellbeing. As such, it sought to support projects that are having a positive impact on people and the communities in which it operates, allowing them to provide help and connecting people with the practical and essential support they need. \r\rAnglian Water also identified that its many connections through Business in the Community (the business-community outreach charity set up by the Prince of Wales to promote responsible business and corporate social responsibility) and in its supply chain could offer vital support and services, and that the organisation had the skills and experience to help facilitate that support. To further these goals, Anglian Water brought forward the launch of its planned GBP 1 million Anglian Water Positive Difference Fund. The organisation states that it has always supported communities overseas through its  fundraising for the charity WaterAid, but that it was keen to do more in its own region, and had planned to launch the fund as part of a new social contract with its customers. The organisation's Board took the decision to bring the launch of the fund forward in response to the COVID-19 emergency. Thus, the fund has focused on those who are considered high risk (including people with pre-existing medical conditions and people over 60) or who find themselves in vulnerable circumstances as a result of the continuing threat of coronavirus.\r\rAs part of this, Anglian Water began by fast-tracking over GBP 50,000 of the cash to front-line organisations in the immediate response to battle the pandemic. It then worked with UK Community Foundations, a charity it has partnered with in the past, to establish a framework and criteria for the fund. The remaining half of the Positive Difference Fund is to be released later in the year to meet emerging needs from the fallout from the pandemic. Eligible organisations have been able to apply to their local Community Foundation for grants of up to GBP 5,000.\r\rThe first application for the Anglian Water Positive Difference Fund was received just hours after it launched and Anglian Water has now funded upwards of 60 groups across its region. The fund has already supported a wide range of organisations, each providing a vital service for those most in need in their community - from those providing hot meals for people sleeping rough, and groups combatting coronavirus fraud, to those adapting services for autistic children, and vulnerable adults, including telephone befriending for people with dementia and providing devices for adults with learning difficulties to reduce isolation.\r\rAnglian Water has also been instrumental, through its regional leadership of Business in the Community (BITC), in setting up the National Business Response Network, a virtual notice board that promoted a brokerage service between BITC members and organisations in the community that needed help. Since then, more than 750 businesses have joined up to the National Business Response Network, including Marks and Spencer, Boots and Lloyds as well as smaller businesses. The Network has received more than 2,300 requests for help from community groups, local authorities, schools, charities and alliances, and has been able to match nearly 2,000 of those with businesses to provide resources such as food, social care, technology and logistical support.\r\rMoreover, additional support offered to customers has included financial advice, payment holidays, instalment plans, the use of income maximisation tools to signpost additional help, and the promotion and extension of its priority services register.\r\rIn terms of its own employees, Anglian Water took the decision early on not to furlough anyone; however, it recognised that employees might still face financial difficulties and thus, it set up an independently funded Employee Assistance Fund. It also extended support to its  wider supply chain, including reducing the time taken to make payments, releasing more than GBP 5 million in March alone, helping to support and advise many small and medium-size suppliers with access to advanced procurement opportunities and supporting staff within some supply chain companies whose pay was reduced by their employer.

Businesses eligible are those active in the following sectors: tourism, catering, entertainment, gambling, film industry, live performance, event organiser and sports\u202factivities and passenger land transport services (taxi services).\u202fSelf-employed and\u202fmicrocompanies\u202fpaying the KATA flat tax for small entrepreneurs will be exempt from the tax in the period of March to June 2020. The KATA tax includes social insurance tax, and the entrepreneurs choosing to get this assistance can still stay insured. In addition, a freeze will be applied to any KATA arrears accumulated before 1 March 2020 until the end of the 'state of emergency' announced by the government on 11 March. 82,000 KATA-registered businesses paying HUF 25,000, 50,000 or 75,000 per month (depending on what category they are in) may be recipients of the tax relief. A rough cost estimate: HUF 12 billion in total if most entrepreneurs take advantage of the measure. This is an automatic measure, so the 81,000 KATA registered entrepreneurs will be exempt from the tax for the designated months. After the circle of sectors was extended, the relief affects about 120,000 solo entrepreneurs in 2021. The only alternative is to suspend business activities even beyond the period of the tax relief, as when suspended, no taxes are due. The Music Hungary Association, an umbrella organisation for the music sector, lobbied the Finance Ministry for re-introducing KATA relief in November 2020, as lockdowns deeply affected the music sector. In its answer in January 2021 the Finance Ministry suggested that musicians suspend their business activities for the time when no concerts can be held. KATA is generally chosen by small entrepreneurs or freelancers (40% of KATA-registered businesses earned below HUF 4 million or \u20ac11,000 a year from their activities in 2019) so their representation in social dialogue is especially weak.","767":"Employers organisations FAQs on COVID-19 Against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, many employer and business organisations compiled information leaflets, guidelines and FAQs to help their members to keep up with the amount of new information released during the first half of 2020 (e.g. regards newly available help measures) and make them aware of what is available regards company support, but also what needs to be observed by companies in a time of a pandemic. The Confederation of German Confederation of Skilled Crafts (ZDH) published FAQs - especially designed for crafts businesses. Whilst the information is put together for the needs of the crafts sector, information might also be interesting for companies from other sectors. It is available online (for free). The ZDH's FAQ site gives advice on topics, such as public and financial support measures, legal amendments to existing short-time working rules, social security issues and tax deductions or deferrals for self-employed persons and occupational health and safety issues. In addition, the ZDH published FAQs on how to deal with vocational training and trainees' examinations that usually conclude the training but might now be deferred to COVID-19.\r\rThe Confederation of German Employer Organisations (BDA) published FAQs on current short-time working rules. Short-time working rules were eased right at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak to help companies stay afloat during a time of low demand.

The BDA's guideline provides an overview on companies' rights and obligations when sending their workers on short-time work. In addition, the BDA published guidelines on legal labour issues that might occur during a pandemic. They provide an overview on companies' rights and obligations during a pandemic - especially in the field of employment and labour relations. Topics covered by the guideline are: \r\r* legal definition on infection and suspecting an infection plus information and notification obligations\r* information on infection protection law information and on Federal Government's social protection package \r* rules for home-office and short-time working arrangements \r* information on the COVID-19 app employees returning from holidays.\r\r No information available. The FAQs and guidelines are designed and implemented by the employer organisations themselves. Providing this kind of material is part of the organisations' member services.

The measure was determined by the need to ensure a safe transition back to work after the end of the state of emergency,  for protecting workers health and keeping business profitable. Against this background, the social partners decided to conclude a protocol that will enforce some of the best practices from Italy in Romanian companies. The content of the protocol is not public. It might be gradually disclosed, but there is no calendar in this regard up to date.\r\rFrom the media and from the interviews with trade union representative carried on for this study, it appears that the measure is targeting the employees of the companies affiliated to Confederatia Nationala a Sindicatelor Cartel Alfa and Confindustria Romania. It basically offers to the employees (and to their family members) a special private health care insurance that may be used for accessing private health care services in case of an infection with COVID-19 (and the families of the employees).

The extraordinary plan of wage increases for \u20ac2 million was conceived as a special recognition for the work commitment of the 700 employees working in the five plants in Italy, who guaranteed continuity in food supplies during the pandemic emergency. The extraordinary plan of investment of the company, amounting to \u20ac2 million, was allocated to the 700 employees working in the five establishments in Italy. The extraordinary plan was applied starting from the 9 March 2020 and covered also the month of April 2020. It provided for a 25% wage increase for each day worked by each employee and an extraordinary monthly ticket of \u20ac400 covering the babysitting costs. Furthermore, the company has activated an insurance policy in favor of the whole personnel, including the workers in smart working, in the event of contagion from COVID-19, to supplement the health and safety measures already implemented, as according to the national legislation.

Companies whose business has been suspended by a public authority and companies which are significantly affected by the emergency measures to deal with COVID-19, on the basis of principal or secondary activity, are required, not to make staff reductions by termination of employment contracts, for as long as the measures to deal with COVID-19 are in place.\r\rIf they are made, such complaints shall be void. Termination of employment contracts made from 18 March 2020 onwards are void. Furthermore, after the expiry of the time of suspension of their staff's employment contracts, companies are required to maintain the same number of jobs, for a period equal to that of suspension (i.e. 45 days). This means they have to employ the same number of workers and on the same terms of employment as on 21 March 2020. The concept of the same number of jobs does not include voluntarily leavers, retiring on retirement, and fixed-term workers whose employment contract expires after the expiry of the suspension.  \r\rThe job retention clause and the invalidity of any employment contracts also apply to companies which agree to workers whose contracts of employment are suspended from the provision of teleworking work to meet their temporary needs.

The virus continues to be a major global threat. EU citizens and health systems remain under pressure, with emerging variants triggering new cases. At the same time, there is reason to look forward to a substantial reduction in the prevalence of the virus, raising the prospect of a lifting of the restrictions weighing on citizens and the economy alike. This Communication charts the way ahead for a balanced policy and common EU approach, pointing to what we need to do to advance the time when we can recover our European way of life, but to do so in a safe and sustainable way with control over the virus. Controlling the COVID-19 pandemic has required an unprecedented range of restrictions. Those restrictions continue to come at a high and ever-increasing cost for individuals, families, communities and businesses. With the risk of emerging variants, some Member States have extended or imposed new restrictions, causing disruption to citizens and supply chains. The conditions must be created across the Single Market to allow for safe and coordinated re-opening, so that citizens can enjoy their rights in full and so that economic and social activity can return. This will give us the foundation of strong public health on which we can launch the recovery which citizens and businesses so sorely need. EU citizens have good reason to expect the situation to improve: above all, thanks to vaccination. Vaccination is our principal means to combat the virus, and already, there is clear evidence that those population groups who have been vaccinated have significant levels of protection from the disease. The investment in vaccine development and production made by the EU and the Member States in 2020, and the steps now under way to boost production and supply of the vaccines to the EU, are paying off: all Member States will now see increase in vaccine supply, with 300 million doses of the currently authorised vaccines expected in the second quarter of 2021. Swift and effective deployment of these vaccines by Member States will be a key driver in bringing down the number of new cases, and thus determining when and how restrictions can be lifted. At the same time, hygiene and physical distancing will remain essential measures to control the virus until high levels of vaccination coverage are achieved. In lifting restrictions, we must learn the lessons of 2020, and avoid the extra costs of stop-start restrictions. All the steps to re-opening need to be sustainable, to command the confidence of citizens and provide a solid basis for recovery. One key step is the HERA Incubator, which specifically targets the risk that variants will bring a resurgence in the virus and limit the impact of vaccines 1 . This Communication invites Member States to adopt a coordinated approach to safe re-opening and sets out steps and tools to take to achieve that common goal. Each step towards re-opening will be more effective and more convincing if taken as part of an EU-wide approach to safe and sustainable re-opening, one which promotes the goal of lifting restrictions within a common set of measures grounded in a clear understanding of how to ensure, and maintain, an effective suppression of the virus. Reopening will take longer, cost more, and be less sustainable if the Member States do not work together; moreover reopening in a coordinated manner ensures the continuity of the internal market which is inextricably linked to the economic and social life of Europeans as well as those who interact with them be that from a trade and economic dimension or through mobility Our interdependence means that, so long as some Member States apply restrictions, there will be limitations as to how far other Member States can successfully reopen. Our work inside the EU needs to progress in step with global progress. The EU's commitment to openness will drive its approach to gradually re-build open societies and economies. Only a global approach can bring a solution to this global challenge and common global solutions are the best way to ensure a sustainable recovery. 2 WORKING TOGETHER TOWARDS RE-OPENING The epidemiological situation varies across the EU and within Member States, as do the measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. But one of the lessons we have learned so far is that our interdependence means that imposing restrictions in one part of the EU has implications for all. We can expect the same to be true when it comes to loosening these restrictions. This calls for a common approach to guide action across the EU. The various restrictions applied by governments in Member States to movement and travel, to meeting friends and family, to schools and universities, shops, cultural venues, restaurants and bars have played a critical part in controlling the virus. Choices about the timing and the mix of such restrictions have both reacted to and had an impact on the prevalence of the virus. The experience of the last year has shown the advantages of managing the situation proactively, rather than reacting to a situation that is spiralling out of control. The same will be true as we gradually assess the impact that vaccination has on cutting transmission chains and reducing infections. Evidence-based decision-making, based on robust epidemiological indicators will be key to opening at the right time with the virus sufficiently under control to allow for relaxation, and to avoid restrictions lasting longer than necessary. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is today setting out a framework to help Member States to take such decisions. The approach would define tiers reflecting the epidemiological situation in each Member State. It would allow simulations illustrating how much latitude each Member State has to lighten response measures without risking a reversal in the spread of the virus. Clear indicative epidemiological thresholds will help coordination, predictability and transparency. A clearer scientific basis 2 will help to understand and manage the connection between the lifting of measures and the impact on COVID-19 incidence and mortality as vaccination accelerates. An interactive digital tool developed by ECDC will be operational in April for use by Member States 3 . Different Member States will continue to make different choices about which restrictions to apply and to lift at different times: the framework will help Member States prioritise in these choices by providing a common understanding of the likely impact. Relying on a common basis of an agreed framework will also help the process to progress on a basis of mutual confidence between Member States. Otherwise Member States' caution about the possible impact of the situation in other Member States will act as a brake on re-opening. The Commission invites Member States to endorse this approach and to follow up swiftly. A common framework can also help to give citizens confidence in the decisions taken, critically important as compliance is weakened by pandemic fatigue or by complacency as vaccination rolls out. It is also critical to work together to provide objective information and to counter the flood of disinformation holding back effective vaccination campaigns. 3 SAFE RE-OPENING Returning safely to free movement For EU citizens an important part of the lifting of restrictions will be to again exercise unrestricted free movement and other fundamental rights throughout the EU. With a sufficient improvement of the epidemiological situation, a coordinated approach to free movement will give the reassurance that re-opening is not outpacing control of the virus. Citizens must also be able to exercise their rights with full non-discrimination. The Commission is adopting a legislative proposal establishing a common framework for a Digital Green Certificate covering vaccination, testing and recovery. This will put in place an EU level approach to issuing, verifying and accepting such certificates, to help holders to exercise their right to free movement within the EU, as well as making it easier to wind down COVID-19 restrictions put in place in compliance with EU law. It will allow every EU citizen and their family members, to receive a secure and interoperable certificate. All Member States would accept the certificate as sufficient proof where relevant in order to waive free movement restrictions such as quarantine or testing requirements put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19. It is important to stress that people without such a certificate must still be able to travel and that being in possession of a certificate is not a prerequisite of exercising the right to free movement or other fundamental rights. It is important to have trust in the certificates to allow for their acceptance. The certificates could be used to ascertain whether or not people can travel without being subject to temporary limitations which might be in place to reduce the spread of the virus, such as testing on arrival and quarantine. The package will also cover third country citizens legally staying or legally residing in the EU. The proposal put forward today is a flexible and simple instrument, to be available in both digital and paper form. It will allow the authorities in one Member State to undertake, if needed, a quick, secure and straightforward check of the certificate issued in another Member State. It would use only the minimum amount of data necessary (for example the date of vaccination and which vaccine was administered or the date of a COVID-19 test). To be ready for an increase in travel over the summer, the proposal needs swift consideration and adoption by the European Parliament and the Council. For the immediate future, the Commission will also consider whether it should propose changes to the Recommendation on a coordinated approach to restrictions on free movement 4 . In any event, all the exemptions for essential travel, such as those recommended for seasonal, transport or frontier workers, should continue to apply. The \"Green Lanes\" principles for freight transport must also continue to be applied in full in any circumstances when internal border controls are temporarily reintroduced as a measure of last resort. Implementation of the Digital Green Certificate legislation also needs a compatible technical framework to be defined at EU level and put in place by Member States. This should ensure inter-operability, as well as full compliance with personal data protection. The goal should be to have this work complete and the system in place by the middle of June. The technical framework will factor in global efforts to ease travel restrictions: interoperability with systems being developed through the World Health Organization (WHO) should be taken into account from the start. It will also allow for the possibility to extend to compatible certificates issued in third countries. The proposal on the Digital Green Certificate is flexible enough to be able to take into account new scientific evidence and guidance as we learn more about the effect of vaccination, the implications of new variants and to what extent people that have recovered from an infection are protected. The Commission is also adopting a 'twin' proposal to address the issuance of the Digital Green Certificate to third country nationals legally staying or residing in Member States and who are entitled to travel within the EU 5 . If such a third country national is in possession of a certificate which is a sufficiently reliable proof of vaccination, or has been issued under a system that is interoperable with the Digital Green Certificate trust framework, this would facilitate travel within the EU. An important part of re-opening will be to allow the safe travel of third country nationals to the EU. Tourism and other travel from outside the EU are an important feature of the EU's openness and should target the same goal of safe opening as other activities. A framework is already in place with the Recommendation identifying countries whose epidemiological situation is such that non-essential travel to the EU is possible 6 . The Council should remain attentive to the evolution of the situation in countries outside the EU, and particularly where reduced incidence of COVID-19 can be seen to have been driven down on a sustainable basis, for example by widespread vaccination with vaccines of demonstrated efficacy. Another important factor would be a low level of variants of concern in a third country. For the immediate future, the Commission will keep the operation of the Recommendation under close review, and propose amendments in line with developments in this area. This could include amendments to align the Recommendation to the Digital Green Certificate and initiatives taken on a global basis by WHO or the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which could in due course facilitate adaptation of restrictions where travellers from third countries are in a position to present certificates attesting to a relevant COVID-19 status issued under a system deemed sufficiently reliable or interoperable with the Digital Green Certificate, once available in EU Member States. In parallel, the Commission is working closely with international organisations including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 7 , the UN World Tourism Organisation 8 and the G20 Tourism Working Group on the restart and recovery of world tourism in a sustainable manner. The use of the Digital Green Certificate should be accompanied by clear and transparent communication to citizens to explain its scope, use, clarify the safeguards to personal data protection and reassure citizens that this is a tool to help in enjoying free movement rights to the full. The guidance on testing and quarantine applied to travellers 9 will be updated, to promote a more harmonised and predictable approach to border measures that is more easily understood by travelers and transport service providers. Testing and tracing as tools to help opening Successful vaccination alone will not eradicate the virus. There will still be a need to monitor and respond to the epidemiological situation, so testing and contact tracing will continue to be vital tools. This will be particularly important in the phase of re-opening, to provide reassurance that any resurgence will quickly be identified. The EU has published guidance documents to support the development and implementation of testing strategies across the EU and recommendations to support a common approach to the use, validation and mutual recognition of different tests 10 . There are regular discussions amongst Member States in the Health Security Committee on testing strategies and new tests entering the market. The Health Security Committee has also agreed a common list of rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 diagnosis as well as a selection of rapid antigen tests for which Member States will mutually recognize their results 11 . In addition, the Commission is now providing 20 million rapid antigen tests to the Member States 12 . The accuracy and the availability of rapid antigen tests continues to improve, and they are increasingly being used and are useful in the context of facilitating services and safe travelling. Self-tests for COVID-19 (both self-swabbing and self-testing kits) are now starting to enter the market. The Commission and ECDC are reviewing these. ECDC will publish today technical guidance on COVID-19 self-tests, including details on, for example, their availability and possible impacts on the implementation of prevention and control measures, their clinical performance compared to the \"gold standard\" RT-PCR tests, their implications for reporting and epidemiological surveillance, and the settings for their appropriate use. Through the Health Security Committee, the Commission is monitoring if and how countries are using or considering the use of rapid antigen self-tests. One important use of testing is to track the virus and its variants in wastewater. This can provide rapid and inexpensive information on the presence of a virus and therefore on a possible resurgence: monitoring just 6000 collection points allows the wastewaters of 70% of the EU population be tracked. Wastewater surveillance can be used for preventive or early warning purposes, as virus detection in wastewater is a sign of the possible re-emergence of the virus. Similarly, the absence of the virus in wastewater could indicate that a given population zone can be considered at lower risk, and that measures put in place to curb virus transmission have worked. It is therefore critical that Member States put in place effective wastewater surveillance systems ensuring that relevant data are promptly provided to competent health authorities. The Commission is today adopting a Recommendation to support a consistent approach to the use of wastewater monitoring to track COVID-19 and its variants 13 . The Recommendation is based on the knowledge and experience of Member States and includes specific guidance regarding the design and management of a wastewater surveillance network for the rapid transmission of data to health authorities. It will promote the use of common methods for sampling, testing and data analysis, supported by a European exchange platform. Financial support will be made available to support deployment of a coherent wastewater monitoring and surveillance strategies and activities across the EU, and to strengthen Member States' and partner countries' capacities in the long term. Testing by itself does not control infectious diseases. It must be followed up and used effectively. Tracing has a key role in assisting towards safe opening as the overall situation improves, when the effective containment of more isolated outbreaks becomes particularly valuable. By complementing traditional manual contact tracing, mobile contact tracing applications can help to break transmission chains and help save lives. In view of the increased transmissibility of variants, it is important that the parameters employed in the apps are reviewed and where necessary adjusted, in coordination with ECDC and national authorities. The Commission will support Member States to consider additional features to strengthen contact tracing applications and encourage their uptake and use. These additional features could for example include a dashboard displaying the latest information on the public health situation and on the rollout of vaccination campaigns, or notifying users of their past presence at an event or a venue where confirmed COVID-19 cases have been identified. Member States also collect data from cross-border travellers entering their territory via national Passenger Locator Forms ('PLF'). Data exchange between Member States' contact tracing authorities can be particularly important when travellers are crossing borders in close proximity, such as in airplanes or trains. The Commission has developed a platform that enables the exchange of data between the PLF systems of the Member States. In order for Member States to exchange relevant passengers' data through the exchange platform, the Commission will publish draft measures to ensure that by the time of the summer travelling season, lawful processing of personal data is set under an EU legal basis 14 . This will lay down the limited and well-defined data sets to be exchanged and the roles and responsibilities of the different users. For those Member States where there is no digital PLF system in place, the EU Healthy Gateways Joint Action has developed an EU digital PLF platform as a single point of entry and cloud-hosting services allowing the storage of the collected PLF. The two platforms PLF exchange platform and EU digital PLF platform are complementary and interconnected projects. These tools will allow faster and more effective contact tracing of cross-border passengers. Continuing to manage the virus: therapeutics and medical equipment As therapeutic treatment has developed, it has helped to save lives, speed up recovery time, and reduce the length of hospitalisation to the benefit of both patients, and hard-pressed health care systems. The Commission is using a number of instruments, including joint procurement, to secure access for Member States to the limited number of therapeutic treatments currently in use to treat COVID-19 cases, as well as research programmes. More and faster action is needed. A common EU strategy on therapeutics is planned for mid-April. Similar to the approach used successfully with vaccines, this will seek to speed up research and manufacturing, so that Member States can have access to valuable treatments on the scale and at the speed required. More flexible regulatory measures for therapeutics, such as labelling facilitations, will be deployed to enable rapid supply at large scale during the pandemic. Technology can also be used in other ways. Ultraviolet disinfecting robots can disinfect a standard size patient room in as quickly as 10 minutes by using ultraviolet light, and disinfect over 18 rooms in one charge. They can help ensure a sterile environment in hospitals without exposing staff to unnecessary risk. A 12 million programme is under way purchasing at least 200 robots and deploying them in Member States with actual delivery of robots throughout 2021. Helping the most affected sectors to prepare for safe re-opening Some of Europe's most dynamic sectors tourism, culture, and transport have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic. The more that can be done to help these sectors to re-open safely, for workers 15 and for the public, and in a way which builds trust and confidence, the quicker these sectors in which many businesses are in great jeopardy and on which many jobs rely can start to recover. Europe's tourism ecosystem has been heavily disrupted. In 12 Member States, tourism generates between 25% and 10% of national GDP, while four EU Member States featured among the world's top- ten tourism destinations in 2019 in terms of international arrivals and receipts. With a drop of 70% in revenues during 2020 and up to 11 million jobs at risk 16 , tourism services are at the bottom of the business confidence indicator. EU overnight stays fell by 52% in 2020 and international tourist stays fell by 68% in 2020 17 . Some Member State economies are also highly dependent on international tourism and unable to compensate for the loss of foreign travellers with domestic tourism. Reopening travel and tourism safely will bring millions of Europeans back to their jobs, and can drive recovery faster in many EU regions 18 . Restoring travel in a safe and predictable manner requires restoring the confidence of consumers that their health and rights are protected. The downloadable application Re-open EU will continue to provide reliable information to citizens about the epidemiological situation and rules in place across the EU (including the Digital Green Certificates) with improved new, user-friendly \"travel path\" functionalities 19 . A clear, EU-wide system to give people full confidence in public health standards can be a real step forward in ensuring clarity to travellers while also dispelling remaining concerns and opening the door for the coming summer season. In 2020, the Commission provided valuable guidance to the transport 20 and hospitality sectors to help it to minimise risks 21 . The Commission has also invited the European Committee for Standardisation to prepare a standardisation document as a basis for health and safety protocols for the hospitality sector, which will be available before summer. This voluntary tool will help better inform and prepare tourism businesses to welcome people in full safety. The Commission will work with Member States and the industry to ensure the successful rollout of this 'EU tourism health seal'. The Commission, Member States and the industry should further cooperate on communication campaigns aiming at re-building confidence in safe travelling in Europe among Europeans but also travellers from third countries. The third step to help the tourism sector to prepare for a safe opening is to continue supporting businesses on the ground, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro-enterprises, to maintain COVID-safe services and adapt the tourism product to the new reality. Member States can mobilise support and investments for most affected sectors and regions under the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative 22 and REACT EU, while the Recovery and Resilience Facility and cohesion policy funds will contribute to the sustainable recovery of the most affected sectors. The European Regional Development Fund 2021-2027 includes a specific objective aiming to support economic development and social inclusion in culture and tourism. The Commission will make available a Guide to EU funding to help tourism stakeholders identify the most relevant sources of EU funding for their projects and investments. Sharing once again the collective experience of cultural venues and events, heritage sites and cultural tourism will be one of the most visible signs of re-opening. It will also be essential for the survival of a cultural and creative economy that has been particularly badly affected by the restrictions imposed to control the pandemic. This sector lost around 31% of its revenues in 2020, with performing arts (a drop of 90%) and music (a drop of 76%) being the most impacted 23 . Again, a common approach and common indicators will help decisions to lift restrictions by building confidence amongst audiences and visitors that opening is taking place in a responsible way. The Commission will use existing cooperation structures and networks 24 to exchange information on the safe re-opening of the cultural sector. In order to better coordinate Member States' measures for the safe resumption of activities in the cultural and creative sector, the Commission will develop guidelines for sectors in the field of music (festivals, venues), audiovisual (film festivals and markets, cinemas, production sets), performing arts (festivals, venues), exhibition spaces such as museums or galleries, libraries, and cultural heritage sites. Cultural tourism boosts growth and creates jobs, with four in ten tourists choosing their destination on the basis of the cultural offer. The Commission will launch a dedicated EU social media campaign on sustainable cultural tourism, aimed at promoting EU cultural heritage sites and cultural routes, as well as cultural events and festivals. New initiatives will be backed up when conditions allow through Erasmus+ and its DiscoverEU action to promote the discovery by young people of Europe's cultural heritage by rail, during and beyond the European Year of Rail. Building global resilience against COVID-19 A sustainable path out of COVID-19 inside the EU depends on progress at global level. No country or region in the world will be safe from COVID-19 unless it is contained at global level, and only a global approach can bring a solution to a global crisis. For as long as the virus is circulated, the human cost will continue: the toll on the world has already reached almost 120 million confirmed cases and over 2.6 million deaths reported worldwide. Continued circulation also means continued risk of resurgence and of new variants emerging with the potential to breach the defences created by vaccines. The EU has both a responsibility and an interest to fulfil its commitment to tackle COVID-19 worldwide. The EU is at the forefront of the international response. It has provided concrete financial, emergency and in kind support to international partners and countries around the world. So far this \"Team Europe\" approach\" 25 has contributed a total of over 40 billion for international support in the fight against COVID-19. As inside the EU, a sustainable approach means vaccination. That is why the EU has strongly supported the work of COVAX in rolling out vaccines worldwide: with more than 2.2 billion financing, the EU and Member States as \"Team Europe\" are among the main supporter of COVAX, the global initiative to ensure equitable access to vaccines, and has urged all partners to join in this work. The COVAX Facility has started rolling out vaccine doses and intends to share vaccines with all low and middle income countries in the first half of 2021. This should be sufficient to vaccinate their entire health workforce and at least 3% of their population, to increase to at least 20% before the end of the year. The Humanitarian Buffer of 100 million doses, with a transparent allocation mechanism, will help ensure inclusive access for vulnerable populations to vaccines. The EU and its Member States are establishing a coordinated European approach to vaccine sharing by setting up an EU Vaccine Sharing Mechanism based on the principles of fairness, gradual build- up, zero waste and a Team Europe approach. The aim is to further support and go beyond existing bilateral initiatives of Member States, and to create and scale up an EU pot fed in an equitable manner by a share of doses from Member States. The mechanism will start and build up gradually as vaccine availabilities improve and quantitative targets are set. Vaccines will preferably be channelled through COVAX, and can also continue to be shared directly with countries, with a particular focus on Western Balkans, neighbourhood and Africa. The EU will also continue to facilitate coordination and logistics, and co-finance the transport of vaccines via the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM). In parallel, the EU and its Member States, as Team Europe, will continue to support preparedness for and the roll out of vaccination strategies at country and regional level ensuring collective action in partnership with regional and global actors, including humanitarian actors. In the longer term, it will be essential to work with partner countries in particular in Africa - to strengthen health systems and manufacturing, including vaccines capacity, diagnostics and therapeutics. Scaling up vaccines production on a global level and their delivery to countries in need requires increased global collaboration between public authorities, vaccine developers and manufacturers to ensure voluntary licensing for the necessary transfer of technological know-how. The EU is supporting such efforts, including in the World Trade Organisation. It will engage with other vaccine-producing countries actions to avoid disruptions of closely integrated supply chains. The EU will also ensure that its transparency and authorisation scheme for exports of COVID-19 vaccines, which provides for a number of exemptions 26 , is applied in a fair and equitable manner. Readiness to react to a resurgence in COVID-19 The key health measures under way vaccination, testing and tracing, and readiness for variants provide a major reassurance that the reversal of progress seen at times over the past year is less likely. However, the experience of loosened restrictions followed by a resurgence in the virus means that an important part of building confidence is the knowledge that if there were to be resurgence such as through a new variant the EU and Member States would be ready to act. The ECDC framework described above will be of particular value in helping to quickly identify any risk of resurgence and to highlight the most appropriate restrictions to apply. In terms of the health response, the Commission continues to support Member States via the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. I-its 24\/7 Emergency Response Coordination Centre can, within hours, facilitate and fund the deployment of emergency medical teams (as in the recent case of the deployment of Romanian, Danish and Belgian doctors and nurses to Slovakia), critical medical equipment, vaccines (where France recently shared doses with Slovakia and Czechia) and personal protective equipment (including from the rescEU medical stockpile). The Emergency Support Instrument allows for the rapid cross-border transfer of patients to ease the pressure on health facilities. Over the longer-term, the EU must also put in place a stronger framework for resilience and preparedness in the eventuality of future pandemics. This is already the objective of the proposals for a European Health Union, as well as the work now under way on the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority. The ongoing revision of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism will also support this work. The European Health Union proposals to strengthen the EU health security framework should be adopted as soon as possible. The Commission will put forward a vision for resilience and preparedness in the \"lessons learned\" communication requested by the members of the European Council. The EU should also reflect on whether the success of other emergency steps taken over the past year, such as the Green Lanes system, should be consolidated in a framework which can be activated in response to any new crisis. The upcoming Schengen Strategy will also offer the opportunity to put in place solid contingency planning and coordination mechanisms for measures in relation to internal and external borders, taking stock of the experience of the crisis and the necessity to limit, to the extent possible, any possible disruption to free circulation and to the functioning of the Single Market. 4 WAY FORWARD The next few months of the COVID-19 pandemic will require decisive action to ensure a sustainable and safe re-opening of our societies and economies. Coordinated action is needed at all levels, to ensure that the steps we take are as effective as possible in driving down the incidence of the virus, supporting citizens and companies, and allowing our societies to return to normal. The Commission invites all EU institutions and Member States to take forward the common effort: stepping up communication efforts is particularly important. The European Council -to call for an agreed approach to a safe re-opening based on a solid scientific framework; -to support further coordination on efforts to contain the pandemic at a global level, based on the Team Europe approach. The European Parliament and the Council -to fast-track discussions and agreement on the proposals for a Digital Green Certificate; -to accelerate discussions and reach an agreement on Health Union legislative proposals before the end of the year. The European Commission -to continue supporting the ramping up of vaccines production and timely delivery of contractual commitments; -to further develop technical solutions at European level to increase interoperability of nationals systems to facilitate travel, data exchange and contact tracing; -to put forward a European strategy on therapeutics. Member States -to ensure the acceleration of vaccination programmes in line with increased supply; -to ensure that temporary restrictions to combat COVID-19 are proportionate and non-discriminatory; -to accelerate the technical implementation work on the Digital Green Certificate in view of the fast-track adoption of the proposal; -to swiftly implement all recommendations and develop the necessary infrastructure to use available tools to fight the pandemic.

In particular, Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 lays down disease-specific rules for the diseases listed in accordance with Article 5(1) thereof (listed diseases), and Article 9 thereof provides how those rules are to be applied to different categories of listed diseases. Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 also provides for the Member States to establish compulsory eradication programmes for the listed diseases referred to in Article 9(1)(b) thereof, and for optional eradication programmes for listed diseases referred to in Article 9(1)(c) thereof, and for the approval of such programmes by the Commission. In addition, it provides for the approval by the Commission of the disease-free status or non-vaccination status of Member States or zones or compartments thereof with regard to certain listed diseases referred to in Article 9(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/429. (2) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018\/1882 (2) defines listed diseases into Categories A to E diseases, and provides that the disease prevention and control rules for listed diseases referred to in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 are to apply to the categories of listed diseases for the listed species and groups of listed species referred to in the table set out in the Annex to that Regulation. This Regulation should lay down rules that concern Category A, Category B or Category C diseases. (3) Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 regards the following as listed diseases: infection with Brucella abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), infection with rabies virus (RABV), enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL), infection with bluetongue virus (serotypes 1-24) (infection with BTV), bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), infectious bovine rinotracheitis\/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR\/IPV), infection with Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV), infestation with Varroa spp., infection with Newcastle disease virus, infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS), infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN), infection with highly polymorphic region deleted infectious salmon anaemia virus (HPR-deleted ISAV), infection with Marteilia refringens, infection with Bonamia exitiosa, infection with Bonamia ostreae, and infection with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV).

(4) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 (3) supplements the rules on eradication programmes and disease-free status for certain listed diseases of terrestrial, aquatic and other animals, as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016\/429. In particular, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 establishes criteria for the granting of disease-free status for Member States or zones or compartments thereof, and the requirements for the approval of eradication programmes for Member States or zones or compartments thereof. (5) Article 85 of Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 provides that the Member States or zones thereof with an approved eradication programme or an approved surveillance programme for category C diseases before the date of application of that Regulation are to be deemed to have an approved eradication programme in accordance with that Regulation for a period of six years from the date of application of that Regulation. Accordingly, this limitation should be indicated in the relevant Annexes to this Regulation. (6) Article 280 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 provides the rules for the maintenance of the existing disease-free status or approved eradication and surveillance programmes of Member States or zones or compartments thereof for certain listed diseases that were approved by Commission acts adopted in accordance with Council Directives 64\/432\/EEC (4), 91\/68\/EEC (5), 92\/65\/EEC (6), 2005\/94\/EC (7), 2006\/88\/EC (8) or 2009\/158\/EC (9). In addition, Articles 84 and 85 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 supplement the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 in that respect by laying down transitional measures concerning existing disease-free statuses, and existing approved eradication and surveillance programmes, with regard to those listed diseases. (7) For the sake of simplification and transparency, this Regulation should replace the lists of existing disease-free Member States, zones and compartments and the existing approved eradication and surveillance programmes set out in the Commission acts adopted pursuant to the Directives referred to in Article 280 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 and in certain Directives referred to in Articles 84 and 85 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 with lists set out in the Annexes to this Regulation. (8) For certain listed diseases, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 lays down rules for the first time for the approval of the disease-free status for Member States or zones or compartments thereof and therefore the provisions of Article 280 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 do not apply to such situations. This is the case for infection with rabies virus (RABV), infection with bluetongue virus (serotypes 1-24) (infection with BTV), bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) or infection with Bonamia exitiosa. Several Member States have submitted to the Commission applications to have disease-free status granted for those listed diseases. Following the assessment by the Commission, those applications have been shown to comply with the criteria of Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 4 of Part II of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 that lay down rules for the granting of disease-free status for Member States or zones and compartments thereof. Therefore, the disease-free status of those Member States or the relevant zones or compartments thereof, should be granted and they should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (9) For certain listed diseases, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 lays down rules for the approval of eradication programmes for Member States or zones or compartments thereof that are not subject to the provisions of Article 280 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/429. This is the case for infection with Brucella abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), infection with rabies virus (RABV), enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL), infection with bluetongue virus (serotypes 1-24) (infection with BTV), bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) or infection with Bonamia exitiosa. Several Member States have submitted to the Commission applications to have the eradication programmes approved for those listed diseases. Following the assessment by the Commission, those applications have been shown to comply with the criteria of Chapters 2 and 3 of Part II of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 that lay down criteria to be complied with for the approval of eradication programmes for Category B and Category C diseases of terrestrial and aquatic animals, respectively. Therefore, those eradication programmes should be approved and the Member States or zones and compartments thereof should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (10) For certain listed diseases, applications from Member States to have disease-free status granted or to have eradication programmes approved have not yet been received by the Commission or their assessment has not yet been finalised. Once received or once the assessment is finalised the relevant Member States, zones or compartments may be listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (11) In addition, for infection with Brucella abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis a Member States has recently submitted to the Commission an application to have disease-free status from infection with Brucella abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis granted for a zone. Following the assessment by the Commission, the application has been shown to comply with the criteria of Article 71 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/689 that lay down rules for the recognition of disease-free status based on eradication programmes. Therefore, the disease-free status of the zone should be granted and it should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (12) With respect to avian influenza, Commission Regulation (EC) No 616\/2009 (10), which was adopted pursuant to Directive 2005\/94\/EC, provides for the approval by the Member States of poultry compartments and other captive birds' compartments. The list of approved compartments is publicly available and the Commission's website includes links to the internet-based information pages of the Member States. Poultry compartments and other captive birds' compartments approved with respect to avian influenza under Regulation (EC) No 616\/2009 should have their disease-free status maintained in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 and should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (13) Commission Decision 2003\/467\/EC (11) lists the Member States and regions thereof with tuberculosis-free status, brucellosis-free status and EBL-free status in accordance with Directive 64\/432\/EEC. Those Member States and regions thereof should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (14) Commission Decision 93\/52\/EEC (12) sets out the list of Member States and regions thereof with official brucellosis-free (B. melitensis) status in accordance Directive 91\/68\/EEC. Those Member States and regions thereof should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (15) Commission Implementing Decision 2013\/503\/EU (13) sets out the list of Member States or territories thereof which are recognised as free from varroosis in accordance with Directive 92\/65\/EEC. Those Members States or territories thereof should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (16) Commission Decisions 94\/963\/EC (14) and 95\/98\/EC (15) establish the status of Finland and Sweden as 'non-vaccinating' as regards Newcastle disease in accordance with Directive 2009\/158\/EC. Those Member States should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (17) Commission Decision 2004\/558\/EC (16) sets out the lists of regions of Member States that have the IBR-free status and the regions of Member States that have an approved IBR eradication programme in accordance with Directive 64\/432\/EEC. The regions with IBR-free status should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation, whereas the regions with approved IBR eradication programmes should maintain their programme for a limited period of time in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020\/689, and should be listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (18) Commission Decision 2008\/185\/EC (17) sets out the lists of Member States or regions thereof that have the Aujeszky's disease-free status and the regions that have an approved Aujeszky's disease eradication programme in accordance with Directive 64\/432\/EEC. Those Member States or regions thereof with Aujeszky's disease-free status should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation, whereas the regions with approved Aujeszky's disease eradication programmes should maintain them for a limited period of time in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020\/689, and should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (19) Commission Decision 2009\/177\/EC (18) establishes lists of Member States and certain zones and compartments with disease-free status, or subject to approved surveillance programmes or eradication programmes with regard to listed diseases of aquatic animals in accordance with Directive 2006\/88\/EC. The disease-free status of those Member States, zones and compartments should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation, whereas the approved programmes should be maintained for a limited period of time in accordance with Article 85 of Regulation (EU) 2020\/689, and should be duly listed in the Annexes to this Regulation. (20) With regard to listed diseases of aquatic animals, there are certain disease-free zones and compartments, and approved surveillance programmes, not listed in Decision 2009\/177\/EC but lists of which are publicly available on the internet-based information pages of the Member States in accordance with Directive 2006\/88\/EC. Those zones and compartments should have their disease-free status maintained, whereas the programmes should be maintained for a limited period in accordance with Article 85 of Regulation (EU) 2020\/689. Up-to-date information concerning the establishments that are located in those disease-free zones and compartments, or which are subject to those programmes, are set out in the publicly available internet page that has been established and maintained in accordance with Article 185(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/429 and with Article 21(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/691 (19). (21) As the lists set out in Decisions 93\/52\/EEC, 94\/963\/EC, 95\/98\/EC, 2003\/467\/EC, 2004\/558\/EC, 2008\/185\/EC and 2009\/177\/EC, Regulation (EC) No 616\/2009 and Implementing Decision 2013\/503\/EU are being replaced by the lists set out in the Annexes to this Regulation, those acts should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation. (22) In accordance with the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (Withdrawal Agreement), and in particular Article 5(4) of the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland in conjunction with Annex 2 to that Protocol, Regulation (EU) 2016\/429, as well as the Commission acts based on it, apply to and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland after the end of the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement.

The recommendations are based on analysis of the state of play, the needs and the priorities for agriculture and rural areas in Estonia. The recommendations address the specific economic, environmental and social objectives of the future common agricultural policy (CAP) and in particular the ambition and specific targets of the Farm to Fork Strategy and the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. As stated in the Farm to Fork Strategy, the Commission invites Estonia, in its CAP Strategic Plan, to set explicit national values for the Green Deal targets 1 , taking into account its specific situation and these recommendations. 1.1 Foster a smart, resilient and diversified agricultural sector ensuring food security Estonia has good opportunities for achieving sustainability in its agricultural production, but the country also faces certain challenges. The share of agriculture in total value added is higher in Estonia than the EU average. Furthermore, income per worker in agriculture is 83% of the average wage in Estonia, which is significantly higher than the EU average. On the other hand, agricultural factor income is below the EU average, and has been highly volatile over the last 15 years. This means a high level of uncertainty for farmers, but the situation could be improved by greater use of and further development of risk management instruments (including crop and livestock insurance). Climate change adaptation instruments (such as drainage management for handling changing rainfall patterns and farm resilience plans) play also an important role in making the agricultural sector more resilient. CAP support schemes play a key role in the farms' revenues, particularly for certain sectors (cattle, sheep and goat farms); in some years average income would even be negative without the support schemes. At the same time, the concentration of direct payments in Estonia is one of the highest in the EU. This mirrors the concentration of land, where over the last 17 years there has been a strong decrease in the number of farms and increases concentration of farmland management . To reduce the income gap with big farms, more targeted support from the CAP in favour of small and medium-sized farms should be considered. Increasing the competitiveness of farms largely depends on access to finance. It seems to be difficult for farmers to obtain guarantees and long-term loans, and some producers lack adequate financial planning skills. There are no recognised producer organisations in Estonia although a number of co-operatives are operating in the agricultural sector. However, the existing co-operatives are rather small and do not yet have strong enough bargaining power to improve the position of farmers in the value chain. With its high level of digital and technological capital, Estonian farmers could benefit further from development of short-supply chains as well as on-line and other direct marketing channels. There is also potential for quality schemes to strengthen the position of farmers, thus contributing to the objectives of the Farm to Fork Strategy. 1.2 Bolster environmental care and climate action and contribute to the environmental- and climate-related objectives of the Union Estonia presents a mixed picture in terms of the environmental and climate objectives of the CAP and the Green Deal. On the one hand, it has a marked enthusiasm for organic farming (with uptake not far off the EU level target of 25%), it is not a heavy user of fertilisers, and its inland waters are fair in terms of quality (though pollution in the Baltic Sea affects its coastal waters). On the other hand, various problems and pressures are evident. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gross and net) are rising and expected to rise further. Estonia is expected to miss the targets on reducing ammonia emissions. Not all water bodies have yet achieved a good status and nitrate concentrations are increasing in some of them, with agriculture identified as a significant contributing factor. Various habitats and species are also under pressure (for example in grassland and forest areas). Against this backdrop, ambitions and projections for further growth in the agricultural sector may raise questions about long-term sustainability. At present, an above-average proportion of Estonia's farmland is considered to be intensive in terms of input use (though that fact also reflects strong regional differences). In response to this situation, steps to improve nutrient management have a major role to play. Besides helping to meet the EU Farm to Fork Strategy's target for nutrient losses, better nutrient management would also help mitigate climate change (as could more efficient enteric fermentation in livestock), cut ammonia emissions, improve water quality, address nutrient deficiencies in some areas and reduce pressure on biodiversity. On the other side of the carbon balance sheet, replacing harvested forest on time and in a sustainable manner with appropriate species mixes and management would enhance Estonia's carbon sink, as would protecting the country's considerable peatland area. Biodiversity and ecosystems could also benefit from improvements to overall CAP support for the management of semi-natural grasslands, and from efforts to re-introduce landscape features in areas where they have been lost in line with the related target in the Biodiversity Strategy. 1.3 Strengthen the socio-economic fabric of rural areas and address societal concerns Estonia has one of the highest proportions of rural areas among EU Member States , and the share of population living in rural and urban areas is almost equal. Unlike the decreasing trend for the EU as a whole, the share of young farmers in Estonia is increasing. It also has one of the highest ratios of young to elderly farm managers to elderly in the EU, and the share of female farmers is relatively high compared to the EU average. These elements present an advantage, but certain improvements are still possible. The key issue for new entrants to agriculture sector in Estonia is access to land. While Estonia is a front-runner in the use of financial instruments, new entrants find it difficult to obtain loans from banks, which seem to lack relevant knowledge and dedicated financial products. Estonia has followed the LEADER approach to local development, which continues to offer opportunities to strengthen the socio-economic fabric of rural areas. Despite positive trends, a high poverty rate in rural areas and a gap between the employment rate in rural areas and the rest of the country remain an issue; GDP per capita in rural areas is still below the EU average and, although it has been rising, the convergence rate is slowing down. There is also a slow trend of depopulation and ageing in rural areas. Estonia must take account of the specific needs of women in agriculture and rural areas to deliver on gender equality and close the gender gaps in employment, pay, pensions, care and decision-making. Also, ensuring the protection of agricultural workers, especially the precarious, seasonal and undeclared ones, will play a major role in delivering on the respect of rights enshrined in legislation which is an essential element of the fair EU food system envisaged by the Farm to Fork Strategy. Estonia is generally on the right track regarding the transition set out in the Green Deal and the Farm to Fork Strategy towards safe, nutritious and sustainable food and animal welfare, but there are still issues that need addressing. The sale of plant protection products in Estonia is decreasing, but implementation records are inconclusive. Risks linked to pesticides have, after a period of increase, started decreasing over the last 3 years. However, Estonia remains far beyond EU average with regard to the reduction of risk from pesticide use. Estonia applies animal welfare measures widely in rural development, but the standards are not always perceived to be sufficiently ambitious. While the sales of antimicrobials are below the EU average, they could be further reduced to contribute to the Green Deal target of halving sales of antimicrobials in the EU by 2030. Continued awareness of an investment in biosecurity is also important, in view of the persistent risk of African Swine Fever (ASF) outbreaks. Estonia should make an effort to shift towards healthier sustainable diets as it has a very high rate of non-communicable diseases caused by dietary risk factors. 1.4 Modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation, and encouraging their uptake The agricultural knowledge and innovation system (AKIS) in Estonia appears to be weak and fragmented., No central hub exists to coordinate innovation and knowledge exchange in agriculture and the upstream and downstream activities that relate to it (e.g. environment, climate, biodiversity, food and non-food systems including processing and distribution chains, consumers and citizens, etc.). Training and advisory services are provided in Estonia by publicly funded advisors and a number of independent organisations, although their level of specialisation and skills varies. Importantly, cooperation and information exchange between public and private advisors is not working as well as in some other Member States. Furthermore, Estonia planned to implement only a very low number of operational groups under the European Innovation Partnership, which did not allow it to benefit fully from the opportunities offered by this European initiative. Estonia performs well on digital public services, but is merely level with the EU average in terms of integrating digital technology in the economy.Moreover, while both broadband coverage in rural areas and the level of digital skills is higher than the EU average, gaps still exist between urban and rural areas. This gap needs to be addressed to contribute to the Green Deal target of completing fast broadband internet access in rural areas. 1.5 Recommendations To address the above interconnected economic, environmental\/climate and social challenges, the Commission considers that the Estonian CAP strategic plan needs to focus its priorities and concentrate its interventions on the following points, while adequately taking into account the local conditions: Foster a smart, resilient and diversified agricultural sector ensuring food security Ensure fairness and better targeting of income support by reducing income gaps between different farm sizes (in favour of smaller and medium-sized farms), by applying, for example, the complementary redistributive income support for sustainability and the reduction of payments. Strengthen the competitive position of the agricultural sector by improving access to finance, in particular by reviewing financial instruments to be used in conjunction with the CAP. The latter should be accompanied by adequate advice on financing issues. Make the agricultural sector more resilient by encouraging and facilitating the use of risk management instruments and by supporting investments targeting climate change adaptation. Improve farmers' position in the food supply chain by ensuring further organisation of agrifood markets by encouraging producer co-operatives to seek recognition as Producer Organizations as well as better targeting the support for cooperation of producers. Bolster environmental care and climate action and to contribute to the environmental- and climate-related objectives of the Union Ensure improvement in nutrient management, thereby helping to achieve the Green Deal target on reducing nutrient losses. A better nutrient balance should be sought in both intensively and extensively farmed areas, reflecting regional differences. Effective implementation of conditionality will be important in achieving this, as will a widespread transition to agro-ecological practices and precision farming which Estonia should consider supporting through funded schemes. Reduce GHG emissions from enteric fermentation in farmed livestock in line with the Methane Strategy, including through support for advice, innovation and management practices, as appropriate. Ensure adequate protection of Estonian peatlands including through effective design of related conditionality elements and support for carbon farming. Rewetting may also be appropriate in some cases.Encourage the timely regeneration of harvested forest, in such a way as to maximise long-term carbon capture (with species which are adapted to climate change and favourable to biodiversity), within a wider context of sustainable forest management. Support not only for planting but also for advice on species selection may be appropriate. Encourage effective management of semi-natural grasslands, as highlighted also in the Prioritized Action Framework for CAP funding. Estonia should consider expanding the provision of dedicated support beyond the current area, as well as ensuring that the implementation of rules concerning direct payments (especially definitions) do not exclude land from eligibility in ways which may encourage poor management practices. This should be done in a wider context of efforts to improve biodiversity status in farm and forest areas more generally. Seek to increase the density of high-diversity farm landscape features of benefit to biodiversity thus helping to achieve the Green Deal target on landscape features especially in areas with low landscape diversity. The implementation of GAEC I standard 9 will be important in this respect, and voluntary support schemes for creating and maintaining features may also be appropriate. Strengthen the socio-economic fabric of rural areas and address societal demands Put in place more ambitious animal welfare measures, especially for pigs and laying hens, to improve animal and human health and food quality in line with the Farm to Fork Strategy, and improve biosecurity in view of ASF risk, through targeted investment support and knowledge transfer actions. Contribute to the EU Green Deal targets on pesticides by promoting the sustainable use of pesticides, in particular by ensuring the uptake of integrated pest management practices. Tackle poverty reduction and reverse depopulation and ageing trends in rural areas by investing in basic infrastructures and services that will boost economic development and quality job creations in rural areas. In doing so it will be important to ensure synergies with other EU and national funds. Fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake Contribute to the Green Deal target of completing fast broadband internet access in rural areas by focusing on closing the gap between the fast broadband availability in rural and urban areas through targeted investment interventions. In doing so it will be important to ensure synergies with other EU and national funds. Strengthen AKIS integration by implementing and interlinking dedicated information and knowledge exchange interventions, in particular focusing on coordination and support for public and private independent advisors. Advance cooperation for innovation through interactive European Innovation Partnership (EIP) projects and EIP networking activities. Invest in creating innovation support services to develop bottom-up ideas. 2.ANALYSIS of agriculture AND rural development IN eSTONIA The agricultural sector in Estonia is characterised by a decreasing number of farms and increasing farmland area. It is limited by specific Baltic conditions in terms of crop varieties. Estonian market is predominantly oriented to the Baltic and Nordic states. Agriculture plays a more important role in the overall economy of Estonia than is the case in other EU Member States, and seems to be more attractive to young farm managers than observed on the average in the EU Member States. However, the COVID crises revealed the importance of non-native workers in the agricultural sector and the difficulty of the sector attracting workers. It is still seen as a non-attractive sector, with a large decline in number of workers. High level of land concentration and relatively limited range of crop production result in a limited level of diversity of Estonian agriculture. While overall status of nature and biodiversity protection and usage of natural resources seems rather satisfactory, certain issues remain. Rural areas have a predominant role in Estonia, with 82% of the territory and 44.5% of population share. Rural areas face depopulation, poverty and ageing. The low level of economic activity, the limited quality job opportunities and missing basic infrastructures and services make rural areas less attractive. 2.1 Support viable farm income and resilience across the EU territory to enhance food security In Estonia, the agricultural income is about 82% of the average wage in the whole economy between 2015 and 2019. The share varies a lot over the period 2005-2019, mainly due to fluctuations in agricultural income. The average share for the period 2005-2019 is 104%, which is much higher than the EU average (approx. 40%) II -4. See the graph below. For the period 2005-2019, the average agricultural factor income per worker (EUR\/AWU III 12 018) is volatile, with no clear upward or downward trend. In the vast majority of years, the income is below the EU figures IV . EU subsidies play a key role in the farms' revenues, with direct payments forming annually on average 46% (one of the highest share in the EU) V and payments under rural development 26% (substantially above the EU average at 7%) of the agricultural factor income VI (period 2015-2018). The concentration of direct payments in Estonia is one of the most important in the EU, with the 20% biggest beneficiaries concentrating 86% of total direct payments, which reflects exactly the concentration of land (20% of the largest beneficiaries farm 86% of land)5. It is also observed that a significant share of direct payment beneficiaries (34%) have a lower economic size than EUR 20002. This situation reflects as well the low degree of differentiation and targeting of the direct payment received per hectare (see below). Estonia did not implement the redistributive payment in the period 2015-2020. The factor income tends to increase with physical farm size. The direct payment per hectare does not vary much with farm physical size4-5. The factor income trend is similar for the economic farm size. The direct payment per hectare also tends to increase very slightly with the economic size VII . Some of the small (in physical and economic terms) farms may actually not apply for direct payment per hectare, which would explain the lower value of the decoupled direct payment per hectare that in theory should be similar in a Member State that implements the Single Area Payment Scheme. For sectors, the factor income is the highest for granivores VIII , cereals, oilseeds and protein field crops farms and the lowest in sheep and goats farms. The direct payment per hectare is comparable whatever the sector (coupled support compensates for lower decoupled direct payment per hectare in horticulture farms). The share of total income support (direct payments) in income is highest for cattle and sheep and goat farms, certain years factor income would (on average) even be negative without support for those sector5. The factor income was similar in less favoured areas (LFA) than for non-LFA areas over the period 2004-2010 and became slightly lower (on average 96% of income of non-LFA areas) until 20144. From 2015 on, the whole territory is designated as areas facing natural or other specific constraints (ANC)5, IX . However, whereas no payments for ANC are granted in the current programming period, it is observed that a geographical distinction has been introduced under coupled support, with one 'dairy measure' for mainland and one for islands. Agricultural income as % of average wage in the economy EU-27 Agricultural factor income per AWU in real terms Agricultural income as % of average wage in the economy Trend in agricultural income (versus average wage in the economy) in Estonia The analysis of risk management instruments X shows that the offer in Estonia (national support to cover the rest of veterinary losses not taken on board by the EU\/national shared mechanism for animal diseases losses compensation; support for crop insurance with broad coverage including climatic risks, support for livestock insurance with all livestock types covered) is quite broad. As of 2019, the support for insurance premium is available through the Estonian Rural Development Programme (RDP). However, by the end of the year, there was no uptake yet XI , with one reason being the lack of suitable products on the insurance market.

The opposite tendency is recorded for the utilised agricultural land (UAA), which has increased by 24.2%, from 795 640 hectares in 2003 to 988 410 XII in 2019. As a result, the average farm size increased between 2005 and 2016 from 32 to 60 hectares. However, in 2016 the majority of farms (almost 65%) were of size below 20 hectares, and those with 100 hectares and over formed 11.4% of the total number. XIII Of the total agricultural area reported in 2018, 67.6% was arable land, 31% permanent grassland and a modest 0.4% was used for permanent crops. XIV Between 2005 and 2013, the number of livestock units was rather stable over time at around 310 thousand LU. This number decreased to 280 thousand in 2016, after the outburst of African swine fever and the Russian ban on EU products in 2014. After that drop, the number of livestock units has remained rather stable again. The agricultural, forestry and fisheries sector accounted for 3.3% of the gross value added (GVA) of Estonia in 2019 (for comparison, the EU average was 1.8%). Crops formed almost 54% of agricultural output, and over 23% of crops were cereals. Animal output reached slightly over 46% with milk production as the main contributor (57% of total animal output). XV High outflow of labour force (over -48% during 2005-2019) was the main driver for steady increase in labour productivity, and in turn, in total factor productivity (TFP) in 2005-2015. The following years saw a drop caused by harsh weather conditions of 2016 and 2018 with TFP falling below EU average by 2018. In 2019, after an exceptionally good year in agriculture, the labour productivity increased again to almost 90% of the EU average; however, when calculated for 2017-2019 it accounts for more modest 71%. XVI While the reported outflow of labour is largely a result of structural changes, the COVID crisis revealed also the sector's vulnerability its low attractiveness and the developed dependency on non-native workers. The financing gap in the agricultural sector is estimated between EUR 28 million and EUR 117 million. Lack of collateral, high lending risk and poor financial planning skills are among the main constraints on access to finance, and in addition, there seems to be an insufficient availability of long-term loans. XVII The agri-food trade balance is negative. The balance is positive with non-EU countries, but it forms a lesser part of the trade (7% of all imported and 25% of all exported agri-food products in 2019) XVIII . The main trading partners are Finland, Latvia and Lithuania, for export also Russia and Sweden. In 2019, the main products for export continued to be cereals (20%), and milk and milk products (19%).

This share is relatively stable over the years although shrinking in crisis years. During market failures, market prices are dropping faster in Estonia than in other Member States on average and primary producers are often obliged to take higher risks than other stakeholders in the supply chain with more market power. There are no recognised producer organisation or inter-branch organization in Estonia. However, there were 152 agricultural co-operatives registered in Estonia in 2018. XX To make full use of the benefits stemming from the producers' cooperation, co-operatives and other type of non-recognized producer organisations would have to be recognised by the public authorities. Therefore, co-operatives should be encouraged to seek recognition. Moreover, they should be encouraged to explore the use of quality labelling to improve cooperation between producers and to strengthen their bargaining position in the value chain. 80% of the co-operatives are small (13.3 producers per co-operative in 2016), with low turnover. A \"silo approach\" is predominant cooperatives in different sectors or different regions are not interacting, members are not overlapping and development is impeded by the inability of members to adopt a proper management and ownership model and to raise additional capital. Because of historical factors, co-operating and joint operations are not highly regarded, in particular by the older generation of farmers. However, long-term knowledge transfer measures, financed from the Estonian RDP for 2014-2020, has started to change that narrative. This measure should be continued and mergers of smaller co-operatives and co-operation between different stakeholders in the supply chain, including in the form of inter-branch activities, should be fostered. Knowledge transfer, generational renewal, advisory and training measures targeting co-operation in agriculture should be enforced in order to consolidate the primary sector and thus improve farmers' position in the supply chain. Estonia has not yet transposed the Directive on unfair trading practices XXI in the agricultural and food supply chain into its national law although it should do it by May 2021. A private code of good trading practices as adopted by the Estonian Traders Association in 2008 has not phased out the use of unfair trading practices within agricultural sector. During the 2014-2020 programming period, Estonia has implemented rural development support for short supply chains or marketing through local markets. The number of applicants who have benefited from this measure remains low. Value of food products bought online in Estonia is low as well (estimated to be ca 1%) although it grew multiple times during the COVID confinement. COVID crises also contributed to the launching of several e-commerce facilities by individual farmers but several of these have become inactive upon end of the confinement. Food e-commerce market in Estonia remains pre-mature and rather turbulent. Nevertheless, there are at least seven countrywide e-commerce platforms providing food products directly from producer to the consumer plus large number of regional platforms and\/or possibilities to order food via social media (mainly Facebook).

In terms of share, agriculture represents 7% of Estonia's total GHG emissions (EU average is 10%) and slightly less than a half percent of the total EU-27 GHG emissions from agriculture. XXIII 47% of agricultural emissions in Estonia relate to agricultural soils, 38% to enteric fermentation of livestock (mainly cattle) and 14% to the management of manure. XXIV An upward trend in GHG emissions in the agricultural sector is expected to continue due to predicted growth in livestock numbers and an increased milk yield, in case of dairy cows. Also, the emissions from liming and from the use of synthetic and lime fertilizers are expected to increase. XXV The land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, acting as a carbon sink in Estonia, plays an important role in the national carbon cycle. Estonia is one of the few EU Member States in which peatlands and peat-topped soils are strongly present covering 20.2% of total national territory, 9.150 km2 (data for 2011) XXVI . Such areas, whether used as agricultural land or not, can be large sinks for or sources of atmospheric CO2 and must therefore be appropriately managed. In particular peatland used as arable land is to be considered at risk of degradation. Suitable soil management techniques or rewetting are considered useful tools to prevent degradation, to stop further GHG emissions and to preserve carbon sequestration. Forests cover about 56% XXVII of the country's territory and the majority of CO2 removals in the LULUCF sector comes from the biomass increment in forest land. XXVIII So far the removal of CO2 has outweighed the GHG emissions of the sector, though, this trend is changing. According to the national projections, the LULUCF sector remains a carbon sink until 2030 (though the effect being almost negligible already as of 2025), after which the sector is projected to be a source of emissions. This course is mainly due to increased emissions from cropland and the reduction of carbon stored in forests, as the replacement of older forests with younger ones reduces forest stocks. In the coming years, forest stocks will reach a peak and then begin to decline, which is why an increase in CO2 emissions from forest land is expected. XXIX The National Energy and Climate Action Plan 2021-2030 XXX reflects on how to achieve the target for decreasing the emissions in the sectors falling under the scope of the Effort Sharing Regulation (which includes agriculture) by 2030 at 13% compared to 2005. The Action Plan lists the planned actions for the agricultural and forestry sector (22 and 8 measures respectively) for this purpose. These focus on environmentally friendly land management and animal rearing techniques. In 2018, renewable energy represented almost 30% of the energy consumed, exceeding the 2020 target of 25% XXXI . However, the share of agriculture in the production of total renewable energy in Estonia was a marginal 0.3% (the EU-27 average 12.1%). The main contributor (94.5%) to renewable energy production was the forestry sector. XXXII Energy consumption in Estonian agriculture and forestry as a share in total final energy consumption is 4.3%, above the EU-27 average of 2.9%. XXXIII While there was an overall slight decrease (-2.5) in the number of kg of oil equivalent use per hectare (kgoe\/ha) of agricultural land and forest area in the EU-28 between 2009 and 2015, the energy consumption in Estonian agriculture increased by almost 12 kgoe\/ha. XXXIV The current Estonian RDP already recognises reducing GHG emissions as an important challenge; several measures supporting environmentally friendly management do target also GHG and\/or ammonia emissions, covering almost 52% of the agricultural land with respective management contracts at the end of 2019 (exceeding slightly the initial target for 2023 of 49.6%) XXXV . Support is also provided for investments into renewable energy production, for which already EUR 13 million of total investment in renewable energy production have been achieved by the end of 2019 (i.e. about 64% of the target set for 2023). Furthermore, by the end of 2019, the target for 2023 to support management contracts contributing to carbon sequestration and conservation on 14.8% of Estonian agricultural and forest land has been reached. XXXVI Like other Nordic countries, the Estonian agricultural sector is vulnerable to risks stemming from climate change such as decreases in summer rainfall and increased numbers of winter storms and floods as well as pests and diseases risks. XXXVII National studies also predict a likelihood of an increase in the average amount of precipitation, reduction in snow cover and spring time floods due to temperature rise and the increasing number of extreme climate events, such as droughts or heavy showers.

As in EUROSTAT [ env_air_gge ]. 2.5 Foster sustainable development and efficient management of natural resources such as water, soil and air Estonia's situation in terms of management of natural resources is better than that of some Member States, but there are nevertheless points which require attention. Emissions of ammonia from Estonian agriculture (which make up almost 89% of total reported emissions) have been roughly stable for a decade or more, hovering between 9 000 and 10 000 tonnes per year. However, recent data (2017 and 2018) indicate an uptick in volumes and in any case crucially the country is not projected to meet its ammonia emission reduction targets under the National Emissions reduction Commitments (NEC) Directive. XXXIX Moreover, a review of Estonia's National Air Pollution Control Programme suggests that proposed technical measures targeting ammonia may be inadequate if intended growth for the agricultural sector production is not achieved in an appropriate way. XL The pressure on water availability in Estonia is unusually high for a Baltic Member State: values for the Water Exploitation Index+ have typically lain between 10% and 15% in recent years (compared with less than 1% in Latvia and usually less than 5% in Lithuania). XLI However, as Estonia has a very small area equipped for irrigation (just 0.3% of agricultural land in 2016) XLII agriculture is not the main source of this pressure and is not currently under threat from it though this could be an issue to watch for the long term. The picture on water quality in Estonia is slightly clouded by doubts over the current classification of water bodies, but nevertheless pressures seem to be most acute in coastal waters: only 13% of these were reported as having good ecological status, compared with 60% of rivers and 67% of lakes. XLIII Moreover, the most recent figures (for 2012-2015) on eutrophication and hypertrophication in coastal waters showed a substantial rise XLIV which reflects a serious and more general problem of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea as a whole. Groundwater bodies in Estonia are generally not suffering high pollution from nitrates: in 2015-2017 95% of them were considered to be of \"high quality\" (i.e. with less than 25 mg of nitrates per litre of water). XLV Nevertheless, reporting under the Nitrates Directive revealed rising nitrate concentrations in 44% of groundwater stations in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones between the periods 2008-2011 and 2012-2015. XLVI XLVII (At the same time, 21% of groundwater bodies are failing good chemical status) Estonia has designated 3267 km2 as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, which is 7% of the total territory and 34% of the total agricultural area, XLVIII and overall, diffuse agricultural pollution is the third significant pressure on surface waters and the sixth most significant with regard to groundwater bodies. On the other hand, on its territory as a whole Estonia is not a heavy user of fertilisers. Its gross nitrogen surplus was 22 kg\/ha\/year in 2015 less than half the EU average and down from 36 kg\/ha\/year in 2004 and it recorded a phosphorus deficit of 7 kg\/ha\/year in the same year (up from 2 in 2006). XLIX L However, given the hotspots of problems mentioned above, and the fact that a substantial proportion of farmland is subject to a high input intensity (55% in 2017, against an EU-27 average of 36%) LI , attempts at balanced fertilisation will clearly need regional differentiation. Note that the impact of activities to improve nutrient management in Estonia could be increased by linking them to research, innovation and demonstration activities available under the forthcoming Horizon Europe Mission on soil health and food. In this context, it is significant that 28% of arable soils are left without soil cover in winter LII and 54% of tillable land is under conventional tillage LIII . Although appropriate fertilisation may present an issue for the future if Estonia is to get the most from its agricultural soils in a sustainable manner, in general those soils show positive characteristics. The mean organic carbon content in arable land was 51g\/kg in 2015 LIV more than in the EU as a whole and with an average rate of soil loss from water at 0.21 tonnes\/ha\/year (EU average: 2.46) LV , Estonian soils do not suffer from significant water erosion. Nor is there major pressure on farmland from urban sprawl in a country with artificial land coverage of 1.9% (compared with an average of 4.1% in the EU-28). LVI From 2000 to 2018, 0.28% of cropland and 0.65% of grassland was lost to \"artificial areas\" low by EU standards (though the figure for forest and woodland, 2.1%, was more significant). LVII Potential surplus of N and P on agricultural land in Estonia Potential surplus of nitrogen on agricultural land (in kg N\/ha\/year) EU-27 GNB for Nitrogen Potential surplus of phosphorus on agricultural land (in kg P\/ha\/year) Source: EUROSTAT [ aei_pr_gnb ]. 2.6 Contribute to the protection of biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services and preserve habitats and landscapes Available data including information from the Prioritised Action Framework for Estonia drawn up pursuant to the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive - indicate causes for concern in Estonia with regard to specific objective 6. The Farmland Bird Index was at 62 in 2017 (compared to 70 in the EU-27), having fallen sharply from a value of 102 in 2007. LVIII The message from this general trend has been confirmed by a marked decline in the breeding population of the skylark a key indicator species in Estonia as in many EU countries. LIX At the same time, the conservation status of grassland habitats of EU interest affected by agriculture is deteriorating overall. Although in the reporting period 2013-2018 the proportion of such habitats with \"favourable\" status was stable from the previous reporting period at 38% (compared with 20% in the EU as whole), 13% had moved downwards to the status \"unfavourable bad\" (from \"unfavourable inadequate\"). LX It may be relevant that only 11% of permanent grassland in Estonia's Natura 2000 areas is designated as \"sensitive\", compared with 55% in Natura 2000 zones in the EU as a whole. LXI In any case, a key contributing factor to the decline of grassland habitats in protected areas has been identified as non-management of many semi-natural grasslands: although a support scheme is currently available through Estonian RDP, assessments indicated that this should be expanded. LXII Forest habitats of EU interest in Estonia are also experiencing mixed fortunes: only 20% have enjoyed \"favourable\" status in the period 2013-2018, and numbers of key forest birds are declining (e.g. the population of Tetrao urogallus has fallen by 31% over 19 years) LXIII . These statistics on protected areas are significant in themselves but should also be understood in a wider geographical context especially as Estonia's Natura 2000 zones cover a relatively modest surface: just 6% of UAA (compared with 11% in the EU) and 18% of forested area (30% in the EU). LXIV A trend of concern is that the presence of permanent grassland is being eroded: in 2018 it covered 31% of agricultural area, down from 34% in 2013. LXV Otherwise, where grassland is still in place, noted threats from the perspective of biodiversity and landscapes include cultivation and fertilisation (note the comparison with the threat of non-management inside Natura 2000 zones). LXVI Evidence also suggests that definitions and eligibility rules applied by Estonia may make some semi-natural grasslands ineligible for direct payments, which can encourage inappropriate management. The absence of a dedicated support scheme for such land outside protected areas is also considered problematic. LXVII In the case of other agricultural eco-systems including on cropland the main pressures identified come from increased use of plant protection products, mineral fertilisers and liquid manure, especially in areas where livestock rearing is more concentrated. LXVIII In this context, it is perhaps significant that Estonia has a greater proportion of farms categorised as using a high input intensity (55% in 2017) than does the EU as a whole (36%). LXIX About 1% of Estonia's UAA is taken up by linear landscape features which can be beneficial to biodiversity such as hedges, ponds, ditches and traditional stone walls in addition to about 3.4% of UAA taken up by fallow land. This compares reasonably well to the EU averages (0.6% for linear landscape features, 4.1% for fallow land). LXX However, the distribution in Estonia is uneven: certain agricultural areas, especially certain arable areas, have become relatively unbroken, monotonous landscapes. LXXI Despite the above-mentioned substantial presence of more intensive farms, Estonia has enthusiastically adopted organic farming which covered 22% of UAA in 2019 (second only to Austria), half of which is permanent grassland. LXXII The share of UAA under conversion is also high, at around 3%.

Whereas the EU average decreased between 2010 and 2016, Estonia had an increase in the share of young farmers in the same period. In addition, Estonia's ratio of young managers to elderly (0.17 in 2016) is one of the higher ratios in the EU. LXXIII LXXIV LXXV The ratio of young female managers to male managers is about 3:10, which is also one of the higher ratios in Europe. The average economic farm size in Estonia is the highest in the age class of 45 to 54 years old in 2016. Access to land (land to buy or to rent) seems to be the most important general need for young farmers in Estonia. Access to land was reported LXXVI as critical by 37% of Estonian farmers, compared to 11% in the EU. The demand for financing LXXVII is particularly high amongst young farmers and new entrants, but banks have not developed dedicated products for them. Overall, interviews with farmers' organizations and financial institutions confirm that this segment of the sector is experiencing the most difficulties in obtaining loans from banks. Estonia is notable for making use of financial instruments to incentivise investment on farms, which is partly designed to address generational renewal goals in rural areas. LXXVIII LXXIX In Estonia in 2016, the share of farm managers below 35 years of age with at least a basic level of agricultural training (55%) is higher than the respective share among total farm managers (40%). The share of young farm managers with at least a basic agricultural training in Estonia is also higher than the EU average. LXXX In the 2014-2020 programming period Estonia is implementing several CAP measures aiming at generational renewal. Under Pillar I, the young farmer payment (YFP) amounted to 0,67% of the direct payment envelope in 2018 LXXXI . Although this represents an increase in comparison to the estimated share (0,3%) and to previous years data, such figure remains below the EU average share of 0.92% (possible maximum being 2%). The average YFP\/beneficiary stood at EUR 1131 in 2018, placing Estonia in the group of Member States with lower YFP\/beneficiary. LXXXII This can be partly explained by the fact that Estonia has set up the threshold of payments entitlements that can be activated for the YFP at 39 ha (range being legally between 25 and 90 ha). Currently, Estonia has not added eligibility conditions (e.g. skills, training etc.) to be met by young farmers to receive the YFP. The results of the implementation of setting up support for young farmers under rural development have been positive with 455 beneficiaries of planned 553 having received support by the end of 2019. LXXXIII Nevertheless, it is important to continue with measures to encourage the younger generations to enter agriculture. In addition to existing support measures, further support should be provided to young entrepreneurs through advisory services and mentoring programmes, as they are the most in need of practical knowledge to cope with the day-to-day management of the business. Knowing that the farm replacement services can be used during holidays, sickness or other reasons may also encourage taking up agricultural business. Business development could be facilitated by the development of the infrastructure in rural areas. Accessible digital solutions and fast internet provide people with more flexible working time and teleworking possibilities; improved basic services such as medical care, schools, children's leisure activities and other leisure activities also facilitate moving to rural area.

[ ef_m_farmang ]. 2.8 Promote employment, growth, social inclusion and local development in rural areas, including bio-economy and sustainable forestry Estonia is among the EU Member States with the highest rural areas percentage: 82% of the total area is predominantly rural LXXXV . The share of population living in urban and in rural areas is however almost equal, respectively 45.2% and 44.5%. While in 2015-2019 the population in urban areas grew by 5%, the rural population decreased by 1% and the share of elderly people increased in a higher speed than in other territories. LXXXVI The employment rate in rural areas in Estonia decreased after the economic crisis in 2008 from 75% to 66% in 2010. In 2016, the rural employment rate was back at pre-crisis level LXXXVII and continued to increase reaching 77% in 2019 LXXXVIII . Despite rapid convergence with the EU, the gap in social and economic performance between the capital region and the rest of the country has increased. LXXXIX According to the national data, the largest employer is the service sector, which provides employment for 61% of the rural population, followed by the industrial sector with 31% and the primary sector with 8%. The rural poverty rate of 28.5% (2019 data) is high compared to urban areas and above the EU average. XC The GDP per capita in rural areas is below the EU average. While the trend has been upwards since 2000, it has not yet caught up with the EU average and the convergence has been slowing down between 2012 and 2016 (the PPS index in Estonia staying at 50 against EU average of 71 for rural areas). XCI As regards younger generation, 6.9% of 15-24 years old in Estonia are neither in employment, nor in education or training (NEET); this rate is higher in rural areas, but stays still below the EU average (8.5% and 10.7% respectively). The share of young NEET women in rural areas is higher than of young men (9.6% and 7.6% respectively), but both figures are again below the EU average (11.7% and 9.8% respectively). XCII When looking at the rate of early leavers from education and training (18-24 years old), then Estonia in general scores slightly lower than EU average (9.8% vs 10.2%), but the rate in rural areas exceeds this average (12.3% vs 10.7%). The picture is different when comparing men and women in rural areas: when 8.6% of young women are considered as early leavers, the issue is more pronounced among young men with 15.2%. XCIII Local action groups (LAGs) play an important role in local development. Currently there are 26 LAGs whose area of operation cover almost the whole territory and the whole rural population. During current programming period 9% of EAFRD funding is allocated to LEADER, which is high compared to the EU average of 7%. Supported projects mainly aim at improved possibilities for sporting and other recreational activities, rural tourism, cultural heritage and developing services for local people. XCIV While doing so, they have also created a significant 913 new jobs. XCV Forests cover almost 56% XCVI of the total area of Estonia. Forestry sector XCVII employs 35 800 persons (20% in forestry, 49% in wood industry, 26% in furniture industry and 5% in paper industry). The percentage of people employed by forestry sector has been rather stable for over a decade staying at between 5-6% of total employed persons in Estonia. XCVIII The labour productivity with EUR 37 032 per AWU in 2015 to 2017 is close to 70% of the EU average. XCIX The turnover in bio-economy sectors in Estonia has steadily grown since 2008 and reached EUR 7 billion in 2017. C Main contributors are wooded products and furniture sector (39%), food and beverages sector (29%), agriculture (14%) and forestry sector (11%). As the number of persons employed in the bio-economy sectors has slightly declined compared to 2008, the turnover per person employed increased from EUR 62 000 in 2008 to EUR 100 000 in 2017. CI While Estonia does not yet have a comprehensive national Bio-economy strategy, the Estonian Research Council commissioned a targeted study in 2018 (expected to be completed in 2021). CII 2.9 Improve the response of EU agriculture to societal demands on food and health, including safe, nutritious and sustainable food, as well as animal welfare For Estonia, the overall sales of veterinary antimicrobial agents for food producing animals has been stagnating and lately, in 2013-2017, even dropped by almost 27%. The sales of antimicrobial agents expressed as milligram per population correction unit (mg\/PCU) has been steadily decreasing, and at 53.3 mg\/PCU in 2018, it was well below the EU average of 118.3 mg\/PCU. Estonia should continue to implement measures to maintain its downward trend for the overall sales of antimicrobials to contribute to the Farm to Fork target at EU level and ensure that all the necessary measures are in place for a smooth implementation of the new provisions of Regulation (EU) 2019\/6 CIII on veterinary medicinal products applicable as from 2022. The most important consumer of antimicrobials in Estonia is the cattle sector followed by the pigs sector. Estonia had around 10% of 2017 sales of antimicrobials included in the AMEG Category 2 (classified as the highest priority critically important antimicrobials for human health (HP CIAs) by the World Health Organisation - i.e. the third and fourth generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, other quinolones and polymyxins). The most widely used HP CIA antimicrobial in Estonia are polymyxins and fluoroquinolones. In 2018, the sale of plant protection products (PPPs) in Estonia totalled 636 tonnes, a decrease in relation to 2017. While there are obvious variations in the use of PPPs, data shows globally a decreasing trend in the last years. The sales stays largely below EU average and is one of the lowest in the EU. Herbicides are the most important category of PPPs sales in Estonia (about 67% of all PPPs). Based on the calculation of Harmonised Risk Indicators (HRIs) the risks linked to pesticides increased by 31% in the period of 2011-2018 in comparison to 17% decrease at the EU level. CIV However, the risk shows downward trend for the last three years. The significantly reduced sale of PPPs containing non-approved active substances is an important factor in this trend. Despite the low figures the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) implementation record of Estonia is mixed. Estonia appears to have implemented most of the IPM principles, mainly crop rotation and using certified seeds. IPM guidelines have been established for most of the crops and a scoring system for self-control on the implementation of IPM has been introduced. A web-based monitoring systems for plants pest has been implemented in parallel. The implementation of IPM by PPP professional users is verified during official control by the competent authority in Estonia. On the other hand, Estonia needs to act on its obligation to inspect pesticide application equipment in use. At EU level, the European Commission has estimated annual food waste between 30% and 50% of edible food along the entire food chain until reaching the consumer, representing an annual loss of 89 million tons in the EU. In Estonia, a study carried out for the Ministry of Environment CV showed that around one third of the food is thrown away in Estonian households, corresponding to around EUR 120 per year (which is below EU average). While the recently adopted waste legislation addresses the food waste after the farm gates, not enough attention is given to food loss and waste occurring at the primary production level and the early stages of the supply chain. This could be tackled by extending the national food waste prevention programme required by Article 29(2a) of the Waste Framework Directive 2008\/98\/EC CVI and by the implementation of the Directive on unfair trading practices CVII to reinforce the farmers' bargaining power. Estonia has a number of issues regarding the respect of the legal baseline of animal welfare elements. For instance, the tail docking of pigs is still a routine practice. The conditions on farm should improve so that the number of tail-docked pigs could decrease. Efforts could also be made to promote the production of eggs under non-cage systems for laying hens. Estonia is a major user of animal welfare support (currently included in 34 rural development programmes of 17 Member States representing 1.8% of total EAFRD expenditure). The Estonian RDP has assigned 4.7% of its EAFRD funding to the animal welfare measure, with a total of EUR 42.6 million of public funding. The European Court of Auditors' Special Report (31\/2018) on animal welfare CVIII however pointed to weaknesses concerning cost-effectiveness of this measure. In addition, Estonia is listed among the countries affected by African Swine Fever (ASF). While the ASF is currently not present in pig farms, and despite the substantial reduction in the number of pig farms in Estonia (701 in 2015 and 109 in 2020 CIX ), it needs to be noted that in 2017 almost half of the herds were with up to 100 pigs CX . In terms of farm biosecurity this is considered as an increased risk. Hence, there is a need to assure high biosecurity in all pig farms in order to avoid further spread of ASF. Estonia has a high burden from non-communicable diseases due to dietary risk factors expressed as disability adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100 000 population. CXI This DALYs value is influenced by a number of dietary factors. Also, Estonia has a low consumption of fruits and vegetables CXII . The overweight rates CXIII reported in Estonia currently stand at 56.1% (EU average 52%), obesity rates are 21.8% (EU average 14.9%), thus both are high, pointing towards the necessity for changes of behaviour in consumption. Efforts should focus on shifting towards healthy sustainable diets, in line with national recommendations, in order to contribute to reducing rates of overweight, obesity and the incidence of non-communicable diseases while simultaneously improving the overall environmental impact of the food system. This would include moving to a more plant based diet with less red meat and more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds.

As in EUROSTAT [ SDG_02_51 ]. 2.10 Cross-cutting objective on knowledge, innovation and digitalisation The overall structure of Estonian Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (AKIS) appears weak and fragmented, and no central hub exists for overall coordination of innovation and knowledge development. CXIV Such fragmentation may reduce the ability of the system to meet the knowledge needs of farmers. Estonia has well established public agricultural research, education and extension (advisory) system. As regards Research and Innovation infrastructures, there are three universities that have programmes in their curricula relevant for agriculture, and there are several institutes that conduct research in agriculture. There are also four fully operational Digital Innovation Hubs in Estonia and one of them conducts research and advances technology-based entrepreneurship also in agriculture and agri-food sectors. CXV In addition, there are five vocational education centres that offer vocational agricultural education. However, detailed information on knowledge flows between research bodies and farmers is not available. There have been 66 projects funded by Horizon 2020 under thematic objective 'Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research'. CXVI The Advisory Centre of Rural Development Foundation is in charge of the publicly funded advisory system. A number of other organisations provide also training and advisory services. The total number of nationally accredited advisors available in Estonia is 135 CXVII (on average one consultant per 124 agricultural holdings CXVIII ) with varying specialisation and level of skills; 53 of them are contracted by the Advisory Centre. CXIX A study carried out in 2018 CXX pointed out that while the farmers are mostly satisfied with the organisation of advisory services, the information exchange between the independent advisors and advisors operating at Advisory Centre is not working well. This, in turn, exacerbates the possibilities for coherent activities in the field of knowledge transfer, common information base, etc. CXXI Under the 2014-2020 programming period, Estonia has programmed almost 4.4% of the total RDP funding for knowledge transfer and information actions, advisory services, farm management, farm relief services and cooperation (EU average 3.63%). The implementation of the RDP CXXII indicates that by the end of 2019, the number of participants trained were 5054 (2023 target being 4000), and 4511 beneficiaries had been advised (64% of planned 7000). In addition, also the number of supported cooperation projects exceeded the target value (43 projects supported instead of planned 17). As regards cooperation for innovation, only two European Innovation Partnership Operational Groups (EIP-OGs) have been planned. Agricultural Research Centre manages the National Rural Network (NRN) in Estonia. NRN's main tasks are the collection and dissemination of project examples, information exchange and training activities, support to the cooperation measure and promotion of innovation-related networking. Based on data prior to the pandemic, Estonia ranks seventh out of the 28 EU Member States in the 2020 edition of the European Commission's Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI). While Estonia ranks 1st place in the EU on Digital public services (with its well-developed e-government and e-health systems, with all central government services, as well as municipalities providing services online), it scores slightly below the EU average on the Integration of digital technology. To boost the digital transformation of the Estonian economy, it is important that Estonia continues and strengthens its efforts to raise awareness of the benefit of better integrating digital technologies, particularly for SMEs. CXXIII Estonia has not yet opted for the use of satellite-based means to monitor CAP implementation but is currently part of an EU project dealing with the uptake of new technologies. As regards broadband, 62% of rural households in Estonia are covered by next generation access (NGA) broadband (EU average in rural areas is 59%; total coverage in Estonia 84%). Very-high capacity networks (VHCN) cover 20% CXXIV of rural households (total 57%; EU average 44% CXXV ). Ultra-fast broadband coverage in rural areas in Estonia increased to 32.8%. CXXVI The level of digital skills in Estonia is above the EU average: 62% of the population has basic or above basic digital skills (the EU average is 56%); in rural area the percentage is lower (57%), but still well above the corresponding EU average (48%). CXXVII In 2016, the number of farm managers that had attained basic training was lower than EU average (11% and 23% respectively). On the other hand, Estonia has higher than average number of farm managers with full agricultural training: 29% against EU average of 9% (for managers under 35 the share was 37% and 22% respectively).

It took due account of the European Pillar of Social Rights, proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 17 November 2017. On 17 December 2019, on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 1176\/2011, the Commission also adopted the Alert Mechanism Report, in which it identified Greece as one of the Member States for which an in-depth review would be carried out. On the same date, the Commission also adopted a recommendation for a Council recommendation on the economic policy of the euro area. (2) The 2020 country report for Greece was published on 26 February 2020. It assessed Greece's progress in addressing the country-specific recommendations adopted by the Council on 9 July 2019 (3) ('the 2019 country-specific recommendations') and Greece's progress towards its national Europe 2020 targets. It also included an in-depth review under Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 1176\/2011, the results of which were also published on 26 February 2020. The Commission's analysis led it to conclude that Greece is experiencing excessive macroeconomic imbalances. In particular, the imbalances identified relate to the high public debt, the high non-performing loans on banks' balance sheets and the external sector, in a context of still low potential growth and high unemployment. (3) On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. It is a severe public health emergency for citizens, societies and economies. It is putting national health systems under severe strain, disrupting global supply chains, causing volatility in financial markets, triggering consumer demand shocks and having negative effects across various sectors. It is threatening people's jobs and incomes as well as companies' business. It has delivered a major economic shock that is already having serious repercussions in the Union. On 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a communication calling for a coordinated economic response to the crisis, involving all actors at national and Union level. (4) Several Member States have declared a state of emergency or introduced emergency measures. Any emergency measures should be strictly proportionate, necessary, limited in time, and in line with European and international standards. They should be subject to democratic oversight and independent judicial review. (5) On 20 March 2020, the Commission adopted a communication on the activation of the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact. The general escape clause, as set out in Articles 5(1), 6(3), 9(1) and 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1466\/97 and Articles 3(5) and 5(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467\/97 (4), facilitates the coordination of budgetary policies in times of severe economic downturn. In its communication of 20 March 2020, the Commission considered that, given the expected severe economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the conditions for the activation of the general escape clause had been met and asked the Council to endorse this conclusion. On 23 March 2020, the ministers of finance of the Member States agreed with the assessment of the Commission. They agreed that the severe economic downturn requires a resolute, ambitious and coordinated response. The activation of the general escape clause allows for a temporary departure from the adjustment path towards the medium-term budgetary objective, provided that this does not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term. For the corrective arm, the Council may also decide, on a recommendation from the Commission, to adopt a revised fiscal trajectory. The general escape clause does not suspend the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact. It allows Member States to depart from the budgetary requirements that would normally apply while enabling the Commission and the Council to undertake the necessary policy coordination measures within the framework of the Pact. (6) Continued action is required to limit and control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthen the resilience of the national health systems, mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic through supportive measures for business and households, and ensure adequate health and safety conditions at the workplace with a view to resuming economic activity. The Union should fully use the various tools at its disposal to support Member States' efforts in those areas. In parallel, Member States and the Union should work together to prepare the measures necessary to bring about a return to the normal functioning of our societies and economies and to sustainable growth, integrating, inter alia, the green transition and the digital transformation, and drawing lessons from the crisis. (7) The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the flexibility that the internal market offers to adapt to extraordinary situations. However, in order to ensure a swift and smooth transition to the recovery phase and the free movement of goods, services and workers, exceptional measures that prevent the internal market from functioning normally should be removed as soon as they are no longer indispensable. The current crisis has shown the need for crisis preparedness plans in the health sector. Improved purchasing strategies, diversified supply chains and strategic reserves of essential supplies are among the key elements for developing broader crisis preparedness plans. (8) The Union legislator has already amended the relevant legislative frameworks by means of Regulations (EU) 2020\/460 (5) and (EU) 2020\/558 (6) of the European Parliament and of the Council to allow Member States to mobilise all unused resources from the European Structural and Investment Funds so they can address the exceptional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those amendments will provide additional flexibility, as well as simplified and streamlined procedures. To alleviate cash-flow pressures, Member States can also benefit from a 100 % co-financing rate from the Union budget in the 2020-2021 accounting year. Greece is encouraged to make full use of those possibilities to help the individuals and sectors most affected. (9) The socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to be unevenly distributed across Greek regions because of different specialisation patterns, in particular in regions markedly relying on tourism and more generally on face-to-face business to consumers. This entails a substantial risk of widening regional and territorial disparities within Greece, aggravating the already observed trend of widening disparities between the capital city and in particular the insular and mountainous regions that further intensified during the financial crisis years. Combined with the risk of a temporary unravelling of the convergence process between Member States, the current situation calls for targeted policy responses. (10) On 30 April 2020, Greece submitted its 2020 National Reform Programme and its 2020 Stability Programme. In order to take account of their interlinkages, the two programmes have been assessed at the same time. (11) Greece is currently in the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and subject to the debt rule. (12) In its 2020 Stability Programme, the government plans the headline balance to deteriorate from a surplus of 1,5 % of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 to a deficit of 4,7 % of GDP in 2020. The deficit is projected to decline to 0,2 % of GDP in 2021. After decreasing to 176,6 % of GDP in 2019, the general government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase to 188,8 % in 2020, falling again to 176,8 % in 2021, according to the 2020 Stability Programme. There are risks underlying the budgetary projections, namely the pending litigation and public service obligations. The macroeconomic and fiscal outlook is affected by high uncertainty because of the COVID-19 pandemic. (13) In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as part of a coordinated Union approach, Greece has adopted timely budgetary measures to increase the capacity of its health system, contain the pandemic, and provide relief to those individuals and sectors that have been particularly affected. According to the 2020 Stability Programme, those budgetary measures amounted to 5,4 % of GDP. Those measures include a temporary economic support to wage earners, self-employed, individual businesses and certain liberal professions affected by the pandemic, payment of repayable advances to companies with decreased turnover, payment of social security contributions for employees whose labour contracts have been suspended, deferral of taxes and social security contributions including tax instalment schemes for at least three months for all companies, self-employed and wage earners affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, an interest subsidy on loans to small and medium-sized enterprises ('SMEs') and higher healthcare expenditure. In addition, Greece has announced measures that, while not having a direct budgetary impact, will contribute to providing liquidity support to businesses. Those measures include provision of a cash collateral to support bank lending, distributed through the Hellenic Development Bank. However, the Commission 2020 spring forecast considers all tax deferrals also as liquidity measures without a negative budgetary impact in 2020. Overall, the measures taken by Greece are in line with the guidelines set out in the Commission communication of 13 March 2020. The full implementation of the emergency measures and of supportive fiscal measures, followed by a refocusing of fiscal policies towards achieving prudent medium-term fiscal positions when economic conditions allow, will contribute to preserving fiscal sustainability in the medium term. (14) Based on the Commission 2020 spring forecast under unchanged policies, Greece's general government deficit is forecast at 6,4 % of GDP in 2020 and 2,1 % of GDP in 2021. The general government debt ratio is projected to reach 196,4 % of GDP in 2020 and 182,6 % in 2021. (15) On 20 May 2020, the Commission issued a report prepared in accordance with Article 126(3) of the Treaty because of Greece's non-compliance with the debt rule in 2019 and the planned breach of the 3 %-of-GDP deficit threshold in 2020. Overall, the Commission's analysis suggests that the debt criterion as defined in the Treaty and in Regulation (EC) No 1467\/97 is complied with, while the deficit criterion has not been fulfilled. (16) Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Greece's timely response and enforcement of restrictions seems to be an efficient course of action, judging from the rather low number of confirmed infections so far. However, the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis is expected to be severe, as compared with other Member States Greece relies heavily on its tourism and transport sectors. In the tourism sector, Greece could lose a large portion of receipts compared to 2019. Tourism is the most important service export of the Greek economy and accounted for 45 % of service exports. Furthermore, the shipping sector, which accounts for 40 % of service exports, is also expected to be affected by a drop in demand as global trade slows down due to the pandemic. Because of confinement measures, lower disposable incomes, and increased unemployment, domestic demand is expected to contract significantly. (17) Faced with the COVID-19 outbreak, Greece activated its national pandemic plan and rapidly put in place a set of unprecedented measures, including a strict quarantine and social distancing especially for those suspected of having had any contact with people carrying the virus. The authorities adopted a broad range of measures to mitigate the economic and social impact worth up to 10,5 % of GDP in 2020. The measures entail 5 % GDP of fiscal measures with a net budgetary impact of 3,7 % of GDP and an additional 1,9 % GDP of temporary tax deferrals and cash collateral for commercial banks, which could provide up to 3,6 % of GDP of additional fresh loans. The public healthcare sector has received a one-off injection of EUR 273 million that will cover, for example, the hiring of 2 000 additional healthcare sector staff, the purchase of health-related equipment and supplies, and reinforced screening. (18) To continue dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare system's capacity, accessibility and resilience needs to be improved. Direct payments for private health services, and informal payments which are closely linked to inefficient hospital management are still high. This leads to inequalities. Access is still an issue, and self-reported unmet healthcare needs are among the highest in the Union, with large differences by income groups and employment status. Co-payments have not been sufficiently means-tested to protect vulnerable groups. This is exacerbated by the oversupply and hence the overconsumption of often excessively expensive drugs. To tackle this, Greece is implementing an ambitious primary care reform to provide access to essential quality services in the short term, and a comprehensive gatekeeping-based system for the whole population in the longer term. Early indications suggest that this is proving to be key to protect citizens and limit the spread of the virus, ensuring the full capacity of the system can be employed to treat patients according to their needs. A sustainable solution for health spending is yet to be found, as fiscal sustainability is mostly ensured by a clawback system increasingly under pressure because of insufficient structural measures. Despite some encouraging actions taken recently, centralised procurement is still weak. In 2018, public spending on health was below the Union average, even including the value of the clawback, adding about 1 % of GDP. Increased efficiency along with additional financial resources are needed to improve effectiveness, accessibility and overall resilience of the health system. (19) Measures are needed to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on workers and businesses. According to the Commission 2020 spring forecast, unemployment is expected to rise to 19,9 % in 2020 and recover to 16,8 % in 2021. Greece has already introduced a temporary scheme alleviating the cost of labour for businesses whose operation has been suspended or severely affected, while protecting employment contracts and providing income support to the affected workers. However, implementation of a comprehensive short-time work scheme would provide a more sustainable and flexible solution and authorities have taken steps in that direction, by adopting the employment support scheme SYN-ERGASIA to be rolled out from 15 June to 15 October 2020. Such a scheme would allow businesses to apply a reduction of working hours in a modulated manner, corresponding to the degree in which their activities have been restricted, while preserving operation of the industries, and preventing temporary layoffs from becoming structural. Expanding flexible working arrangements, such as teleworking, which have been so far limited in Greece compared to other Member States, would also help preserve economic activity and jobs during confinement and social distancing. (20) The COVID-19 crisis risks exacerbating once again the social situation of large parts of the population and increasing income inequality. Before the pandemic outbreak, the share of the Greek population at risk of poverty or social exclusion was still one of the highest in the Union, with children and working-age people at greater risk than older people. In-work poverty, access to affordable housing and energy poverty have also been significant concerns. To mitigate the impact of the crisis, the provision of adequate income replacement to all affected workers and the self-employed, including those facing gaps in access to social protection, will be crucial. It will also be important to support the most vulnerable people, including those inactive and undeclared workers, by strengthening social safety nets. With more people likely to fall back on the basic safety nets, it will be important to improve the adequacy of the minimum income support. Comprehensive access to social services is necessary for the most deprived and vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, refugees and asylum seekers. In addition, long-term care services are not sufficiently developed. Greece should also further promote access to affordable housing, especially for households at risk of poverty, for example by introducing a scheme to assist vulnerable homeowners with a mortgage. (21) The COVID-19 crisis has halted the positive labour market developments observed in the past years, and unemployment is once again set to rise. To support a robust recovery of employment in the post-crisis period, Greece needs to complete reforms to increase the effectiveness of policies to get people into work, in particular training programmes. Increasing the public employment service's capacity to provide continuous and individualised support to jobseekers will be key. Greece needs to pay particular attention to young people and women, who are more affected by a lack of employment opportunities. There is also scope for improving social dialogue, by supporting social partners' active and meaningful involvement in policy-making, including in the design and implementation of measures to address the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. The government should focus its efforts on improving basic skills for all, including digital skills. Addressing poor educational outcomes, upgrading vocational education and training, and scaling up adult learning will be essential. To reduce skills mismatches and speed up labour market recovery, it is vital to increase quality and labour market relevance of education and training. (22) Providing sustainable liquidity support, including working capital, to affected businesses, particularly SMEs and microenterprises, in particular through loans and guarantees, has rightly been a government priority since the start of its response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Under the State aid temporary framework, Greece has introduced three schemes to increase capital liquidity of businesses, namely: (i) scheme covering repayable advance payments; (ii) a cash collateral scheme to cover bank loans; and (iii) an interest subsidy scheme for current loans. It is important that in this process, the banking sector fulfils with the support of the authorities its intermediary role to maintain the necessary flow of credit, on the basis of appropriate credit risk assessment and prudent credit standards, while accurately reporting any deterioration in asset quality. Supporting the banking sector's capacity to offer sustainable debt restructuring solutions to viable borrowers affected by the crisis will be crucial to safeguard asset quality while bolstering economic recovery. (23) To foster the economic recovery, it will be important to front-load mature public investment projects and promote private investment, including through relevant reforms. Increasing growth-enhancing investment in priority sectors will be instrumental in underpinning longer-term growth and reducing regional disparities. In 2019, public investment fell short of plans by more than 1 % of GDP, following a similar underperformance in previous years. The authorities started to address the persistent underexecution through establishing a 'national development programme' to strengthen the rules governing the development, management, financing, and implementation of supported projects, and an action plan to improve forecasting and monitoring of public investments. Given the important role that public investment will play in kickstarting the economic recovery after the COVID-19 crisis, it is crucial to address any remaining administrative obstacles and establish a pipeline of new projects. Setting up a dedicated project preparation facility could further improve and accelerate public investments. A more efficient implementation of public investment would further stimulate growth due to the multiplier effect. Greece could also benefit from more efficient and sustainable public procurement as an integral part of its efforts to improve and rationalize public spending, as well as guarantee a competitive business environment. This would require addressing identified deficiencies, such as the persistent phenomenon of unjustified excessively low tenders, through appropriate legislative and administrative measures. (24) Rekindling Greece's economy will also require tackling some long-term weaknesses and tapping into potential future opportunities. Sectors with significant investment needs include transport and logistics, where support is particularly needed for rail, road safety and upgrading intermodal hubs, as well as solid waste and urban waste-water management where environmentally sustainable investments are needed. Greece's transformation to a climate neutral economy will also require sizeable private and public investment over a sustained period. Planned investments, for instance small-scale projects in the area of energy efficiency, building renovations and renewable energy projects, could be front-loaded and contribute to the post-COVID-19 economic recovery. Preparatory work for medium-term recovery measures can benefit from investments planned under Member States' National Energy and Climate Plans, projects of common interest lists, and infrastructure development plans. Related investments could include cross-border connections for importing and exporting power between neighbouring Member States to ensure the sustainable supply of power to people and businesses in Greece, and measures to ensure the just transition of the regions most affected by Greece's ambitious plan to move away from lignite-based power generation. The programming of the Just Transition Fund, which is the subject of a Commission proposal, for the period 2021-2027 could help Greece to address some of the challenges posed by the transition to a climate-neutral economy, in particular in the territories covered by Annex D to the 2020 country report. This would allow Greece to make the best use of that Fund. (25) Despite some progress made in the previous years, Greece needs to accelerate its efforts to improve its digital performance, including through the deployment of digital tools and services in the public administration, the justice system and businesses. Maintaining the momentum and locking in the gains achieved by the launch of a number of digital services since the COVID-19 outbreak will be especially pertinent for the public administration and the recovery phase. A strategic approach to accelerating the use of digital technologies across all economic sectors, including in the public administration, and the interoperability of various information systems, particularly the market surveillance database would help bridge the productivity gap with Member States whose currency is the euro and ease up on administrative burden. Improving availability of very-high-capacity networks and uptake of very high-speed internet is also a priority. As concerns digital skills, Greece remains below the Union average, as in 2019 only 51 % of people aged 16-74 appeared to have at least basic digital skills, compared to a Union average of 58 %. Digital upskilling will allow everyone in Greece to enjoy equal access to e-services, help businesses make effective use of teleworking, and e-tools, and enable all learners be they at school, university or in adult learning to fully participate in distance learning. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, including refugees and asylum seekers, and those living in remote and rural areas should receive particular attention. (26) Following its successful completion of the financial assistance programme under the European Stability Mechanism in 2018, Greece is subject to enhanced surveillance in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 472\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). The activation of enhanced surveillance for Greece under Commission Implementing Decisions (EU) 2018\/1192 (8) and (EU) 2019\/338 (9) acknowledges the fact that over the medium term, Greece needs to continue adopting measures to address the potential sources of macroeconomic imbalances, while implementing structural reforms to support a robust and sustainable economic growth. Greece made a commitment in the Eurogroup of 22 June 2018 to continue all key reforms adopted under the programme until they are fully completed. Greece also committed to implementing specific measures related to fiscal and fiscal-structural policies, social welfare, financial stability, labour and product markets, privatisation, functioning of the justice system, public administration and anti-corruption. These structural reforms are increasingly important to Greece's efforts to restart its economy. The successful implementation and completion of these reforms should significantly help support Greece's growth in the medium and long term. Greece is subject to quarterly reporting on its progress in implementing its commitments under enhanced surveillance, where a favourable report can, on semi-annual basis, pave the way for the release of debt-relief measures worth 0,7 % of GDP per year. The release of the first two instalments of policy-contingent debt measures worth EUR 970 million and EUR 767 million was agreed by the Eurogroup in April 2019 and December 2019, respectively. The sixth enhanced surveillance report assessing Greece's progress in implementing its commitments was published on 20 May 2020. (27) While the country-specific recommendations set out in this Recommendation ('the 2020 country-specific recommendations') focus on tackling the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitating the economic recovery, the 2019 country-specific recommendations also covered reforms that are essential to address medium- to long-term structural challenges. The 2019 country-specific recommendations remain pertinent and will continue to be monitored throughout next year's European Semester. That includes the 2019 country-specific recommendations regarding investment-related economic policies. All of the 2019 country-specific recommendations should be taken into account for the strategic programming of post-2020 cohesion policy funding, including for mitigating measures and exit strategies with regard to the current crisis. (28) In particular, it is crucial in the current situation to maintain the focus on bank reorganisation to preserve financial stability and free up capacity in the banking sector to enable financing the economic recovery. The banking sector has become more resilient, resulting in the abolition of capital controls in September 2019, but legacy risks and challenges remain high. These include a still large stock of non-performing loans, a capital position in line with capital requirements but faced with an increasing capital demand in the medium term, as well as a low profitability dependent on lending growth. As a result, Greek banks are particularly exposed to the risk of increases in funding costs and renewed deterioration of asset quality due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fostering the continuous functioning of the secondary market for non-performing loans, in parallel with new lending and viable long term loan restructurings in accordance with prudent credit standards, can play a key role in meeting the dual goal of mitigating the impact of the outbreak on asset quality while tackling the legacy of non-performing loans. The implementation of a reform of the legal framework that allows unconstrained collateral enforcement from defaulted borrowers, can be an essential step in that direction. (29) The European Semester provides the framework for continuous economic and employment policy coordination in the Union, which can contribute to a sustainable economy. In their 2020 National Reform Programmes, Member States have taken stock of progress made in the implementation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By ensuring the full implementation of the 2020 country-specific recommendations, Greece will contribute to the progress towards the SDGs and to the common effort of ensuring competitive sustainability in the Union. (30) Close coordination between economies in the economic and monetary union is key in achievinga swift recovery from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a Member State whose currency is the euro, Greece should ensure that its policies remain consistent with the 2020 euro-area recommendations and coordinated with those of the other Member States whose currency is the euro, while taking into account political guidance from the Eurogroup. (31) In the context of the 2020 European Semester, the Commission has carried out a comprehensive analysis of Greece's economic policy and published it in the 2020 country report. It has also assessed the 2020 Stability Programme, the 2020 National Reform Programme and the follow-up given to the country-specific recommendations addressed to Greece in 2019. The Commission has taken into account not only their relevance for sustainable fiscal and socioeconomic policy in Greece, but also their compliance with Union rules and guidance, given the need to strengthen the Union's overall economic governance by providing Union-level input into future national decisions. (32) In the light of this assessment, the Council has examined the 2020 Stability Programme and its opinion (10) is reflected in particular in recommendation (1) below. (33) In the light of the Commission's in-depth review and this assessment, the Council has examined the 2020 National Reform Programme and the 2020 Stability Programme. The 2020 country-specific recommendations take into account the need to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate the economic recovery as a necessary first step to allow for an adjustment of imbalances. The 2020 country-specific recommendations directly addressing the macroeconomic imbalances identified by the Commission under Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1176\/2011 are reflected in recommendations (1), (2), (3) and (4) below, HEREBY RECOMMENDS that Greece take action in 2020 and 2021 to: 1. Take all necessary measures, in line with the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, to effectively address the COVID-19 pandemic, sustain the economy and support the ensuing recovery. When economic conditions allow, pursue fiscal policies aimed at achieving prudent medium-term fiscal positions and ensuring debt sustainability, while enhancing investment. Strengthen the resilience of the health system and ensure adequate and equal access to healthcare. 2. Mitigate the employment and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, including by implementing measures such as short-time work schemes and ensuring effective activation support. 3. Swiftly deploy measures to provide liquidity and continued flow of credit and other financing to the economy, focusing in particular on SMEs most affected by the crisis. Front-load mature public investment projects and promote private investment to foster the economic recovery. Focus investment on the green and digital transition, in particular on safe and sustainable transport and logistics, clean and efficient production and use of energy, environmental infrastructure and very-high-capacity digital infrastructure and skills. Improve the effectiveness and digitalisation of the public administration and promote digital transformation of businesses. 4. Continue and complete reforms in line with the post-programme commitments given at the Eurogroup of 22 June 2018 to restart a sustainable economic recovery, following the gradual easing-up of constraints imposed because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Priorities 2. Execution of the operational budget by financing mechanism 3. Beneficiaries MAIN COMMUNICATION ACTIONS INTRODUCTION This report covers the implementation of the annual work programme for 2018 (2018 AWP) of the third health programme for 2014-2020 1 ('the programme'). Article 13(1) of the Programme Regulation states that the European Commission must report to the Health Programme Committee on the implementation of all actions funded through the programme, and must keep the European Parliament and the Council informed. This report, which provides information on the 2018 budget and how it was used, is intended to meet the second requirement. The Commission staff working document accompanying this report presents the key actions co-funded under the programme whose results became available in 2018, together with tables detailing all co-funded activities and contracts. It also includes information on the actions implemented under the main thematic priorities of previous AWPs whose results also became available in 2018. The 2018 AWP was marked by the first ever call for projects to support the implementation of existing best practices identified and validated on the basis of agreed criteria by the Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non-Communicable Diseases 2 . Under Objective 1 (Promote health, prevent diseases and foster supportive environments for healthy lifestyles), five projects were funded with a total EU contribution of EUR 6.8 million to support best practices for promoting health and preventing non-communicable diseases to reduce health inequalities and scale up integrated care. Under Objective 2 (Protect Union citizens from serious cross-border health threats), the focus in 2018 was on strengthening preparedness, including laboratory capacities, and on implementing international health regulations 3 in the EU. Joint action was launched to build capacity to counter health threats in EU countries, including stepping up cooperation with neighbouring countries. The overall EU contribution was EUR 7.9 million. Objective 3 (Contribute to innovative, efficient and sustainable health systems) saw the launch of several actions. Examples include the voluntary cooperation between Member States' national pricing and reimbursement authorities on the pricing of pharmaceutical products (known as EURIPID cooperation), the second phase of the information and communication campaign on the new Regulation on medical devices 4 , and meetings of the EU expert group working with effective ways of investing in health and the joint assessment of medical devices. Under Objective 4 (Facilitate access to better and safer healthcare for Union citizens), the programme funded: the Orpha Codes project, designed to expand coding for identifying rare diseases in national health information and reimbursement systems; the administration of the 23 existing European Reference Networks (ERNs) and the establishment of a new ERN, eUROGEN; and the continued operation up to 2021 of the Orphanet Network, bringing together national teams throughout the EU to collect, validate and disseminate key information on rare diseases. The Commission and the Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food Executive Agency (Chafea) ensure that the programme's results are publicised widely through appropriate communication and dissemination activities. Member States and non-EU countries participating in the programme are also encouraged to engage in disseminating the results of the co-funded actions and to seek synergies with other EU funding programmes. These promotional activities included holding 8 information days to promote the funding opportunities offered under the 2018 AWP, in cooperation with the network of national focal points (NFPs) 5 . In parallel with these initiatives, the Commission is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the third health programme. Chafea and DG SANTE have contributed to the data gathering study, which involved examining documents on 70 actions (technical reports, sustainability plans, evaluations, etc.), to review and extract relevant data for the baseline analysis and modelling of impacts. This study informed the Commission's decision on future EU action on health in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF) for 2021-2027 6 . HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR The 2018 AWP broadly addressed the four specific objectives of the health programme. Under Objective 1 (Promote health, prevent diseases and foster supportive environments for healthy lifestyles), Chafea launched three calls for projects on the implementation of best practices on promotion of good health, prevention of non-communicable diseases and scaling up integrated care. The first call dealt with the implementation of existing best practices identified by the Member States and validated according to agreed criteria by the Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non-Communicable Diseases. Two project grants were co-funded to support the transfer of best practices and help scale them up at national and European level. These practices fell into the areas of health promotion, prevention of non-communicable diseases and reduction of health inequalities. 1.The purpose of the #Stay Healthy - Cardiovascular Risk Prevention (YOUNG50) project is to transfer the Italian CARDIO 50 screening model programme for active prevention in 50 year-olds, which constitutes best practice, to Lithuania, Romania and Luxembourg. Through early detection, treatment of risk factors and follow-up, it is expected to benefit those who receive counselling and to improve their lifestyles or medical parameters. EUR 983 255 in EU funding was made available. 2.The European Physical Activity on Prescription model (EUPAP) project is designed to transfer the Swedish model for physical activity on prescription, classed as best practice, to 10 other EU countries. EU funding amounted to EUR 1 346 154. The second call focused on integrated care, the proposed actions being designed to help healthcare authorities reform their healthcare systems. The set objective was to help local and regional health authorities develop the capacity needed to implement integrated care by following the main design principles and related building blocks identified in this area by the expert group on health systems performance assessment 7 . The following two projects were funded: 1.Evidence-based guidance to scale up integrated care in Europe (VIGOUR) 8 . The project, based on a consortium of 15 beneficiaries from 9 EU countries and the UK, received EU funding of EUR 1 827 608. 2.Personalised knowledge transfer and access to tailored evidence-based assets on integrated care (SCIROCCO Exchange) 9 . The project explores the readiness of local environments for the adoption of integrated care, using the SCIROCCO online self-assessment tool to understand local needs and the reasons for transferring the integrated care mode. This will serve as a basis for designing a tailored capacity-building approach and personalised assistance to national and regional health and social care authorities. The project, based on a consortium of 14 beneficiaries from 8 EU countries and the UK, received EU funding of EUR 1 508 988. The third call focused on nutrition, expanding the transfer of the wholegrain promotion initiatives 10 to interested countries. The purpose of the European action on wholegrain partnerships (WholEUGrain) is to facilitate the transfer of the Danish best practice model for a wholegrain partnership and to promote good health through healthy diets. By developing country-based wholegrain public\/private partnerships, the project will support disease prevention, reduce inequalities and establish supportive environments for healthy lifestyles. The project brings together five partners from four countries and received EU funding of EUR 855 410. Through a service contract under the same objective, Chafea undertook other activities related to alcohol-related harm reduction to support implementation of best practices, including those identified by EU countries under the joint action on reducing alcohol-related harm (2014-2016). Chafea also managed a number of studies supporting the implementation of EU legislation on tobacco products. Under Objective 2 (Protect Union citizens from serious cross-border health threats), the SHARP joint action 11 got under way in EU countries and other countries participating in the programme. The purpose of the joint action is to improve preparedness in the EU to cope with serious cross-border threats to health and support the implementation of international health regulations. A further aim is to step up the implementation of EU legislation on serious cross-border threats to health 12 . The joint action involves 26 associated partners, 33 affiliated entities and 9 collaborating partners in 30 countries (24 EU countries, 3 EEA\/EFTA members and 3 European neighbourhood countries). It received an EU contribution of EUR 7.9 million. Under Objective 3 (Contribute to innovative, efficient and sustainable health systems), a series of activities was funded that involved support to the implementation of the regulations on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, including the development and implementation of the new European Database for Medical Devices (EUDAMED 13 ). Finally, under Objective 4 (Facilitate access to better and safer healthcare for Union citizens) the ERNs received financial support for their coordination, particularly in the form of 3-year grants running until the end of the programme. The programme also supported the independent assessment of healthcare providers applying to join existing ERNs. The 2018 AWP also included direct grant funding for one additional ERN (eUROGEN), as well as the Orphanet database network. BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION The overall budget for the third health programme for 2014-2020 was EUR 449.4 million. This includes EUR 30.6 million in operating costs for Chafea, which is mandated by the Commission to manage the programme. Chafea has been providing the Commission with technical, scientific and administrative assistance in implementing the health programme since 2005 14 . It organises annual calls for proposals, coordinates the evaluation of submissions, negotiates, signs and manages grant agreements and disseminates the results of the actions. It is also responsible for most procurement procedures. The budget set out in the work plan for 2018 was EUR 68 325 543.65, broken down as follows: operational expenditure EUR 60 467 000, corresponding to budget line 17 03 01 ('Encouraging innovation in health, increasing the sustainability of health systems and protecting Union citizens from serious cross-border health threats'); additional contributions of EUR 1 952 043.65 from EFTA\/EEA 15 and other non-EU countries 16 participating in the programme; administrative expenditure EUR 1 500 000, corresponding to budget line 17 01 04 02; budget for Chafea's operating costs EUR 4 406 500, corresponding to budget line 17 01 06 02. The operational budget totalled EUR 62 419 043. EUR 61 322 254.98 (98.24%) were committed under the 2018 AWP. Chafea committed EUR 45 976 468.52 and DG SANTE EUR 15 345 786.46, covering part of procurement and other actions. Of the overall commitment, unused appropriations amounted to EUR 1 096 788.67, corresponding to 1.76% of the total. 1.Priorities In 2018, the total operational budget implemented (EUR 61 322 254.98) was assigned to the four specific programme objectives as follows: 1.Health promotion - EUR 15 796 420.66 (26% of the operational budget) for promoting health, preventing diseases and fostering supportive environments for healthy lifestyles, taking into account the 'health in all policies' principle; 2.Health threats EUR 7 900 000 (13% of the operational budget) for protecting Union citizens from serious cross-border health threats; 3.Health systems EUR 8 422 838.09 (14% of the operational budget) for contributing to innovative, efficient and sustainable health systems; 4.Better and safer healthcare EUR 25 455 254.83 (42% of the operational budget) for facilitating access to better and safer healthcare for Union citizens. In addition, cross-cutting activities (IT activities, communication, reimbursement of expert evaluators) accounted for EUR 3 747 741.40 (6% of the operational budget). Chart 1: Operational budget by third health programme objectives in 2018 In the 2018 budget allocation to the programme's various thematic priorities, Chart 2 below shows that the ERNs rank highest, followed by capacity building to cope with health threats, with chronic diseases in third place. Chart 2: Operational budget by thematic priority in 2018 To reach its objectives, the programme was implemented through a wide range of funding instruments. These are: project grants, including the specific mono-beneficiary grant agreement for the ERNs for rare, low-prevalence and complex diseases; operating grants to support non-governmental organisations (NGOs); actions co-financed with Member State authorities (joint actions, JAs); direct grant agreements (DGAs) with international organisations; public procurement; and other actions, such as support to the scientific committees, administrative agreements with the Joint Research Centre and EUROSTAT, and grants for Presidency conferences. Competitive calls were used to select actions for funding, e.g. for projects and procurement. JAs, grants to international organisations and conferences organised by European Council presidencies are DGAs because of their monopoly situations (de facto or de jure). External reviewers (JAs), DG SANTE and Chafea officials evaluate the proposals to ensure that these co-funded actions meet certain quality standards. The administrative budget covered expenditure on matters such as study meetings of experts, communication, and technical and administrative assistance for IT systems. 2.Execution of the operational budget by financing mechanism Type of financing mechanism Implementation (EUR) Share of mechanism in total implemented budget (%) Grants under call for proposals or invitation 30 674 796.67 50.02 Project grants, including other DGA projects 11 095 795.01 18.09 ERN actions 3-year specific grant agreements (SGAs) under Framework Partnership Agreement 13 691 043.13 22.33 Operating grants for NGOs 5 887 958.53 9.60 JA grant 7 900 000.00 12.88 Conference grants to the Member States holding the EU Presidency 166 000.00 0.27 DGAs with international organisations 4 020 000.00 6.56 Procurement (service contracts), prizes and cross-cutting actions 8 924 955.22 14.55 Managed by CHAFEA 2 618 012.85 4.27 Managed by DG SANTE 6 306 942.37 10.28 Other actions 9 636 503.09 15.71 Managed by CHAFEA 597 659.00 0.97 Managed by DG SANTE 9 038 844.09 14.74 Budget implemented of 2018 AWP 61 322 254.98 98.24 Managed by CHAFEA 45 976 468.52 73.66 Managed by DG SANTE 15 345 786.46 24.59 Total available budget of 2018 AWP 62 419 043.65 Not used 1 096 788.67 1.76 by CHAFEA 1 096 788.67 by DG SANTE 0.00 3.Beneficiaries In 2018, Chafea and DG SANTE signed more than 262 17 grants and contracts with a range of beneficiaries and service providers: governmental organisations, academic institutions, NGOs, private companies, and individual experts 18 .

It replaced Council Directive 90\/314\/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours. The PTD builds on the key features of the 1990 Directive, including information requirements, provisions on contract changes and liabilities, as well as the protection of consumers in case of the organiser's insolvency. The new PTD significantly extends the level of consumer protection, taking into consideration new online booking models for combinations of travel services. After its report on the provisions of the PTD applying to online bookings made at different points of sale issued in June 2019 ('click-through bookings' report) 2 , the Commission submits this general report on the application of the PTD in accordance with Article 26, sentence 2, of the PTD to the European Parliament and the Council 3 . The stakeholder expert group to support the application of the PTD 4 and national authorities 5 were consulted for the preparation of this report. 1.1. The main elements of the Directive Under the PTD, the organiser of a package is responsible for the performance of all services forming part of the package, irrespective of whether those services are to be performed by the organiser itself or by other service providers. When replacing the 1990 Directive, the PTD extended the concept of 'package', modelled originally on pre-arranged package holidays, to customised or tailor-made holidays that a trader, including traditional tour operators, online or off-line travel agencies, airlines and hotels, composes of different travel services selected by the traveller. All those traders can be 'organisers' for the purposes of the PTD. The main elements of the PTD 6 are: The wide definition of 'package', including ready-made holidays offered by a tour operator and the customised selection of components for a trip or holiday by the traveller at a single online or off-line point of sale; The introduction of the concept of Linked Travel Arrangement (LTA), which is a looser combination of two or more travel services for the same trip or holiday than a package. Contrary to the organiser of a package, traders facilitating an LTA are liable only for the performance of travel services they carry out themselves. A combination of travel services qualifies as LTA when one trader facilitates -the purchase of different services through separate booking processes during a single visit to a travel agent or website or, -in a targeted manner the purchase of an additional travel service from another supplier within 24 hours after a traveller receives confirmation of the booking of the first travel service (e.g. through providing in the booking confirmation a link to another service provider); enhanced information requirements: businesses must inform travellers whether they are offered a package or linked travel arrangement and on their key rights through standardised information forms. They must provide information on the features and characteristics of the package, its price and any additional charges; companies selling package holidays must provide security for refunds and the repatriation of travellers in case organisers go bankrupt. To a limited extent, such guarantee also applies to LTAs. Traders facilitating an LTA must provide a money-back guarantee for payments they receive from the traveller in case the relevant travel service is not performed due to their insolvency. This guarantee covers also repatriation when the trader facilitating an LTA is responsible for the carriage of passengers, e.g. an airline. The PTD lays down the principle of mutual recognition for the insolvency protection provided by organisers or traders facilitating an LTA in accordance with the law of their Member State of establishment; strict rules on liability: apart from certain exceptions, the organiser of a package is liable if something goes wrong, no matter who performs the travel services; stronger cancellation rights: travellers may cancel their package holiday for any reason against a reasonable termination fee. They may cancel their holiday free of charge, in particular, in case of \"unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances\" 7 at the travel destination which affect the performance of the package (e.g. war, natural disasters or outbreak of a serious disease) or if the price of the package is raised by over 8% of the original price; assistance to travellers: where travellers cannot return from their package holiday due to \"unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances\", they are granted accommodation for up to three nights, unless longer periods are provided for in Union passenger rights legislation. In general, organisers must provide assistance to travellers in difficulty, in particular, by providing information on health services and consular assistance. 1.2. Market data In 2017, packages represented around 9% of all tourism trips of EU27 residents and had a share of around 21% of the total tourism expenditure 8 . On average, each EU tourist spent around 762 EUR on a package trip within EU27 (overall expenditure: around 58 billion EUR) and 1756 EUR on a package trip to the rest of the world (overall expenditure: around 36 billion EUR) 9 . By far the main destination country within Europe was Spain (overall expenditure: around 15 billion EUR). According to a Market Monitoring Survey on packaged holidays and tours 10 , in 2020, a majority of EU27 consumers (81%) trusted the packaged holiday and tour services providers. This figure varies to some extent by Member State, from a high of 90% (in Croatia and Portugal) to a low of 60% (in Poland). A large majority (91%) report positive experiences of making purchases in the market, with few notable differences between countries or sociodemographic subgroups. Consumers who made their purchase at a travel agency generally paid one total price for the different services (82%). In contrast, 25% of those who purchased services online, did so on a single website but paid for each service separately, while 19% purchased them on one website and then clicked on a link on that site to buy another service from a different provider. 11% of consumers experienced problems with the services they purchased, or with operators, that gave them legitimate reason to complain. Of this group, 40% experienced financial loss while 79% experienced non-financial impacts such as loss of time, anger, frustration, stress or anxiety. Of all those who experienced problems, the majority (62%) filed a complaint. Just over half (54%) reported being satisfied with the outcome of the complaint, while 42% reported being dissatisfied. 2.Transposition The Member States had to transpose the Package Travel Directive by 1 January 2018. Between February 2016 and May 2017, the Commission organised five workshops to assist the Member States in the transposition of the Directive 11 . 2.1. Respect of transposition deadline In March 2018, the Commission opened infringement procedures for non-communication of national transposition measures against 14 Member States. Two Member States transposed the Directive only after the Commission had issued a reasoned opinion pursuant to Article 258 of the TFEU. By March 2019, all Member States had notified the Commission of the complete transposition of the Directive. 2.2. Conformity assessment of transposition measures A conformity assessment study of the national transposition measures conducted by an external contractor was finalised at the beginning of 2021. According to that study, there may be, to various degrees, potential non-conformity issues in all Member States, e.g. as regards definitions, pre-contractual information requirements, travellers' termination rights and termination fees, consequences of lack of or improper performance of the contract, the obligations of traders facilitating LTAs, liability for booking errors and the imperative nature of the PTD. The problems identified do not show a general trend, except for the fact that the proper transposition of the provisions on insolvency protection, notably its effectiveness, may not be fully guaranteed in many Member States. The Commission will analyse the findings of the study and, where appropriate, consider entering into a dialogue with the Member States and\/or opening infringement proceedings. 3.Application and enforcement The Member States were obliged to apply their rules transposing the PTD from 1 July 2018. 3.1. Awareness-raising The Commission issued a press release 12 to draw attention to the entry into application of the new rules, provided information for travellers 13 and businesses 14 on its YOUR EUROPE website and included package travel in its #yourEUright communication campaign about several key consumer rights launched in 2019 15 . Nonetheless, consumer representatives consider that many consumers are not sufficiently aware of their rights, in particular in relation to their rights when they want to terminate a package travel contract. 3.2. Main challenges related to the application of the Directive In the transposition phase and the first years of application, in particular the broad definition of 'package', the new concept of LTA, the delimitation between the two concepts and the standard information forms gave rise to questions from stakeholders and authorities. Moreover, challenges materialised in relation to insolvency protection, in particular in the context of the Thomas Cook bankruptcy (see chapter 4), and the COVID-19 pandemic (see chapter 5). 3.2.1.Broad scope of package definition Any combination of at least two different types of travel services for the same trip or holiday combined by one trader, including at the request of the traveller, is a package, if all services are included in a single contract or if other criteria are met, e.g. an inclusive or total price. Exemptions from the scope of the Directive are very limited 16 . This led to uncertainties during and after the transposition of the PTD as regards the question of whether the Directive applies to providers of tourist accommodation services that include free access to local leisure activities or transport services (e.g. 'tourist cards') in their offer. Examples: 1. A farmer who advertises on its website horse-riding holidays, including accommodation and horse-riding classes at a total price is an organiser of a package under the PTD. 2. A travel agent who advises his\/her customer about possible safari tours and, in accordance with the latter's selection, books a flight, accommodation in different lodges and a guided tour, for which the traveller agrees to pay once he has selected all the components, is the organiser of that package and liable for the performance of the different included travel services. Representatives of small undertakings in the tourism and leisure sector (e.g. rural tourism, sport clubs) consider that small or very small undertakings should be exempted from the PTD, especially where no transport is offered. Consumer and travel business organisations, however, consider that additional exemptions would not be an appropriate solution. 3.2.2.Linked travel arrangements (LTA) The concept of LTA was introduced taking into account market developments where traders (mainly online but also off-line) assist travellers in concluding separate contracts with individual travel service providers for the same trip within a short period of time. It covers two scenarios where a trader facilitates the booking of travel services provided by other providers and extends the application of certain rules of the PTD to such business models. Examples: 1. A travel agent books a flight for a customer and the traveller pays for the flight. Then, still during the same visit at the travel agency, the travel agent books accommodation at a hotel for the same trip, which had not been selected and availability of the hotel had not been checked before the booking of the flight, and requests payment or a down payment for the hotel. Through separate selection and separate payment of each travel service, the travel agency has facilitated an LTA. 2. In the e-mail confirmation of a flight booking, the airline provides a link to a hotel booking website offering the traveller the possibility to book a hotel at the travel destination. If the traveller clicks on the link and, within 24 hours after receiving the flight booking confirmation, books a room for his trip, the airline has facilitated an LTA in a 'targeted manner'. While recitals 12 and 13 of the PTD give some guidance as regards the concept of LTA, the application of this concept has arguably raised the highest number of questions. Consumer and business stakeholders consider the LTA definition overly complex and difficult to apply in practice. It is not always clear what 'facilitation' and 'facilitation in a targeted manner' actually means. Recital 12 clarifies that the posting of links through which travellers are merely informed about further travel services in a general way should not be considered as facilitating an LTA. Hence, an active promotion, based on a commercial link involving remuneration between the trader facilitating the procurement of an additional travel service and the other trader, will generally be required (see recital 13). A challenge with the application of the LTA concept is linked to the fact that, in the second example provided above, the insolvency protection obligation, where applicable, depends on an uncertain event in the future, i.e. the fact of whether the traveller books an additional travel service from another trader within 24 hours after the first booking. If this is the case, the provider of the first travel service who receives pre-payments from the traveller has to provide insolvency protection for those payments. Although Article 19(4) PTD requires the second trader to inform the trader facilitating the LTA about the conclusion of a contract with the traveller, the first trader does not necessarily have all the information to determine in which cases an LTA was formed. It is reported that the providers of the additional travel service do not always comply with their reporting obligations, e.g. due to lack of technical means for secured exchange of data or fear to breach the General Data Protection Regulation 17 . Such uncertainty could lead to difficulties when arranging the required insolvency protection. Concerns have also been raised that, with the exception of insolvency protection and certain pre-contractual information requirements, the PTD does not provide for the liability of traders facilitating an LTA for the performance of the relevant services. Consumer representatives are concerned that travel service providers misleadingly present themselves as a trader facilitating an LTA rather than as an organiser in order to avoid the stricter liability rules applicable to packages, leaving consumers with a lower level of protection. 3.2.3.Delimitation between package and LTA The distinction between certain packages and certain LTAs can be difficult 18 . A travel agent who books a flight and a hotel for its customer and issues one invoice for both services sells a package. When the same services were not selected jointly, the travel agent that books them one after the other and does not charge a total price facilitates an LTA. With regard to 'click-through bookings' 19 it may be very difficult for consumers and enforcement authorities to prove whether a package, an LTA or none of them was concluded, as explained in the 2019 'click-through bookings' report. A travel service provider who, after completion of a booking, transfers the traveller's name, payment details and e-mail address to another trader with whom a second service is booked within 24 hours of the confirmation of the first booking, is the organiser of a package and hence liable for the performance of both services. If one of those data elements is not transferred, the first trader facilitates a LTA and is only liable for the performance of its own service, provided the second booking happens within 24 hours. If it happens later, the PTD is not applicable at all. It is reported that, in practice, it is difficult to demonstrate what data was transferred between traders or the moment of the booking of the second travel service. 3.2.4.Information requirements According to Articles 5 and 19 PTD, organisers, retailers and traders facilitating an LTA must provide travellers with specific information before the conclusion of the contract. The pre-contractual information requirements on the specific package in question, overall, do not seem to pose major problems 20 . In addition, the PTD provides three different standard information forms for package travel contracts 21 and five different forms for LTAs 22 that must be provided to the travellers. On 26 November 2019, the Commission services organised a workshop on the application of the PTD in the airlines sector 23 , also to follow up on the Commission's 'click-through bookings' report. Representatives of airlines considered that the standard information forms are too complex, technical and difficult to read especially on mobile devices. In particular, as regards the standard forms for LTAs, it was argued that the information could be considered confusing and deterrent, as travellers are primarily informed that they do not benefit from rights applying to packages. However, it was precisely the aim of this information requirement to draw the attention of consumers to the different level of protection offered by packages as opposed to LTAs and thus give them an informed choice between the two models. Consumer organisations argue that transparency should be further enhanced by informing travellers who book a stand-alone travel service about the level of protection linked to it, which, in the case of transport services is ensured by the EU passenger rights Regulations 24 . Representatives of travel businesses suggest, in particular in view of COVID-19, enhanced consumer information and protection for all travel services, including stand-alone services. They argue that this could give more freedom to operators and consumers when choosing a combination of travel services (a fully protected package or an LTA style combination of travel services with clear liability for the proper performance of the services for each service provider). 3.3. Enforcement Article 24 PTD requires Member States to ensure that adequate and effective means exist to ensure compliance with the Directive. Enforcement is organised differently in the Member States in accordance with their respective legal traditions. As a large part of the PTD provisions concern the contractual relationship between organiser and traveller, those provisions can be privately enforced by travellers before courts or alternative dispute resolution bodies. The PTD falls within the scope of the new Directive on representative actions that Member States will have to transpose by the end of 2022 25 . With the application of this Directive, qualified entities will be able to bring collective actions both to cease the infringements of travellers' rights and to obtain redress. In addition, according to the conformity assessment study (see above 2.2), in the majority of Member States at least certain requirements of the PTD are subject to administrative or criminal penalties. Public enforcement is particularly relevant for checking compliance with insolvency protection requirements and information requirements. The PTD falls within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2017\/2394 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (CPC Regulation) 26 . In exchanges within the CPC network, several authorities reported on enforcement actions at national level. Cross-border infringements of the PTD that have harmed, harm or are likely to harm the collective interests of consumers can also be publicly enforced through the cooperation mechanism established under the CPC Regulation. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and online dispute resolution (ODR) Directive 2013\/11\/EU on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes (ADR Directive) 27 and Regulation (EU) 524\/2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes (ODR Regulation) 28 established a horizontal legislative framework that is applicable also to the PTD. The national ADR landscapes are diverse 29 . In several Member States the ADR bodies responsible for 'transport services' also cover package travel disputes, while in other Member States this sector is covered by the residual ADR bodies for consumer disputes 30 . Consumers purchasing goods or services online can make use of the European Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform, but the available data shows that the number of package travel related complaints on the ODR platform remains low 31 . The Commission does not have exact figures about the level of participation of organisers in ADR proceedings. Consumer organisations and some national ADR bodies 32 however report that voluntary ADR participation in the package travel sector is generally very low. The French ADR body Mediation Tourisme et Voyage (MTV) covers essentially the whole travel and transport sector. In 2019, it received 8667 requests (around 21% of them concerned typical package tours); for 5449 amicable solutions were proposed with an acceptance rate of 93.5% 33 . The main topics of disputes related to package travel concerned performance of the contract, contract cancellations or alterations and the quality of the service. The German authorities informed the Commission services that during the period 2016 to 2019, 24% of the applications submitted for dispute resolution to the Universalschlichtungsstelle des Bundes (Federal General Conciliation Body) concerned services in the leisure sector, in particular package travel. From the beginning of 2020 until the end of August, the number of applications concerning package travel was 27% of the total number of disputes, in view of the travel disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 34 . A survey conducted by the Commission services on the impact of the COVID-19 on the ADR bodies showed that they have in general managed to cope with their heavier workload, with some having introduced digital tools, e.g. videoconferencing. Information from European Consumer Centres (ECC) In 2019, the network of European Consumer Centres (ECC) 35 dealt with 2399 queries and 261 complaints related to the PTD 36 . In 2020, due to COVID-19, the numbers increased by 368% (11226 queries) and 250% (914 complaints). Furthermore, the proportion of the total ECC caseload that related to the PTD increased significantly from 2% in 2019 to 7% of the total caseload in 2020 37 . The average case-handling time remained the same and the rate of successful or neutral 38 outcome of ECC intervention with a trader increased from 61% in 2019 to 70% in 2020 39 . In 2019, non-conformity of the performance or misleading acts or omissions were the main topic of queries and complaints (39%). In 2020, cancellation and non-performance was the topic number one (62%). In 2020, the ECCs published a brochure on the interpretation of the PTD 40 and shared FAQs on their national websites and social media channels to assist consumers in view of the spike of complaints in the travel sector, including packages. 4.Insolvency protection According to Article 17 of the PTD, organisers must provide security for the refund of all payments made by travellers insofar as the relevant travel services are not performed as a consequence of the organiser's insolvency. That security shall also cover the travellers' repatriation if carriage of passengers is included in the package. While Member States retained discretion as to the way in which insolvency protection is to be arranged, they must ensure that the protection is effective in accordance with the requirements laid down in Article 17 of the PTD. Overall, the 2015 PTD has led to a significant improvement of the national insolvency protection systems compared to the one under the 1990 PTD. In 21 Member States, the insolvency protection is organised by the sector itself, either through private guarantee funds, insurance companies, a combination of both or other forms of private arrangement, such as bank guarantees. Two Member States (Finland and Portugal) have set up a guarantee fund established as a public entity. Four Member States (Czechia, Denmark, Malta, Poland) and the UK have a mixed system, which means that a form of private security is complemented by a publicly administered guarantee fund (double layer) or that the guarantee funds are administered by private-public organisations. 4.1. Functioning of insolvency protection schemes the Thomas Cook bankruptcy The failure in September 2019 of the UK based Thomas Cook Group plc., one of the world's leading leisure travel groups, with sales of 9.6 billion and around 19 million clients in the year prior to its bankruptcy, sent shock-waves through the whole tourism sector. Thomas Cook was active across the EU through different subsidiaries and brands in several Member States and had more than 21 000 employees. The bankruptcy affected around 600 000 holidaymakers, who either had to be repatriated or reimbursed the money they had paid in advance. Travellers in almost all EU countries were affected. To the extent that travellers had bought a package tour, they were covered by the relevant national insolvency protection schemes. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) organised the largest peacetime repatriation of more than 140 000 travellers. In the UK alone, the competent authority settled around 340 000 claims, at a value of almost 350 million covered by the government-run Air Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL) protection scheme 41 . The bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's German subsidiaries left around 140 000 travellers stranded abroad, who were repatriated with the help of the insolvency protection provider Zurich Versicherungen 42 . The insolvency protection, however, was insufficient to fully cover the refunds of travellers not yet at their destination (estimated 287.4 million EUR), because of a cap in the liability of insurance companies covering this risk 43 . The federal government committed to compensate all affected travellers for the difference between their pre-payments and the amount of refunds received from the insurance company covering the insolvent Thomas Cook companies 44 . According to information provided by the German authorities, at the beginning of February 2021, 105 306 travellers had completed their registrations for such claims and up to 10 000 registrations could possibly still be completed 45 . In France, more than 53 000 travellers were affected and the costs for the travel guarantee fund APST, that covered Thomas Cook's French subsidiaries, are estimated between 40 and 50 million EUR. Around 10 500 travellers were repatriated and more than 30 000 customers could spend their holidays with other tour operators. The refund of more than 11 500 travellers can start only once the insolvency procedure is finalised and all eligible refund files are completed. Thomas Cook continued to have insolvency protection in each of the Member States where its different subsidiaries were established and did not rely on the mutual recognition mechanism under the PTD. Therefore, the costs for repatriation and reimbursement of the travellers concerned across the EU were shared among the different insolvency protection providers in the Member States, and did not rest on one single travel guarantee fund or insurance company. 4.2. Assessment 4.2.1.Repatriation of travellers and refund of payments Overall, and having regard to the magnitude of the Thomas Cook bankruptcy, the insolvency protection systems appear to have functioned well, even though they were put under great strain. The affected travellers, who had already been at their travel destination, were repatriated or could terminate their holidays as planned. According to the information available to the Commission, travellers who had not yet started their package have received or should receive a refund of their pre-payments. However, in some Member States travellers had to wait a long time to receive a refund, or have not yet received a full refund more than one year after the Thomas Cook bankruptcy, even though Article 17(5) of the PTD requires that refunds shall be provided without undue delay after the traveller's request. 4.2.2.Insurability of risks Some business stakeholders represented in the PTD stakeholder expert group and authorities have expressed concerns that it may be increasingly difficult to find appropriate insolvency protection providers that are willing and capable to cover the risks related to the bankruptcy of a big organiser, especially during peak season. Relatively few travel guarantee funds and insurance companies provide insolvency protection. It has been reported that banks were no longer providing security for organisers and that also some of the already relatively few insurance companies offering insolvency protection are pulling out of the market (e.g. in Austria 46 and Belgium 47 ). It is therefore important to find a solid system that effectively protects travellers against the risk of insolvency. Ideas brought forward to address different challenges include multiple security providers for one organiser or the setting up of a pan-EU guarantee fund as a kind of re-insurance for the first line guarantors. 4.2.3.Divergences between national insolvency protection systems The PTD requires that the insolvency protection must be 'effective' but has left the way in which this protection is to be arranged to the Member States (see recital 39 of the PTD). The challenges in some Member States to cover repatriation and refunds has led consumer organisations to call for further harmonisation of the national insolvency protection systems, including minimum criteria how the insolvency protection system should be designed and to ensure that guarantee funds are adequately funded. However, the PTD already provides more details on the required insolvency protection than the 1990 PTD and it was controversial in the legislative negotiations on the PTD how prescriptive the Directive should be in this respect. Representatives of the insurance industry have pointed out that repatriations can be better organised by the travel industry itself (e.g. through a guarantee fund) while the core business of financial institutions is to deal with payments. 4.2.4.Preference for continuation of the package holiday In particular representatives of travel guarantee funds in the PTD stakeholder expert group stressed that in case of an organiser's insolvency the continuation of the booked package, instead of repatriation or refund, would be the best solution for travellers and providers of travel services 48 . In recital 39 of the PTD, it is stated that it should be possible to offer travellers the continuation of the package. 4.2.5.Limitation of pre-payments Pre-payment is the usual payment mode for package travel. In Germany, based on national case law on unfair contract terms, pre-payments for package travel are in principle limited to 20% down payment at the time of booking, unless the organiser duly justifies a higher pre-payment due to expenditures arising at the time of contract conclusion; the rest is due not more than 30 days before begin of the trip 49 . Nonetheless, Thomas Cook's bankruptcy led to refund claims of estimated 287.4 million EUR in Germany, eventually prompting the government to pay for outstanding refunds (see above under section 4.1.). Also in Austria, restrictions on pre-payments for package travel exist, which, however, do not apply when unlimited insolvency protection is available 50 . In order to limit the exposure of travellers to the insolvency risk, but also to reduce the risks of security providers, and hence the costs for it, consumer and traveller organisations have put forward the idea to limit the amount of pre-payments and require travellers to pay only when they receive the service. They argue that by limiting pre-payments, the risk to be covered by insolvency protection systems could possibly be limited mainly to repatriation, and travellers would be better protected in case of cancellations 51 . As pre-paid services, such as carriage of passengers, are often part of a package, the feasibility, scope and constraints of a potential limitation of pre-payments in the package travel sector would have to be assessed having regard to the broader tourism eco-system. Representatives of the transport and travel sectors consider that limitation of pre-payments could worsen their critical liquidity situation. They also point out that pre-payment is the global standard for travel services and unilateral EU requirements limiting this business model could have far-reaching implications and distort the level playing field vis-a-vis non-EU competitors. In addition, industry representatives stress that package holiday prices can be kept low because travel operators purchase large allotments of hotel and transport capacity in advance, financed with pre-payments from consumers 52 . 4.2.6.Insolvency protection against the bankruptcy of transport operators In its resolution in reaction to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook 53 , the European Parliament acknowledged the effective repatriation and did not raise any concerns in respect of the PTD. In this context, the Parliament nevertheless repeated its request to extend insolvency protection to seat-only flights in the framework of the revision of the Air Passenger Rights Regulation 261\/2004. The insolvency of an airline can affect travellers, tour operators and intermediaries. For example, if a package travel contract with a flight component is cancelled in accordance with the PTD, the organiser may have to refund the traveller the full price irrespective of whether he still holds the money or will be able to recover it from the airline. The call from a number of stakeholders representing travel businesses and consumers for the introduction of mandatory insolvency protection to be provided by airlines has become louder in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. The Aviation Roundtable Report on the Recovery of European Aviation (November 2020) acknowledges that this crisis has shown that passengers feel they may find themselves unprotected in case of insolvency of airlines and suggests that the impact of airline insolvency protection could be further analysed 54 . In its Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy of 9 December 2020, the Commission stated that the \"EU must help passengers when transport operators go bankrupt or are in a major liquidity crisis as in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Stranded passengers need to be repatriated and their tickets have to be reimbursed in case of cancellations by carriers. The Commission considers options and benefits of possible means that protect passengers against such events and will, if appropriate, make legislative proposals\" 55 . 5.The COVID-19 pandemic On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of COVID19 and, on 11 March 2020, characterised it as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented worldwide travel restrictions causing almost a standstill of travel in Europe and many other parts of the world. This is having a serious impact on the whole tourism ecosystem. UNWTO data show for January-October 2020 a reduction of tourism results in Europe of 72% compared to 2019 56 . Besides the loss of revenues, organisers are particularly hit by the fact that refund requests from travellers due to cancellations significantly exceed the level of new bookings. The Commission's Joint Research Centre estimated in a 'second wave' scenario that 11.7 million jobs could be at risk in the EU economy as a result of a drop in tourist arrivals in 2020 57 . At the same time, according to consumer organisations, by December 2020 thousands of consumers had not yet received a refund in money for cancelled holidays 58 . 5.1. Travel cancellations due to COVID-19 COVID-19 triggered the application of the PTD provisions concerning \"unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances\" which is defined in Article 3(12) PTD as \"a situation beyond the control of the party who invokes such a situation and the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken\" 59 . Significant risks to human health, such as the outbreak of a serious disease at the travel destination or its immediate vicinity usually qualify as such unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances (see recital 31 PTD). In accordance with Article 12 PTD, the traveller can terminate the package travel contract without penalty if there are \"unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances occurring at the place of destination or its immediate vicinity and significantly affecting the performance of the package, or which significantly affect the carriage of passengers to the destination\" (Article 12(2) PTD). The organiser of a package can terminate the contract without penalty as well if he is prevented from performing the contract because of \"unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances\" (Article 12(3) PTD). In those cases, the traveller has the right to a full refund of any payments made for the package within 14 days after termination of the contract (Article 12(4) PTD). On 5 March 2020, with an update on 19 March 2020, the Commission services published on the Commission's website informal guidance on the application of the Package Travel Directive in connection with COVID-19 60 , confirming the traveller's right to get a full refund, if, based on a case-by-case assessment, the conditions of Article 12(2) or (3) of the PTD are met. In that note, the Commission services also stated that, having regard to the cash-flow situation of organisers, travellers should consider accepting that their package tour is postponed to a later point in time, which, having regard to the current uncertainty to make travel plans, could be done by credit note (\"voucher\"). Several Member States requested the Commission to suspend the 14 days refund right and\/or replace it with a temporary voucher solution 61 . In a letter of 27 March 2020 addressed to all Member States 62 , Commissioner Reynders recalled that the traveller's reimbursement right had to be applied to COVID-19 related cancellations. To ease businesses' liquidity problems, he suggested that tour operators could offer vouchers under the condition that the travellers (1) would have the choice to accept the voucher and (2) should have the possibility to ask for a full refund if, eventually, they did not make use of it. In addition, Commissioner Reynders also stressed that measures to ensure robust insolvency protection were needed to enhance travellers' confidence to make such choice. 5.1.1.Commission Recommendation on vouchers On 13 May 2020, the Commission adopted Recommendation (EU) 2020\/648 on vouchers offered to passengers and travellers as an alternative to reimbursement for cancelled package travel and transport services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic 63 . In this Recommendation, the Commission again recalled the right to reimbursement under the applicable EU legislation, namely the PTD and EU passenger rights Regulations. At the same time, the Recommendation recognises the unsustainable cash-flow and revenue situation for the transport and travel sectors, due to the numerous cancellations entailed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Commission therefore recommended ways in which vouchers could be made more attractive, as an alternative to reimbursement in money, in order to increase their acceptance by passengers and travellers. The Recommendation also pointed out what kind of Union schemes are available to support undertakings in the travel and transport sectors. By letter of Commissioner Reynders and Commissioner Valean of 14 May 2020 64 , the Commission drew the attention of all Member States to this Recommendation. The Commission requested, amongst other things, that PTD and EU passenger rights Regulations are correctly applied and that practices in violation of such rules are detected in a timely manner and effectively sanctioned 65 . With its Recommendation the Commission gave a clear signal to Member States and stakeholders that it would not follow calls for lowering consumer protection 66 . Several Member States 67 , following the Commission Recommendation, adopted legislation on voluntary vouchers related to package travel and\/or adopted State aid measures to support the travel sector directly under the Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak 68 or under the Treaty 69 . Consumer organisations, however, have complained that EU countries, airlines and tour operators are poorly following the Commission Recommendation 70 . 5.1.2. Temporary national rules derogating from the PTD According to the information of the Commission, 15 Member States adopted specific rules temporarily allowing organisers of packages to impose vouchers, instead of reimbursing payments in money, for cancelled trips, or to postpone reimbursement beyond the 14-day period, which is contrary to Article 12(2), 12(3)(b) and 12(4) read in conjunction with Article 4 of the PTD. As a consequence, in line with the clear position expressed in its Recommendation 2020\/648, the Commission opened infringement proceedings against 11 Member States 71 . The Commission did not open infringement proceedings against the four Member States in which the temporary derogations from the PTD had expired or had been amended when the Commission decided on the opening of infringement proceedings. At the time of this report, infringement procedures against four Member States are still open. In several Member States, the non-compliant national measures, albeit not in force any more, continued to produce effects, for example because travellers who received compulsory vouchers based on the expired or repealed legislation had to wait at least until the end of the validity of such vouchers, before they could claim the refund of the pre-payments made for their cancelled package tour. The Commission urged those Member States to take measures to remedy the situation created by the past legislation contrary to the PTD and make sure that consumers, who prefer reimbursement in money to a voucher, effectively receive a refund in accordance with the PTD 72 . 5.1.3.National State aid measures Besides general State aid schemes available also to operators in the tourism sector, several Member States adopted specific State aid measures to support package travel organisers and, in particular, set up guarantee schemes for vouchers to ensure that, in the event of insolvency of the organiser, travellers are reimbursed, as recommended by the Commission in its Recommendation 2020\/648. The Commission approved those measures in accordance with the Temporary Framework for State aid measures 73 or under the Treaty 74 . Denmark adopted a 200 million loan in support of the Travel Guarantee Fund for travel cancellations due to coronavirus outbreak 75 . Germany adopted a 840 million guarantee scheme to secure voluntary vouchers accepted by travellers instead of cash refunds 76 . With this scheme, Germany aimed at making vouchers an attractive alternative to reimbursement in money. Poland adopted measures to support tour operators and other undertakings active in tourism and culture 77 . Under this scheme, the Polish State reimburses travellers affected by COVID-19 related cancellations on behalf of tour operators, which will have to repay those loans. Italy adopted measures to provide direct grants to tour operators and travel agents in order to compensate for losses 78 . The Netherlands adopted a 165 million loan to support the five Dutch guarantee funds that provide guarantee schemes for package travel organisers 79 . The purpose of this State aid is to provide liquidity to the funds to ensure sufficient cover for all payments to travellers in case of travel operators' insolvency, including the reimbursement of 'Corona vouchers'. Bulgaria adopted an aid scheme of around 26 million for tour operators and travel agents for compensation of losses related to refunds to be made to travellers whose packages have been cancelled because of COVID-19 80 . Cyprus adopted aid of an estimated amount of 86.6 million in the form of guarantees for credit notes issued to consumers and package travel organisers in order to secure those voluntary vouchers against a possible insolvency of the issuer 81 . Sweden adopted aid in form of loans to travel agencies and tour operators to support them fulfilling their legal reimbursement obligations 82 . Austria adopted aid in the form of State guarantees to cover, for a limited amount of time, the insolvency risk of package travel organisers and facilitators of linked travel services having regard to the withdrawal of banks and insurance providers from package travel insurance and the difficulties for package travel organisers and facilitators of linked travel services to find affordable guarantees on the market 83 . 5.2. Challenges 5.2.1.Respect of travellers' right to reimbursement Across the EU, several thousands of travellers whose trips had to be cancelled because of COVID-19 reportedly did not receive reimbursements within 14 days as provided for under Article 12(4) PTD; they were either refused a refund, imposed a voucher against their wish, could not contact the organiser, received a refund with significant delay or only partially, or were otherwise hindered to claim their right 84 . Also the increase in the number of queries and complaints received by ADR bodies, ECCs and consumer organisations gave rise to concerns regarding the respect for travellers' rights under the PTD. 5.2.2.Difficulties for businesses As described in section 5.1., COVID-19 triggered the application of the notion of \"unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances\" as defined in Article 3(12) PTD. Recital 31 mentions, as examples, \"warfare, other serious security problems such as terrorism, significant risks to human health such as the outbreak of a serious disease at the travel destination, or natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes or weather conditions which make it impossible to travel safely\". Such events are usually, but not necessarily, limited to a specific destination or a particular part of the world. Organisers are often able to address such events by changing the destination, postponing the date of the trip or refunding the traveller cross-financed through income from bookings to other destinations, if those circumstances are isolated to a specific destination. In case of a pandemic that leads globally to a quasi-standstill of travel over a longer period, as in the case of COVID-19, refund obligations are significantly higher than income from new bookings. In addition, organisers often have fixed costs stretching the companies' financial situation. Eventually this can harm the travellers' interests if an organiser goes bankrupt and the travellers has to make claims to the insolvency assets. The Commission Recommendation on vouchers (see above 5.1.1.) aimed to address also the liquidity problems of organisers caused by COVID-19 related to massive cancellations. Those liquidity problems are exacerbated by the fact that organisers have to reimburse the full price of the package to the traveller while they do not always receive reimbursement of prepaid services that form part of the package from service providers on time. If service providers go bankrupt in the meanwhile, organisers may not receive refunds at all. This can result in an unfair sharing of the burden among operators in the travel eco-system 85 . Some package organisers and intermediaries reported that, during the COVID-19 crisis, airlines stopped the automatic refund mechanism towards organisers and other travel agents through the Global Distribution Systems (\"Computerised Reservations Systems\"), while organisers had to refund the money to travellers. The uneven character of the business-to-business relation is further aggravated by the different legal regimes of organisers and transport services providers. Contrary to the PTD, passengers who cancel a flight or other transport service themselves do not have a right to reimbursement under the EU passenger rights Regulations, even in case of extraordinary circumstances. In such a case, the legal consequences and in particular the passenger's right to reimbursement are determined by the terms and conditions of the contract concluded between the passenger and the transport operator and the applicable law of the Member States. For example, if a traveller who booked a package with a flight component, cancelled the package travel contract in accordance with the PTD, the organiser has to reimburse the traveller, but has no right under EU law to claim a refund from the airline if the flight was operated. The organiser would rather need to assert a possible right to refund under the relevant law of the Member State concerned. Some package travel organisers have suggested amending Article 22 of the PTD and adding a refund obligation of suppliers of travel services that are not provided due to the termination of the package travel contract, if the organiser has to reimburse the traveller. The airline sector, on the other hand, has raised strong concerns with regard to regulating in the PTD the often complex business-to-business relations between organisers and travel service suppliers. 5.2.3.Official travel warning or advice It is widely recognised that an official travel warning of national authorities is an important indicator that a package travel contract can be cancelled due to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances affecting the performance of the trip. However, the PTD itself is silent in respect of the legal value of travel warning or advice issued by governments, as, at the moment of its adoption, some Member States were strongly opposed to any reference to official travel advice in the Directive 86 . The issuing of travel advice is the competence of the Member States, which exchange information on the advice they issue through the Consular OnLine (CoOL) network. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Member States issued travel advice not only in respect of third countries, but also regarding other Member States, typically discouraging all non-essential travel. National travel warnings or advice were made, initially, in a non-coordinated way. This caused uncertainties for travel business and consumers, especially in cross-border situations, about their rights and obligations. On 13 October 2020, the Council adopted a Recommendation 87 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic within the EU. Although not addressing travel advice directly, Member States agreed on a common map on the COVID-19 risk level in the EU, published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In addition, Member States committed to clear and timely information to the public provided, among others, via the Re-open EU platform 88 . In view of the evolving epidemiological situation, the Council amended the Recommendation on 1 February 2021 89 . 5.2.4.Vouchers Contrary to the passenger rights Regulations, the PTD does not expressly provide for the possibility to make refunds in form of a voucher. In its Recommendation (EU) 2020\/648, the Commission recognised that organisers may propose vouchers as an alternative to reimbursement in money, subject to the traveller's voluntary acceptance, in the event of cancellations (see above section 5.1.1.). Germany 90 , Hungary 91 , Latvia 92 and Cyprus 93 have adopted national rules setting a legal framework for vouchers proposed for voluntary acceptance by travellers in the package travel sector, along the lines of the Commission Recommendation, in particular regarding protection against the insolvency of the issuer. Italy and Greece have followed parts of the Recommendation when amending their laws after the opening of infringement proceedings. Spain amended its legislation to prevent the opening of the infringement proceedings. Ireland introduced State-backed refund credit notes that may be offered to customers of tour operators and travel agents operating in Ireland instead of a cash refund, if the customer agrees 94 . The Commission stated clearly that the travellers' right to reimbursement as provided by the PTD had to be respected and considered that vouchers are an acceptable solution only if their acceptance is optional for the traveller. 5.2.5.Insolvency protection The question arose whether pending claims for reimbursements from travellers were covered by the insolvency protection systems provided in accordance with the PTD. Article 17(1) PTD requires organisers to provide security for the refund of all payments made by the traveller \"insofar as the relevant services are not performed as a consequence of the organiser's insolvency\". The Commission considered in its Recommendation 2020\/648 that, if organisers become insolvent, there is a risk that many travellers would not receive any refund, as their claims against organisers are not protected 95 . Nonetheless, representatives of travel guarantee funds have alerted that some insolvency protection providers may come under significant additional pressure in the coming months, if they had to step in to reimburse vouchers issued by organisers going bankrupt in high numbers. This is especially the case in Member States that obliged existing insolvency protection providers to cover vouchers without supporting measures 96 . The question may arise whether refunds may be limited in light of recital 40 PTD according to which 'highly remote risks' do not need to be taken into account for an effective insolvency protection 97 . In the context of the preparation of this report, consumer organisations and some Member States suggested that the PTD should be amended to ensure that consumers' refund claims are protected also in situations where the package travel contract had been terminated on grounds not related to the organiser's insolvency, such as due to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances. 5.2.6.Insurance Risks related to pandemics are often excluded from insurance policies, in particular travel cancellation insurance 98 . This limits the possibility of travellers to insure themselves against possible losses due to cancellation of a trip caused by a pandemic. Some travel business stakeholders have suggested that organisers should be allowed to include appropriate personal travel insurance in a package with an opt-in\/out option. Within the PTD stakeholder group, consumer organisations however stressed that any insurance taken out by the travellers themselves should in no way limit existing travellers' refund rights and the protection under the mandatory insolvency protection. 6.Next steps The issues described in this report, in particular in sections 3.2, 4 and 5, and their practical consequences require further analysis. In particular, the full impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the sector and the level of consumer protection should be further evaluated. As announced in its New Consumer Agenda, building on the findings of the present report, the Commission will carry out by 2022 a \"deeper analysis into whether the current regulatory framework for package travel, including as regards insolvency protection, is still fully up to the task of ensuring robust and comprehensive consumer protection at all times, taking into account also developments in the field of passenger rights\" 99 . The upcoming in-depth analysis planned for 2022 will not aim to lower consumer protection. On the contrary, the Commission will assess how the high level of consumer protection provided by the PTD can be ensured, how the rights of consumers can be effectively enforced at all times and how a fairer sharing of the burden among economic operators along the value chain could contribute to this objective. This action under the Consumer Agenda will take into account the relevant actions announced in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. These actions comprise (1) the review of the passenger rights regulatory framework, including to ensure its resilience to extensive travel disruptions and options for multimodal tickets 100 and (2) the assessment of options and, if appropriate, the proposal for an adequate financial protection scheme to protect passengers against the risk of a liquidity crisis or an insolvency regarding the reimbursement of tickets and if needed their repatriation 101 by 2022. To this end, the Commission will assess whether the differences between the PTD and the passenger rights Regulations as regards insolvency protection and cancellation rights are justified or if the rules should be more aligned 102 and whether specific rules for situations like COVID-19 should be proposed 103 , with the objective to better protect consumers.

Such information should therefore rather be provided upon the traveller's request. (21) Annex I, Part A, B and C. (22) Annex II, Part A, B, C, D and E. (23) Ref. no. ARES(2020)270448.

The epidemiological approaches taken by individual Member States, but also individual regions, have been very different, with negative consequences not only for health but in the social and economic fields too; believes that representatives of the European Committee of the Regions, as the institution representing local and regional authorities from all the countries of the European Union, should be involved as observers in the work of teams, committees and task forces set up at EU level to deal with public health emergencies, particularly the Advisory Committee on Public Health Emergencies; calls for the introduction of effective instruments for coordination between border regions, including those on the EU's external borders, and proposes that interregional, cross-border contact groups be set up; notes that, although health policy remains a primary competence of the Member States in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, it is necessary to launch a reflection to deepen EU competences in the field of health (Article 168 of TFEU) during the debate on the future of Europe in order to address in solidarity serious cross-border health threats across the European Union, taking into account the different subnational structures in the field of health and the different competences of the health authorities in individual Member States. These new competences should, among others, enable the Commission to formally recognise a public health emergency at Union level; reminds that the COVID-pandemic has been accompanied by important restrictions to the freedom of movement inside the European Union; I.

When preparing national preparedness and response plans each Member State shall coordinate with the Commission in order to reach consistency with the Union preparedness and response plan, also inform without delay the Commission and the HSC of any substantial revision of the national plan. If applicable, where local and regional authorities have significant public health responsibilities in the national health system, national plans should include subnational preparedness and response plans. 2. National preparedness and response plans should specify that inter-regional, cross-border contact groups can or should be set up in border areas to prepare and coordinate actions in regions on both sides of the border in the event of a health threat emerging. Reason When competences at regional level are concerned, the involvement of regions is not an option. Explanation of proposed changes Self-explanatory.

On the basis of the information provided by the Member States in accordance with Article 7, and of the results of the audits referred to in Article 8, the Commission shall by July 2022 and every 2 years afterwards, transmit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the state of play and progress on preparedness and response planning at Union level. 1. On the basis of the information provided by the Member States in accordance with Article 7, and of the results of the audits referred to in Article 8, the Commission shall by July 2022 and every 2 years afterwards, transmit to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Committee of the Regions a report on the state of play and progress on preparedness and response planning at Union level. Amendment 5 Article 10 Coordination of preparedness and response planning in the HSC Insert subpoint. Text proposed by the European Commission CoR amendment (f) supporting regional cross-border cooperation on health in regions potentially or already at risk and coordinating the activities of inter-regional, cross-border contact groups. Reason A regional territorial component in the work of the HSC will allow for seamless integration of border regions in the crisis response and prevent the lack of communication experienced on many occasions during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. Amendment 6 Article 11 Training of healthcare staff and public health staff Text proposed by the European Commission CoR amendment 2. The training activities referred to in paragraph 1 shall aim to provide staff referred to in that paragraph with knowledge and skills necessary in particular to develop and implement the national preparedness plans referred to in Article 6, implement activities to strengthen crisis preparedness and surveillance capacities including the use of digital tools. 2. The training activities referred to in paragraph 1 shall aim to provide staff referred to in that paragraph with knowledge and skills necessary in particular to develop and implement the national preparedness plans referred to in Article 6, implement activities to strengthen crisis preparedness and surveillance capacities including the use of digital tools. Training activities shall also be targeted towards local and regional authorities with competences in healthcare in order to support capacity-building at subnational level. 5. The Commission may support organising programmes, in cooperation with the Member States, for the exchange of healthcare staff and public health staff between two or more Member States and for the temporary secondment of staff from one Member State to the other. 5. The Commission may support organising programmes, in cooperation with the Member States, for the exchange of healthcare staff and public health staff between two or more Member States and for the temporary secondment of staff from one Member State to the other. Such actions should be carried out particularly in border regions where regional and local authorities have significant competences in the field of healthcare, not least through the training of people who work for interregional, cross-border contact groups. Reason While the division of powers may vary in different Member States, local and regional authorities are often involved both in the management of municipal hospitals and civil protection, but lack specific training or capacity. Targeted training is very much needed for often understaffed municipal services and would allow faster response times and more efficient action.

(g) provide, upon request of the Commission or the HSC, or its own initiative, guidelines for treatment and case management of communicable diseases and other special health issues relevant for public health, in cooperation with relevant societies , including guidance for border regions and transit hubs in cases of cross-border health threats ; Reason In the case of COVID-19, border regions and transport hubs remained without guidance for certain periods before national measures were rolled out. Initial guidance from the ECDC, even of an informal and non-binding nature, would facilitate a common early response at the local and regional level across the EU, before targeted national measures enter into force. Amendment 10 Article 5 Operation of dedicated networks and networking activities Text proposed by the European Commission CoR amendment 2. (h) ensure, where possible, the collection of data at subnational level. Reason The request for the ECDC to collect data at subnational level is based on the experience gained from the COVID-19 pandemic; in some regions, the epidemiological picture has differed from the national average or the conditions in neighbouring regions. Amendment 11 Article 5b Preparedness and response planning Text proposed by the European Commission CoR amendment 1. (c) facilitate self-assessments and external evaluation of Member States' preparedness and response planning, and contribute to reporting and auditing on preparedness and response planning under Articles 7 and 8 of Regulation (EU) \/ [OJ: Please insert the number of Regulation SCBTH [ISC\/2020\/12524]]; 1. (c) facilitate self-assessments and external evaluation of Member States' preparedness and response planning , including preparedness and response plans at subnational level applicable to border regions and transport hubs , and contribute to reporting and auditing on preparedness and response planning under Articles 7 and 8 of Regulation (EU) \/ [OJ: Please insert the number of Regulation SCBTH [ISC\/2020\/12524]]; Reason Regions with substantial powers in the field of health have reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic with their own planning and measures. Independent guidance and auditing would have helped with the exchange of information and improved the quality of the initial response. Amendment 12 Article 5b Preparedness and response planning Text proposed by the European Commission CoR amendment 1. (l) produce recommendations for cross-border coordination and compatibility of regional responses to heath threats; Reason Regions with substantial powers in the field of health have reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic with their own planning and measures. Independent guidance and auditing would have helped with the exchange of information and improved the quality of the initial response. Amendment 13 Article 8 Operation of the Early Warning and Response System Text proposed by the European Commission CoR amendment 6. The Centre shall coordinate closely, where possible, with regional cross-border contact groups on health. Reason The lack of possibilities for exchange hampered adequate responses in cross-border regions during the crisis. Joint cross-border contact groups sharing information with the ECDC and authorities at all levels would allow the competent authorities to take informed decisions. II. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS A. Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on serious cross-border threats to health and repealing Decision No 1082\/2013\/EU THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS 1. stresses that according to Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), 'A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities', as well as Article 196 thereof which states that 'The Union shall encourage cooperation between Member States in order to improve the effectiveness of systems for preventing and protecting against natural or man-made disasters'; 2. refers to its commitment, set out in its opinion on the EU4Health programme to prioritise 'health at European level and to support regional and local authorities in the fight against cancer and epidemics of diseases in cross-border health cooperation and in the modernisation of health systems'; 3. recalls the principle 'one health', which means that health is a horizontal topic which must be mainstreamed throughout policy fields and actions of the European Union; 4. takes into consideration the European Commission Work Programme published on 29 January 2020, which states that the European way of life 'is about finding common solutions to shared challenges and equipping people with the skills they need, and investing in their health and wellbeing'; 5. points out that pursuant to Article 1 of Directive 2011\/24\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), measures should be taken to facilitate access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare and promote cooperation on health between Member States, in full respect of national competencies in organising and delivering healthcare; 6. stresses that, according to Eurobarometer data from 2017, over 70 % of Europeans expect greater EU involvement in the field of health. Health is now more than ever a key concern for EU citizens, who rightfully expect the EU to take a more active role in this area; 7. highlights that the lessons learned from the COVID-19 crisis provide an opportunity for the EU to establish a better interregional framework for monitoring and fighting cross-border health threats for its citizens; 8. points out that, in addition to fighting the pandemic, the EU is faced with the serious problem of health system inequalities and permanent shortage of medical personnel in some parts, which require also our attention; 9. is concerned that the local and regional level is not properly taken into account in the proposal, and that cross-border issues are treated from the perspective of national borders rather than the specific needs of border regions; Strengthening the role of local and regional authorities in planning and preparing responses 10. points out that 19 of the 27 Member States have chosen to allocate primary responsibility for health, care and public health to the local and regional authorities, and therefore calls for local and regional authorities to be fully involved in the development of national preparedness and response plans, their evaluation and the preparation of responses; 11. points to the need to develop implementation mechanisms at regional level. Effective implementation of national preparedness and response plans depends on the extent to which national governments involve the regional level; 12. welcomes the proposal of the European Commission to organise stress-tests of the health systems in Member States in order to ensure the functioning of the Union preparedness and response plan. Recalls that these stress-tests should fully involve, depending on their competences, regions and cities in the Member States concerned; 13. welcomes the Commission's idea of organising training for healthcare staff in the development and implementation of national preparedness plans, with a view to boosting crisis preparedness, including through the use of digital tools; at the same time, considers that this training should cover the staff of local and regional authorities responsible for health, when these authorities have significant public health responsibilities; 14. highlights the need for flexibility in combining top-down activities with local and regional knowledge and actions; 15. stresses that the involvement of citizens and local authorities would allow for more effective resilience to threats. This process should also involve practitioners, who may have a different perspective to legislators; 16. draws attention to the subject of education and promoting awareness of public health-related issues among the general public. Local and regional authorities play a key role in this area; 17. insists on support for digital connectivity and training in regional health facilities as well as the promotion of telemedicine, with a view to providing more effective care through smart centres and mobile multidisciplinary teams; Border regions 18. draws attention to the particular role and challenges facing regions along the EU's internal and external borders, whose models of health cooperation between border regions have been developed over many years, and to the benefits that these arrangements bring to local populations; 19. suggests strengthening measures to protect regional and local authorities' health technology systems against potential cyberattacks that could jeopardise the functioning of Member States' healthcare systems. Coordinated planning and centralised guidance is needed to shore up systems that are critical in normal situations but even more so during pandemics; 20. points out that the current crisis has revealed the existing threats to the cross-border healthcare system and has created additional barriers to cooperation between regions. Differences in competences and administrative difficulties arising from different legal provisions have become major challenges in achieving more effective and improved healthcare management in border regions; 21. calls for the swift adoption of appropriate legal solutions, a system of incentives and the promotion of good practices to secure lasting improvements to healthcare cooperation between border regions, in particular by taking into account the possibility or necessity of setting up, within the framework of national preparedness and response plans, interregional, cross-border contact groups, which would prepare and coordinate actions in the regions on both sides of the border in the event of a health threat emerging; 22. stresses that patients seeking care abroad mainly do so in the neighbouring region, making border region cooperation a key element for success; 23. suggests creating the 'status' of cross-border healthcare professional in order to facilitate the mobility of medical staff; thinks that to facilitate the mobility of medical staff within Europe it would make sense to enhance the system of mutual recognition of professional qualifications and promote uniform training structures; 24. calls, therefore, on the Commission to put forward a proposal to ensure a minimum level of permeability of borders and related cross-border cooperation in the field of health in order to maintain or, where necessary, improve the provision of services in this area, including in crisis situations, as has been the case with the COVID-19 pandemic; 25. suggests promoting the conclusion of permanent health cooperation agreements between the competent authorities of the appropriate levels in various countries in order to ensure the exchange of patients in crisis situations. These agreements must also take account of the fact that the EU has common borders with third countries; B. Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 851\/2004 establishing a European Centre for disease prevention and control THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS 26. welcomes the proposal for a consolidated mandate for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as requested in the opinion on the Health Emergency Mechanism; 27. believes that the expansion of the ECDC's remit is crucial in order to develop common EU strategies for dealing with cross-border health threats; 28. recommends that, as part of its new mandate, the ECDC collect data at subnational level and improve cooperation between border regions and transit hubs in situations involving cross-border health threats; 29. highlights that close cooperation with the ECDC will contribute to better preparedness and response planning, reporting and auditing within local and regional authorities, especially in border regions, and calls for the adoption of suitable provisions allowing regional authorities to arrange cross-border responses and coordination more quickly in the event of pandemics; 30. hopes that the ECDC will issue non-binding recommendations and suggestions on risk management, especially with regard to border regions; 31. underlines the importance of capacity to mobilise and deploy the EU Health Task Force to assist local response in Member States; 32. points out that close cooperation between the operational contact points in the Member States and the competent authorities overseeing healthcare units at local and regional level will significantly increase the effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance; 33. stresses that healthcare facilities have the most up-to-date knowledge, including databases on the epidemiological situation; urges, therefore, that the local and regional authorities overseeing them become involved in the preparation and implementation of harmonised systems for the provision of this information; 34. insists on the need for the Member States to agree on a common statistical protocol to allow for comparability of the data on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics. This protocol, to be developed under the joint authority of the ECDC and Eurostat, could rely on data provided at NUTS 2 level to facilitate a policy response integrating the use of European Structural and Investment Funds; 35. believes that the ECDC can ensure epidemiological surveillance via integrated systems enabling real-time surveillance by deploying modern technologies and available artificial intelligence modelling applications. Brussels, 7 May 2021. The President of the European Committee of the Regions Apostolos TZITZIKOSTAS (1) Directive 2011\/24\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare (OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45).","2216":"Council conclusions \u2018The European arrest warrant and extradition procedures \u2013 current challenges and the way forward\u2019 2020\/C 419\/09 4.12.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 419\/23 Council conclusions 'The European arrest warrant and extradition procedures current challenges and the way forward' (2020\/C 419\/09) THE COUNCIL HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: 1. The key priority of the Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, adopted by the European Council on 20 June 2019, is protecting citizens and freedoms. Europe must be a place where people feel free and safe. To this end, the fight against terrorism and cross-border crime must be expanded and strengthened. Cooperation in criminal matters and the exchange of information should reflect these ambitions and the application of common instruments must be further improved and developed. 2. The Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (2002\/584\/JHA, EAW Framework Decision) (1), which is the key instrument of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, has simplified and accelerated cooperation between Member States. It continues to make an essential contribution to meeting the Union's objective of providing its citizens with an area of freedom, security and justice. 3. Discussions on how to further improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters have been held on various occasions. During this process, certain areas have emerged in which the effectiveness of the EAW surrender mechanism could be further increased. Thus, in 2018, during the Austrian Presidency, the Council adopted conclusions on mutual recognition in criminal matters, entitled 'Promoting mutual recognition by enhancing mutual trust' (2). In 2019, the Romanian Presidency issued a report entitled 'The way forward in the field of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters' (3). The Commission's latest implementation report of 2 July 2020 (4), the ongoing ninth round of mutual evaluations in the Council (5), the draft implementation report of the European Parliament's LIBE Committee of 4 September (6) and the virtual conference held on 24 September 2020 in the context of the German Presidency (7) have given the discussions on the future of the EAW new impetus. 4. 13 June 2022 will be the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the EAW Framework Decision. Member States, the Commission, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), Eurojust, the European Judicial Network (EJN) and practitioners working on a daily basis on surrender proceedings should strive to find and implement solutions for current challenges in the application of the Framework Decision to celebrate that anniversary. 5. The Council agrees that there is scope for improvement in the following areas: A. Improving national transposition and the practical application of the EAW Framework Decision; B. Supporting executing authorities in dealing with fundamental rights evaluations; C. Addressing certain aspects of the procedure in the issuing and in the executing Member State; D. Handling requests to extradite EU citizens to third countries; E. Strengthening EAW surrender procedures in times of crisis. A. Improving the national transposition and practical application of the EAW Framework Decision 6. The efficiency and effectiveness of the EAW Framework Decision depend mainly on national legislation transposing the requirements of EU law in full. Despite the considerable efforts already made, there is still room for improvement, in particular in view of the evolving case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). 7. The Council calls on the Member States to ensure the correct transposition of the EAW Framework Decision, taking due account of the case law of the CJEU and the recommendations resulting from the fourth and ongoing ninth rounds of mutual evaluations (8), as well as from the Commission's implementation reports of 24 January 2006, 11 July 2007, 11 April 2011 and 2 July 2020 (9). It should be noted that the Commission has started infringement procedures under Article 258 TFEU and, where necessary, will continue initiating such proceedings in the near future. 8. The Handbook on how to issue and execute a European arrest warrant (10), last updated in 2017, has proven to be a valuable tool for practitioners. In view of the developments that have taken place in the meantime, in particular with regard to the large number of judgments by the CJEU, the Council invites the Commission to update the Handbook in the near future. 9. The Member States are encouraged to make it easier for practitioners to apply and interpret the national legislation implementing the EAW Framework Decision by laying down non-binding guidelines for the application of the EAW. Such guidelines, which should take into account and be compatible with the EAW Handbook, could assist issuing judicial authorities, in particular as regards the verification of whether the conditions for issuing an EAW are met and whether the principle of proportionality is observed. 10. The Eurojust overview 'Case law by the Court of Justice of the EU on the EAW', last updated in March 2020, has proven to be a useful tool for practitioners. The Council invites Eurojust to update this overview as appropriate, as frequently as possible, and to continue making it electronically available in an appropriate form. 11. The Council encourages the Member States, the Commission and the European Judicial Training Network in their efforts to support and increase continuous training for practitioners involved in EAW surrender procedures and to further promote the exchange of views between practitioners from different Member States. Direct contact between practitioners in different Member States enhances mutual trust and thereby contributes to a better application of the EAW Framework Decision. Possibilities for hosting specific training events for practitioners from two or more Member States with a high mutual caseload should be further explored in order to promote mutual understanding. 12. Eurojust and the European Judicial Network (EJN) play a key role in the practical application of the EAW Framework Decision, as highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Council encourages Eurojust and the EJN to continue their valuable work and to intensify their efforts both to further improve information exchange, coordination and cooperation between national judicial authorities and to provide the best possible support for cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). 13. In order to further improve the application of the EAW Framework Decision, a centralised portal at Union level should be provided where all relevant information that could make it easier for practitioners to use the EAW is collected and continuously updated. To that end, the EJN, in consultation with the Commission, Eurojust and other relevant stakeholders, is invited to explore the options for expanding and further improving the EJN website, which already provides a broad range of information on the EAW and is therefore a good basis in that regard. B. Supporting executing authorities in dealing with fundamental rights evaluations 14. The system put in place by the EAW Framework Decision is based on the principle of mutual recognition (recital 6, Article 82(1) TFEU); while execution of the EAW constitutes the rule (Article 1(2)), refusal to execute is the exception. Such refusal, which could increase the risk of impunity and undermine security of citizens and protection of victims, can, in principle, only be envisaged in the circumstances set out in Articles 3, 4 and 4a of the Framework Decision. Although the Framework Decision does not stipulate a ground for refusal in the case of imminent violations of fundamental rights, it does not have the effect of modifying Member States' obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental principles as enshrined in Article 6 TEU and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 1(3), recitals 12 and 13). 15. The CJEU has acknowledged that the executing judicial authority may, in exceptional circumstances and subject to certain conditions, refuse to execute an EAW where there is a real risk that the surrender of the person concerned could lead to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 4 of the Charter (11), owing to the detention conditions in the issuing State, or to a violation of the fundamental right to a fair trial enshrined in Article 47(2) of the Charter (12), due to concerns about the independence of the judiciary in the issuing State. Practitioners have thus been given the challenging task of resolving the tension between mutual recognition and the protection of fundamental rights on a case-by-case basis. Protection from inhuman or degrading treatment 16. The prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, laid down in Article 4 of the Charter, is absolute in that it is closely linked to respect for human dignity, the subject of Article 1 of the Charter and one of the fundamental values of the Union and its Member States as set out in Article 2 TEU (13). 17. The Council emphasises that the challenges relating to detention conditions in the issuing Member State must be addressed in that Member State, and with regard to all detained persons. It highlights the fact that minimum standards and benchmarks on detention conditions, including on pre-trial detention, already exist in the form of recognised soft-law instruments, in particular the Council of Europe's 'European Prison Rules' (14). The Council encourages Member States to take the measures necessary to ensure compliance with these instruments. 18. The Council underlines the importance of providing practitioners with the necessary support and information to carry out the two-step assessment as set out by the CJEU (15). Practitioners must have access to objective, reliable, specific and properly updated information in order to assess, as a first step, whether there are deficiencies with respect to the detention conditions in the issuing Member State, which may be systemic or generalised, which may affect certain groups of people, or which may affect certain places of detention. For the second step of assessment, practitioners must, pursuant to Article 15(2) of the EAW Framework Decision, receive all necessary information on the conditions in which it is actually intended that the individual concerned will be detained in the issuing Member State, in order to assess whether there are substantial grounds for believing that, if surrendered, that person would run a real risk of being subject to inhuman or degrading treatment. 19. The Council welcomes the fact that, in order to improve access to the information necessary, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) launched the criminal detention database in 2019, bringing together in one place information from 2015 to 2019 on detention conditions in all EU Member States. The FRA is invited to regularly update this database in order to ensure that the information provided meets the requirements set out by the CJEU and, in the medium term, to assess whether the database meets the needs encountered in practice. 20. The Council invites the Commission, when updating the EAW Handbook, to place particular emphasis on providing guidance for practitioners on how to deal with the question of detention conditions, taking into account the results of the ongoing ninth round of mutual evaluations. In this context, the Commission should also consider the advisability of developing practical solutions, such as a template for requesting supplementary information pursuant to Article 15(2) of the EAW Framework Decision. Safeguarding the right to a fair trial 21. The right to a fair trial, as laid down in Article 47(2) of the Charter, is of cardinal importance as a guarantee that all the rights which individuals derive from EU law will be protected and that the values common to the Member States set out in Article 2 TEU, in particular the value of the rule of law, will be safeguarded (16). 22. The Council reminds Member States of their responsibility to ensure respect for the rule of law in the EU and to safeguard the right to a fair trial and, in particular, access to an independent and impartial tribunal. Member States must take the measures necessary to remedy deficiencies in order to strengthen mutual trust and to avoid the risk of a politicisation of cooperation in criminal matters. The Council calls on the Commission to make use of its function as guardian of the Treaties in this respect. 23. The Council underlines the importance of providing practitioners with the necessary support and information to carry out the two-step assessment required in cases of an alleged risk of breach of Article 47(2) of the Charter as set out by the CJEU (17). Practitioners must have access to objective, reliable, specific and properly updated material, in order to assess, as a first step, whether there is a real risk, connected with a lack of independence of the courts in the issuing Member State owing to systemic or generalised deficiencies, of the fundamental right to a fair trial being breached. For the second step, practitioners must receive, pursuant to Article 15(2) of the EAW Framework Decision, all necessary information to assess whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the person concerned will run such a risk if he or she is surrendered, having regard to the personal situation of that person, as well as to the nature of the offence and the factual context that form the basis of the EAW. 24. The Council invites the Commission, when updating the EAW Handbook, to provide guidance for practitioners on how to deal with cases of alleged risk of breach of Article 47(2) of the Charter and, in consultation with the FRA, to consider ways to improve practitioners' access to information and to the sources of information to which practitioners may refer, taking into account the criteria set out by the CJEU. Assurances 25. In accordance with Article 15(2) of the EAW Framework Decision and the principle of sincere cooperation set out in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) TEU, the executing authority may request supplementary information and the issuing authority may give assurances that the person concerned, if surrendered, will not suffer a violation of his or her fundamental rights (18). 26. The Council underlines that the executing judicial authority, in view of the mutual trust which must exist between the judicial authorities of the Member States and on which the European arrest warrant system is based, must rely on those assurances, at least in the absence of any specific indications to the contrary (19). C. Addressing certain aspects of the procedure in the issuing and in the executing Member State Strengthening procedural rights in EAW proceedings 27. Considerable progress has already been made with respect to the procedural rights of suspected or accused persons in criminal proceedings. In implementing the Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights (20) as part of the Stockholm Programme (21), common minimum requirements for criminal proceedings were established by Directive 2010\/64\/EU (right to interpretation and translation), Directive 2012\/13\/EU (right to information), Directive 2013\/48\/EU (right of access to a lawyer), Directive (EU) 2016\/343 (presumption of innocence, right to be present at the trial), Directive (EU) 2016\/800 (procedural safeguards for children), and Directive (EU) 2016\/1919 (legal aid). 28. The Commission's implementation reports, published on 18 December 2018 with respect to Directives 2010\/64\/EU (22) and 2012\/13\/EU (23), and on 27 September 2019 with respect to Directive 2013\/48\/EU (24), show a clear need for improvement in the transposition of these Directives. The Council calls on the Member States concerned to remedy the shortcomings identified in the implementation reports and to ensure full and correct implementation of the Directives. It should be noted that the Commission has started infringement procedures under Article 258 TFEU and, where necessary, will continue to initiate such procedures in the near future. 29. The Council emphasises the need to assess the practical effectiveness of procedural rights in proceedings in the issuing and executing Member States under the EAW Framework Decision. The report published by the FRA on 27 September 2019 ('Rights in practice: access to a lawyer and procedural rights in criminal and EAW proceedings'), which covers the situation in eight Member States, is a valuable contribution in this regard. The Council invites the FRA to consider the possibility of continuing the study, extending it to all Member States and putting a special emphasis on the experiences of lawyers acting in surrender proceedings until 2022. Translations 30. The Council recalls that an EAW must be translated into one of the official or accepted languages of the executing Member State and stresses that an adequate translation is essential for the effective functioning of EAW surrender procedures. 31. The Council invites Member States to consider, with regard to the translation of the EAW, whether they could make greater use than at present of the possibility provided for in Article 8(2) of the EAW Framework Decision, to accept a translation in one or more other official languages of the European Union, in order to simplify and accelerate the procedure. Transfer of proceedings and conflicts of jurisdiction 32. In order to avoid impunity in a Europe without borders, for example when the execution of an EAW is refused, when there is a conflict of jurisdiction, or in case of parallel proceedings in two or more Member States in relation to the same facts, the question arises, inter alia, of how proceedings can be transferred effectively and how conflicts of jurisdiction can be resolved. 33. The Council Framework Decision of 30 November 2009 on prevention and settlement of conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings (2009\/948\/JHA) (25) aims to prevent parallel proceedings in respect of the same facts and infringements of the principle of 'ne bis in idem', but is limited to establishing provisions on the exchange of information and direct consultations between the competent authorities of the Member States. As is underlined by the Report on 'Eurojust's casework in the field of prevention and resolution of conflicts of jurisdiction' of 16 February 2018, difficulties remain, in particular in complex cases and those relating to negative conflicts of jurisdiction. 34. There is currently no common legal framework for the transfer of criminal proceedings between Member States. Only 13 Member States have ratified the European Convention on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters of 15 May 1972. The other Member States rely on the use of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 20 April 1959, in conjunction with the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union of 29 May 2000, or on bilateral agreements or informal cooperation. 35. In the past, despite considerable efforts, in particular the initiative of 16 Member States for a Council Framework Decision on transfer of proceedings in criminal matters in 2009 (26), no consensus regarding an EU instrument could be reached. However, as is highlighted in Eurojust's report of 16 February 2018 and the conclusions on the 52nd Plenary meeting of the EJN in 2019 (27), practitioners continue to face legal and practical challenges as a result and therefore tend to support the creation of an EU instrument. 36. Common rules between Member States on the transfer of proceedings and conflicts of jurisdiction could, in principle, be an important contribution to the fight against cross-border crime by increasing the efficiency of criminal proceedings and improving the proper administration of justice within the area of freedom, security and justice. 37. In its report 'The way forward in the field of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters' (28), the Romanian Presidency suggested further exploration of the need to launch a legislative proposal on the transfer of proceedings in criminal matters in a broader context, including assessment of the provisions of Framework Decision 2009\/948\/JHA on conflicts of jurisdiction. In the light of this report, the Commission financed an academic study on the transfer of proceedings in criminal matters, which will be finalised in the second half of 2021. 38. The Council invites the Commission, as soon as the outcome of the study is available, to discuss with the Member States, Eurojust and the EJN whether a new proposal for an EU instrument on the transfer of proceedings in criminal matters is feasible and would present an added value. In the affirmative, the Commission is invited to prepare an impact assessment and, where appropriate, a legislative proposal. Promoting alternatives to detention and to the use of an EAW 39. The Council encourages Member States to explore the opportunities to enhance, where appropriate, the use of non-custodial sanctions and measures, as set out in the Council conclusions adopted during the Finnish Presidency regarding the use of non-custodial sanctions and measures in the field of criminal justice (29). 40. When considering the consequences that the execution of an EAW will have on the requested person's liberty, the issuing authority must determine whether, in the light of the particular circumstances of each case, it is proportionate to issue an EAW. This assessment includes, in particular, the question of whether the EAW is the most appropriate instrument or whether other judicial cooperation measures could be used instead (e.g. European investigation orders, European supervision orders, transfer of prisoners). 41. The Council invites the Commission and the Member States to consider whether there is a need to strengthen the use of other judicial cooperation measures, taking into account the results of the ongoing ninth round of mutual evaluations. D. Handling requests to extradite EU citizens to third countries 42. The Council recalls the exchange on the state of play regarding the handling of extradition requests from third countries concerning EU citizens who are not nationals of the requested Member State at the informal video-conference of justice ministers on 4 June 2020. 43. Following the judgments of the CJEU in the Petruhhin case and several subsequent rulings (30), in handling such requests Member States are faced with two obligations: on the one hand, the duty to fulfil existing obligations under international law and to combat the risk that the offence concerned will go unpunished and, on the other hand, Member States that do not extradite their nationals are obliged, in accordance with the principles of freedom of movement and non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, to protect citizens from other Member States as effectively as possible from measures that may deprive them of the rights of free movement and residence within the EU. In that regard, the CJEU has clarified that the requested Member State must ascertain whether there is an alternative measure which would be less prejudicial to the exercise of the rights of free movement and which would be equally effective in achieving the objective of preventing impunity (31). This includes informing the Member State of which the person concerned is a national and, should that Member State so request, surrendering the requested person to that Member State in application of the EAW Framework Decision, provided that said Member State has jurisdiction to prosecute that person for offences committed outside national territory (32). 44. Considerable work has been done to provide an insight into the practical application of the Petruhhin principles by Member States (33). However, the existing case law does not provide a solution when the Member State of nationality cannot issue a EAW in respect of the requested person. 45. The Council welcomes the fact that Eurojust and the EJN have conducted a most useful analysis of how requests for the extradition of Union citizens by third countries are handled in practice. The Council will discuss the results of this analysis in a timely manner and decide on the question of whether any follow-up action should be taken and, if so, in what form. 46. The practical experience of different Member States shows that there are cases where unfounded and abusive requests for extradition are submitted by third countries. The Council invites the Commission to consider the need, in the light of the results of the analysis prepared by Eurojust and the EJN, for further action, such as a suggestion for a common approach in dealing with potentially abusive, including politically motivated, search and extradition requests from third countries. In this context, the best practices of the Member States should be taken into account. E. Strengthening EAW surrender procedures in times of crisis 47. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Member States have taken a variety of measures, such as closing borders, suspending air traffic and imposing strict contact and social distancing rules. This has also had a significant impact on judicial cooperation in criminal matters, in particular on surrender procedures under the EAW Framework Decision. 48. The Council underlines that ensuring the proper functioning of judicial cooperation in criminal matters in times of crisis is of great importance for the area of freedom, security and justice. COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of the coordinated and swift exchange of information and experience, and the need to further digitalise cooperation between the Member States. 49. With regard to the necessary exchange of information and experience in times of crisis, a coordinated approach by all actors involved is vital in order to avoid duplication of work and to streamline the collection and distribution of information. The use of questionnaires has proven to be a valuable instrument for collecting information, and the regularly updated compilation by Eurojust and the EJN, combining information received by Eurojust, the EJN and the Presidency\/General Secretariat of the Council, has proven to be a valuable tool for the coordinated exchange of information and of great assistance to practitioners. In the future, consideration should be given to creating an electronic platform on which, in times of crisis, helpful information could be consulted and updated on a daily basis. 50. The Council underlines that digitalisation plays a central role. The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly illustrated the need for the prompt and comprehensive digitalisation of cross-border judicial cooperation, as highlighted in the Council conclusions 'Access to justice seizing the opportunities of digitalisation', which were agreed under the German Presidency (34). In many cases, practical issues can be overcome by means of digital solutions. 51. The Council welcomes the Commission's final report on the study on 'Cross-border Digital Criminal Justice', published on 14 September 2020. The measures adopted as a follow-up to this study should pay particular attention to the following aspects: the creation of secure electronic communication channels between competent authorities, a harmonised approach to the recognition and use of electronic signatures, or at least more flexible use of the existing systems, the creation of a secure means of transmitting large files and a better alignment of video-conferencing systems, in particular with regard to their quality and technical interoperability.

The Council welcomes the Commission's final report on the study on 'Cross-border Digital Criminal Justice', published on 14 September 2020. The measures adopted as a follow-up to this study should pay particular attention to the following aspects: the creation of secure electronic communication channels between competent authorities, a harmonised approach to the recognition and use of electronic signatures, or at least more flexible use of the existing systems, the creation of a secure means of transmitting large files and a better alignment of video-conferencing systems, in particular with regard to their quality and technical interoperability.'","2279":"Decision (EU) 2021\/752 of the European Central Bank of 30\u00a0April 2021 amending Decision (EU) 2019\/1311 on a third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (ECB\/2021\/21) 7.5.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 161\/1 DECISION (EU) 2021\/752 OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 30 April 2021 amending Decision (EU) 2019\/1311 on a third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (ECB\/2021\/21) THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first indent of Article 127(2) thereof, Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular the first indent of Article 3.1, Article 12.1, the second indent of Article 18.1 and the second indent of Article 34.1 thereof, Having regard to Guideline (EU) 2015\/510 of the European Central Bank of 19 December 2014 on the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (General Documentation Guideline) (ECB\/2014\/60) (1), Whereas: (1) Pursuant to Article 1(4) of Guideline (EU) 2015\/510 (ECB\/2014\/60), the Governing Council may, at any time, change the tools, instruments, requirements, criteria and procedures for the implementation of Eurosystem monetary policy operations. (2) On 22 July 2019, in pursuing its price stability mandate and to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and support the accommodative stance of monetary policy in Member States whose currency is the euro, the Governing Council adopted Decision (EU) 2019\/1311 of the European Central Bank (ECB\/2019\/21) (2). This Decision provides for a third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs-III) to be conducted over the period September 2019 to March 2021. (3) On 12 March 2020, in order to support bank lending to those most affected by the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, the Governing Council decided to change certain key parameters of TLTROs-III. Moreover, on 30 April 2020, in order to further support the provision of credit to households and firms in the face of the prevalent economic disruptions and heightened uncertainty, the Governing Council decided on certain further changes to these parameters. Decision (EU) 2020\/407 of the European Central Bank (ECB\/2020\/13) (3) and Decision (EU) 2020\/614 of the European Central Bank (ECB\/2020\/25) (4) implement these changes. (4) On 10 December 2020, the Governing Council decided to adopt additional monetary policy measures aiming to contribute to preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. As part of these measures, the Governing Council decided to further recalibrate the conditions of TLTROs-III. In particular, it decided to extend the period over which considerably more favourable terms will apply to June 2022, that three additional operations will be conducted between June and December 2021, and to raise the total amount that Eurosystem counterparties will be entitled to borrow in TLTROs-III from 50% to 55% of their stock of eligible loans. In order to provide an incentive for banks to sustain the current level of bank lending, the Governing Council also decided that the extension of the more favourable terms on TLTROs-III to June 2022 will be made available only to banks that achieve a new lending performance target. Decision (EU) 2021\/124 of the European Central Bank (ECB\/2021\/3) implemented these changes (5). (5) The sanctions related to non-compliance with the deadlines set for submitting reports and auditor evaluations should be adjusted to make the sanctioning regime more proportionate while still aiming to ensure that participants comply with the deadlines set. In addition, the cases in which participants are permitted to switch from individual to group participation or join existing TLTRO-III groups as well as the procedure to be followed in such cases should be clarified. Furthermore, provision should be made for an exemption from the obligation to submit a further auditor's evaluation in relation to reports revised due to corporate reorganisations or changes in the composition of TLTRO-III groups. Lastly, the reporting requirements and relevant interest rate calculations in the event of a change in the TLTRO-III group composition or of a corporate reorganisation that occurs between 1 April 2021 and 31 December 2021 should be clarified. (6) The changes to the sanctions for non-compliance with reporting and auditing requirements and the provisions regarding the treatment of corporate reorganisations occurring after 31 March 2021 for the purpose of calculating TLTRO-III interest rates introduced by this Decision should be made known to credit institutions as soon as possible. Therefore, this Decision should enter into force without delay.

Finland is among the most advanced economies in the EU and among the front-runners in digital technologies and clean energy innovation. The government has also set particularly ambitious objectives for climate action, reaching carbon neutrality by 2035 and becoming the world's first fossil-free welfare society. Nevertheless, the country faces significant challenges, in particular a productivity decline after its electronic sector contracted and an ageing population combined with an employment rate lower than its Nordic neighbours. Furthermore, productive investment in Finland remains low compared to its EU peers. Addressing these challenges will strengthen the growth potential of the economy and make it more inclusive and resilient to external shocks. The medium-term reform plans announced by the new government look promising, although they may face political and implementation hurdles. Finland's business cycle has passed its peak. Real GDP is expected to have increased by 1.4% in 2019 after 1.7% in 2018 and 3.1% in 2017. Lower GDP growth results mainly from lower net exports and less dynamic investment, in particular investment in equipment. Lower employment growth is weighing on consumer spending, while construction of residential housing is clearly decelerating. Inflation remains close to the EU average. Finland's economic growth is projected to slow down from 2.1% over the previous three years to an average annual rate of 1.0% in 2020-2021. In the coming years, public investment is expected to partly offset the loss of momentum in global trade expansion. The country's shrinking workforce is set to affect growth potential relatively soon as well as the long-term sustainability of public finances. The workforce appears to be ageing faster than previously estimated. As a result, the labour force's contribution to potential GDP growth is expected to turn negative as early as 2021. The decline in the working-age population and the ageing of the overall population are soon expected to have a negative impact on public finances, notably through increasing health care, long-term care and pension expenditure weighing directly on the sustainability of public finances. Raising employment to the declared target of 75% could help Finland deal with the demographic challenge and improve the sustainability of public finances. A major objective for the new government is to attain a 75% employment rate (15-64-year olds) by 2023 (72.6% in 2019). It will require a large range of measures, especially in a low economic growth context. In particular, several characteristics of the labour market and of the social benefit system tend to affect the job opportunities of people who belong to some specific groups, while rising vacancy rates and labour shortages suggest a need to invest in skills. Tackling these issues could require structural reforms of the social benefit system, which could be politically challenging. These could include addressing the 'unemployment tunnel', which allows extended unemployment benefit to older people ahead of the statutory retirement age. Raising productivity appears to be key to offsetting the negative impact of the demographic challenge. Investment remains below EU average for categories that most support productivity growth, notably investment in equipment and in intellectual property. This impedes the growth potential and weighs on the country's competitiveness. Furthermore, labour shortages in high-skilled sectors suggest a need for investing in skills that contribute to higher productivity. The new government's plans to increase public investment in the coming years, notably in skills, education, R&D and infrastructure, could strengthen the economy's capacity to face these challenges. Focusing investment-related economic policy on human capital, on research and innovation, on low carbon and energy transition, and on sustainable transport, would strengthen the country's long-term growth potential. While the overall investment level in Finland appears largely satisfactory, investing further in people's skills, education and training and in coordinated professional services available to the unemployed and the inactive is needed to offset workforce losses from population ageing, reduce inactivity and long-term unemployment and potentially increase productivity. Employment would also benefit from investment in social inclusion. The ratio of R&D to GDP has not recovered since the crisis years and appears to be insufficient to diversify exports towards higher tech goods in the medium term. The decarbonisation of energy-intensive industries and the transport sector will also require higher private and public investment. Finland has made limited ( 2 ) progress in addressing the 2019 country-specific recommendations. There has been some progress in the following area: Reforms are being implemented to strengthen skills and inclusion, notably through well-integrated services and higher funding for continuous learning in vocational education and training and tertiary education. Measures to mitigate risks to the financial system as a whole have been adopted and other measures are being drafted to strengthen the monitoring of the household debt. There has been limited progress in the following areas: The government plans to continue the social and healthcare reform initiated by Juha Sipila's government (2015-2019). The reform is expected to be adopted by the end of the government's term. Improving incentives to work is a long-term process that entails simplifying the complex benefit system, while keeping its capacity to reduce poverty and inequalities. The benefits system reform process is expected to be implemented gradually over two government terms (to be completed by 2027). As regards investment-related economic policy on research and innovation, low carbon and energy transition and sustainable transport, the Finnish government has announced plans to strengthen investment in these areas. Work on the credit registry is still in the planning phase: the necessary legislative work on data protection has started in early 2020, while work on the credit registry itself might incur delays. The authorities are committed to having the necessary legislation in place by 2023. Finland performs well on the indicators of the Social Scoreboard supporting the European Pillar of Social rights. The good overall results reflect Finland's advanced welfare model with a strong social dialogue. Income inequalities are among the lowest in the EU and few people are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Finland continues to have an education system that generally performs well. It scores well on digital skills, although a lack of specialists seems to create obstacles for companies in the information and communication services sector. Access to health care remains a concern, given the relatively high unmet health care needs. Regarding progress in reaching the national targets under the Europe 2020 strategy, the employment rate target of 78% (20-64-years old) appears to be within reach, although the low-growth environment may pose challenges. The poverty rate is low compared to the EU average, but recently it has slightly increased and the national target seems to be out of reach. The school-drop-out rate ('early school leaving') remained slightly above the target of 8%. The very ambitious R&D investment target of 4% of GDP is unlikely to be met. However, Finland is broadly on track to reaching its 2020 climate and energy targets. Finland is a front-runner in integrating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into public policies, and performs better than the EU average on most of those. Moreover, the country is further improving its ranking for most SDGs, but with significant progress made on SDG8 decent work and economic growth, while it is moving moderately away from SDG9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure ( 3 ). Key structural issues analysed in this report that point to particular challenges for Finland's economy are the following: Weaknesses in the policy framework have hindered the participation of certain groups in the labour market. These groups notably include low-skilled men, workers close to retirement, people with a migrant background, people with partial work ability and persons with disabilities. Spending on policies to help people find or stay in work is lower in Finland than in other Nordic countries. Moreover, dispersed services for the unemployed and inactive may hinder the activation the activation of some specific groups in the labour marget. Other factors holding back employment are related to weak incentives inherent in the complex social benefit system. Unemployment and inactivity traps and lack of flexibility in combining income from part-time work and various benefits may somewhat hold back an increase in the employment rate. The government plans to address these issues, including through a long-term reform of the social benefit system; however, the reform is at an early stage of preparation and cannot be assessed yet. Demographic trends pose some risks for the sustainability of public finances and accessibility of health and long-term care services. Finland's shrinking workforce and the ageing-related long-term trends in spending is set to affect the long-term sustainability of the country's public finances (see above). Furthermore, the high unmet health care needs remain a concern, especially for people not covered by occupational insurance. A major reform of the healthcare system is currently being considered and is expected to be largely based on the plans and objectives of Juha Sipila's government. Productivity growth remains a challenge. Finland's productive investment remains close to, or even below, the EU average for categories such as equipment, including information and communication technology equipment, and intellectual property products. Moreover, productive investment is rather narrowly concentrated, with an increasing gap between the most productive firms and those that are the least productive. Some structural factors might be holding back investment. The most commonly cited barrier to investment is the availability of skilled staff, notably in the information and communication services sector. Other impediments are: i) lengthy procedures for obtaining business permits; ii) the still limited cooperation between businesses and academia; iii) lack of coordination of smart specialisation at central level; and iv) the still modest access to finance for seed capital companies. Household debt remains high but the banking sector is well capitalised. Household debt, including through housing corporations, remains at historically high levels, supported by persistently low interest rates. The predominance of variable rates could create risks if interest rates rise in the medium term. Consumer credit is also rising. The lack of a comprehensive (positive) credit registry prevents banks from having a clear overview of households' overall debt. However, the servicing of debt remains solid, and banks remain well capitalised. Moreover, further measures to contain the rising household debt are being considered. There are some weaknesses in the measures taken to tackle money laundering. Finland intends to update its national risk assessment of money-laundering and terrorist financing, as the current assessment dates from 2015. Preparatory work is expected to be completed in 2020. The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority has made progress in boosting its supervisory capacity but there is scope for further improvement as regards human resources. There is also scope for applying a risk-based approach to supervision. Cooperation with the Financial Intelligence Unit beyond providing guidance to obliged entities is limited. Finland is broadly on track to reaching its 2020 climate targets, but its objective of reaching carbon neutrality by 2035 will require an ambitious set of new measures. The Finnish government intends to achieve this objective, notably with a further electrification of the economy, and by largely using nuclear fuel and renewable energy to generate power. This will require a comprehensive agenda of policies and measures. In this respect, decarbonising energy-intensive industries and the transport sector appear as key objectives. Sizeable investment in low carbon and energy transition as well as in sustainable transport infrastructure is being considered. The government has announced an overhaul of energy taxation and it will phase out fossil fuel subsidies on oil, coal and, possibly, peat. Waste management is advanced, but the country's recycling rate remains below the EU average. The Commission's proposal for a Just Transition Mechanism under the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2021-2027, includes a Just Transition Fund, a dedicated just transition scheme under InvestEU, and a new public sector loan facility with the EIB. It is designed to ensure that the transition towards EU climate neutrality is fair, by helping the most affected regions in Finland to address the social and economic consequences. Key priorities for support by the Just Transition Fund, set up as part of the Just Transition Mechanism, are identified in Annex D, building on the analysis of the transition challenges outlined in this report. 1. Economic situation and outlook GDP growth Economic expansion is expected to ease. Finland's real GDP is estimated to have increased by 1.6% in 2019 (see Graph 1.1), having already decreased in 2018 (1.7%), following robust growth performances in 2016 and 2017. Growth is forecast to have been broad-based, with positive and balanced contributions from all components. Gradual cyclical slowdown in advanced economies, weakening external demand and a period of increased uncertainties, are all expected to weigh on growth. Falling consumer confidence and lower employment growth might affect private consumption, and construction investment is likely to fall. This is expected to be partly offset by an expansionary fiscal stance. In 2020 and 2021, GDP growth is forecast to decelerate, as the contribution from net exports turns negative. Graph 1.1:GDP growth and contributions Source: European Commission (Autumn forecast 2019) Potential growth Finland's potential GDP growth prospects are affected by a gradually shrinking working-age population. The number of births declined by around 20% over the last decade and the latest update of the population projections implies even faster ageing than previously estimated. Labour contribution to potential GDP growth is expected to be negative as early as from 2021 onwards (see Graph 1.2). Assuming that current trends continue, this negative impact is anticipated to gradually increase over the coming years. While the contribution of total factor productivity and capital accumulation are projected to offset in excess the negative impact of ageing, these demographic trends are expected to represent a substantial drag on potential growth. Graph 1.2:Contributions to potential growth TFP: total factor productivity PF potential growth: production function potential growth Source: European Commission The impact of a structural change from manufacturing to services activities has affected Finland's aggregate productivity. From 2000 to 2018, the relative share of GDP at current prices of the highly productive manufacturing sector (average labour productivity growth of 3.4% over 2000-2018) declined by 10 percentage points (pps). At the same time, the aggregated share of construction, real estate, professional and non-market services activities, whose average productivity growth was close to zero or negative, increased by 8 percentage points. This progressive structural shift is a long-term phenomenon that could continue to negatively affect Finland's overall potential economic growth in the years ahead. Moreover, the share of high-tech services in GDP (information & communications), whose productivity growth is high (3.3% over 2000-2018), increased by only 1 percentage point. Low levels in the categories of productivity-enhancing investment( 4 ) could prevent Finland from achieving higher potential growth rates (see Section 3.4). Finland's level of investment remains close to, or even below the EU average for investment categories that most support productivity growth. In particular, equipment investment has been among the lowest in the EU for many years, which applies specifically to ICT equipment. This is a puzzling phenomenon in an otherwise strongly digitalised economy (see Section 3.4). Furthermore, after the technological disruption that affected the country's largest private R&D investor a decade ago, investment in intellectual property slightly recovered in 2018, but remains markedly below the level of its Nordic peers (Sweden and Denmark). Graph 1.3:Investment: total construction and housing construction - Finland and the EU As a share of value-added Source: European Commission Construction, a less productive investment category, remains predominant at 61% of total investment ( 5 ). The country still has the highest level of construction investment in the EU (see Graph 1.3). Housing construction is particularly high, as people move from rural areas to dynamic urban centres. Beyond still favourable conditions provided to borrowers, public investment in social housing and public incentives to housing construction remain sizeable. The average labour productivity growth of the construction sector is close to zero (-0.1% over the 2000-2018 period). However, amidst high territorial dispersion and limited regional labour mobility, housing construction in dynamic urban centres is expected to contribute to higher allocative efficiency. Inflation Inflation failed to pick up in 2019, remaining below the euro area average (see Graph 1.4). The pass-through from higher wages into services was smaller than in the past. Expected slower economic growth and low external price pressures implies that the period of low inflation is likely to continue, remaining below 2% over the next 2 years. Graph 1.4:Annual harmonised index of consumer prices, Finland, annual average, % change Source: European Commission Labour market After 4 years of economic growth, the labour market situation has improved, but a slowdown is expected. Employment continued increasing in 2018, both in absolute terms and in the percentage of the workforce. It increased by 2.1 pps in 2018 to reach 76.3% (20-64 year-olds), partly due to a drop in inactivity. Employment is expected to continue growing in 2019 and 2020, albeit at a slower pace. The unemployment rate has been decreasing steadily since 2016. It stood at 7.4% in 2018 down from 8.6% recorded in 2017, although still slightly above the EU average. The new government has set an ambitious employment target to be reached by the end of 2023 (see Section 3.3). The still relatively high unemployment suggests structural bottlenecks in the labour market. Youth unemployment decreased substantially in 2018 but remains above the EU average. Similarly, the activity rate is catching up but the employment figures are still below those of Nordic peers, and even below the EU average for some age groups. Among the reasons for inactivity are disincentives to work, inactivity traps, unemployment traps, bureaucratic traps, caring responsibilities, illness or disability, as well as relatively low regional mobility. Wage growth was moderate in 2018 and 2019. Real wages improved modestly in 2018. This should have changed in 2019, due to a tightening labour market (see Section 3.3). Unit labour cost is expected to have increasing in 2019 slightly faster than in the EU on average, thus not overly affecting competitiveness. Social developments The risk of poverty, social exclusion and income inequality remains among the lowest in the EU, despite a slight increase. At 16.5% in 2018 (15.7% in 2017), the risk of poverty or social exclusion remains below the EU average of 21.9%. The ratio of the income of the richest 20% compared to the poorest 20% has remained broadly stable (3.6 in 2018). Finland remains among the best performers in the EU as fighting poverty and social transfers play a major role in reducing poverty. In 2018, social transfers reduced the risk of poverty by 53.7% and the poverty gap by 82% (the EU averages are respectively 33.2% and 55%). In 2018, the income share of the poorest 40% of the population stood at 24%, being among the highest in the EU (EU average 21%). Still, the ageing population and the rising age-related expenditure remain concerns for the long-term sustainability of the Finnish public finances. Regional disparities Regional disparities have slightly decreased in recent years, but there is still a gap between the capital region and the less developed region of North and East Finland. In terms of GDP per head, the Greater Helsinki region stood notably above the EU average (142%) in 2017 and 1.5 times higher than the weakest North and East region, where GDP per head corresponds to 91% of the EU average. In 2010, the capital region's GDP per head was 1.7 times higher than that for North and East Finland. Graph 1.5:Regional convergence: average GDP per head growth in 2010-2017 vs. GDP in 2010 Source: European Commission Staff calculations The decrease in regional disparities is largely due to a slow recovery in the capital region in 2010-2017 (see Graph 1.5). During this period, all regions except North and East Finland expanded at a considerably slower pace than the EU average growth rate of 1.2%. The GDP per head in Helsinki region declined, while other regions in mainland Finland modestly grew (between 0.24% and 1.19% annually), with South Finland and North and East Finland above the country average. Regional unemployment and activity rates have been converging in recent years. The dispersion of NUTS2 ( 6 ) regional employment rates is now at 3.2 pps, one of the lowest rates in the EU. The North and East region is lagging behind in terms of employment. Graph 1.6:Nominal unit labour costs in total economy (2015=100) Source: European Commission Competitiveness In 2019, the nominal labour costs are expected to have increased in Finland slightly faster than in its Nordic peers (see Graph 1.6) . In 2019, nominal wages are expected to have grown relatively strongly (3.1%), only partly offset by a small recovery in productivity growth (0.4%). Overall, this is set to have further pushed up nominal unit labour costs, opening the risk of decreasing the cost-competitiveness edge gained in previous years. In parallel, comparatively lower productive investment is expected to continue to weigh on productivity, and therefore, in particular, on non-cost competitiveness (see Graph 1.7). Furthermore, if business creation were to be below EU average, it might hamper the swift economic redeployment towards high-tech activities (see Section 3.4). In recent years, export market shares recovered, reducing past cumulated losses. In 2018, exports benefited from the continued recovery in world trade (see Graph 1.8) and increased shipbuilding export. However, overall, the recovery in Finland's market shares is small compared to accumulated losses since 2008. In 2019, unit labour costs are expected to have reverted to positive growth and the real effective exchange rate appreciated slightly. In the years ahead, import growth is expected to marginally outpace export growth. As unit labour costs are set to increase faster in Finland than in the EU as a whole, further market share gains for Finland are expected to be limited. Graph 1.7:Breakdown of balance of trade for goods (fuels not included) 2001-2018 Cost and non-cost competitiveness impact (1) Only goods for which both imports and exports, as well as volumes, are taken into account. As a result, in 2018, the total trade balance (without fuels) in the Graph was US$ 0.13 bn or 0.12 bn, instead of the actual trade balance of 0.82 bn. (2) Cost and non-cost competitiveness are defined in the report by comparing the unit values of exports (UVX) and imports (UVM) and the trade balance for each category of goods (four digits categories). If UVX > UVM, and if the trade balance for the particular category of goods TB > 0, it is a case of non-cost competitiveness. Another case of non-cost competitiveness is when UVX < UVM and TB < 0. When UVX < UVM and TB > 0 or when UVX > UVM and TB < 0), it is a case of cost competitiveness. Where there is strong non-cost competitiveness in a category of goods, there is a trade surplus, and, where non-cost competitiveness in a category of goods is weak, there is a trade deficit. The same applies to cost competitiveness (European Central Bank, 2012). Source: European Commission External position In 2019, both current account and trade balance deficits narrowed slightly. The current account balance improved from -1.4% of GDP to -1.1% of GDP, while the trade balance improved by 0.5 pps to -0.7% of GDP (see Graph 1.9). The current account balance is still below (-0.7%) what can be explained by fundamentals (Countinho et al., 2018). The trade balance for goods remained slightly positive, while the deficit on services decreased due to strong rise in exports of telecommunications, computer and information services. These account for almost 35% of the total exports of services ( 7 ). Overall, Finland is relatively more exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as 5 out of its top 7 export markets are non-euro area countries (goods exports by country in 2018: Germany 15.1%, Sweden 10.4%, United States and the Netherlands 6.8%, China 5.5%, Russia 5.2%, and the UK 4.5%). Graph 1.8: Export market shares (EMS): EMS growth rate, export growth, world export growth (negative sign) Source: European Commission Finland's net international investment position has slightly improved and reverted to positive values in 2019. It improved from 2.0% of GDP in 2018 to 3.5% in 2019 (see Graph 1.10). Both gross assets and liabilities have increased markedly in the fourth quarter of 2018, due to the move of a major bank's headquarters from Sweden to Helsinki. At the end of 2019, the financial sector accounted for almost half of total liabilities, while the relative share of non-financial corporations in total liabilities declined. Government social security funds remain the largest net positive sector, followed by the central bank and collective investment schemes. Graph 1.9:Breakdown of external position (current and capital accounts) Source: European Commission Financial sector and household debt Finland's banking system remains robust and is now one of the EU's largest in relative terms. Its balance sheet is four times the country's GDP. The banks are highly capitalised and have low ratios of non-performing assets. In terms of risk, the banking sector is heavily reliant on wholesale market funding and has potential substantial exposure to other Nordic financial systems. The credit risk is strongly linked to high households' indebtedness. It stood at 140% of household disposable income in 2019. Total private sector debt amounted to 142% of GDP in 2018, in line with fundamentals-based benchmarks (European Commission, 2018a) but above prudential, estimated at around 125% of GDP. Both non-financial corporations and household debt lie above their prudential values (of 56% and 68% of GDP, respectively), while household debt, at 65% of GDP in 2018 is also above its fundamental value of around 57% of GDP). European Systematic Risk Board issued recommendations in June 2019 (European Systemic Risk Board, 2019) that call for activation of income-related borrowers-based measures. As one of the proposed measures to curb household indebtedness, the authorities have started preparatory work to establish a comprehensive credit registry by 2023. Housing market There is continued and growing disparity in house prices between the bigger cities and the rest of Finland. On a country level, by third quarter prices increased in nominal terms both for new buildings and existing housing stock, but deflated prices of existing housing stock were slightly lower than in 2018. However, prices in Helsinki and the bigger cities (where there is a net migration) are clearly rising faster than in the rest of the country. There is likely to be little price pressure, due to the construction of a high number of new buildings in recent years, which increased the stock of unsold dwellings. As indicated by the decreasing number of building permits and building starts, it is likely that the supply of new dwellings will drop in 2020 and 2021, putting more upward pressure on prices in the medium term. Graph 1.10:Breakdown of the international investment position (% of GDP) Source: European Commission Public finances The general government headline balance is forecast to deteriorate. According to the Commission 2019 Autumn Forecast, the deficit is expected to increase from -0.8% of GDP in 2018 to -1.1% of GDP in 2019. While economic and employment developments continue to support tax revenues and contain spending on social benefits, the outlook for government revenue has clearly deteriorated in line with macroeconomic trends. Furthermore, higher-than-expected spending by local authorities in the first half of 2019 further deteriorated the projected balance. The recent statistical data revisions also resulted in the balance for 2018 deteriorating by 0.1 pp. The general government balance is forecast to further deteriorate to -1.4% of GDP in 2020 and assuming no-policy-change to -1.6% of GDP in 2021. The public debt-to-GDP ratio may approach the 60% benchmark ratio in the medium term. Finland reduced its gross public debt from the peak of 63% of GDP in 2016 to 59% of GDP in 2018. The Commission forecasts that the government debt ratio will remain close to this level in 2019 and 2020, and will start increasing in 2021. In the long term, the costs of ageing, in particular related to healthcare and long-term care, are projected to weigh on the sustainability of Finland's public finances. Sustainable development governance Finland is a front-runner in integrating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into public policies ( 8 ), and performs better than EU average on most of those. Finland was one of the first countries in the world to prepare a national programme to interpret the United Nations' 2030 Agenda. It was one of the first countries to voluntarily report on its progress at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development 2030 Agenda in July 2016 ( 9 ). Unsurprisingly, Finland ranks higher than EU average for most SDGs, except on a few sub-items. Overall, the country is improving its ranking for 11 SDGs, out of 17, but with significant progress made on three of them: Decent work and economic growth (SDG8), Climate action (SDG13) and Peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG16). It is moving moderately away from three SDGs: Partnership for the goals (SDG17), No poverty (SDG1) and Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9) (see Annex E). Table 1.1:Key economic and financial indicators - Finland Source: Eurostat and ECB as of 4-2-2020, where available; European Commission for forecast figures (Winter forecast 2020 for real GDP and HICP, Autumn forecast 2019 otherwise) 2. Progress with country-specific recommendations Finland has achieved some progress in implementing the country-specific recommendations (CSRs) addressed to it since 2011 ( 10 ). Overall, Finland has recorded at least 'some' progress on 70% of all CSRs addressed to it since 2011, and 'limited' progress on the remaining 30% of the CSRs. Over recent years, Finland has been addressing the challenges to the long-term sustainability of public finances by adopting a pension reform that came into force in 2017. External sector challenges have abated and cost competitiveness has improved thanks in particular to the measures in the Competitiveness Pact of 2016. Finland has also taken action to increase incentives to accept work and to strengthen active labour market policies. Graph 2.1:Overall multiannual implementation of 2011-2019 county-specific-recommendations to date * The overall assessment of the country-specific recommendations related to fiscal policy excludes compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact ** 2011 annual assessment: Different CSR assessment categories ** The multiannual CSR assessment looks at the implementation of the CSRs since they were first adopted up until the 2020 Country Report. Source: European Commission The pension reform has strengthened the long-term sustainability of public finances. The ageing population is putting pressure on the pension and healthcare systems. The reform of the earnings-related pension system, which linked statutory retirement age to life expectancy, was enacted in late 2015. Under the reform, the lowest statutory retirement age has gradually started to rise from 63 to 65 as from 2018. In 2019, the minimum retirement age was 63 years and 6 months. Efforts to improve cost-efficiency of healthcare services are still ongoing. The gradual improvement of cost competitiveness has been supported by the implementation of the CSRs since 2014. Progress has been made in aligning wage growth with productivity developments, which has resulted in a slower increase of unit labour costs and improved cost-competitiveness relative to competitor economies. A new Finnish wage-setting model was being discussed. In this model, pay rises in the non-tradable sector would have been linked to the increases first agreed in the tradable sector. However, no formal agreement on this link was reached. Reforms in the labour market have advanced, but activity of some groups is still low. Several measures have been introduced to activate unemployed job seekers, such as carrying out regular interviews with the unemployed. In order to increase incentives to work, the earnings-related unemployment insurance was been cut in time several years ago. Nevertheless, dispersed services for unemployed and inactive people may still hamper the activation of some specific groups in the labour market. Moreover, spending on active labour market policies is still lower in Finland than in other Nordic countries. Finland has taken measures in several policy areas and has made limited ( 11 ) progress in addressing its 2019 CSRs. To improve the long-term sustainability of public finances, the government plans to continue the social and healthcare reform initiated by the previous government. The reform still aims at addressing the fragmentation of the system and the related financial challenges faced by small, remote municipalities. The centralisation of service provision to the county level is being considered and would likely lead to increases in efficiency. Accessibility to health and long-term care would be promoted by means of strengthening the primary care system. The government plans to adopt the reform by the end of its term. On addressing labour market and social challenges, more integrated and personalised services are expected thanks to the announced work ability reform as well as a result of the service experiments carried out in municipalities. The reform of vocational education and training is in its final stages of implementation and the funding model should increase incentives to strengthen links with businesses and provide more re-skilling and upskilling opportunities for adults. Similar development is expected in tertiary education in 2021, when its new funding scheme will enter into force. Moreover, the government is launching a 'continuous learning' reform to help adult workers address skills shortages. Other factors holding back employment are related to disincentives inherent in the complex social benefit system. Unemployment and inactivity traps, the 'unemployment tunnel' as well as a lack of flexibility in combining work income and various social benefits constitute impediments to higher employment rate. The government plans to address some of these issues through a long-term reform of the social benefit system. Increasing the minimum age for extended unemployment benefits, the so-called 'unemployment tunnel', from 61 to 62 and deployment of the real-time income register are improving incentives to take up work or to remain at work. On investment-related economic policy, the amount of public money to support research and development is expected to increase. In parallel, the government's objective is to make Finland carbon neutral by 2035 and the world's first fossil-fuel-free society. This will require a comprehensive agenda of policies and measures, including large investments in low carbon and energy transition as well as in sustainable transport infrastructure. Sustainable infrastructure investment is being planned, notably to increase labour mobility. A new national transport system will be developed in 2020-2021 under the lead of a parliamentary steering group. The government has announced an overhaul of energy taxation, notably with a pledge to phase out fossil fuel subsidies on oil, coal and, possibly, peat. Some progress has been observed in the monitoring of the household debt. Private-sector debt remains at historically high levels, as a result of persistently low interest rates. However, the servicing of debt remains solid, and banks remain well capitalised. Moreover, in early October, the Ministry of Finance proposed to limit to 60% the loan to value ratio (selling price ratio) applicable to housing companies. In parallel, a debt-to-income ratio will be applied to households when their loan requests exceed a certain threshold, while the legislation relating to consumer credit has been tightened. Further macro-prudential measures to contain the household debt are being considered. Work on the credit registry is still being planned. The government has recently decided that the credit registry is to be managed by a public entity. The necessary legislative work on data protection was expected to start in January 2020, while work on the registry itself might be delayed. Nevertheless, the authorities are committed to having the necessary legislation in place by 2023. Upon request from a Member State, the Commission can provide tailor-made expertise via the structural reform support programme to help design and implement growth-enhancing reforms. Since 2019, such support has been provided to Finland for three projects that involved i) facilitating domestic and foreign investment by assessing the impact of regulations on international investment in Finland, ii) measuring the size of the digital economy in Finland and its impact on taxation, and iii) proposing an improved VAT reporting model. Table 2.1:Assessment of 2019 CSR implementation (*) (1) This does not include an assessment of compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Source: European Commission (*) The assessment of CSR 3 does not take into account the contribution of the EU 2021-2027 cohesion policy funds. The regulatory framework underpinning the programming of the 2021-2027 EU cohesion policy funds has not yet been adopted by the co-legislators, pending inter alia an agreement on the multiannual financial framework (MFF). Box 2.1: EU funds and programmes to address structural challenges and to foster growth and competitiveness in Finland Finland is a beneficiary of EU support. The financial allocation from the EU Cohesion policy funds for Finland amounts to 2.6 billion ( I ) in the current Multiannual Financial Framework, equivalent to around 0.2% of the GDP annually. By the end of 2019, some 2.1 billion (around 79% of the total) was allocated to specific projects and 1.2 billion was reported as spent by the selected projects ( II ) showing a level of implementation well above the average. EU Cohesion policy funding also contributes to addressing structural challenges in Finland. The Cohesion Policy programmes for Finland have allocated EU funding of 581.9 million for smart growth, 186.5 million for sustainable growth and 502.7 million for inclusive growth. In 2019 following the performance review ( III ) 160.9 million have been made available within performing priorities. EU Cohesion policy funding is contributing to transformations of the Finnish economy and society by promoting growth and employment via investments, among others, in research, technological development and innovation, competitiveness of enterprises, low carbon society, employment, education and social inclusion. By 2019, investments driven by the ERDF have already led to the creation of more than 5,800 new jobs and 320 new enterprises. Almost 10,000 companies had participated in projects run by research and development institutions, more than 1,400 companies had started to export or expand their exports. The ESF supported over 200,000 participants finding a job, among which over 30,000 long-term employed and 26,000 migrants. Moreover, to tackle youth unemployment, the ESF has invested in projects to improve educational outcomes and access to the labour market for over 37,000 participants under 30 years old ( IV ). Agricultural and fisheries funds and other EU programmes also contribute to addressing the investment needs. The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EARDF) makes available in total 5.7 billion, and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) in total 141 million (including the national co-financing for both). Finland benefits also from other EU programmes, such as for example the Connecting Europe Facility, which allocated EU funding of 190 million to specific projects on strategic transport networks; or Horizon 2020, which allocated EU funding of 1.1 billion (including 340 SMEs with about 216 million). EU funding contributes to mobilisation of important private investment. European Structural and Investment funds (ESIF) supported programmes alone mobilise additional capital by committing about 43 million in the form of loans, guarantees and equity. EU funds already invest on actions in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In Finland, European Structural and Investment Funds support 12 out the 17 SDGs and up to 98% of the expenditure is contributing to those. 3. Reform priorities 3.1.Public finances and taxation 3.1.1.fiscal policies Fiscal policies helped lower the deficit by reducing public expenditure in 2015-2017. The general government balance improved from its lowest at -3% of GDP in 2014 to -0.8% in 2018, in the context of economic growth and fiscal consolidation. Between 2014 and 2017, the government expenditure as a proportion of GDP fell from 58.1% to 54.2% (see Graph 3.1.1). It was driven mainly by cuts in spending on health, education, economic affairs as well as social protection. The public wage bill has also come down due to the measures in the 2017 Competitiveness Pact (wage freeze and a temporary reduction in holiday bonuses), lowering expenditure on general public services by 0.4% of GDP. Total public spending remained second highest in the EU, still well above the EU average (54.2% vs 45.8%). Graph 3.1.1:General government expenditure as a proportion of GDP, broken down by function, Finland and the EU (1) The classes of the functions of government (COGOF) are: 1. General public services; 2. Defence; 3. Public order and safety; 4. Economic affairs; 5. Environmental protection; 6. Housing and community amenities; 7. Health; 8. Recreation, culture and religion; 9. Education and 10. Social protection. Source: Eurostat In 2019, the government decided to change the fiscal stance and pursue expansionary policies by means of fostering structural reforms. The government's plans anticipate a permanent increase in annual expenditure by 1.1 billion (0.5% of GDP) in 2020, increasing to 1.4 billion by 2023. The government also plans to spend a total of 3.1 billion (1.3% of GDP) on 'future-oriented investments' in 2020-2023. The planned increases in spending will be directed towards labour market and social security reforms, investment in education and health care as well as the maintenance of transport infrastructure. Tax hikes, asset sales and the projected increase in income taxes from new jobs are the main sources of finance for the government programme. The new permanent expenditures are planned to be primarily covered through increases of excise duties reaching 0.7 billion (0.3% of GDP) by 2023. The government plans to cover the remaining gap to achieve a balanced budget in 2023 from the expected revenue from the higher employment rate. The 'future-oriented investments', which the government plans to phase out by 2023, are to be financed by sales of State assets. The initial expenditure-revenue mismatch on top of underlying trends is expected to lead to the general government balance deteriorating (see Graph 3.1.2). The headline deficit is forecast to increase from 1.1% of GDP in 2019 to 1.4% of GDP in 2020 and 1.6% of GDP in 2021. Graph 3.1.2:Drivers of change in general government balance Source: European Commission It is not certain that the higher public spending will lead to a proportional increase in the public debt. Finland has a large stock of financial assets that the government is going to use to finance part of this planned expenditure. Finland reduced its gross public debt from the peak of 63% of GDP in 2016 to 59% of GDP in 2018. The Commission forecasts that the government debt ratio will remain close to this level in 2019 and 2020. It will start increasing in 2021, not least due to substantial military expenditure that will kick in. Taxation Finland's tax structure is characterised by a high overall tax burden skewed to labour and consumption. In 2018, the total tax burden (43.2% of GDP) was among the highest in the EU. This is mostly driven by a relatively high level of personal income taxation (12.2% of GDP) and of taxes on consumption (14.2% of GDP). By contrast, revenues from capital taxes, including recurrent immovable property taxes, are at 7.1% of GDP, somewhat below the EU average. The government decided to continue the gradual tax shift away from taxation of labour income towards consumption taxes. It proposed a moderate decrease of the personal income tax by adjusting lower and middle income tax brackets. The tax base will be strengthened by phasing out the mortgage interest deduction and reducing the tax credit for household expenses. At the same time, increases in excise duties on tobacco products, soft drinks are scheduled, which can lead to health and welfare benefits. Taxes on transport fuels will also increase in 2020. The reform of immovable property taxation remains on the agenda. The aim is to ensure a better overall match between the immovable property tax base and the market value of properties. The government programme points out that immovable property taxes must take into account the environmental aspects. Regarding taxes on capital, the government is also studying the prospects for introducing, from 2022 onwards, a 5% withholding tax on dividends payable to foreign funds and other corporations that are currently exempt from dividend tax. Revenue from environmentally-related taxes remains above the EU average,. Environmental taxes accounted for 2.9% of GDP in 2018 (EU average 2.4%), and energy taxes for 1.9% of GDP on the same level as the EU average. While subsidies had almost disappeared by 2016, tax exemptions remained in place in 2016 for fossil fuels used in transport ( 12 ), mobile machinery, agriculture, energy-intensive businesses, heating, etc. These exemptions totalled 1.6 billion (or 0.7% of GDP) in 2016 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2020). A general tax reform for sustainable development will cover energy taxation, transport taxation, promotion of the circular economy and will include a study on the taxation of emissions-based consumption. The General Government Fiscal Plan for 2020-2023 includes appropriations for the carbon neutrality targets, the wellbeing of the environment and biodiversity, reducing emissions, supporting renewable energy and public transport. Efforts to improve tax compliance continue with the implementation of the income register and deployment of special tax number systems. The income register (see also European Commission, 2019a) became operational in 2019, and the first experiences have revealed that some corrective measures are needed to make sure that the data are reported correctly. There will be more support provided to small businesses and civil society organisations. The income register will be expanded in two separate stages. As from 2020, all data users who are covered under the Income Register Act began to use the income register data. From 2021, data on pensions and benefits will also be reported and enforcement authorities will begin to use income register data. The Finnish Tax Administration has introduced special tax number systems to improve tax collection and prevent a grey economy from developing. Based on the positive experience in the construction industry ( 13 ), the system will be introduced in the shipbuilding sector. The need to introduce it in other sectors, such as tourism and restaurants, will be assessed. Fiscal framework Finland is the only euro area Member State that has designated a Ministry of Finance department as the independent forecast producer in the meaning of Regulation (EU) 473\/2013. The management of the Economics Department and the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance are separated and the Economics Department carries out its forecasting activities independently. However, this particular arrangement warrants regular surveillance to ensure that the separation and independence of both functions within the one institution are preserved. The government follows some 'green budgeting' practices. Since 2017, budget proposals include a chapter focusing on climate change and sustainable development (see Section 3.5). It examines which appropriations included in the budget foster green targets. In particular, it presents the appropriations that promote i) the use of renewable energy, ii) biodiversity and the wellbeing of the environment and nature, iii) emissions reduction, iv) bio-economy solutions and v) developing Finland into a low-carbon society. The chapter also covers taxes that are significant in terms of the goal of a carbon-neutral Finland, such as energy taxes, motor vehicle tax, car tax, excise duty on certain beverage packaging and waste tax. Furthermore, it includes a qualitative assessment of components of public funding that are detrimental to the environment, on the basis of earlier studies. At the beginning of the new term, the government carried out a spending review. Spending reviews are detailed inspections of public expenditure aimed at identifying savings and efficiency gains against the current composition of public expenditure. The previous spending review aimed at providing a detailed description of central government expenditure to be considered in government negotiations after the 2015 elections, with a view also to informing ministers of the new government. The 2019 elections triggered an update of the spending review process. The spending review carried out in the first half of 2019 covered all central government expenditure, including transfers to local governments and social security funds and excluding operational expenditure, expenditure items of less than 50 million and VAT expenses. 3.1.2.Debt sustainability analysis and fiscal risks No significant risks of fiscal stress are anticipated for Finland in the short term. The value of the S0 indicator, the Commission's early-detection indicator of fiscal stress over one year, is below its critical threshold, for both the fiscal and financial competitiveness sub-indices (see Annex B). The low spreads on sovereign yields and credit-default swaps point to a favourable financial market perception of Finland's solvency. Finland is facing fiscal sustainability risks in the medium to long term. The sustainability gap indicator S1 points to medium risks, mainly due to the projected increase in age-related public spending. According to this indicator, a cumulative gradual improvement in the structural primary balance of 0.5% of GDP, relative to the baseline scenario, would be required over 5 years to reach the debt ratio of 60% of GDP by 2034. In the long term, the fiscal sustainability gap indicator S2 points to medium risks. Based on the no-policy-change scenario, the S2 indicator ( 14 ) is estimated at 3.6% of GDP. This is worse than estimated last year, due to the more unfavourable initial budgetary position that will impact the S2 indicator to the tune of 1.7% of GDP out of the 3.6% of GDP (up from 0.7% of GDP last year). The projected contribution of the increase in ageing costs remains high (1.9% of GDP), driven by the projected increase in expenditure on long-term care (1.6% of GDP). Public debt is projected to increase over the forecast period. The debt sustainability analysis points to medium risks over the medium term. Under the baseline scenario of no policy change, the debt ratio is projected to increase gradually to about 62% of GDP in around 2030. The debt will primarily grow due to ageing. If the costs of ageing (pensions, long-term care and healthcare expenditure) were left out of the debt projections, the debt ratio would gradually decline to about 53% of GDP in the same period (see Graph 3.1.3). In addition, debt is also projected to grow due to negative primary balances, which will be partially compensated by a favourable contribution of the snowball effect (see Annex B). If Finland was to comply with all fiscal rules under the Stability and Growth Pact, the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline to about 50% of GDP in 2030. By contrast, government debt in 2030 would reach 65% of GDP if economic growth were lower than in the baseline scenario. Graph 3.1.3:Debt as % of GDP Source: European Commission Healthcare and social care reform The increasing spending on long-term care highlights the urgent need to address the sustainability of the health care system. While expenditure on health care alone is below the EU average in terms of current spending (5.5% of GDP vs 6.6% of GDP in the EU), expenditure on long-term care is at 2.2% of GDP, the fourth highest in the EU. By 2070, spending on health and long-term care is expected to grow due to an ageing population and other non-demographic drivers by 13% and 93% respectively. The financing of healthcare consists mainly of government schemes, 62% compared to 36% of the EU average (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\/EU, 2018). However, the current system is fragmented, and consists of three channels: the municipal system, the national health insurance system and occupational healthcare. The level of out-of-pocket payments is higher than the EU average and has been increasing over the last three years. After the setback in March 2019, the reform of the healthcare system remains on the political agenda. The regional government health and social services (SOTE) reform prepared by the government in 2015-2019 was not presented to the Parliament in the end, due to, among other things, constitutional concerns. The government is planning to implement the revised reform by spring 2023. The main item of the reform is still the consolidation of management of both health and social care services at regional level. The related plans to reorganise public sector administration for these services at State, regional and municipal levels are also maintained. The reform will put more emphasis on equal access to services and their quality. However, increasing the role of private healthcare providers and granting the patients freedom of choice between public and private services, which was included in the previous version of the reform, is no longer considered. The government's reform of the healthcare system is to focus on primary care services. About 140 million will be spent over the next three years and 1,000 additional doctors are to be hired in health and social care centres. In particular, the government plans to i) raise the minimum staffing level for care personnel; ii) improve access to basic-level services (shorter maximum waiting times); iii) increase home care resources and informal care; iv) design a national mental health strategy; v) continue the programme to address child and family services; and vi) reform the Act on Disability Services and Assistance. The second aspect of the reform is the transfer of healthcare matters from the 295 municipalities to new administrative entities (15 to 18 counties), albeit at a slower pace than initially planned. Preparations for the administrative reform have started with a study on special arrangements for Uusimaa, the Helsinki metropolitan area. Management at the regional level is expected to improve efficiency. The reform aims at addressing the financial weakness of municipalities, some of which struggle to fulfil their legal obligations in healthcare provision. The consolidation is expected to strengthen the management of the system. The risk-pooling of the population and the access to specialists are likely to improve. The main factor for boosting efficiency will be the ability of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health to monitor and manage the performance of the future regional healthcare entities. However, no study has been initiated so far on possible cost savings from the reform. Reaching an agreement on the reform has been a challenge for the last 15 years. The new stepwise and consultative approach adopted by the government may prove to be a more effective way to adopt the reform. However, whereas the expansion of primary healthcare to improve accessibility has a clear budget, deadlines and deliverables, the governance reform aiming at improving fiscal sustainability is still being formulated. 3.2. Financial sector 3.2.1.BANKING SECTOR The banking sector is large and its profitability has been slightly declining in recent years. Finland's banking sector is highly concentrated with the top three players occupying over 70% of the market across all main segments. It is one of the largest in Europe in relative terms, with a balance sheet equivalent to four times the country's economic output. Banks remain profitable but profit margins have somewhat deteriorated over recent years, and remained mostly stable in 2019 (see Table 3.2.1). A major factor involved are the heavy investments in modernising the IT infrastructure, pushing the average cost\/income ratio to 63% in the first 6 months of 2019. Table 3.2.1:Financial soundness indicators, all banks in Finland (1) Annualised data Source: ECB, CBD Banks are highly capitalised, but the Finnish banking system's reliance on wholesale funding remains a vulnerability. The sector's capital levels exceed minimum requirements by a large margin. The sector's aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio declined to 16.6% in 2019. The decline reflected the move of Nordea Group to Helsinki (end-2018), as well as the impact of a minimum risk-weight of 15% on mortgages imposed by the Finnish Financial Supervision Authority in January 2018. Capital ratios are bound to be further challenged by the introduction of Basel III capital requirements. The quality of the loan books is very good, with a low ratio of non-performing loans. However, with a system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio of 127.2%, Finnish banks are more dependent on market funding than some of their European competitors. This is one of the long-lasting structural vulnerabilities of the system, even if at present market access remains relatively easy and prices are favourable. The banks are limiting this vulnerability with a large pool of liquid assets that is higher than the aggregate funding gap, and a steadily increasing issuance and use of long-term debt, mainly covered bonds. They are slowly (on average by 5 billion yearly) replacing securities with a shorter-term repayment profile. While this limits the refinancing risk, it also increases the interconnectedness of credit institutions and their exposure to the Nordic housing markets. Access to finance remained easier than in most EU countries. According to the 2019 survey on access to finance of enterprises, access to finance for small and medium-size enterprises in Finland is deemed the least problematic of all surveyed countries (European Central Bank, 2019). However, in 2017, the size of investment in seed capital companies remained relatively modest, even though it increased in line with the EU average (Flachenecker et al., 2020). Also, the cost of borrowing small amounts relative to large loans is higher than the EU average. 3.2.2.HOUSEHOLD DEBT Robust domestic demand remains the driver behind loan growth. The loan books of Finnish banks' continue to grow at 2.4% and 6.6% (second quarter 2019) in the household and corporate segments respectively. Loans to non-financial corporations currently represent about 40% of banks' aggregate loan book to the private sector. In the current environment of low interest rates, most firms and retail clients can easily afford bank credit for any purpose. It is nevertheless concerning that households seem to resort also to borrowing from unsupervised payday loan companies, which aggressively market their services. Household debt to disposable income remains high, close to 140%, similarly to 2018. As in recent years, most of the credit stock, including new lending, is taken at variable rates, which makes borrowers vulnerable to potential rapid changes in the monetary policy stance. The legislative framework required for developing the credit registry is being put in place. A comprehensive credit registry would allow a more complete picture of the overall indebtedness level of households. Following the 2018 report commissioned by the Ministry of Justice that proposed establishing a centralised credit registry, preparatory and analytical work started in 2019. Legislative work has started in early 2020. The registry is expected to be established by the end of the government's term. It will run alongside the income registry system that is already in operation. A key feature of the credit registry is data protection,. The feasibility study estimates the total cost of the credit registry project at 20 million,. While the registry is expected to ultimately become a fully comprehensive system covering all credit granted to individuals, the coverage of the registry is expected to be developed gradually. At the first stage, at least consumer credit would be included. 3.2.3.ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING Finland adopted its action plan for the prevention of grey economy and economic crime in June 2018. Money laundering risk in Finland comes primarily from the grey economy. In recent years there have been large-scale alleged money laundering cases in the Nordic EU Member States, which have been looked at in the 'Report on the assessment of recent alleged money laundering cases involving EU credit institutions'(European Commission, 2019b). The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) has made progress in boosting its supervisory capacity but more needs to be done. Finland is currently working on a preparatory study for a new national risk assessment, to be completed in 2020. The mutual evaluation report released by the Financial Action Task Force in April 2019, assessed Finland's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing system and concluded that the financial supervision needed to be strengthen. In particular, it concluded that the following steps were needed: i) the development of a risk classification tool; ii) a better understanding and correct application of the risk-based approach; iii) the revision of inspection procedures and iv) the establishment of a dissuasive sanctioning policy could all enhance the supervisor's ability to adequately address money-laundering and terrorist financing risks. Following the evaluation, Finland is subject to enhanced monitoring and will have to regularly report on progress made. Finland is committed to rapidly strengthening capacity and has recently provided additional financial and human resources to key competent authorities. Yet, more such resources need to be provided to FIN-FSA. In several cases, the financial supervisor has looked at suspected money laundering in the banking sector. The first sanctions were issued in December 2019 against one bank and one investment company for breaches of money laundering \/ terrorism financing obligations. The workload for the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has increased markedly over the past year. The number of suspicious transaction reports received by the FIU increased by 64.2% in 2019. In response, the FIU increased its number of staff. In many areas, such as giving guidance to obliged entities, there is a close cooperation between the supervisor (FIN-FSA) and the FIU. However, cooperation is lacking in the consultations on fit and proper tests and the contact between FIN-FSA and the FIU is otherwise limited, as the FIU can only share little information with the FIN-FSA, while the FIN-FSA only shares general information.. Box 3.2.1: A credit registry in Finland A credit information system collects, processes and distributes information for managing credit-related decisions and for financial supervision. The key participants in credit reporting are the data subjects, the data providers, the service providers and the users. There are two main types of service providers. Credit registries (typically government owned) have as their primary objective to support financial sector supervision and monitor systemic risks. Credit bureaus (in most cases privately owned) aim principally at improving the quality and availability of data so that creditors can make better-informed decisions. In terms of reported information, credit information systems may deal with negative and positive data. Negative data is normally limited to the reporting of unfulfilled financial obligations, such as late payments, defaults and bankruptcies, and is only registered when there is an adverse event. Positive data complements the data captured by negative-only files. Among other things, it may include information on assets and liabilities, debt ratios, loan types, lending institutions, guarantees, debt maturities, or repayment patterns. In Finland, credit information is provided by credit bureaus that collect mainly negative information, with notably low coverage when compared to the EU. The coverage ratio has been stable over recent years, whereas in the EU there was a general tendency to increase the coverage of credit information. Furthermore, many EU countries have established public credit registries, and the vast majority of EU credit information systems incorporate positive data as well. At the same time, since 2012, household debt in Finland has been increasing and has exceeded the EU average, while in the EU it has been decreasing (see Graph 1). In this context, the 2019 Country Specific Recommendation (COM(2019) 526) calls for the establishment of a credit registry system in Finland to strengthen the monitoring of household debt (see Section 3.2.2 for recent developments). Graph 3.1.3a: Household debt and credit bureau coverage Sources: Eurostat (2019a), World Bank (2019) Note: Coverage indicates the number of individuals and firms listed in a credit bureau, with current information on repayment history, unpaid debts, or credit outstanding. The number is expressed as a percentage of the adult population. Well-developed credit information systems with wide coverage are recognised as having several advantages. First, information sharing has a positive impact on information asymmetries and repayment behaviour. Second, credit information systems are important for financial sector regulation and supervision, as well as for the assessment of micro- and macro-prudential risks. Third, and particularly pertinent for Finland, is the link with indebtedness. Credit information sharing can function as a mechanism for borrower discipline and can mitigate the incentive to over-borrow. It reveals borrowers' debt exposure to all lenders and could eventually reduce aggregate indebtedness, as highly indebted parties receive less credit. Information sharing arrangements are also powerful determinants specifically for household debt, and for related insolvencies and defaults (van Roy et al., 2017; Bennardo et al., 2015, Jappelli et al., 2005, 2013; Padilla et al., 1997, 2000; Girault et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2007). The benefits of collecting positive data are also accredited. In systems without positive data, there may be information gaps and limited oversight of the overall debt level. For example, there would be no information available on debtors that meet their financial obligations regularly, without any adverse events. By contrast, positive data is more comprehensive. Its use improves the ability of lenders to separate low- from high-risk borrowers and, therefore, assists in the efficient extension of credit. Studies link the inclusion of positive information with better lending decisions, credit that is low-priced and fairly distributed, lower default rates and reduced loan losses (Doblas-Madrid et al., 2013; International Finance Corporation, 2012; Turner, 2010). Finally, while credit information systems that include positive data can be useful, regulatory and legal frameworks on privacy and data protection issues should be complied with accordingly. 3.3. Labour market, education and social policies 3.3.1.Labour market After four years of economic growth, the employment rate is historically high, but a slowdown is expected. The employment rate (20-64 years) increased by 2.1 pps in 2018 to reach 76.3% (see Graph 3.3.1). In parallel, the unemployment rate has been decreasing and stood at 7.4% in 2018, a sharp reduction from the 8.6% recorded in 2017. The decline in unemployment also led to a drop in long-term unemployment, which decreased by 0.5 pps to 1.6% in 2018, well below the EU average. Employment is expected to have increased in 2019 and to continue increasing in 2020, albeit at a slower pace. However, some groups, e.g. people of a migrant background still have low employment rates (see the section on social policies below). Graph 3.3.1:Activity, employment and unemployment rates Source: Eurostat Labour shortages are growing, especially in the ICT sector. According to the Finnish public employment service, the number of vacancies increased by 4% in the first two quarters of 2019 to reach 114 000 in 2019. Out of those, around 50% were reported as hard-to-fill vacancies. In particular, the percentage of companies reporting hard-to-fill ( 15 ) vacancies for jobs requiring ICT specialist skills is above the EU average (see also section on skills below). Wages are expected to have grown further in 2019 due to the tightening labour market and to higher contractual wage increases. Nominal wages are expected to have grown in 2019 by 3.1%, above the expected rate of inflation (see Section 1). Most of the collective agreements will expire by 2020. Wage negotiations with public and private sectors for 2020 and beyond started in autumn 2019 and are expected to end in spring 2020. So far, it is difficult to predict to what extent the outcome will take account of productivity developments, competitiveness considerations and wage adequacy. Based on the first round of negotiations, wages are expected to grow by around 3% in the next two years ( 16 ). The most contentious issue will likely be the working time extension (of up to 24 hours per year) that had been agreed in the Competitiveness Pact in 2016. The technology industry dropped the working time extension in exchange for the possibility to agree locally on extra working hours. The gender pay gap remains at 16.7% just above the EU average. The gender pay gap is partly due to gender occupational segregation in the labour market and long family leaves used mostly by mothers. More women are hired on temporary contracts, with Finland having the second largest gender difference in the EU. The government proposes tackling unjustified pay differences and pay discrimination by improving pay transparency with legislation (Valtioneuvoston kanslia, 2019). Addressing gender segregation through targeted employment and educational policies could increase labour supply in sectors that are facing shortages. Demographic trends are putting pressure on the labour market. The working-age population has been shrinking since 2016 because of ageing (see Graph 3.3.2). Until now, the impact of this on total population growth has been more than offset by positive net migration. Nevertheless, declining fertility puts a strain on the long-term outlook for labour supply. The fertility rate has dropped dramatically in the last 10 years and now ranks among the lowest in the EU (Official Statistics of Finland, 2019). By the end of 2060, the share of working-age population is projected to reduce by 5 pps. The causes of this sudden drop are unclear, but the following possibilities could be considered as reasons: i) difficulty to reconcile family and working life; ii) concerns about the future; iii) the postponement of having children; iv) increased childlessness and v) policy measures that discourage people from having children such as the non-indexation of the universal child allowance or limitations to the universal right to child-care have been eased since 2020. Graph 3.3.2:Population change, 2007-2018 Source: European Commission calculations based on Finland Statistics (data for 2019 are until August) Activity has surged in recent years, but structural bottlenecks remain in the labour market. The total activity rate reached 82% in 2018, up from 80.7% a year earlier. This is above the EU average (78.4%). However, the activity rate of men between 25 and 54 is below the EU average. According to labour force survey in September 2019, the unemployment rate of men increased by 0.4% compared to September 2018, whereas the unemployment rate of women decreased by 1.3%. The activity rate for women at childbearing age (20-39), even though higher than EU average, is around 4 pps. lower in Finland than in its Nordic EU peers. The activity rate of older cohorts (55-64) is 8 pps above the EU average, but remains lower than in other Nordic countries. The government has set ambitious employment targets; removing structural bottlenecks to activity will be key to achieve it (see Box 3.3.2). It will would contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal 8 on full employment and economic growth. Drivers for inactivity appear somewhat gender and age specific, in addition to low educational attainment. Family and caring responsibilities appear to affect women disproportionally more than men. The main drivers for men's inactivity are illness or disability (see Graph 3.3.3). Retirement is the main reason of older cohorts'(55-64) inactivity. The employment rate of low-skilled adults remains below the EU average. However, the number of low-skilled adults is relatively small in Finland ( 17 ). Addressing inactivity requires a variety of measures depending on the target group. Graph 3.3.3:Reasons for inactivity as a proportion of inactive population by sex and age group. 2018 Source: Eurostat Incentives to work Inactivity and employment traps remain, but some measures have been taken in recent years to address them. Certain benefits, and their combinations, constitute unemployment or inactivity traps (European Commission, 2016a, 2017, 2018b & 2019b). A reform of the social security system has started, which addresses the overall challenge of inactivity and employment traps (see Box 3.3.2). To address bureaucratic traps (European Commission, 2019b), Finland deployed a real-time income register in 2019. It contains real-time information on salaries and benefits (the latter starting from 1 January 2020). It has the potential to speed-up handling times of unemployment and other benefits, thus increasing certainty of income level if taking-up part-time or short-term work. Moreover, it could open up possibilities for a more effective combination of work-related-income and benefits in the future. Incentives for carers could improve their long-term employment prospects. Long spells involving caring responsibilities, which fall often on women, weaken the labour market position of carers. Women with a migrant background are disproportionally underrepresented in the labour market. The activity rate gap between women born outside the EU and in the EU in 2018 was very high (non-EU 18.2pp - EU 9.5pp). The government has passed legislation to restore full access rights to childcare for children from families experiencing unemployment or inactivity. The government aims to reform family leave. The main objective is to grant both parents an equal number of non-transferable days of family-related leave. The proposed reform could have a positive effect on work-life balance and gender equality. The government is exploring the idea of streamlining the homecare leave system by looking into for example the possibility of paying the home care allowance directly to grandparents. This could open up more opportunities for some parents to return to work or to education. A deeper reform of home-care leave combined with increased investments in access to and quality of early childhood education and care could bring about sustainable results in terms of integrating women into the labour market, especially those from the above-mentioned groups. The pension reform has reduced the number of new old-age retirees. Based on the 2017 pension reform, the earliest eligibility threshold for old-age retirement rises per age group until it reaches 65 years old in 2027. The reform has affected the number of people moving from employment to retirement. The Finnish Centre for Pensions estimates that the number of old-age retirees dropped by 8% between 2017 and 2018, mainly because of the reform. This could partly explain the positive trend of the employment rate for people over 55 years old and it is expected to continue due to the increasing retirement age. The extended unemployment insurance benefits for older workers partly contribute to unemployment in the oldest age groups. The eligibility of older unemployed people, over 61 years of age, for extended benefits reduces their incentives to return to work before retirement. Moreover, it could involuntarily encourage employers to dismiss those employees who qualify for the extended benefits. The social partners proposed to the government an increase of the eligibility age for extended unemployment benefits from 61 to 62 for those born after 1961. The amendment came into force at the beginning of 2020. According to an estimation, the extension would decrease the number of unemployed people by 7,400 by the end of 2025 (Reipas, 2019). In the current context, the full phasing out of such a system and improving incentives for older workers to stay at work would contribute to reduce labour shortages. Activation measures Sustainable activation of target groups is a challenge. Finland is spending more than the EU average on active labour market policies but less than its Nordic peers. In particular, Finland spends one third of its total budget for labour market policies on active measures, whereas Sweden spends around half (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2016). The public employment services (PES) have suffered from staff reductions over the last ten years, partly due to efforts to digitalise the services. Deployment of new technologies in the services could also have a negative consequence: putting the PES under threat of losing its position in the labour market as the main player that helps unemployed people find work. It could be beneficial to focus more on activating unemployed men in their prime working age, people with partial work ability and migrants, given their low employment rates. There is a lack of coordination in providing integrated services for people who are 'hard-to-place'. In recent years, multi-professional services have been launched for different target groups (European Commission, 2017 & 2018b). However, the services for long-term unemployed people and people with 'partial work ability' could benefit from tighter coordination and commitment on the part of key players, especially between local PES and municipalities. The challenges are seemingly the lack of human resources as well as incompatible data exchange systems that are preventing services from being effectively integrated. Municipal level experiments seek to address the challenges. Municipalities participating in the experiment were selected in 2019. A law for piloting transfer of employment services from the government's employment offices to municipalities is under preparation. The new programme promotes the decentralisation of employment and entrepreneurship services to municipality level. The experiments will continue until 2022 and the results will feed into the design of future service structures. The government has repealed the 'active model', a conditional unemployment benefit scheme that was introduced in 2018 (European Commission, 2018 & 2019). Based on the government's proposal, the automatic reduction of unemployment benefits has now been removed, while leaving the other parts of the system untouched. According to an evaluation on its effectiveness (Kyyra et al., 2019), it was difficult to prove the direct effects of the active model on employment due to the fast economic growth and increased demand for labour. At the same time, the evaluation acknowledged that the model was successful in encouraging unemployed people to use the employment services and that it increased their participation in active labour market measures. It is important that the PES are strengthened so they can intervene rapidly to reduce the risk of long-term unemployment and shifts to inactivity. Following the revision of the 'active model', consideration could be given to designing other mechanisms that would increase incentives to look for work or take part in training. Pay subsidies are a key measure put forward by the government to increase employment. The government increased available funding for pay subsidies by 17 million in the 2020 budget. Moreover, measures to simplify the use of pay subsidies by employers are in the pipeline. These changes have a potential to improve the targeting of the subsidies to the private sector and increase their effectiveness in terms of sustainable employment results (Asplund et al., 2018). However, if the pay subsidies are used as an all-around support, it may lead to negative effects, because many unemployed could have been employed even without the subsidy. More concrete proposals are expected over the course of 2020. Measures to increase employment of those with partial work ability are in the pipeline. The previous government launched a 'work ability programme' targeting people with partial work ability (see European Commission, 2019b). The reform aims to integrate and clarify the responsibilities of all the relevant services for those with partial or reduced work ability. Moreover, legislative work on a reform of the disability pension has started. It seeks to incentivise people on part-time disability pensions to come back to the labour market. The aim of the reform is to increase the beneficiary's net income with the uptake of work. To achieve this, the reform would introduce an 'earnings disregard' of 50% of the pension. The earnings that exceed the disregard would reduce the pension by 50% of each euro earned (Knuuti et al., 2019). Policy measures to facilitate access to finance for social enterprises are considered. Social enterprises in Finland play an important role in actively including marginalised groups. However, many of these organisations have difficulty finding financial support. In addition, most financial tools are designed either for conventional business or not-for-profit associations and therefore do not cater specifically for social enterprises. The Finnish government's 2019 programme aims to improve the operating environment for social enterprises, which may improve their potential further. Skills and future of work Skills mismatches at macroeconomic level are below the EU average. The level of disparities in the labour market outcomes of the different skill groups (low-, medium-, and high-skilled) is below the EU average and has decreased since 2010 (see Graph 3.3.4). The vertical skills mismatch, i.e. when people are over-qualified, remained largely constant in Finland between 2008 and 2018, with a rate below 20%. In recent years, Finland has experienced an increase in high-skilled tasks relative to middle-skilled tasks and a decline in routine tasks. This indicates that in the short term the adult workforce needs to be reskilled and upskilled so it can better match labour market demand. The recent vocational education and training (VET) reform and reform of higher education funding increase incentives to provide more upskilling and reskilling training to adults (see education section below). Graph 3.3.4:Relative dispersion of employment rates by education level (2010, 2015, 2018) (1) Annual average based on the average of four quarters Source: European Commission calculations based on Eurostat There is only a low risk of jobs in Finland being squeezed out by automation. The exposure to automation poses a challenge to about 5 8% of jobs depending on the region (Gonzalez et al., 2019). These figures are the lowest in the EU. However, job profiles are changing due to digitalisation, robotics and artificial intelligence. The labour market will have higher demand for non-cognitive and digital skills. Finland scores well in digital skills (Box 3.3.3; Gonzalez et al., 2019) with around 50% of the population having above-basic digital skills (see also Section 3.4.2). Despite good availability of digital skills, labour shortages risk becoming a drag on the development of the information and communication services (ICT) sector. (see Graph 3.3.5). While Finland has the best availability of scientists and engineers in the world (World Economic Forum, 2016), the percentage of companies reporting hard-to-fill vacancies for jobs requiring ICT specialist skills is above the EU average (6.9% compared to 4.6%) (European Commission,2019d). Intense shortages were found in several knowledge areas such as computers, electronics and mathematical knowledge. The proportion of ICT graduates remains well above the EU average, but shortages still exist. Moreover, costly residence permit processes limit possibilities for foreign students to stay in Finland after graduating. Furthermore, Finnish companies face administrative difficulties in hiring foreign experts. A softening of the relatively stringent immigration policies is being considered, in particular extending working permits after graduation to 2 years. Graph 3.3.5:Job vacancy rates in the whole economy and in the information and communication services sector in Sweden and Finland (1) Seasonally adjusted data, not calendar adjusted data Source: European Commission Finland has an effective 'skills anticipation' system to deal with future challenges. Skills anticipation activities are linked to policy-making and are aligned with labour market needs (European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, 2017). Finland launched its 'Skills Anticipation Forum' in 2017. It organised its activities around two main pillars: one provides skills forecasts based on the economic developments until 2025, and the second is focused on anticipating education and training needs. In addition, many regional anticipation and foresight projects are ongoing. Regional anticipation activities have developed rapidly in recent years, involving local authorities and educational establishments. Skills anticipation feeds into a range of government educational policies from vocational training to higher education. Reskilling and upskilling are key to maintaining the employability of the labour force and ensure the right supply for future skills needs. Participation in adult learning is already high in Finland. In 2018, 28.5% of adults aged 25-64 reported in a survey that they took part in a learning course during the previous 4 weeks (EU average 11.1%). Despite the high uptake in adult learning, the government will put forward a continuous learning reform starting in 2020. Time constraints have been one of the reasons for workers not to join training (European Commission, 2019b). The reform aims to increase the possibilities for people of a working age to participate in 'continuous learning' courses, combining work and study in a flexible manner and supporting learning at the work place. There will also be improvements to the anticipation of individual skills' needs and guidance services for adult learners (Ministry of Education 2019a). In 2020, 7.5 million of extra funding will be allocated to educating adults with a low level of basic skills. 3.3.2.Social policies and healthcare The risk of poverty or social exclusion has been rising slightly but remains well below the EU average. Material and social deprivation (MSD) ( 18 ) is at a low level in Finland compared to the EU average. Finland also has one of the EU's lowest rates of population at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) and child poverty. However, in the context of a general decrease in other Member States, the MSD has stabilised and the AROPE rate increased slightly in 2018. Elevated risk of poverty and social exclusion remains an issue for specific vulnerable groups, such as self-employed people, children of low-skilled parents and people with a migrant background. Social transfers play a major role in reducing poverty, in particular unemployment benefits, sickness and disability benefits ( 19 ). Income inequality remains among the lowest in Europe (see Section 1). Relative spending on social protection is among the highest in the EU and has increased over recent years. In 2018, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate by 53.7% (compared to an EU average of 33.2%). On average, unemployment benefits have the largest impact on the at-risk-of-poverty rate, followed by family benefits, sickness and disability benefits, and housing benefits. The recent increase in social benefits could address slowly growing poverty. As part of its economy of well-being strategy and in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals 1 (No poverty) and 10 (Reduced inequalities), the government has announced measures to reduce income inequality. The level of different social security benefits was increased in early 2020. The level of increase varies between benefits. These benefits include minimum rehabilitation allowance, sickness and parental allowance, basic unemployment allowance and labour market subsidy. In addition, the level of the lowest pensions will be increased. These reforms should reduce beneficiaries' dependency on social assistance (the 'last resort' benefit). Box 3.3.1: Monitoring performance in light of the European Pillar of Social Rights The European Pillar of Social Rights is a compass for a renewed process of upward convergence towards better working and living conditions in the European Union. It sets out twenty essential principles and rights in the areas of equal opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; and social protection and inclusion. The Social Scoreboard supporting the European Pillar of Social Rights points to the overall good performance of Finland. The employment rate is now higher than before the crisis, at 76.3% in 2018, and the gender employment gap is the second lowest in the EU at 3.7 pps. Income inequalities are among the lowest in the EU. In 2018, the income of the richest 20% was stable at 3.6 times that of the poorest 20% and low compared to the EU average of 5.2 times. The risk of poverty or social exclusion remains also low (16.5% in 2018), although it has been rising slightly, especially due to the non-indexation of unemployment benefits. This also explains the slight decrease in the impact of social transfers on poverty reduction, though Finland remains the best performer in the EU with 53.6% (versus an EU average of 33.2%). The risk of poverty and social exclusion remains an issue for specific vulnerable groups, such as people with a migrant background and children of low-skilled parents. Self-reported unmet needs for medical care have increased from 3.6% of the population in 2017 to 4.7% in 2018. This is particularly the case for the lowest income group (6.6% of the lowest income group (Q1) reported unmet needs compared to 2.9% of the richest income group (Q5)) and for the unemployed (8.8% reported unmet needs in 2018). Access to care remains an issue in Finland, mainly due to long waiting times for primary health care and specialised services for those not covered by occupational or private healthcare insurance. It is being addressed by a reform of the healthcare and social services that has faced multiple delays. Finland performs well in upskilling and reskilling, particularly for digital skills. Finland has the highest uptake in adult learning in the EU with 28.5% of adults aged 25-64 having had a learning experience in the last 4 weeks (the EU average is 11.1%). Time constraints are considered as a main reason for not joining a training programme in 2019. The government will roll out a continuous learning reform in 2020 to enable people to combine work and studies in a flexible manner. Furthermore, Finland has a well-performing skills forecasting system to inform policies. This is reflected in the good results obtained in digital skills, with 76% of 16-74 years-olds having basic or above basic digital skills in 2017. The final results of the basic income experiment will be published in 2020. The experiment, which attracted worldwide attention, ran in 2017 and 2018. Its primary objective was to find out whether introducing basic income could reduce the relatively high unemployment and help eliminate inactivity traps. According to the preliminary results published in early 2019, the employment level of the participants in the first year of the experiment had not changed compared to the control group. However, the participants reported higher level of well-being. This result may have been driven by the specific setup of the experiment, in which basic income replaced the unemployment benefits only in a very limited way. A comprehensive reform of the social security system is being prepared. To meet the long-term challenges posed by the changing world of work and the ageing population, the government has launched a reform of the social security system. The previous government started a reform by carrying out a project to provide different proposals for the future social security system. In order to give all political parties a sense of ownership over the project, the preparatory work has been carried out in a parliamentary working group and the reform will be prepared in a parliamentary committee. The aim of the reform is to streamline the complex social security system to make it more adaptable. The focus is on the basic social security, earnings-based benefits and social assistance. Another main objective is to address inactivity and unemployment traps. Due to the magnitude of the reform, it will be implemented in parts. The reform should be ready by 2027. Although this is a lengthy schedule, the experience with the regional, healthcare and social care reform, which has suffered a setback due to constitutional concerns, suggests that careful preparation could be an advantage when designing such a large-scale reform. Ensuring the long-term integration of refugees and other migrants into the Finnish labour market and society remains a challenge. In particular, non-EU born continue to face integration challenges (see also the paragraph on incentives above). The employment rates are improving along with the general employment situation, but the employment gap between non-EU born and native-born people is still high (17.5 pps in 2018). The poverty gap is high, but slightly improving (17.9 pps. in 2018 from 19.5 pps in 2017). The gap between non-EU born and native people for severe material deprivation was above the EU average in 2018 (FI: 7 pps; EU: 5.9 pps). Finland has reformed its integration policies since 2015 to address these challenges. The policy focus has shifted from language training towards swifter labour market integration (European Commission, 2018 & 2019). The reforms are showing some positive results in terms of increased employment rate for migrants, although it may be difficult to disentangle the impact of reforms from the general increased labour demand. However, some innovative experiments, such as the Social Investment Bond for integration, have had encouraging first results. Continuous efforts to improve the integration of migrants into the labour market and into society would also achieve a more balanced economic dependency ratio in the long run. This is especially important in the context of the rapidly ageing population. Access to healthcare services and long-term care The life expectancy of the Finnish population has increased since 2000, but mental disorders are a growing burden. Life expectancy at birth is 81.7 years, higher than the EU average of 80.9 years. However, the number of healthy life years is lower than the EU average and substantial health inequalities, both geographical and socioeconomic, persist (e.g. education gap in life expectancy of 5.6 years for men and 3.5 years for women at the age of 30). This can be linked to behavioural risks being more pronounced among people with a lower level of income and\/or education. The estimated prevalence of mental health disorders is one the highest in the EU, increasing the risk of early school leaving, unemployment, inactivity and social exclusion. The health system is effective but access is a concern, particularly for primary care and specialised services. The treatable mortality rate in Finland is significantly lower than the EU average, indicating that the health system is effective. The healthcare system puts a strong emphasis on promoting health and preventing disease. Care for many chronic conditions has improved, probably because of several large-scale national prevention and treatment programmes. However, access to care remains an issue in Finland, mainly due to long waiting times for primary health care and specialised services. As highlighted in the Social Scoreboard accompanying the Social Pillar, the proportion of Finnish citizens who reported unmet needs for care increased to 4.7% of the population in 2018, which is above the EU average. This is particularly the case for the lowest income group (6.6% of the lowest income quintile reported unmet needs compared to 2.9% of the highest quintile) and for the unemployed (8.8% reported unmet needs in 2018). The issue of access is being addressed by a complex reform of both health and social care systems, taken over by the new government with several adaptations (more details in Section 3.1). The current system of healthcare services delivered by various providers leads to an unequal placement of medical staff across the country, also affecting access to healthcare. Public healthcare centres do not attract doctors due to difficult working conditions. Finland acknowledges this challenge and considers the strengthening of primary care as the highest priority. The number of physicians has been growing strongly, although regional disparities are considerable. The number of physicians has increased particularly in health care districts with universities, whereas elsewhere the trend is often negative. When it comes to specialists, there are shortages in some specialisations, such as psychiatrists. This is a concern, considering the increasing number of mental disorders. The number of nurses per capita is one of the highest in the EU. The role of nurses is expanding in primary care and home care and this may help improve access, especially where shortages of doctors exist. (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2019b). Graph 3.3.6:Self-reported unmet needs by income quintile declared (% pop) (1) 2018 data (2017 data for UK, SK, IE) Source: Eurostat The need for long-term care is projected to increase in the coming decades due to the ageing of the population. The Finnish social care system is among the most generous and comprehensive in the EU, both in terms of public expenditure and coverage of the population (European Commission, 2018c), but it still faces challenges. Long-term care is provided at municipal level, which may lead to inequalities in the quality and accessibility of care across municipalities. As well as on the formal care and cash benefits, municipalities rely on informal care provided by family members, which may hinder labour market participation of the (mostly female) informal carers (European Commission, 2019c), although the gender employment gap is particularly low in Finland (European Commission, 2016b). 3.3.3.education and skills Education in Finland remains among the best in the EU, although there are signs that performance and equity in the Finnish education system are deteriorating (Volante et al., 2019). Though starting from a high level of accomplishment in providing quality education (UN Sustainable Development Goal 4), not only has the average performance of Finland been falling in recent cycles of the PISA survey, but also inequality in achievement appears to be increasing. Municipalities are concerned about the lack of sufficient financial resources to implement recent educational reforms, both in early childhood education and care and in compulsory education. The levels of basic skills as measured by the PISA 2018 survey remain comparatively high, but have worsened since the PISA 2015 survey. The performance of Finnish students in reading, mathematics and science has been at, or near, the top of the participating countries in the PISA survey. However, results from the PISA 2018 survey (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2019c) show a statistically significant decline of performance in science. The proportion of 15-year old students underachieving also increased, while remaining below the EU benchmark level of 15% for each subject area. In addition, after accounting for socio-economic status, the difference in reading performance between immigrant and non-immigrant students is the largest in the EU. The Finnish Education Evaluation Centre reported for 2018 that the low level of appreciation for studies and insufficient student support might influence students' outcomes in basic skills (Finnish Education Evaluation Centre , 2018). Participation in early childhood education and care remains low by international comparison despite a recent increase. By 2017, the participation rate of children under age of three had increased to 33.3%, close to the EU average (34.2%). However, Finland remains among the EU countries with the lowest participation rate of children aged between four and the starting age of compulsory education (87.8% EU average 95.4%) in 2017, with large regional disparities. Education funding is expected to increase over the coming years, progressively offsetting significant budget cuts in 2016-2019. Between 2016 and 2019, the government reduced spending by around 950 million (0.4% of GDP), mainly in vocational education and training (190 million) and in early childhood education and care (155 million). According to the General Government Fiscal Plan 2020-2023, total annual expenditure on education will increase by about 518 million by 2023, with additional spending over 2020-2023 totalling 455 million. The 2020 budget plans a 6% increase in expenditure (11% more in general education including early childhood education and care, 12% more in vocational education and 5% more in tertiary education). As from 2021, higher education institutions will apply new funding models to foster transitions from education to work. Universities of applied sciences will receive 6% (currently 4%) of their basic funding depending on the number of graduates that enter into employment and on the quality of their employment. For the other universities, such funding will represent 4% (currently 2%). The new funding mechanism aims to improve incentives to provide continuous learning courses. It will increase funding based on continuous learning indicators for universities of applied sciences from 5% to 9%, and for the universities from 2% to 5%. This should contribute to tackling imminent skills shortages in the labour market. The education system fares relatively well in terms of inclusiveness, although challenges remain for some groups. Pupils with disabilities go to mainstream schools and receive support from special teachers or assistants, interpretation or communication services, support services, assistive devices, transport services, etc. If needed, municipalities provide services for special education. However, choosing a certain type of secondary education may depend on the physical accessibility of a school building rather than on genuine interests of pupils with disabilities (Hoffren, 2017). The early school leavers' gap between pupils with disabilities and other pupils is higher than the EU average (15.6 pps vs the EU average of 10.1 pps). In parallel, the early school-leaving rate for non-EU born pupils stood at 13.6% in 2018, being 5.5 pps higher than that for native born pupils. Finland plans to raise the mandatory school age to 18 years and provide upper secondary ( 20 ) education free of charge. The planned reform (Ministry of Education, 2019b) aims to ensure that students gain an upper secondary qualification. The plan is to introduce a range of study and support options for compulsory education. The material fees for upper secondary education is expected to be abolished. Finland will also carry out a study on non-material-fee-paying upper secondary education and a reduction in learning material costs and, based on that, take the appropriate measures to implement upper secondary education that is genuinely free of charge. The government legislative proposal is expected to be submitted for consultation by May 2020, sent to the Parliament by September 2020 and come into effect in 2021. There are shortages of teachers in special education and care. The latest forecast from 2018 on the national demand for qualified teachers in primary, secondary and vocational schools in Finland, carried out in spring 2018, points to shortages of special education teachers (2.2% of the total workforce) and career counsellors (6.2%) (Nissinen & Valijarvi, 2018). The lack of special needs teachers increases also in vocational education and training. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's survey (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2019d), only 21.5% of lower-secondary teachers in Finland consider themselves well or very well prepared to use information and communication technologies (ICT) for teaching when they finished their studies (the second lowest in the EU), and only 14% of the teachers feel well or very well prepared to teach in a multicultural and\/or multilingual setting (among the lowest in the EU). Reaching the new tertiary education attainment target will require taking into account the availability of study places. The government plans to raise the proportion of young adults (25-34 year-olds) with a tertiary education degree to 50% by 2030. This could require an increase of study places in certain regions. Compared to the rest of Finland, there is a major lack of higher education study places and a growing demand in the Uusimaa region (i.e. the extended Helsinki metropolitan area). In spring 2018, Uusimaa had available 12,369 university study places (26% of the total in the country), while 53,982 students submitted an application (35% of the total in the country). Consequently, each year, around 60% of Finnish students starting their higher education outside Finland are from the Uusimaa region. It can be particularly difficult to enter university in some regions because of the restricted number of places. This delays tertiary education for several years for many students. Vocational education and training (VET) VET remains an attractive study path in Finland. In 2017, more than 52,000 new students entered upper secondary VET programmes in Finland, compared to 33,000 who entered general upper secondary education. The proportion of pupils enrolled in upper secondary VET out of the total number of upper secondary students was 71.6% in 2017, which is markedly higher than the EU average. However, despite the attractiveness of VET, the employment rate of recent graduates (78.5%) was slightly below the EU average (79.5%) in 2018. The recent VET reform pushes for more responsiveness to the labour market needs. The key components of the reform were to provide individualised and flexible study pathways and to integrate separate funding strands into one coherent funding system. One of the objectives is to open up more possibilities for VET organisers to provide modular, not degree related, reskilling and upskilling trainings for adult learners. The new funding system was planned to be gradually rolled out until 2022 and was based on core funding (50%), performance based funding (35%) and effectiveness funding (15%). The funding system is based on core funding (70%), performance based funding (20%) and effectiveness funding (10%). The effectiveness funding has the potential to speed up transitions from education to work or education to education by linking part of the funding to success rate in these fields. Further changes to the legislation are being prepared and should come into force in 2021. Box 3.3.2: Reaching the 75 % employment rate target The government has set a target to increase the employment rate for 15-64 years old to 75% by 2023. The employment rate for this age group stood at 72.1% in 2018. According to the government's initial estimation, reaching the target would require around 60,000 new jobs compared to the Ministry of Finance forecast (spring 2019) ( V ). Based on Eurostat population projections for 2023, the 75% employment rate objective would require additional 86,000 employed compared to the 2018 level. In 2019, the employment rate continued to grow to reach 72.9% by the third quarter. Nevertheless, the target appears very ambitious, as employment is historically high whereas economic growth is forecast to slow down. However, the example of Sweden (77.5% employment rate in 2018) shows that it is possible to reach an above 75% employment rate in a similar economic and social context. Graph 3.3.6a:Employment rate by age and gender, 2018 Source: Eurostat While the overall employment rate is above the EU average, it falls short of Finland's Nordic peers. The employment rate of working-age men is even below EU average. The female employment rate is better than the EU average, for all age groups except 30-34 year-old, and it is better than the male one for young (15-24) and old (50-64) cohorts. This is the result of structural changes during the last decade as the drop in employment in the industry (drop of 47,900 jobs in total, 30,000 for men) and the shift towards services disproportionately affected male workers ( VI ). Making work pay in all circumstances is paramount to reaching higher employment. One of the reasons for inactivity and unemployment are disincentives to work due to the comprehensive and complex social security system that creates traps. The caring responsibilities that disproportionately affect women, own illness and disability that affect more men as well as relatively low regional mobility, are additional reasons that limit employment opportunities. Since the Finnish social security system includes cash-benefits, benefits-in-kind and other services, all of these sides need to be taken into consideration when reforming the system. To further improve incentives to take up work, the social security system could better balance work-related income and benefits to ensure that working would be financially more rewarding than receiving benefits in all circumstances. A step in the right direction could be streamlining the reinstating of the benefits and making it more transparent through the real-time income register put forward by the government in 2019. The register's information is used for adjusting the unemployment benefit to the income from work at the time it is actually paid to an individual. This could make short-term and part-time work more attractive, thus having a positive impact on employment. Finland is behind other Nordics on the proportion of part-time work. Participation in active labour market measures, especially incentives to look for jobs, has a key role in tackling unemployment. The government has decided to discontinue the active model that was introduced in 2018 (see also Section 3.3.1). While there is some uncertainty about the employment results of the model, participation in active labour market measures has clearly increased. This could be due to the penalties that were introduced as part of the model and to regular interviews, which will remain in place. In addition, the supply of active labour market measures increased with the introduction of the model. Its discontinuation may have a negative impact on employment, even though unemployed may still lose their right to unemployment benefits for a fixed period in case of not participating in active labour market measures and in the regular interviews. It is essential that the government, together with social partners, come up with a system that ensures that the unemployed actively participate in measures that foster their employability and that they actively apply for available jobs. Coupling activity requirements and\/or compliance with employment plans with a credible threat of penalties could increase effectiveness of the policies. The recent decisions to increase funding for active labour market policies, in particular for subsidised salaries, and the improvement of service provision by integrating relevant services could have a positive impact on employment, if they are properly designed and focused on the most vulnerable groups. Many groups require special attention to increase their employment opportunities. Youth unemployment has improved substantially in 2018, but it remains above the EU average (17% vs 15.2%). Activation of the unemployed was successful in recent years and should remain a priority in the future, especially for those who are the most difficult to activate. Since the 2017 pension reform, the employment rate for the over 55 years old has increased and should continue to rise. However, the extended unemployment insurance benefits for older workers partly contribute to the unemployment in the oldest groups, creating an 'unemployment tunnel' towards retirement. The decision to increase the minimum eligibility age by one year could decrease the number of unemployed by 7,400 persons by the end of 2025 (Reipas, 2019 ). A gradual phasing out of the 'unemployment tunnel' could increase employment in the older cohorts and have a positive impact on the effective pension age. Other groups with unused labour potential that require specific attention are people with partial work ability and migrants. Measures to increase the employment of those on a disability pension are already in the pipeline, and the integration system for migrants has been reformed thoroughly in the past few years. However, the demand side might be insufficient to open up job opportunities for these groups who often suffer from long-term unemployment. In this respect, the government's plans to increase subsidised salaries could overcome some reluctance of private sector companies to hire long-term unemployed. To optimise the positive impact, the salary subsidies could be coupled with relevant labour market trainings and with close follow-up by public employment services (PES). Boosting labour migration could also contribute to reaching the objective. Finland has streamlined the application process for work-based residence permits. However, some obstacles remain that discourage recruitments from abroad. For people with no specific skills, the employment process is two staged: the Employment and Economic Development Office makes a partial decision on the application, and, only after that, the Immigration Service can make the final decision. Specialists, top or middle managers and researchers undergo a one-stage process, but the handling times can be up to 4 months. In the sectors where competition of specialists is high, such as in the information and communication services sectors, long handling times constitute a disadvantage for Finnish companies vis-a-vis their foreign competitors. In parallel, a successful integration of foreign students could be an asset for the Finnish labour market. The number of foreign students in the Finnish universities was over 21,000 in 2018 (Opetushallitus, 2019). However, at the end of the studies, the administrative burden of costly residence permit processes may discourage the graduates from staying in Finland. The Sipila government introduced a new type of residence permit for growth and start-up entrepreneurs. However, the handling times for residence permits are still rather long, even for these types of permits (up to 5 months). The responsibility of labour and student migration was transferred to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment starting from 1 January 2020. This shift is expected to strengthen the links between migration policies and promotion of employment. The government has set up a ministerial working groups with seven tripartite sub-groups to prepare the needed labour market reforms. The working groups are focusing on: 1) service structure of labour market policy; 2) pay subsidies and other benefits, including unemployment benefits; 3) promotion of fitness for work and employment of persons with partial work ability; 4) matching skills with labour market needs; 5) work related migration, including integration; 6) labour law; and 7) local bargaining. Some initial results of the working groups have already fed into the 2020 budget, such as the increase of allocation to subsidised salaries. However, the main policy recommendations are expected to be published by spring 2020. Concrete policy actions with assessed employment and budgetary impacts are expected in the 2021 budget. The policy measures and reforms should take into account both supply and demand sides. Due attention would have to be devoted to good working conditions and future labour market developments. In the context of a well-performing social safety net system, the outreach to more vulnerable populations with complex barriers and attracting foreign workers are likely to be more successful, if the quality and attractiveness of vacancies are maintained and if taking up a job is profitable. Impact assessments could be necessary to ensure that all proposed measures are conducive to achieving the target and the largest possible synergy between them. The demand side could also be affected, positively or negatively, by the outcome of the current bargaining round. Maintaining the labour market relevance of the education and training system and further stimulating the high participation rates in adult learning will remain essential to provide workers with the skills needed for the future. 3.4. Competitiveness, reforms and investment 3.4.1.PRODUCTIVITY AND INVESTMENT TRENDS Real labour productivity declined in 2018, as value added in some industrial subsectors markedly decreased. Labour productivity has suffered a significant setback with the crisis and has not caught up with Finland's Nordic peers since then (see Graph 3.4.1). This primarily reflected the setback of Finland's electronics sector. Moreover, continuing wage increases immediately after the crisis affected cost competitiveness and, thereby, economic output (Finnish National Productivity Board, 2019) (see Graph 3.4.1). The progressive recovery that started in 2014, and accelerated in 2016-2017, halted in 2018. This partly reflects the cyclical effects of the economic slowdown, as employment continued to increase strongly (2.6%), while external demand fell and investment in equipment declined, which particularly affected the manufacturing sector. Graph 3.4.1:Labour productivity per person and hour worked in PPS (EA=100) Source: European Commission Total factor productivity (TFP) has been stagnant since 2017 (see Graph 3.4.2) and remains below that of Finland's Nordic peers. Following two years of strong growth in 2016 and 2017, TFP growth decreased in 2018. While TFP in Finland remains close to the euro area average, it falls short of levels observed in a peer country such as Sweden, where TFP growth grew by 13% since 2000, compared to only 7% in Finland. There is an increasing gap in productivity performance across Finnish firms. Productivity growth over the last decade has been concentrated in the most productive firms (top 10%), whereas the bottom 10% of firms have stagnated. This resulted in an increasing gap, even across firms within the same sector. The gap has also increased between small and large firms, both in terms of labour productivity and TFP, with large firms' productivity growing faster. Weak productivity affected mostly firms in the non-exporting sector. Therefore, it seems that productivity is growing only in a small proportion of firms 'at the frontier', while stagnating elsewhere. Graph 3.4.2:Total factor productivity (TFP) (2000=100) Source: European Commission Several drivers may explain this trend of divergence. Technological diffusion across firms seems to have weakened, in part because of weak investments and training in laggard firms. At the same time, firms 'at the frontier' are more likely to be exporters, and production for exports is highly concentrated in Finland. The relative proportion of high-growth firms in Finland remains low, but the highest shares are observed in knowledge-intensive services. Despite the strong performance of the innovation ecosystem (see below under 3.4.2) and the high level of innovation-driven entrepreneurship in Finland, the relative proportion of high-growth firms in Finland (9.5% across the business economy) and their proportion in total employment are still below EU average and well below their Nordic peers. Nevertheless, the highest proportion of high-growth firms is found in knowledge-intensive services and transportations, and particularly in knowledge intensive market services, such as employment activities, security and investigation activities, postal and courier activities, but also computer programming and consultancy, and telecommunications (Flachenecker et al., 2020). Graph 3.4.3:Birth rate of enterprises in the information and communications services sector '(to be updated) Source: European Commission There seems to be scope to improve productivity growth by further stimulating business start-ups in Finland. In 2017, the birth rate of businesses in Finland was at 9.6% in line with the EU average and above that of Sweden. Entry rates in services increased from 8.3% in 2008 to 11% in 2017. However, this rise is largely explained by a surge of companies entering the real estate sector. Excluding this sector, entry rates in 2017 remained below the 2008 level (7.5% in 2008 versus 6.4% in 2017). The entry rate for companies with 10 or more employees in the business services sector was 0.8% in 2017 (up from 0.3% in 2008), below the EU average of 1.5% (Bauer et al., 2020). The information and communication services sector has experienced a significant increase in the number of new-born businesses (26% in 2017, after 4% in 2016) (see Graph 3.4.3). However, this represents only a partial recovery compared to its pre-crisis level. Some structural factors are holding back investment and productivity growth. Finland's investment remains close to, or even below the EU average for investment categories that are the most supportive of productivity growth: investment equipment and investment in intellectual property products (see Section 1 and Box 3.4.1). At the same time, according to the EIBIS Survey 2019 (European Investment Bank, 2019), the most commonly cited barriers to investment are availability of skilled staff and uncertainty about the future (80% and 73% of respondents respectively). The constrained availability of information and communication servicesexperts is becoming a rising concern for digitalisation (see Section 3.3). Further possible obstacles include: i) the still limited cooperation between businesses and academia; ii) lack of coordination of smart specialisation at central level iii) still modest access to finance for seed capital companies (Flachenecker et al., 2020). Furthermore, some structural features of labour market institutions could also be holding back investment (see Section 3.4.2). Investment needs (see also under Section 3.5) Research and Innovation R&D expenditure remains among the highest in the EU, but remains well below the national 2020 target of 4 % of GDP and also falls short of Finland's Nordic peers (see Graph 3.4.4). Finland ranked second after Sweden in the EU in the 2019 European Innovation Scoreboard (European Commission, 2019d). Nevertheless, the technological change, which contributed to the decline of the handset business and the consequent industrial restructuring, led to a steep decline in business R&D expenditure (see Graph 3.4.5). The decline was mostly driven by the manufacturing sector and in particular by the electronics industry and in companies with over 500 employees. In companies with less than 500 employees, the volume of R&D has actually grown in 20112018. Since 2016, the service sector has accounted for the majority of the increase in the Finnish business enterprise sector's R&D expenditure, while R&D expenditure by the manufacturing sector as a whole has only been slowly recovering (see Graph 3.4.6). Overall, addressing the R&D challenge would lead to progress on the UN sustainable development goal (SDG) 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure (see Annex E). Box 3.4.1: Investment challenges and reforms in Finland Section 1: Macroeconomic perspective Investment (share of gross fixed capital formation in GDP) increased in 2018, and remained well above the EU and euro area averages, contributing to progress on SDG8 Decent work and economic growth (see Annex E). However, this high share is driven by the relatively high rate of construction investment, which, in 2018, accounted for 7.3% of gross value added. By contrast, productive investment, such as equipment investment and investment in intellectual property products, remains below or at EU average (see Sections 1 and 3.4). Section 2: Assessment of barriers to investment and ongoing reforms Table 3.2.1a:Assessment of barriers to investment and ongoing reforms Source: European Commission Finland is among the most advanced economies in the EU and offers one of the best business environments with continuous improvements. Moreover, Finland is among the best performers in digital technologies and clean energy innovation. However, Finland is among the most restrictive EU Member States as regards the sales of medicines. Business Finland is the main public funding agency in Finland. It helps businesses go global. It also supports and funds innovations. Funding awarded by Business Finland in 2018 amounted to 535 mln. Selected barriers to investment and priority actions underway 1\/ The most frequently cited obstacle for investment (EIB, 2019) is the availability of skilled staff, while the constrained availability of information and communication services experts is a rising concern for digitalisation going forward. However, Finland has an effective skills anticipation system to identify future challenges. Moreover, the 2020 budget includes a 12% increase in vocational education and a 5% increase in tertiary education. 2\/ There is potential for further increasing cooperation between academia and businesses and for subsequent translation of research into innovation. At the same time, coordination of smart specialisation at central level appears insufficient to consolidate regional smart specialisation strategies and to link them with the national R&D and innovation system. 3\/ Finland remains a modest performer in entrepreneurship and business creation. A the same time, lengthy procedures for obtaining business permits, including environmental permits, and still modest access to finance for 'seed capital' companies might constitute further impediments. Public R&D investment has largely stabilised. After a strong decline between 2010 and 2017, public R&D expenditure stabilised at 0.9% of GDP in 2017 and 2018. While public support to private R&D is directed mostly at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), investment by SMEs in R&D remains low, when compared to that of larger companies. In its recent programme, the new Finnish government has committed to increasing public R&D investment and has kept the target of 4 % of GDP for 2030 (see below). Examples of successful academia-business links exist at regional level. The research and innovation system leads to high-level academic performance ( 21 ). At the same time, the translation of research results into business innovation is less effective. On a positive note, Aalto University offers research and innovation services to students and businesses ( 22 ). In particular, Europe's leading start-up event in Europe, 'Slush', originated in Aalto's student community, while a significant proportion of Finnish start-ups entrepreneurs are Aalto graduates. Another successful example is research and innovation in the forest industry, which made Finland one of the world's frontrunners in the bio-economy area. Neste, the former state petrol company of Finland, has emerged as an example of a fossil-fuel-based company turning to biofuels. Furthermore, Finland has: i) devoted substantial funding to the bioeconomy; ii) sustainably managed large forestry resources; and iii) generated excellent research in the area of wood-derived materials. Its largest bio-product mill in Aanekoski received investment funding from the European Investment Bank and the European Fund for Strategic Investments ( 23 ). Numerous research projects develop novel products from wood fibres. Cutting-edge research and technology allows Finland to compete with countries where forests grow ten times faster and harvesting takes place all year round. At the same time, the Technical Research Centre of Finland, which has traditionally played a major role in supporting innovation in the business sector, suffered substantial funding cuts and lost some of its co-financing from the private sector ( 24 ). Graph 3.4.4:Development of R&D expenditure (as a proportion of GDP) Source: European Commission Recent policy initiatives aimed at strengthening the country's research and innovation performance are being implemented. The merging in 2018 of Tekes (Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation) and Finpro (Finnish Export Promotion Agency) into Business Finland, together with structural changes to the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra, aimed at exploiting synergies and at strengthening Finland's research and innovation performance (Halme et al., 2020). More recently, the new government has acknowledged the need to promote Finland's attractiveness to encourage both foreign and domestic R&D investment. In addition, the new government's fiscal plans include an increase in expenditure on education and additional investment in research, environment and infrastructure in order to increase the international competitiveness of the Finnish research framework. Graph 3.4.5:Trend of public and business R&D expenditure intensity by sectors of performance (as a proportion of GDP) BERD: business R&D expenditure GovERD: government R&D expenditure HERD: higher education R&D expenditure Others: private non-profit sector R&D expenditure Source: European Commission There are promising developments regarding smart specialisation in Finland's regions, but there remains insufficient coordination of the process at central level. In Finland, smart specialisation is tightly linked with smart regions. Finland's aim for 2014-2020 was to complement regional strategies with the national innovative cities (INKA) programme. One of its goals was to match the objectives of the national innovation strategy and regional R&I strategies (Suomen kumppanuussopimus, 2014-2020). However, the programme was abolished in 2017. At present, it is not clear how regional smart specialisation strategies will be consolidated and linked to the national R&D and innovation system. In particular, it is not clear which tool or which body will be used to achieve this. 3.4.2.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND MARKET INTEGRATION Overall, Finland offers one of the best business environments in Europe, and there are continuous improvements. Finland is performing better than EU average for most of the indicators in the Small Business Act ( 25 ). In addition, Finland has the highest proportion of venture capital investment in Europe (mostly concentrated in the manufacturing and information and communication technology sectors) (Flachenecker et al., 2020). Also, according to the World Bank 'Doing Business' indicators' (World Bank, 2020), Finland often scores among the top performing countries worldwide. Moreover, a bill entered into force in July 2019 that removed the capital requirement of 2,500 for registering a private limited liability company (it is now possible to establish such a company without minimum capital), along with other simplification measures. Finland ranks best in the world for resolving insolvency cases. In 2019, amended bankruptcy legislation was passed by Parliament to further speed up bankruptcy proceedings. Graph 3.4.6:Research and development expenditure by industry and year (current prices) Source: Statistics of Finland Liberalisation is ongoing in the retail sector, even though the planned reform of the pharmacy sector has not advanced substantially. A series of reforms aimed at improving the regulatory environment in the retail sector have been carried out over recent years. They included liberalising the opening hours of shops, and amendments to the Land Use and Building Act (132\/1999) in 2017. Currently, the Finnish authorities are working on a further comprehensive reform of the Land Use and Building Act to take account of recent developments in the construction sector and to allow for more strategic planning, particularly in urban areas. The draft law should be ready in 2020. The 2017 amendments to the legislation on retail are being evaluated to assess their fitness for the changing retail environment and evolving consumer preferences. In the pharmacy sector, reform bills are being prepared, although, with the change in government, the scope seems to have been revised, with less ambition to open up the market to private operators. Currently, strict rules on establishing pharmacies as well as price controls for medicines, including non-prescription medicines, place Finland among the most restrictive EU Member States as regards the sales of medicines. Nevertheless, there is scope to improve some aspects of the business environment such as permits and the level of entrepreneurship. There seems to be scope to further simplify business permits, including environmental permits. In 2018, the previous government continued its deregulation programme 'Norminpurku' and some small initiatives focused on streamlining permits and appeal processes. According to the Small Business Act, in Finland, the time required to transfer property is about 47 days, double the EU average. Access to finance remains easier than in most EU countries, but remains modest for 'seed capital' companies (Flachenecker et al., 2020)( 26 ). Moreover, the cost of borrowing small amounts relative to large loans is higher than the EU average (see Section 3.2). While the governments have put several policy initiatives in place over recent years, the indicator 'Entrepreneurship as a desirable career choice' remains below EU average. At the same time, the level of innovation-driven entrepreneurship in Finland is above EU average. Nevertheless, there seems to be scope to further stimulating business entry in Finland (see above under 3.4.1). The new government is planning to further broaden the scope of the entrepreneurial strategy. Some structural features of labour market institutions could be holding back economic dynamism. At the last round of wage negotiations, pay rises in the non-tradable sector were linked to the increases agreed in the tradable sectors. Contrary to the system in Sweden, no formal agreement was reached on applying this model. This absence of formal agreement could increase the uncertainty about the level of wage increases across sectors (see Section 3.3). Some obstacles to local bargaining persist for non-organised employers. However, the new working time arrangement that entered into force on 1 January 2020 should open up possibilities for wider use of flexible working time arrangements, also in non-organised enterprises. Non-compete agreements ( 27 ) might hinder job-to-job transitions. At the same time, small and medium-sized enterprises incur proportionally larger dismissal costs compared to other firms, and clauses that specify a minimum employment period when it comes to re-employing someone are considered a deterrent by employers (International Monetary Fund, 2018). In this context, a new piece of legislation entered into force in September 2019, allowing courts to take the size of the firm into account when considering dismissal cases and reducing from 90 to 60 days the period during which individually dismissed workers would not receive unemployment benefits. Digitalisation Finland is among the best performers in the EU in terms of both digital enablers and digital transformation (European Commission, 2019e). The Finnish government has invested over 100 million, including direct capital funding and regional grants, to support digital projects run by the local authorities in 2018-2022. The planned regional digitalisation process will require new legislation on information management and the establishment of a one-stop-shop service system. Actions include defining the priority areas such as clean-tech, bio-economy, information and communication technologies and health to focus investment on technology-intensive sectors with the potential for upscaling. However, the proportion of organisations with effective risk management approaches to cybersecurity remains low. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are lagging behind in implementing practices that concern digital security risk management. In addition, FinnishSMEs are to some extent lagging behind in online trade within and beyond the EU. Specific initiatives may help them increase their e-commerce business and the use of new technologies. The government plans to continue setting up a real time economy. This means that information on business transactions is to be transferred in electronic format and in real time from one company to another and from companies to the authorities. For the information exchange to work automatically, receipts and invoices need to be in electronic format. The Finnish State Treasury has been developing e-invoicing and electronic receipts, and now the work is continuing on a Nordic level through the Nordic smart government project. The Finnish Patent and Registration Office in collaboration with the State Treasury and the Tax Administration lead this project for Finland's part. Finland is committed to advancing new digital technologies and to investing strategically in them through EU-coordinated programmes. Finland is a member of the Euro-High-Performance-Computing-Joint Undertaking. It has also signed the Declaration on Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence. Eight sites for supercomputing centres have been selected across the EU to host the first European supercomputers. One of the hosting sites will be located in Finland at Kajaani. 3.4.3.institutional quality Finland is a top performer in public administration and governance and continues to maintain its competitive edge. The public procurement system is being modernised. The merger of the two main procurement bodies (Hansel and KL-Kuntahankinnat) eventually took place in September 2019, instead of January 2019 as initially planned. The rationale behind this merger is to create a single national purchasing body, serving contracting authorities at all levels of government. The merger is expected to increase efficiency and to centralise procurement expenditure (representing about 16% of GDP and worth about 35 billion annually), focusing on larger contracts and a more uniform system for public tendering. The merger is expected to lead to savings of up to 20% and will also help harmonise practices to make access to public procurement easier for companies. The merger will also help coordinate large-scale improvement programmes for procurement. In parallel, Finland aims to fully digitalise its procurement system by 2021. Finland excels in offering efficient digital public services and is one of the world leaders in the field. The Finnish government has prioritised the digitalisation of public services, presenting it as a transversal theme cutting across all milestone projects. The ultimate goal is to make digital and user-centred public services available, by developing: i) principles for digitalising all public services; and ii) a one-stop-shop service system for citizens and businesses, backed by the necessary legislation on information management. Finland's success is specifically thanks to the improved availability of open data and digital healthcare services. Online interaction between public authorities and the public is high, as 92% of Finnish online users actively engage with e-government services. 3.4.4.REGIONAL DIMENSION There are strong disparities in economic performance at regional and local level. Helsinki contributed 36% to the country's overall growth between 2000 and 2017. The other two main cities, Tampere and Turku, further added 7%, but their performance over that period was considerably below the national average of 18% due to strong GDP contraction during the economic crisis. Several intermediate ( 28 ) or predominantly rural areas grew economically more over this period, but their performance differed significantly from a contraction of -7% in Kymenlaakso to an expansion of 26% in Ostrobothnia (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2019e). Productivity growth is steady across Finnish regions. Productivity is slowly recovering from losses incurred during the 2008 economic crisis, although productivity remains below pre-crisis levels. However, even in the least productive region, North and East Finland, productivity is clearly above the EU average. At the same time, the productivity patterns appear largely static, with unchanged ranking over the last 18 years (see Graph 3.4.7). Between 2000 and 2017, the changes in labour productivity were modest: from 2 % in Aland to 11 % in North and East Finland. Graph 3.4.7:Regional value added per worker Source: European Commission Finnish regions benefit from higher quality governance than the EU on average. All Finnish regions register a very strong performance in terms of quality of governance: all regions mark at least around 80 against an EU average of 49 in the European Quality of Governance Index ( 29 ). As a result, Finnish regions are more competitive than the EU on average ( 30 ). Still, there is a considerable gap (approx. 20 pps) between Helsinki and North and East Finland. 3.5. Environmental sustainability Sustainable development governance Finland has a good track record on environmental sustainability and governance. Finland has an action plan on 'open government', which encourages citizens to participate across the board. While education plays an important role in training experts in the circular economy, Finland is paving the way by including 'circular economy' in university curricula. Moreover, as Finland uses about 35 billion annually for public procurement, (16% of GDP; Institute for European Environmental Policy, 2019), it has introduced a national strategy on green public procurement with specific targets for central, regional and local governments. The strategy has set targets that gradually increase over time. Finnish SMEs perform above the EU average in the environmental dimension of the Small Business Act (European Commission, 2018d). A faster pace towards a carbon neutral economy The new government programme for 2019-2023 includes an ambitious objective of attaining carbon neutrality by 2035. Finland has fully embraced climate objectives in its domestic policies and the government has stepped up ambitions by setting an objective to reach carbon neutrality by 2035. Reaching this target will require a comprehensive set of policies and measures in a whole-economy approach. Accordingly, the government starts the preparation of a medium-term climate change policy plan in 2021, as laid down in the Climate Change Act. The government also plans to amend the country's original Climate Change Act to include legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, including land use, land use change and forestry. It will be important to offset any negative regional economic and social impacts, including energy poverty. Finland's increased ambition needs to be translated into a significant step-up of mitigation policies, including those for emissions in sectors not covered previously. Greenhouse-gas emissions in Finland have decreased at the same pace as in the EU as a whole (-20.5% in 2017 since 1990). However, the country's emissions in sectors not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme are still higher than the 2020 target and reaching carbon neutrality by 2035 will require additional measures to deal with emissions in these sectors. To achieve the carbon neutrality objective, emissions reduction measures will need to address all greenhouse gas emissions sources. Currently, although the energy mix of the country is already 80% carbon-free, the energy supply sector still represents 31% of the total emissions ( 31 ), ahead of transport (20%), manufacturing (12%) and buildings (7%). Mitigation policies will also need to factor in the decrease of Finland's forest-based carbon sink witnessed in recent years, which may further challenge the country's objective of achieving carbon neutrality. Given the weight of the forest sector in Finland's economy (second largest export sector), policies affecting the sector bear significance both for the economy and the climate policy. The government's climate policies are expected to have a significant impact on the structure of the national budget, and given the increased ambition, this effect could become manifest at an earlier stage. The government has announced an overhaul of energy taxation to help achieve a carbon neutral economy and to benefit renewable energy. It has notably pledged to phase out fossil fuel subsidies for oil, coal and, possibly, peat. Tax expenditure allocated to the energy sector is expected to decrease and consumption taxes are to include a CO2-content element. Mining activities will be removed from the scope of the tax rebate for energy-intensive companies, while the rebate itself will be abolished over a transition period, with cost neutrality to be achieved by means of reducing the electricity tax. However, no assessment of the measures' environmental impact is available at this stage ( 32 ). To ensure that the transition to a climate neutral economy leaves no one behind, the government will need to take into account the distributional effects of environmental taxation and its effects on the most vulnerable households (European Commission, 2019f). The climate and energy challenge The contributions of fossil fuels to domestic energy production are progressively decreasing, while biofuels and electricity are expected to progressively replace those in transport. In 2018, contributions of fossil fuels to domestic energy production reached 8.3% for coal, 26.9% for oil and 6.6% for natural gas. Coal-fired electricity still represents about 13% of the total production of Finland (in 2017). Almost half of the coal-fired power plants are over 35 years old, and most are over 20 years old. The decided coal phase-out for 2029 should lead to no new investments in coal-fired power plants ( 33 ). According to the national energy climate plan (NECP) ( 34 ), the coal phase-out should cost about 34 million. The NECP also significantly targets the reduction of oil consumption in the transport sector, to be substituted by biofuels (which would increase to an expected share of 30%) and by electricity not generated by fossil fuels. Finland is currently meeting its 2020 energy efficiency target, but its progress will have to be monitored in view of the 2030 target. The NECP envisages a very moderate decrease in final energy consumption as well as an increase in primary energy consumption for 2030. This would constitute a very low contribution to the EU energy efficiency target. Finland uses voluntary agreements with industry and has sector-specific energy efficiency targets for transport and building codes setting high energy performance standards for new buildings. However, improving energy efficiency in the existing building stock ( 35 ) consistently with the EU 2030 energy efficiency target will very likely require substantial investment, notably from households (see below under 'Low carbon and energy investment'). Addressing this challenge would contribute to further progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 Affordable and clean energy and SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production (see Annex E). Finland already meets its 2020 renewable energy target. The proportion of renewables in the gross final energy consumption stood at 41% in 2018, 3 pps above the target, thanks notably to contributions of biomass (29% of total energy in 2017) and wind (7% of electricity). The proportion of renewables is expected to keep increasing in the future, with the final NECP indicating a target of 51% in 2030 (in line with the Commission recommendation). This would contribute to further progress on SDG7 Affordable clean energy , on SDG12 Responsible consumption and production and on SDG13 Climate action (see Annex E). Moving towards more sustainable transport and housing can bring along considerable savings. As transport alone accounts for one fifth of Finland's emissions, it will play a key role in reaching carbon neutrality. The new government has set an ambitious target of halving transport emissions by 2030, through tightening fossil fuel taxation and subsidising the electrification of transport. Further investment in railways is also planned (see below under 'Sustainable transport infrastructure investment'). Studies suggest that improving the energy efficiency of buildings could reduce total heating demand by half (MEAC, 2017). Low carbon and energy transition investment The planned transformation towards carbon neutrality is expected to require substantial investment, particularly in the energy sector. The largest investment needs are identified in the area of electricity networks.. Total investments by distribution grid companies amounted to 9.5 billion for 2016-2028. Finland is already above the EU target level for electricity interconnection for each Member State in 2020 (10%) and, for 2030, it aims to keep its connectivity level above the 2030 target of 15% for each EU Member State. There is potential for intensifying the existing cooperation arrangements between Nordic countries and for broadening the geographic reach to include the Baltic States. The projected increased contribution of renewable energy, notably to the power sector, will require further investment in this sector. According to the NECP, Finland intends to reach a 51% proportion of renewable energy in gross final consumption of energy in 2030. This will make the country one of the EU frontrunners in renewable energy. In this context, in 2018, the government reformed the renewable support scheme to increase competitive tenders. The country's aim of increasing the proportion of transport biofuels (to 30%) and of ramping up the number of electric vehicles will require investments in biofuel facilities (estimated 1.3 billion in the final NECP), as well as in recharging infrastructure (estimated, in the final NECP, at 415 million by 2030). Based on Finland's plans, nuclear energy represents another significant part of the investment needs for the energy supply sector in the coming years. First of all, two nuclear reactors are under construction: Olkiluoto 3 (OL3), planned for commissioning in 2020-2021, and Hanhikivi 1 (reactor supplied by Russia's Rosatom), which should be commissioned in the end of the 2020s. In addition, a site for long-term nuclear waste storage is to be commissioned in the mid-2020s. Sustainable transport infrastructure investment Infrastructure investment plans aim at increasing sustainable mobility. A new national transport system is being developed by 2021 under the lead of a parliamentary steering group. The plan is expected to cover 2021-2032 and thereby move towards a long-term planning scheme, the lack of which has been criticised by stakeholders. Three high-speed railroad lines are being considered; however, these are at an early stage of preparation. The 2020 budget proposal includes funding for preparatory works and studies for the Helsinki-Turku and Helsinki-Tampere high-speed lines (estimated 8-9 million annual passengers). Improvements could contribute to progress on SDG9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure (see Annex E). As regards electronic data transmission networks, commercial networks of 5G technology are becoming available. The government is currently taking care of the allocation of market segments. Some major international connection projects have suffered delays or have been suspended. The northeast broadband cable connection to China and Japan is delayed due to political discussions with Finland's neighbours, but the whole project could be constructed between 2020 and 2022. For now, the new government has decided not to join the Rail Baltica consortium, but continues to take part as an observer. The Rail Baltica project remains an important part of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) Scandinavia-Mediterranean corridor. Just Transition analysis Phasing out peat could notably contribute to Finland's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035. Finland is one of the main producers and the main consumers of peat in Europe ( 36 ). The country uses peat mainly as an energy source. According to the final NECP, peat accounted for 4-5% of the total energy supply in 2018. Peat plays a significant role as a fuel in combined heat and power plants. The CO2 emission intensity of peat is higher than that of brown coal or natural gas, and peat used as a domestic fuel enjoys favourable tax treatment to ensure it can compete with imported fossil fuels (IEA 2018). The government is committed to decreasing the use of peat for energy by at least half by 2030. As part of the overhaul of energy taxation, the government intends to assess the necessary changes to the taxation of peat, so that the country can achieve its 2030 target. At the same time, the government wants to ensure that timber material does not end up being incinerated. The government will have to take into account the distributional effects of peat taxation and respective compensatory measures for the most vulnerable households (European Commission, 2019g). The peat stock, the production of peat, and its use for energy is particularly concentrated in the north and centre of the country. The sparsely populated East and North of the country appears to be the NUTS2 region that is most affected by the transition from peat to carbon neutral energy production. As a region that is slightly weaker economically ( 37 ), it may have a more limited capacity to absorb transition shocks on its own. It is important that people can benefit from new opportunities in the green economy. The industry has estimated that the direct employment effect of peat production was 2,300 person-years in 2018 and, when the indirect effect is taken into account, the number increases to 4,200 person-years (Maaseudun tulevaisuus, 2019) ( 38 ). If peat production were to be phased out, it would mainly be employees in direct jobs who would be at risk of unemployment. Some indirect jobs may also be at risk, due to decreasing economic activity in peat-producing regions. This calls for the regional economy to be diversified, ensuring the attractiveness of the region for future investments, as well as the reskilling and upskilling of the workers concerned. The European Commission has proposed a Just Transition Fund to support the people and the territories most affected. Dedicated investment guidance for the Fund is in Annex D. Moving towards a more circular economy Finland strives to move towards a more circular economy, but the challenge is big. In 2020, Finland is preparing a National Circular Economy Action Plan with concrete actions and initiatives to accelerate the transition towards a climate neutral circular economy. Furthermore, a digital market place was established in 2019 to serve as a digital platform for producers and suppliers to announce waste, side streams, and services connected to recycling and waste management. Finland is also promoting the circular economy higher up on the international agenda. However, compared to other EU countries, Finland remains a resource intensive economy. In particular, materials and energy consumption intensities are well above EU average (European Commission, 2019g). Waste management is advanced, but there is room for further improvements. The generation of municipal waste in Finland was above the EU average (Eurostat, 2019b) and has fluctuated over recent years. The landfilling rate is among the lowest in the EU (1% in 2016) and far below the EU average (24%). However, the recycling rate for municipal waste, using calculation method 2 as set out in Commission decision 2011\/753\/EU, was 49% in 2017, above the EU average of 47%. It seems quite likely that Finland will achieve the EU 2020 municipal waste recycling target of 50%. In any case, further measures are needed to achieve the ambitious targets laid down in the revised Waste Framework Directive for years 2025, 2030 and 2035.The 'Early Warning report' on waste management (European Commission, 2018e) recommended that Finland set mandatory recycling targets for municipalities in line with the national targets of 50%. It also recommended greater cooperation between producer responsibility organisations ( 39 ), municipalities and waste collection companies to drive efficiency savings and to reduce fragmentation. Measures to increase the recycling rate would contribute to advancing further towards SDG 11 Sustainable cities and communities and SDG12 Responsible consumption and production (see Annex E). Graph 3.5.1:NUTS2-region the most affected by the transition from peat to carbon neutral energy production Source: European Commission Finland ranks among the best performing countries regarding eco-innovation in the EU, while public investment in environmental protection appears to be rather modest. The country's ranking is very high in terms of both the EU eco-innovation index and the development and diffusion of environmental technologies. Most of the investment in environmental protection is carried out by industry and specialised providers, while the government contributes comparatively little, both relative to government spending elsewhere in the environmental field and relative to the private sector. More generally, the government's stake in environmental protection appears relatively modest as reflected by the GDP proportion of its environmental protection expenditures and output, both ranking among the lowest in the EU. Achieving climate neutrality will bring significant opportunities to create jobs. The transition to climate neutrality is expected to favour job creation for all skill groups. In particular, it is expected to introduce more low to middle-skilled, middle-paying jobs in the service, industry and construction sectors (Eurofound 2019). It is essential to prepare the labour force in order for the green transition to be successful. To make this transition effective and socially balanced, Finland needs to continue investing in up-skilling and re-skilling its labour force to support the deployment of green technologies and target learning schemes towards the overall greening of the economy. Just transition includes a gender dimension. New green jobs are expected mainly in sectors with traditionally limited female representation, such as forestry and clean-tech (Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, 2017). This might help Finland compensate for the comparatively high inactivity of men between 25 and 54 (see chapter 3.3), if the appropriate activation and support measures are in place. Nevertheless, education and training schemes need to be geared towards mitigating existing gender inequalities by encouraging women to participate more in science, technology and engineering studies. In this context, social dialogue also plays an important role. Annex A: Overview Table Commitments Summary assessment ( 40 ) 2019 country-specific recommendations (CSRs) CSR 1: Ensure that the nominal growth rate of net primary government expenditure does not exceed 1.9% in 2020, corresponding to an annual structural adjustment of 0.5% of GDP. Improve the cost-effectiveness of and equal access to social and healthcare services. Finland was not assessed as regards addressing CSR 1 Ensure that the nominal growth rate of net primary government expenditure does not exceed 1.9% in 2020, corresponding to an annual structural adjustment of 0.5% of GDP. The compliance assessment with the Stability and Growth Pact will be carried out in spring 2020, when final data for 2019 will be available. Improve the cost-effectiveness of and equal access to social and healthcare services. Limited progress has been achieved on improving cost-effectiveness of and equal access to social and healthcare services. The government plans to continue with the healthcare reform initiated by the previous government. The reform still aims at addressing the fragmentation of the system and the related financial challenges faced by small, remote municipalities. The considered centralisation of service provision to county level is likely to lead to increases in efficiency. Accessibility would be promoted through a strengthening of the primary care system. The government plans to adopt the reform by the end of its term. CSR 2: Improve incentives to work and enhance skills and enhance active inclusion, notably through well-integrated services for the unemployed and the inactive. Finland has made some progress in addressing CSR 2 Improve incentives to work Limited progress has been made on reducing inactivity and unemployment traps. The social security reform is a long-term process aiming at simplifying the benefit system. The reform could be a major component in helping the government attain its objective of a 75% employment rate for people aged 15-64 by making work pay more in all circumstances. Moreover, it should improve the coordination of different benefits. The government plans to implement the reform gradually, over the course of two government terms. The groundwork started during Sipila's government term. In 2019, Finland deployed a real-time income register that could reduce the bureaucratic traps. This register has the potential to speed up handling times of benefits, thus increasing the 'certainty of income' level, whenever part-time or short-term work is taken up. Moreover, it could open up possibilities for a more effective combination of work-income and benefits in the future. The government has set up seven ministerial working groups with tripartite sub-groups to prepare labour market reforms to explore ways to increase employment. and enhance skills Some progress has been achieved on skills. The government programme recognises inequality, exclusion and differences in learning outcomes as the most serious threats in education. The budget has been increased to address these challenges. The recent VET reform pushes for more responsiveness to the labour market needs and is in its final stages of implementation. Participation in adult education is concentrated on the highly educated, high-skilled, and high-earning employees. The government is launching a 'continuous learning' reform to address skills shortages of adult workers. Notwithstanding, labour shortages, especially of high-skilled workers, are reported to be the most important obstacle to investment and risk becoming a drag on growth. There is a concern about the lack of sufficient funds to implement recent educational reforms in early childhood education, as well as in compulsory and tertiary education. and enhance active inclusion, notably through well-integrated services for the unemployed and the inactive. Some progress has been achieved on active inclusion. The announced 'work ability' reform is expected to result in better coordinated benefits, more personalised, more integrated services. The same results are also expected from trials carried out in municipalities to improve integration of employment services, education and training services, and social and health services in order to support employability of jobseekers who have weak labour market status (those receiving labour market support,, i.e. basic unemployment benefit, young people under 30 years old, and immigrants). The assumption is that more locally provided services would be more efficient. The Parliament will decide on the law in February-March 2020, and the trials are expected to follow in April-May. The government has earmarked 36 million for implementing the 'work ability' programme. This programme aims to increase the inclusion of people with partial work abilities in the labour market. Employment services, and social and health services will be strengthened. Some 20 work ability coordinators will be hired in the employment offices. As a part of the work ability programme, public procurement will be used to hire those people in the weakest position in the labour market. CSR 3: Focus investment-related economic policy on research and innovation, taking into account regional disparities, focus investment-related economic policy on low carbon and energy transition, taking into account regional disparities, and focus investment-related economic policy on sustainable transport, taking into account regional disparities Finland has made limited progress in addressing CSR 3 Focus investment-related economic policy on research and innovation, taking into account regional disparities, Limited progress has been made on public research and innovation investment. The amount of public money for research and development support is expected to increase, but remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP. A roadmap will be drawn up to raise overall R&D investment to 4% of GDP and to make Finland the best place in the world for innovation and experiment. focus investment-related economic policy on low carbon and energy transition, taking into account regional disparities, Limited progress has been made on investment in low carbon and energy transition. The government's objective is to make Finland carbon neutral by 2035 and the world's first fossil-free social society. This will require a comprehensive agenda of policies and measures. The government has announced an overhaul of energy taxation by the 2020 budget, notably with a pledge to phase out fossil fuel subsidies on oil, coal and, possibly, peat. and focus investment-related economic policy on sustainable transport, taking into account regional disparities Limited progress has been achieved on investment in sustainable transport. Sustainable infrastructure investment is being planned, notably to increase labour mobility. Three high-speed railroad lines are being considered to improve labour mobility, but economic studies have not been carried out yet by independent analysts. A new national transport system will be developed in 2020-2021 under the lead of a parliamentary steering group. CSR 4: Strengthen the monitoring of household debt and establish the credit registry system Finland has made some progress in addressing CSR 4 Strengthen the monitoring of household debt Some progress has been made on monitoring the household debt. In October 2019, the Ministry of Finance proposed to limit to 60% the loan to value ratio (selling price ratio) applicable to housing companies. In parallel, a debt-to-income ratio cap will be applied to households when their loan requests exceed a certain threshold. The Ministry of Finance is drafting further macro-prudential measures. The legislation on consumer credit has been tightened. An interest cap at 20% entered into force in September 2019. and establish the credit registry system Limited progress has been made on the setting up a credit registry system. The work on the credit registry is still being planned. The government has recently decided that the credit registry is to be managed by a public entity. The official working group is expected to be established in early 2020. The necessary legislative work on data protection is expected to start in January 2020, while work on the registry itself might incur delays. Nevertheless, the authorities are committed to having the necessary legislation in place by 2023. Europe 2020 (national targets and progress) Employment rate target set in the NRP: 78%. Latest figure: 76.7% (October 2019). R&D target set in the NRP: 4% of GDP According to Statistics Finland, R&D expenditure amounted to 6.4 billion in 2018. Expenditure had increased by as much as 265 million from the previous year. This was the biggest increase in volume terms since 2008. Growth occurred in all sectors: in the business sector it was 5%, in the public sector 2% and in the higher education sector 4% compared to 2017. This was the second favourable year in a row following the decreasing trend of R&D expenditure that lasted for 5 years before that. The GDP proportion of R&D expenditure in 2018 was 2.75% (cf. 2.73% in 2017). At its highest, the proportion was 3.75% in 2009. Although Finland's proportion has dropped by 1 pp. over the past 10 years, it is still significantly above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and EU average. In 2018, businesses accounted for 66% of R&D expenditure and for 61% of R&D funding. The business sector's proportion of total R&D expenditure has declined markedly from 2008 when it was 74%. The public sector is responsible for 9% of R&D expenditure. However, for R&D funding, its proportion is 32%, including basic funding for the higher education sector provided by the Ministry of Education and Culture. According to the official estimates by Statistics Finland, the GDP proportion of R&D will decrease again in 2019. Although R&D expenditure will most likely grow in 2019 by over 110 million, the GDP proportion will go down to 2.71%. This is because the growth rate of the economy is higher than that of R&D expenditure. According to recent estimates from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, the proportion will remain at the level of 2.70-2.75% over the next few years. National greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target: - 16% in 2020 compared with 2005 (in sectors not included in the EU emissions trading scheme) According to Statistics Finland's instant preliminary data, the total emissions of greenhouse gases in 2018 totalled 56.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2 eq.). Emissions grew by 2% from the previous year. The growth in emissions was most influenced by increased consumption of natural gas and peat. Those emissions not included in the EU emissions trading system remained at last year's level, but exceeded the EU's annual emission allocations by 0.4 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. According to most recent projections, the non-ETS emissions, with existing national policies and measures in place, will be slightly over the emission target in the year 2020. However, it is expected that Finland can close the projected gap between the emission target in 2020 and actual emissions by using flexibility measures such as the transfer of surplus annual emission allocation from the earlier years to the later years of the period 2013-2020. 2020 renewable energy target: 38% Finland's renewable energy share, expressed in percentage of gross final energy consumption, was 41% in 2017. Also in 2018, the share is expected to have been clearly over 40%, thus already above Finland's 2020 target. Energy efficiency, 2020 energy consumption targets: Finland's 2020 energy efficiency target is 35.9 Mtoe expressed in primary energy consumption (26.7 Mtoe expressed in final energy consumption) The primary energy consumption amounted to approximately 32.3 Mtoe in 2018. With existing policies and measures, the energy consumption is projected to be 32.4 Mtoe in 2020. Early school\/training leaving target: 8%. Eurostat figure for 2018: 8.3%. Tertiary education target: 42% of population aged 30-34. Eurostat figure for 2018: 44.2%. Target for reducing the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion, expressed as an absolute number of people: 770,000 less people at risk of poverty or exclusion (base year 2010: 911,000). The latest statistics (May 2019) show that 890,000 Finns, or 16.4% of the household population, were at risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2017 (compared to 849,000 in 2016). Most of the people that are at risk of poverty or social exclusion live in low income households, which made up 12.1% of the population. The second most at risk group of poverty or social exclusion were those who live in households with low work intensity, affecting 7.6% of the population. Only 2.6% of households in Finland suffer from severe material deprivation.

Annex D: Investment guidance on Just Transition Fund 2021-2017 for Finland Building on the Commission proposal, this Annex D presents the preliminary Commission services' views on priority investment areas and framework conditions for effective delivery for the 2021-2027 Just Transition Fund investments in Finland. These priority investment areas are derived from the broader analysis of territories facing serious socio-economic challenges deriving from the transition process towards a climate-neutral economy of the Union by 2050 in Finland, assessed in the report. This Annex provides the basis for a dialogue between Finland and the Commission services as well as the relevant guidance for the Member States in preparing their territorial just transition plans, which will form the basis for programming the Just Transition Fund. The Just Transition Fund investments complement those under Cohesion Policy funding for which guidance in the form of Annex D was given in the 2019 Country Report for Finland 41 . Finland is one of the main producers and the main consumer of peat in Europe. Peat production, used mainly as an energy source, employs the equivalent to 2300 persons\/year. Peat use in energy production is equivalent to coal in terms of CO2 intensity. Phasing out peat could contribute notably to Finland's goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. The sparsely populated East and North Finland (Etela-Savo, Pohjois-Savo, Pohjois-Karjala, Kainuu, Keski-Pohjanmaa, Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, Lappi) appears to be the most affected region by transition from peat to carbon neutral energy production. Based on this preliminary assessment, it appears warranted that the Just Transition Fund concentrates its intervention on this region. Finland's government is committed to decrease the use of peat for energy by at least half by 2030. As a result, many workers would be at risk of unemployment in this sparsely populated region where labour demand is otherwise limited. The smart specialisation strategy 42 provides an important framework to set priorities for innovation in support of economic transformation and it could offer a framework for making the transition towards a more diversified, competitive and green economy. In order to tackle these transition challenges, high priority investment needs have been identified for the development and deployment of innovative solutions for efficient and clean production and energy use. Key actions of the Just Transition Fund could target in particular: investments in research and innovation activities and fostering transfer of advanced technologies; investments in the deployment of technology and infrastructures for affordable clean energy, greenhouse gas emission reduction, energy efficiency and renewable energy. In order to seize the opportunities stemming from ambitious decarbonisation policies, priority investment needs have been identified for the diversification of the local economy and ensuring the necessary skills for those affected by the transition. Key actions of the Just Transition Fund could target in particular: productive investments in SMEs, including start-ups, leading to economic diversification and reconversion; investments in the creation of new firms, including through business incubators and consulting services; upskilling and reskilling of workers. In order to minimise the greenhouse effect of the areas released from peat production, related investment needs have been identified. Key actions of the Just Transition Fund could target in particular: investments in regeneration of sites, land restoration and repurposing projects.

(1) () This report assesses Finland's economy in light of the European Commission's annual sustainable growth strategy, published on 17 December 2019. In this document, the Commission sets out a new strategy on how to address not only the short-term economic challenges but also the economy's longer-term challenges. This new economic agenda of competitive sustainability rests on four dimensions: environmental sustainability, productivity gains, fairness and macroeconomic stability. (2) () Information on the level of progress and actions taken to address the policy advice in each respective subpart of a country-specific recommendation is presented in the overview table in the Annex. (3) () Within the scope of its legal basis, the European Semester can help drive national economic and employment policies towards the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by monitoring progress and ensuring closer coordination of national efforts. The present report contains reinforced analysis and monitoring on the SDGs. A new annex (Annex E) presents a statistical assessment of trends in relation to SDGs in Finland over the past 5 years, based on Eurostat's EU SDG indicator set. (4) () Investment in skills not included. (5) () The ratio is 49 % for the EU-28 as a whole. (6) () The NUTS classification (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of the EU. NUTS2 are basic regions for the application of regional policies. (7) () This export item includes hardware and software consultancy, software programs that improve business productivity, as well as computer game programs. (8) () In 2015, the UN Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that will steer the promotion of sustainable development in 20162030. They aim at the eradication of extreme poverty from the world and at ensuring wellbeing in an environmentally sustainable manner. (9) () In May 2019, Finland published a report measuring progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs (Towards the Finland we want by 2050: the State of Sustainable Development in 2019 in light of Indicators and Comparative Studies). Finland's Prime Minister's Office has also commissioned and funded a project (Polku 2030) to evaluate Finland's sustainable development policy and make recommendations for further action. (10) () For the assessment of other reforms implemented in the past, see in particular Section 3. (11) () Information on the level of progress and measures taken to act on the policy advice in each respective subpart of a country-specific recommendation is presented in the overview table in the Annex. This overall assessment does not include an assessment of compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. (12) () The Energy Taxation Directive (2003\/96\/EC) has a mandatory exemption for aviation and sea navigation fuels. (13) () Under the special tax number system, a construction worker cannot be employed at a building site in Finland without a personal tax number. The registration for Finnish personal identity code is required for obtaining the tax number, which is printed on the nametags worn by everyone at any construction site. The public authorities for occupational safety and health control the use of nametags. The Finnish Tax Administration's online information service allows e.g. employers to check whether the registration of an individual worker's name and number is valid. (14) () The long-term fiscal sustainability gap indicator S2 shows the upfront fiscal adjustment to the current primary balance (in structural terms) required to stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio over the infinite horizon. (15) () Reported by employers that recruited or tried to recruit, and had difficulties in filling these vacancies (16) () Based on the agreement between Technology Finland and the industry union that will increase wages by 3.3% (1.3% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021. An additional 0.6% will be settled locally) (17) () Only 10.8% of the adult population do not possess an upper-secondary or higher qualification, compared to an EU average of 21.9%. (18) () The MSD is the result of a revision of the material deprivation indicator (MD). It takes into consideration a broader concept of deprivation as it also includes items related to social activities, whereas the MD measured only material deprivation. It is based on 13 items (of which some are common to the MD). The MSD rate is the proportion of people in the total population lacking (because of an enforced lack) at least 5 items out of the 13 MSD items (as opposed to 3 or more out of 9 items for the MD). (19) () The impact of each type of transfer is the percentage decrease in the at-risk-of-poverty (AROP) rate\/ poverty gap 'caused' by the given type of transfer in a given country and year. More precisely, it is measured as the percentage difference between a counterfactual AROP rate\/poverty gap, calculated based on disposable household income including all transfers except the type analysed, and the AROP rate\/poverty gap, taking into account all transfers. (20) () In Finland, secondary education covers two phases on the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) scale. Level 2 or lower secondary education is considered the second and final phase of basic education, and level 3 (upper) secondary education is the stage before tertiary education. (21) () The country has a relatively strong scientific performance (ranked 6th and 10th in the EU in terms of top publication and international co-publications), even though its Nordic peers outperform it. (22) () For example, incubator, business modules and web-based information technology courses. (23) () The cost of the plant was 1.2 billion, of which 200 million was a loan from the European Investment Bank. The European Fund for Strategic Investments guaranteed a 75 million loan, as announced during the launch of 'Investment Plan for Europe' in July 2015. The Government provided 32.1 million state aid supporting renewable energy and energy efficiency investments. In addition, state-owned Finnvera guaranteed a 400 million loan. (24) () The VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd is a state-owned and -controlled non-profit limited liability company. It provides research and innovation services and information for domestic and international customers and partners, both in private and public sectors. VTT is part of Finland's innovation system and operates under the mandate of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment. (25) () The Small Business Act (SBA) is an overarching framework for the EU policy on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It aims to improve the approach to entrepreneurship in Europe, simplify the regulatory and policy environment for SMEs, and remove the remaining barriers to their development. (26) () Seed capital is the initial funding used to begin creating a business or a new product.

Institutional quality is defined as a multi-dimensional concept consisting of high impartiality and quality of public service delivery, along with low corruption. Funded by the European Commission in 2010, 2013 and 2017, the EQI aims at capturing average citizens' perceptions and experiences with corruption, and the extent to which they rate their public services as impartial and of good quality in their region of residence.

This category covers a number of typical situations to be interpreted on a case by case basis taking into account country-specific conditions. They include the following: no legal, administrative, or budgetary measures have been announced in the national reform programme,in any other official communication to the national Parliament\/relevant parliamentary committees or the European Commission,publicly (e.g. in a press statement or on the government's website);no non-legislative acts have been presented by the governing or legislative body;the Member State has taken initial steps in addressing the CSR, such as commissioning a study or setting up a study group to analyse possible measures to be taken (unless the CSR explicitly asks for orientations or exploratory actions). However, it has not proposed any clearly-specified measure(s) to address the CSR.Limited progress: The Member State has: announced certain measures but these address the CSR only to a limited extent; and\/orpresented legislative acts in the governing or legislative body but these have not been adopted yet and substantial further, non-legislative work is needed before the CSR is implemented;presented non-legislative acts, but has not followed these up with the implementation needed to address the CSR.Some progress: The Member State has adopted measures that partly address the CSR; and\/or that address the CSR, but a fair amount of work is still needed to fully address the CSR as only a few of the measures have been implemented. For instance, a measure or measures have been adopted by the national Parliament or by ministerial decision but no implementing decisions are in place. Substantial progress: The Member State has adopted measures that go a long way towards addressing the CSR and most of them have been implemented. Full implementation: The Member State has implemented all measures needed to address the CSR appropriately.

Objective and Scope The COVID-19 pandemic has already placed great stress on healthcare systems in a number of EU Member States. Many fear that their available intensive care places will not be sufficient. Health professionals are overworked and workforce shortages are growing acute in many healthcare facilities. A number of countries are calling for emergency assistance from the EU and other EU Member States. This call for support has been already answered by some. Recent regional initiatives of hospital cooperation to treat COVID-19 patients several German Lander and Luxembourg offering intensive care places and hospital treatment to Italian and French patients are saving lives and help alleviate the capacities of health systems under stress by providing intensive care places. This is an encouraging and important signal of European solidarity. Since exceptional emergency situations exist a more coordinated approach in cross-border healthcare (1) is justified. The European Commission calls on national, regional and local health authorities to make full use of: existing structures and mechanisms to work together to assist patients in need of critical care by offering available hospital bed capacity, and available health professionals who constitute the backbone of our health systems and to enable them to share expertise and skills working hand in hand with health professionals across borders. so as to alleviate overstretched healthcare facilities in Member States in need and where it does not put the functioning of their own health systems at risk. The European Commission is fully committed to assisting health authorities by: coordinating requested and offered intensive care places for patients and appropriately qualified medical personnel through the Health Security Committee and the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS); coordinating and co-funding the emergencytransport of patients and appropriately qualified teams of medical personnel across borders when Member States request assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism; providing clarity on the reimbursement of healthcare costs for treatment in another Member State in line with the Social Security Coordination Regulations; providing clarity on arrangements for patient mobility across borders: transfer of patient records, continuity of care and the mutual recognition of prescriptions in line with the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive; encouraging local, regional and national health authorities to use, where existing, bi-lateral and regional agreements and contact points to relieve the burden of critical care units treating COVID-19 patients in the neighbouring region; encouraging Member States or specialist non-governmental organisations to send appropriately qualified teams of medical personnel across borders. 2. Health Security Committee to coordinate cross-border assistance in healthcare The EU Health Security Committee (2), composed of Member States representatives and chaired by the Commission, supports the exchange of information and the coordination of preparedness and responses to serious cross-border health threats. The Commission, via the EU Health Security Committee and the Early Warning and Response System, will facilitate the coordination of requests for cross-border health care assistance. Requests for assistance could relate to intensive care places, treatment and transfer of patients as well as appropriately qualified teams of medical personnel. The competent authority of the Member State in need of assistance notifies the Member States and the European Commission through the EWRS. The criteria for when to request assistance from the EU are for the national authorities to determine. Member States able to offer assistance can respond to the request through the EWRS. Once an offer has been accepted, the cooperating Member States coordinate the support directly with each other and with the hospitals concerning the details of the support. A summary table of requests and available assistance on offer will be regularly updated by the Commission and the Health Security Committee will be kept informed. 3. Emergency transport of patients: coordination and co-funding The Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) provides a 24\/7 service that can coordinate and co-finance the necessary medical transport. When Member States request such assistance, the ERCC will activate the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism in accordance with its standard procedures (3). 4. Reimbursement of the patient's medical costs in the treating Member State The coverage of healthcare costs will be governed by the Social Security Coordination Regulations (4). Patients who have to be transported to a hospital in a neighbouring or another Member State offering assistance should normally be in possession of a prior authorisation from the competent social security institution. This is not practical in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergency situation. The Commission calls on the Member States to take a pragmatic approach for patients requiring urgent care and in view of the public emergency to consider a general prior authorisation to ensure the coverage of all the expenses incurred by the hosting health care provider. It is recommended that it should be sufficient for the competent Member State to ensure that the patient carries a document attesting that s\/he is covered at the time of hospital admission or any other practical arrangements that the Member States involved may agree upon. This guidance applies to emergency healthcare only in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients still able to access non-urgent planned healthcare the usual procedures apply in principle for healthcare treatment in another Member State (5). 5. Healthcare arrangements for cross-border patients Member States should share patient summaries and ePrescriptions using where these services are used (6). In addition, patients should receive a copy of their medical records to facilitate both the treatment in another Member State, and the follow-up treatment at home. Health authorities may need to take additional steps to ensure the continuity of care, given possible differences in treatment protocols between borders. The general principle of the mutual recognition of prescriptions applies in accordance with the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive (7). The National Contact Points on Cross-Border Healthcare can provide general information for cross-border patients (8). 6. Free movement of patients across internal borders For EU citizens the rules laid down in the Free Movement Directive (9) continue to apply. Patients in need of urgent care in a healthcare facility in another Member State should not be refused entry where temporary controls at internal borders exist. Patients travelling for treatment for non-urgent care to another Member State should check that the border controls would enable them to travel. Emergency transport services should have priority within the transport system (via the \"green lanes\" (10) in accordance with COVID-19 guidelines for border management). Appropriate safety measures need to be taken for people who are identified as posing a risk to public health from COVID-19. 7. Cross-border healthcare cooperation in border regions The EU supports cooperation and integration of health systems in border regions with its Interreg programmes (i. e. seven zones of organised access to cross-border healthcare have been created alongside the Franco-Belgian border; emergency control centres of Lower Austria, South Bohemia and South Moravia are linked in real time to enable cross-border dispatch of ambulances under the Healthacross initiative; in Upper Rhine between the French-Germany-Switzerland border the TRISAN project coordinates networking activities to upgrade skills of professionals in healthcare sector). Several projects in Interreg regions are now contributing to a more coordinated approach to the pandemic. The Euregio Meuse-Rhine (NL\/BE\/D) in the Maastricht-Aachen-Liege-Hasselt area set up a tri-lateral crisis management centre (Task Force Corona). The cross-border Cerdanya Hospital (ES) between France and Spain co-operates with French hospitals to share intensive care capacity and personnel, working with the border police to ensure access for patients and health professionals. Member States, regional and local authorities should use the maximum flexibility offered by the Interreg programmes to address the challenges of the pandemic. Many border regions have already a history of and structures for cooperation, including in health, which should now be fully exploited to help each other in the spirit of European solidarity. 8. Healthcare personnel working together across borders Free movement of health professionals It is imperative that critical workers are able to reach their destination without delay. Member States should facilitate the smooth border crossing for health professionals and allow them unhindered access to work in a healthcare facility in another Member State (11). Emergency Medical Teams Member States or specialist NGOs can send appropriately qualified teams of medical personnel across borders, in response to requests for assistance. Eight European Emergency Medical Teams are already or in the process to be accredited by WHO for international emergency management assistance, deployable through the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism in response to a request. Existing capacity is currently limited as personnel may in most cases already be fully occupied in their home country. However, the European Medical Teams could be expanded through the activation of additional EU financial support. Recognition of Health Professional Qualifications Many health professions such as doctors with basic medical training, a number of medical specialisations, such as respiratory medicine, immunology or communicable diseases and nurses of general care are based on a minimum harmonisation under the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications (12). In cases of temporary and occasional service provision, only a simple declaration may be required for these professionals without any need to wait for a decision from the host Member State authorities. For other health professions, a mutual recognition procedure can take place, if the competent authorities deem it necessary to compare the substance of the training. The Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications sets out the most that can be required of health professionals wishing to move within the EU; it does not oblige the Member States to impose restrictions as regards recognition procedures and therefore does not prevent Member States from taking a more liberal approach to the treatment of incoming health professionals, be it for purposes of service provision or establishment, for instance by dropping the requirement for a prior declaration and prior check for qualifications or applying shorter deadlines for handling of applications, requesting fewer documents than usual, no certified translations or not insisting on a compensation measure when the host Member State considers that there is no major risk for patient safety. Further guidance from the Commission on aspects relevant for the cross-border mobility of health care professionals can be provided. Sharing Clinical Knowledge and Expertise in the EU: COVID19 CMSS (Clinical Management Support System) Member States' competent authorities and healthcare professionals are encouraged to use the COVID19 CMSS (Clinical Management Support System) in order to ensure a quick exchange of knowledge and experience between clinicians from across the EU and EEA on how to manage patients with severe COVID-19. Any clinician working in a hospital treating complex COVID-19 can have access to the Web Conferencing system and be supported by a dedicated Helpdesk by sending an e-mail to 9. Financial assistance for cross-border healthcare cooperation The EU offers financial assistance to Member States affected by a public health emergency via the Solidarity Fund (13). Health expenditure is also eligible expenditure under Structural Funds to countries and regions and further flexibility to shift funds was provided as part of the co-ordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Additional financial means are likely to be made available soon from the EU budget through the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) subject to the approval of the budgetary authorities. The funds channelled through the ESI are expected to cover cross-border cooperation to alleviate the pressure on health systems in the most affected EU regions. In particular, transportation of patients in need to cross-border hospitals which can offer free capacity, exchange of medical professionals, hosting foreign patients or other type of mutual support and deployment of temporary health care facilities.

(2) The attainment of the action's objectives presupposes mobility, tourism, organisation of events and public participation, which are extremely difficult if not virtually impossible in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. (3) As a direct consequence of lockdown measures taken across Europe, cultural venues have been closed down and cultural events have been cancelled or postponed for an undetermined period of time. European and international cultural cooperation projects have been radically slowed down because the physical crossing of borders has been limited. Finally, due to rapidly decreasing revenues and emerging public health-related needs, local, regional and national governments are under increased budgetary pressure. At present, private sponsoring for culture is also becoming more challenging because there are no public events to sponsor or because companies give priority to public health-related sponsoring activities. (4) The cities which currently hold and will hold the title of 'European Capital of Culture' (the 'title') are impacted to various degrees, primarily depending on the year for which they hold the title. It appears that the impact is strongest on the two cities holding the title in 2020 and the three cities preparing to hold the title in 2021, though the future impact on cities that will subsequently hold the title remains undefined. (5) The two cities holding the title in 2020 had to postpone or cancel events from March 2020 without any clarity as to when or even if the situation will return to normality, while still incurring costs. In practice, they are prevented from fully implementing their cultural programmes in 2020 and capitalising on the huge human and financial investment made. (6) In the three cities that will hold the title in 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a very high level of uncertainty in nearly all areas associated with their preparation: insecure financing perspectives from public and private partners, unknown future safety regulations affecting both participatory work and event types to be authorised, and travel restrictions reducing tourism flows and the possibility of European partnerships. The preventive measures introduced to counter the spread of COVID-19, resulting in delivery teams being in lockdown, have slowed down the preparatory work of those three cities to a critical point when they should be, under normal circumstances, doubling their efforts. The preparatory work has also been slowed down due to the fact that the economic survival of potential contracting partners is uncertain. (7) Decision No 445\/2014\/EU does not provide for the necessary flexibility to take into account such extraordinary circumstances and, more specifically, it does not include any provision on the prolongation or postponement of the year when a particular city holds the title. (8) Decision No 445\/2014\/EU should therefore be amended in a way that is strictly tailored to the need to address the exceptional situation in order to allow the cities holding the title that are the most severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to implement their cultural programmes in a way that allows the delivery of the objectives of the action. (9) Following a consultation process that involved the cities and Member States concerned, it was concluded that it would be appropriate to provide the cities designated by Croatia and Ireland to hold the title in 2020 with the possiblity to continue implementing their cultural programmes until 30 April 2021, without changing the year of designation. (10) Following a consultation process that involved the cities and Member States concerned, it was concluded that the year in which Romania and Greece are entitled to host the title should be postponed from 2021 to 2023 and the year in which a candidate country or potential candidate is entitled to host the title should be postponed from 2021 to 2022. (11) For the sake of legal certainty, in particular for the cities holding the title in 2020 and 2021, and in order to avoid any disruption to the application of Decision No 445\/2014\/EU, this Decision should enter into force as a matter of urgency and should apply from 1 January 2021. (12) Decision No 445\/2014\/EU should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Decision No 445\/2014\/EU is amended as follows: (1) Article 3 is amended as follows: (a) the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 is replaced by the following: 'The title shall be awarded each year to a maximum of one city in each of the two Member States appearing in the calendar set out in the Annex (\"the calendar\") and, in the relevant years, to one city from a European Free Trade Association country which is party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (\"EFTA\/EEA country\"), a candidate country or a potential candidate, or to one city from a country that accedes to the Union in the circumstances set out in paragraph 5.

However, the cities holding the title in 2020 may continue to implement their cultural programme until 30 April 2021.'; (3) in Article 16(1), the third subparagraph is replaced by the following: 'The cities concerned shall draw up their evaluation reports and transmit them to the Commission by 31 December of the year following the year of the title. However, the cities holding the title in 2020 shall draw up their evaluation reports and transmit them to the Commission by 30 April 2022.'; (4) the Annex is replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Decision.

The year was firstly characterised by the conclusion of three MFA operations in the Eastern neighbourhood: Ukraine MFA-IV, Georgia MFA-III and Moldova, as well as the adoption of a new, follow-up operation with Jordan (MFA-III) in the Southern neighbourhood. Furthermore, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 25 May 2020 the European Parliament and the Council adopted a EUR 3 billion MFA package to 10 enlargement and neighbourhood partners to help them to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic 2 . Implementation is ongoing. For each beneficiary country, the report provides more detailed information on: (i) their macroeconomic and financial situation; (ii) implementation of their MFA operations, and (iii) progress in accomplishing their structural reforms agenda. The annexes include overview tables on the effective disbursements of MFA operations since 1990 by date of adoption of the decisions, as well as tables on MFA commitment and payment amounts in 20062020, by year and by region. 3 Background analysis of beneficiaries of macro-financial assistance 4 1.Georgia 1.1.Macroeconomic performance Georgia's GDP contracted by 6.2% in 2020. The outbreak of the coronavirus brought a severe recession from the second quarter of the year. GDP declined by 12.3% year-on-year in Q2, followed by a smaller contraction by 5.6% year-on-year in Q3. The situation deteriorated again due to a new wave of COVID-19 cases and the reintroduction of restrictions in November. All sectors of the economy apart from agriculture and mining contracted in 2020, with the most severe drop in the sector of hotels and restaurants. The unemployment rate in Georgia increased to 20.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020, up by 3.6 percentage points compared to the same period of 2019. Consumer price inflation decreased to 2.4% year-on-year in December 2020 from 7% in December 2019 but then resurged to 7.2% in March 2021. Despite falling inflation and taking into account the uncertain economic outlook, the central bank cut the refinancing rate only slightly in the course of 2020, from 9% to 8% and more recently raised it to 8.5% in March 2021. This reflects, inter alia, pressures stemming from the Georgian currency, the lari, depreciating by 20% against the euro and by 13% against the US dollar in 2020. The general government deficit reached 9.3% of GDP in 2020, slightly higher than the 8.5% of GDP foreseen in the revised budget law. The difference is due to the additional support package announced in response to the new containment measures in the last weeks of the year. The ratio of public debt to GDP increased to 62% at the end of 2020 from 41% at end-2019. Georgia's balance-of-payments position deteriorated in 2020. The current account deficit increased from USD 1 billion in 2019 to USD 1.97 billion in 2020, corresponding to 12.4% of GDP. The factor that had the strongest impact on the current account position was a dramatic fall in revenues from tourism, which had amounted to over USD 3 billion in 2019 and dropped to USD 0.5 billion in 2020. On the other hand, Georgia's merchandise trade deficit narrowed. The increased current account deficit was financed by continuing (albeit slower) inflow of foreign direct investment and, most importantly, by increased volumes of grants and concessional loans from the international partners, including the EU. Georgia's international reserves remained broadly stable in recent months, totalling USD 3.9 billion at the end of October 2020 (corresponding to around 5 months of imports), having increased from USD 3.5 billion at end-2019. For 2021, most forecasts envisage a GDP recovery by 3.5-4%, but this outlook is highly uncertain. It depends notably on the evolution of the pandemic in Georgia and in other countries, on the continuation of the fiscal stimulus in 2021, and on the size of financial inflows from abroad, especially revenues from tourism and remittances.

The amount of this tranche was EUR 25 million, including EUR 5 million in the form of grants and EUR 20 million in loans. Following an official request from Georgia for a new MFA in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the European Parliament and the Council approved a EUR 3 billion COVID-19 MFA package in May 2020, including up to EUR 150 million for Georgia. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and the Loan Facility Agreement (LFA) relating to this MFA operation were signed and ratified by the Georgian Parliament on 30 September 2020. The MoU entered into force on 30 September 2020, and the LFA entered into force on 20 October 2020. In accordance with the MoU, the assistance is to be provided in two instalments. The first instalment (EUR 75 million) was subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights) and the IMF programme remaining on track, and it was disbursed in November 2020. The second instalment of EUR 75 million will additionally be subject to fulfilment of a set of policy conditions laid down in the MoU in the field of public procurement, pension system, company law, governance of state-owned enterprises, judicial system, energy efficiency and the labour market. These MFA programmes are provided in conjunction with the resources from international financial institutions and bilateral donors including the IMF 5 , under its four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme with Georgia approved in April 2017 and augmented in 2020 (to a total of approx. EUR 690 million). All reviews under this programme have been successfully approved by the IMF Board, including the most recent, eighth and final one in April 2021. 1.3.Structural Reforms Georgia's structural reform agenda focuses in particular on improving the business environment, labour market, energy and transport. The Georgian authorities intend to complement structural reforms with fiscal reforms, strengthening of the financial sector, as well as continuous implementation of the Association Agreement with the EU. In terms of improving the business environment, the Georgian Parliament adopted in September 2020 a new insolvency law supporting adequate protection of creditor rights and timely and efficient insolvency processes in line with international standards. A new company law, aimed at regulating corporate relations and approximating the legislation to the EU directives, has been submitted to the Parliament. The authorities have continued improving the revenue administration, e.g. by automatic refund of VAT credits (since November 2020), development of IT strategy and a risk-based approach. Regarding the labour market, Georgia implemented several policy actions from the National Strategy of Labour and Employment Policy, adopted in December 2019. This included the adoption of the Law on Employment Services in July 2020, adoption of substantial amendments to the Labour Code in September 2020 and strengthening of the labour inspection. In the field of energy, the Georgian Parliament adopted in May 2020 laws on energy efficiency and on energy performance of buildings, implementing the EU acquis in this area. Despite the pandemic, the authorities have advanced their infrastructure development plans. As regards transport, several new sections of the East-West Highway were completed in 2020, while the construction on the remaining sections is underway. In the financial sector, the National Bank of Georgia is strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework. In particular, the implementation of the resolution framework for financial institution advanced in 2020, with adoption of the relevant secondary legislation. Georgia continues to implement the measures and obligations resulting from the Association Agreement with the EU, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). The recent Association Implementation Report of February 2021 concludes that while alignment to the EU acquis and European standards has broadly continued, further efforts are needed in particular to consolidate democracy after the recent elections and to advance the reform of the judiciary. Georgia's national reform agenda is supported by MFA conditionality. For example, conditions of the current MFA operation notably require an adoption of the company law, improvements of the judicial system, as well as reforms in the field of the labour market, energy efficiency, governance of state-owned enterprises public procurement and pension system. Status of economic reforms Georgia 1. Price liberalisation Prices are largely market-driven. 2. Trade regime Georgia (a WTO member since 2000) has a liberal trade policy, with no quantitative restrictions on imports or exports. In June 2014, it signed an Association Agreement with the EU, including a deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA) agreement, which entered into force in September 2014. Georgia also has FTAs with its other key trading partners such as Turkey and China. 3. Exchange rate regime There is a floating exchange rate for the lari, with limited official intervention by the National Bank of Georgia. There are no restrictions on current international transactions and Georgia does not operate capital controls. 4. Foreign direct investment Georgia has a liberal regime for FDI and unlimited repatriation of capital and profits. FDI inflows in recent years have consistently been among the highest in the region, although they declined to some 4% of GDP in 2020. 5. Monetary policy The main monetary policy objective of the Central Bank of Georgiais price stability. The Bank is currently applying an inflation-targeting regime, with a target of 3% for 2019-2022. The effectiveness of monetary policy is significantly constrained by the high level of dollarisation: as of end-2020, 55% of loans and 61% of deposits were denominated in foreign currency. 6. Public finances and taxation The public finance management system is essentially sound and transparent. Further needed reforms are ongoing to strengthen public investment management and manage contingent liabilities from state-owned companies and public-private partnerships. Public revenues are constrained by the Constitution, which prescribes a referendum for the introduction of new taxes or the raising of tax rates (Article 94), while the budget deficit, public debt and public spending are capped by the Liberty Act, in force since January 2014, at 3%, 60% and 30% of GDP, respectively. 7. Privatisation and enterprise restructuring Most state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been privatised, with their number falling from around 1,300 in 2009 to around 350 currently, including some 50 public corporationa and some 300 government entities. The government, with support of the IMF and the World bank, has recently started a reform of remaining SOEs aimed at improving their transparency and efficiency. 8. Financial sector Georgia's financial sector is small and dominated by banks, which hold more than 90% of total financial sector assets. However, banking sector credit to the economy amounts to only around 60% of GDP. The sector is concentrated, with the two largest banks, out of 16 in total, holding around two thirds of the assets. Georgia's banking sector has a low-risk profile and has generally remained resilient, reporting sufficient capital and liquidity. The capital adequacy ratio stood at 17.6% in December 2020. The share of nonperforming loans to total gross loans was very low at 2.3% at the end of 2020 (by IMF's methodology). 2.Moldova 1.4.Macroeconomic performance On the back of the pandemic and drought in the summer, Moldova's economy contracted by 7% in 2020. Much of it can be accounted for by the fall in final consumption (significantly affected by the household sector), with an effect of -5.8 percentage points on the GDP. Gross capital formation also contracted, although less profoundly by 2.1% and with relatively low impact on the GDP (-0.5 percentage points). On the supply side, due to the extreme weather conditions, agriculture was among the most affected sectors, with output down by over a quarter compared to 2019, followed by wholesale and retail trade. The government introduced a series of measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic-induced crisis, including increases in social spending, temporary tax deferrals and monetary easing. However, the overall level of support was rather moderate, accounting for about 1% of GDP. In 2020 inflation continued to moderate in Moldova. While in January, the annual inflation rate stood at 6.8%, it decreased significantly throughout the year, reaching 0.4% by December, therefore, falling below the target level set by the National Bank of Moldova at 5% 1.5 percentage points. The strong disinflationary trend was a result of the global recession, including the falling oil prices, as well as a sharp decline in domestic demand. In response to this, and to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic, the central bank cut the base rate five times in 2020, such that in November it reached a historic low of 2.7%. Owing to increased spending on pandemic-related measures, the initial budget for 2020, projected at 3% of GDP, was amended several times throughout last year, up to 8% with the September revision. However, because of underspending (annulment, optimization or underperformance of several spending programmes), by the end of 2020, the fiscal deficit narrowed to 5.3%. In December, the Moldovan authorities passed a new budget law for 2021, albeit in a manner that led to domestic controversies, without proper consultation and lack of a transparent approval process. The 2021 state budget projects an increase of the deficit to 6.5% of GDP, over half of which (58%) is to be financed with the support from International Financial Institutions. As a result of import compression and lower energy prices, the current account deficit narrowed to 6.6% of GDP, compared to 9.3% in 2019. Moreover, as the value of imports is almost double, the sharp, but similar decrease of both imports (-7.3%) and exports (-10.6%) during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a contraction of the trade deficit. An improved current account balance, in addition to financial assistance from the EU and the IMF, as well as central bank interventions, resulted in a significant increase of international reserves by nearly 24%, reaching 3.8 billion at the end of the year. Total external debt has accelerated in 2020 to 69.7% of GDP, up from 61.7% in 2019. In 2020, despite the shock, the fall in remittances (which make about 15% of Moldova's GDP) was relatively low by 2.4%. FDI, which has been at low levels since the bank fraud crisis in 2014, further declined last year, reaching 0.6% of GDP. The economy is expected to recover modestly in 2021 (GDP is forecast to grow by about 4.5% according to the IMF). However, the macroeconomic performance of Molodva this year will largely depend on the epidemiological situation, including the vaccine rollout, and external support.

The EU-Moldova MoU was signed on 24 November 2017, outlining a series of economic policy conditions attached to the assistance. The MoU and related documents (LFA, grant agreement) entered into force on 18 January 2018. The first disbursement of EUR 30 million (out of which EUR 20 million in loans and EUR 10 million in grants) was initially put on hold, due to challenging polticial situation, and it was only paid in October 2019, following a change of government and a renewed reform effort. Similarly, the second instalment was made available to Moldova after some disucssions with regard to the political pre-conditions. To that end, a letter was handed over the Moldovan Prime Minister in February 2020 with eight short-term actions to be implemented by the authorities and help assess the political pre-conditions in a favourable manner. After a positive opinion, the decision for the second disbursement was made on 9 June 2020. The payment proceeded in two parts, on 16 July a EUR 20 million loan, and on 1 August a EUR 10 million grant component. The third and final tranche of the programme was cancelled because not all related policy conditions were satisfied before 18 July 2020, when the MFA expired. The MFA was linked to a four-year IMF programme of Extended Credit Facility\/Extended Fund Fcaility (ECF\/EFF) in the amount of SDR 129.4 million (about USD 178.7 million). The final sixth review of the programme, togther with article IV consultations, was successfully concluded in March 2020. In 2020, as part of the COVID-19 MFA package adopted in May 2020, the European Parliament and the Council agreed on a new one-year MFA programme of EUR 100 million to Moldova. The first instalment (EUR 50 million) was subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights) and was disbursed on 25 November 2020. The second disbursement is conditional on Moldova successfully fulfilling all policy conditions agreed with the EU in the MoU. The conditionality focuses in particular on reforms in the area of public finance management, good governance and fight against corruption, as well as on improving the business climate. In addition, the Moldovan authorities need to ensure a positive dialogue with the IMF and possible adoption of a new reform programme. In July 2020, a staff-level agreement was signed for a three-year ECF\/EFF programme of USD 558 million. The IMF Executive Board decision was expected in September, however, it has been repeatedly postponed due to significant delays in the implementation of the programme's prior actions, as well as worrying political developments (such as the uncertainty around the 11 July 2021 snap-elections and backsliding on some key economic reforms). Discussions might have to start about a new IMF programme, yet little progress has been made so far. 1.6.Structural Reforms The overall framework guiding the process of structural reforms in Moldova is set out in the commitments made under the Association Agreement with the European Union, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement. Due to the pandemic, the reform progress in 2020 has been moderate, and towards the end of the year it was marked by some worrying developments in the Moldovan parliament, as well as the resignation of the government in December. The outlook remains mixed as political instability in Moldova continues to weigh on the country's capacity to undertake reforms, where a way forward could be the formation of a new Parliament through possible snap-elections. However, Moldova continues to benefit from the effects of the reform progress achieved over the past few years. Monetary and fiscal policies had been strengthened and substantial structural economic reforms had been carried out. The banking sector in Moldova has been going through a major restructuring since the banking crisis triggered by large-scale money laundering and bank fraud in 2014-2015. Unfit shareholders have been removed from a large number of banks and the control of the three remaining systemic banks has been taken over by international actors. A new banking law entered into force on 1 January 2018. The law introduced an updated regulatory and supervision framework in line with Basel III standards. In 2019, new capital adequacy requirements in line with the EU's CRDIV\/CRR package were approved. As a result of the banking sector reforms, including in particular the regulatory and supervisory framework, Moldovan banks have become more resilient and safe. Some positive developments related to the fight against corruption were noted in 2020, including the increase of the annual budget of its anti-corruption institutions such as the National Integrity Authority, the Criminal Asset Recovery Agency and the Financial Investigation Unit; as well as the adoption of the new Strategy for Ensuring the Independence and Integrity of the Justice Sector 2021-2024; and the adoption of the law on Anti-Money Laundering sanctions. In addition, on 28 May 2020, Moldova joined the Istanbul Anti-Corruptuon Action Plan of the Anti-Corruption Netowork of the OECD. Nonetheless, as regards the recovery of the assets involved in the 2014 bank fraud, legal proceedings against key actors continue to be slow, and progress in recovering assets, in particular from outside of Moldova, has been limited. Moldova's reform efforts are further supported by the MFA conditionality. The COVID-19 MFA in place focuses in particular on actions related public finance management, good governance and the fight against corruption as well as improving the business climate. Under the MoU, the Moldovan authorities agreed, among others, to update the bank fraud criminal asset recovery strategy. improve the efficiency of the National Integrity Authority, and make amendments to the Moldovan Consitution regarding the selection of the lay members to the Superior Council of Magistracy (in line with recommendations from the Venice Commission). Status of economic reforms Republic of Moldova 1. Price liberalisation Most prices are market-driven, but regulated prices continue to exist for electricity, natural gas, water and sanitation, housing and medical services and rail and urban passenger transport. 2. Trade regime Moldova (a WTO member since 2001) has a liberal trade regime. The EU and the Republic of Moldova have developed a close trading relationship over the years. This led to the conclusion of an Association Agreement, including a DCFTA, which was signed on 27 June 2014 and entered fully into force on 1 July 2016. 3. Exchange rate regime The National Bank of Moldova follows a flexible exchange rate policy and intervenes on the market to smooth excessive volatility, while letting the exchange rate operate to help absorb external shocks. 4. Foreign direct investment There are no controls on inward investment. Some efforts have been made to stimulate FDI, notably through the creation of Free Economic Zones. The DCFTA has created further stimulus to FDI from the EU. Some positive examples of progress exist, primarily in the automotive sector. 5. Monetary policy As part of the medium-term monetary policy strategy adopted in December 2010, the central bank targets inflation of 5% annually (measured by the consumer price index), with a possible deviation of 1.5 percentage points. The Central Bank considers this optimal in its efforts to maintain price-stability, while supporting the growth performance over the medium term. 6. Public finances and taxation In 2018, a 12% flat rate income tax was introduced (the earlier system had two rates: 7% and 18%) and the social contribution rate was decreased from 23% to 18%. To compensate for these changes, a set of measures to strengthen revenue was introduced in 2019, including an increase in VAT rates. However, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic VAT levels for some key sectors, inclding the hotel industry and restuarants were lowered from 15% to 12%, with possible further reductions in the future. 7. Privatisation and enterprise restructuring In the past few years, Moldova has gradually sought to privatise state-owned assets and enterprises. In 2018, the national airline Air Moldova, the gas transmission company Vestmoldtransgaz, a tobacco producer and a number of other smaller properties were privatised. Additionally, the Law on State-Owned Enterprise and Municipal Enterprise adopted in late 2017 aims to strengthen governance and transparency of SOEs. However, limited progress was noted on the privatization agenda in 2020. 8. Financial sector The financial sector reform is one of the major successes of the last period. Major achievements include the liquidation of the three banks involved in the 2014 bank fraud (while investigation and asset recovery of the fraud has been less successful), strengthened governance and increased international ownership in remaining systemic banks, and an introduction of a strengthened regulatory and supervisory framework for banks (aligning with Basel III standards) and non-financial institutions, particularly in the insurance sector. 3.Ukraine 1.7.Macroeconomic performance The COVID19-related economic crisis hit Ukraine less severely than earlier expected. After a y-o-y plunge by 11.4% in the second quarter of 2020, the decline in real GDP moderated to 3.5% and 3% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. Overall, the economy shrank by 4.0% in 2020. The recession did not affect all sectors equally. Over 2020, the contraction was strongest in agriculture (-11.5%) and in industry (-4.5%). Retail and construction continued to expand by 8.4% and 5.6% respectively. The social impact of the economic recession, especially on the labour market, has been contained so far. The rate of unemployment increased from 8.2% in 2019 to 9.5% at the end of 2020. Annual nominal wage growth slowed down to almost zero in April 2020 before rebounding to 15.6% in December. In light of the 5% consumer prices inflation in 2020, this implies a rather sustained catching-up in real terms. The average wage reached about EUR 430 in December 2020. Even though part of that increase is due to exceptional year-end benefits, its contribution to better standards of living is also evident. The COVID19-related crisis reversed the achievements in the area of fiscal consolidation. Ukraine had managed to bring its fiscal deficit below or around 2% of GDP consistently over the previous three years. Total government expenditure increased by 16.2% in 2020, which combined with an expansion of revenues by 6.5% only led to the significant deterioration of the deficit to 5.3% of GDP. Although expenditure increases affected all areas, they were strongest in public support to economic activity (+70%), healthcare (+37%) and defence (+13%). These developments challenge the medium-term sustainability of public finances. To finance the deficit, Ukraine received support from the international financial institutions of about USD 3.3 billion in 2020 (USD 2.1 billion from the IMF and EUR 1.1 billion from the EU). The government also borrowed record amounts from the international markets last year EUR 1.25 billion in January and USD 2.6 billion in July. In addition to these sources of financing, the Treasury issued the equivalent of 7.7 billion in domestic hryvna-denominated bonds (17% above the 2019 volumes) at an average yield of 10.2%, i.e. 673 basis points below the cost of new domestic debt in 2019. Although monetary policy has remained unchanged since the appointment of a new Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) in mid-2020, money supply started to expand and inflation is accelerating. The NBU responded by increasing its key policy rate by 50 basis points to 6% since mid-June 2020. Consumer price inflation decelerated to below 3% from February to October, before increasing steeply to 5% in December 2020 and 8.5% in March 2021, thereby missing again the mid-term y-o-y inflation target of 5%. Base money and the broader aggregate M3 increased by a staggering 24.8% and 28.6%, respectively, much above the 2019 figures. Simultaneously, the hryvna, which had appreciated by 14.7% against the USA dollar in 2019, depreciated by almost 19% in 2020. The depreciation took place in the context of a rather non-interventionist policy by the central bank, which bought only $1 billion in 2020, as opposed to $7.9 billion the year before. Going forward, these monetary developments pose risks to price stability. The crisis-driven contraction of economic activity resulted in imports declining significantly stronger than exports. As a result, the current account has moved from a deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 2019 to a sizable surplus in 2020 (4.3% of GDP). Fresh incoming foreign direct investment, i.e. excluding reinvested earnings, notoriously low already prior to the crisis, further declined to around 0.5% of GDP in 2020. Confidence in the domestic currency remained broadly stable, as evidenced by the record year-end level of the official international reserves (above USD 28 billion, representing more than five months of imports). Going forward, three main risks might challenge the government's forecast of economic growth in excess of 4% in 2021. First, difficulties to rein in government spending, over-inflated beyond the increase in revenues in 2020, might distort economic growth. Second, monetary funding of the government deficit, coupled with a revival of credit expansion to the private sector, could lead to mounting inflationary pressures, thereby suggesting that economic growth might be nominal only, without a real positive effect on standards of living. Third, long-term growth depends crucially on stable flows of domestic and foreign investment that depend crucially on much needed structural reforms to fight corruption and to improve the judiciary and the business climate which the government, though committed, struggles to implement.

The fourth MFA operation (MFA IV) of EUR 1 billion in loans was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in July 2018, and was successfully completed in May 2020. The MoU and the Loan Agreement were signed in September 2018, and ratified by Ukraine in November 2018. The first disbursement under MFA IV (EUR 500 million) was made in December 2018 after Ukraine fulfilled the policy conditions, which covered the areas of fight against corruption, public finance management, governance of state-owned companies and privatisation of small companies. Notably, as part of the implementation effort of MFA IV first tranche conditions, Ukraine made significant progress in the areas of anti-corruption policy that had blocked the planned third disbursement under MFA III. The second instalment (EUR 500 million) was disbursed in May 2020, after the single outstanding prior action (on strengthening financial sector safeguards from the December 2019 staff-level agreement reached between the Ukrainian authorities and the IMF on a new EFF programme) had been implemented. In 2020, as part of the COVID19 MFA package adopted in May 2020, Ukraine became eligible for a fifth MFA programme of up to EUR 1.2 billion. The MoU was negotiated during the summer and entered into force on 14 September 2020, after ratification by the national parliament and signature by the President. The first instalment (EUR 600 million) was subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights) and the IMF programme remaining on track, and was disbursed on 9 December 2020. The disbursement of the second tranche, is also conditioned on the successful implementation of the eight structural policy measures to which Ukraine has committed in the MoU, covering the four areas of public finance management, fight against corruption, improvement of the business climate, and sectoral policies and governance of state-owned enterprises. These MFA programmes are provided in conjunction with the resources from the IMF. In October 2018, Ukraine and the IMF agreed at staff level on a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement of USD 3.9 billion. The SBA replaced Ukraine's previous Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme to provide an anchor for economic policies during 2019 (an election year). The IMF Board approved the Stand-by Arrangement in December 2018, with a first disbursement of USD 1.4 billion. To help Ukraine pursue its reform programme, especially given the COVID19-related challenges, the IMF Board approved a new 18-month USD 5 billion Stand-By Arrangement on 9 June 2020, out of which USD 2.1 billion were disbursed immediately. 1.9.Structural Reforms With the political transition in 2014, Ukraine embarked on an ambitious and wide-ranging reform programme. Despite the difficult external environment and significant internal challenges, Ukraine managed to push through reforms in a variety of sectors, notably as part of the policy programmes attached to the EU MFA, the IMF and the World Bank assistance. Following a slowdown in reform momentum in 2016-17, the year 2019 saw renewed reform activity. The need for the authorities to provide a quick response to the COVID19-related crisis, together with political dissensions in the first months of 2020, slowed down the implementation of reforms. In addition to headwinds resulting from relevant decisions by the Supreme Court and volatile political support in the Parliament, the government seems to have lost the reform momentum, which impacts negatively its compliance record with commitments to the IMF and the EU. In the field of public financial management, the track record is rather favourable. New laws adopted in 2018 improved the fiscal governance by introducing medium-term budgeting and by strengthening programme-based budgeting. The State Tax Service and Customs Service, created in 2018 and effectively reorganised in 2019 and early 2020, are now fully operational, even though the quarantine conditions have not allowed yet for an open and transparent selection of their senior management. To improve tax compliance, the authorities started the gradual deployment of electronic software tax registrars in 2020, to be fully adopted by all businesses by 2025. However, the initially successful example of transparent public procurement by the Health Ministry proved unsustainable during the response to the COVID-19 crisis and have, so far, failed to stimulate a positive impetus to other line ministries. As regards the fight against corruption, the 2020 achievements are rather meager. The Supreme Court declared the compulsory electronic asset declaration system for public officials in breach of data protection requirements and anti-constitutional. Its operation has therefore been suspended. The Court also declared anti-constitutional the presidential appointment of the head of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU). This created legal uncertainty with respect to NABU's operation. Moreover, no progress has been made with strengthening the judiciary and the effectiveness of fighting corruption, despite non-negligible progress with the attestation of prosecutors at regional and local level. On the way to dismantling the tax police, a modern bureau for economic and financial investigations was created in early 2021 and awaits operationalisation. In order to improve corporate governance of Ukrainian state-owned enterprises, independent supervisory boards have been established at least in the ten largest enterprises and further supervisory board members are being selected. Successful consultations with the OECD led to draft amendemnts, pending parliamentary approval, to the legal framework of corporate governance for state-owned enterprises. Also, the state ownership policies have been reviewed and updated for the ten largest state-owned companies. In the absence of successful large-scale privatisations, Ukraine has improved its legal framework for privatisation and has launched a successful electronic platform of sales of small companies and assets, ProZorro.Sale. In the energy sector, the authorities and the energy regulator progressed on implementation of the electricity market law. The electricity retail market was opened to large consumers from January 2019 and the wholesale electricity market was opened from July 2019, although a number of issues hamper the functioning of and competition in the market. Although the government removed the public sector obligation in the retail gas market for households in 2020, a price cap was introduced as of February 2021 for the duration of the heating season. Despite the removal of penalties and charges that were hampering the free choice of a gas provider, the market is far from being liberalised, with one single provider controlling more than 90% of the supply to final consumers. Finally, given the limited progress in 2020 with reform implementation, major challenges remain related to demonopolisation, impartial protection of property rights, cutting vested oligarchic interests and reducing the regulatory burden. Addressing these remaining challenges is crucial to improve the business climate and to attract and retain investors. The sustainability and inclusiveness of economic growth in Ukraine depend on the extent to which these remaining structural bottlenecks to investment are successfully removed. Status of economic reforms Ukraine 1.Price liberalisation Prices are largely market driven. Regulated prives for gas and electricity for households were abolished in 2020, although price caps on gas for households were temporarily re-introduced for the duration of the 2021 heating season. 2.Trade regime Ukraine joined the WTO in May 2008. The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement entered into force on 1 September 2017. The respective provisions as regards the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) have been in application since January 2016. 3.Exchange rate regime Since the decision to abandon the currency peg in February 2014 the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has been implementing a managed float regime within an inflation targetting framework. NBU interventions on the foreign exchange market aim at reducing exchange rate volatility and influence the country's stock of official reserves. 4.Foreign direct investment (FDI) Some restrictions on FDI-related flows exist, such as a ban on the purchase of agricultural land to foreigners, in spite of farmland sales reform started in 2020. Capital controls that affect foreign investment activity persist, despite steps towards their gradual elimination. The net inflow of FDI amounted to 3-4% of GDP in previous years but turned negative in 2020. 5.Monetary policy The central bank's primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability under an inflation targeting framework (5% +\/- 1 percentage point). The end-year 2020 consumer price inflation reached precisely 5% but subsequently increased to 8.5% in March 2021 under the influence of a significant increase in the supply of money. The cenytral bank increased its key policy rate by 50 basis points in March 2021. 6.Public finances and taxation Public revenues reached 32.8% of the Ukrainian GDP in 2020. Prior to the COVID19-related crisis, Ukraine had made significant progress in the consolidation of its public finances, and managed to bring its fiscal deficit persistently below 2% of GDP since 2017. However, due to the stabilisation policy response, the deficit reached 5.3% in 2020 and is expected to remain around 5% in the coming years due to the permanent nature of the pension and wage increases. Thus, fiscal consolidation remains a priority to alleviate risks to medium-term sustainability. 7.Privatisation and enterprise restructuring Despite ambitious privatisation plans, no major sales of state assets took place in 2020. A number of independent supervisory boards have been established in major enterprises, for which updated ownership policies have been adopted. The government prepares legal amendments to align SOE framework in line with the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of SOEs. 8.Financial sector The NBU has significantly improved its supervisory standards over the last years. The soundness of the banking sector has been strengthened, with an aggregate capital adequacy ratio above 20%. Banks' liquidity remains comfortable, despite significant purchases of domestic government bonds to finance the 2020 public deficit. The very high share of non-performing loans, above 45% on average, and the governance of state-owned banks remain two major challenges. 4.Jordan 1.1.Macroeconomic performance The COVID-19 pandemic is severely affecting an already struggling Jordanian economy. The strict containment measures imposed by the authorities in March 2020 helped to contain the health crisis, but the social and economic costs have been high. To support the economy, the authorities implemented a timely package of growth-friendly policy measures, including reducing temporarily the tax-burden on businesses and individuals and the Central Bank of Jordan's (CBJ) move to increase liquidity for commercial banks, ease debt burdens and support SMEs. A phased reopening of the society started in April 2020, but the second surge in COVID-19 cases since autumn 2020 led to more restrictive measures again. In 2020, real GDP contraction in 2020 was limited to 1.6%, after years of only subdued 2% growth. The fall in GDP is explained by a negative (yet divergent) performance in the majority of the sectors, particularly: Hotel and Restaurants (-8.2%), Transport, Storage & Communications (-5.2%), Construction (-3.8%) and Social & Personal Services (-3.3%). The economic downturn caused unemployment to spike to a record 24.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020, up from 19.3% in the first quarter. Unemployment remains highest amongst youth of 15-19 years (62.1%) and youth of 20-24 years (47.9%), women (32.8%) and university degree holders (27.8%). The monetary environment has been resilient, supported by a sizable and timely stimulus enacted by the CBJ early on in the crisis to support credit to the economy and support SMEs and individuals. The CBJ's gross foreign reserves (including gold and SDRs) have remained strong, amounting to USD 15.6 billion, covering around 11 months of the Kingdom's imports as at end-2020. Inflation dropped to historic lows, particularly during the lockdown period in Q2 2020. Indeed, the consumer price index increased by only 0.1% in 2020, down from 0.6% recorded in 2019. Fiscal slippages continue and were further amplified by the pandemic. The general budget deficit (including grants) deteriorated to 5.8% of GDP in the first ten months of 2020 (from 4.3% in the same period of 2019), as the lockdown and restrictions imposed to contain the virus translated into lower domestic revenues (-11.6%) and higher total expenditures (+2.7%). Jordan's gross public debt stood at 105.1% of GDP at the end of November 2020, up from 95.2% of GDP at the end of 2019. The National Electricity Company (NEPCO) and Water Authority (WAJ) remain highly indebted. Although the increase is a certain source of concern, the IMF assessed Jordan's public debt as being sustainable in December 2020. The current account deficit increased to 8% of GDP in 2020 (from 2.1% of GDP in 2019), and becomes more pronounced without grants. The trade deficit decreased by a significant 16.5% in 2020 when compared to 2019, as imports slummed (-11.3%). Exports decreased by 4.5% during 2020, as the increase in national exports was more than offset by the decline in re-exports. The important tourism sector was hit the hardest. The thriving sector (which accounted for 18% of GDP and employment in 2019), was closed to wiped out during the pandemic. Despite the supportive measures taken by the authorities (e.g. temporarily reduced consumption tax rates on tourism), international travel receipts decreased by 72.5% during the first three quarters of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. Furthermore, remittances decreased by 9.7% over the same period. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) remained low at 1.6% of GDP in 2020, well below the 12.7% average that prevailed over 2005-2010, before the onset of the Syrian crisis. Notwithstanding significant uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the pandemic, the economy is expected to gradually recover in 2021 (latest IMF forecast: +2%), except for tourism and remittances, for which recovery is expected to take longer.

Indeed, following the Kingdom's request for further MFA on 11 July 2019, the Commission adopted on 6 September 2019 a proposal for a new, follow-up MFA to Jordan in the amount of EUR 500 million in loans. The proposal was adopted by co-legislators on 15 January 2020. The assistance is to be implemented in three instalments over 2020 and 2021. Later in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the already struggling Jordanian economy, the authorities requested further MFA on 21 April 2020. In turn, as part of the COVID-19-MFA package adopted on 25 May 2020, the European Parliament and the Council agreed on a MFA programme of EUR 200 million to Jordan (reinforcing the resources made available under MFA-III). The new (combined) MFA comes on top of the EUR 380 million of MFA provided to Jordan since 2014, under Decisions (EU) 2013\/1351 and 2016\/2371. The MoU between the EU and Jordan, which oversees both MFA operations, was endorsed by the Member states committee on MFA on 27 July 2020. It then entered into force on 2 October 2020 upon signature, whilst the LFA entered into force on 7 October 2020. The first instalment (EUR 250 million in loans) was subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights) and the IMF programme remaining on track. It was disbursed on 25 November 2020. The second instalment (EUR 250 million in loans) and the third instalment (EUR 200 million in loans) are, in addition, subject to the specific policy conditionality agreed between Jordan and the EU in the MoU. The programme's policy conditionality focuses primarily on improving public finance management, fighting corruption, and on reforms in the utilities sector, social and labour market policy, and governance. The policy actions included in the MoU are in line with the reform commitments taken by Jordan in the context of the EU-Jordan Partnership Priorities and other EU support instruments, as well as the adjustment programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank. Taking Jordan's \"Five-Year Reform and Growth Matrix\" as a guideline for the design of the policy programme in the MoU ensures ownership of the reform process by the Jordanian authorities and avoids overburdening of (limited) administrative capacities. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on implementation timelines is reflected in the fact that the second tranche of the assistance is linked to a more limited set of conditions that are achievable in a short(er) time period under a still challenging context. These MFA programmes are provided in conjunction with the resources from the IMF under its four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme with Jordan approved on 25 March 2020 (EUR 1.2 billion, 270% of quota). On 20 May 2020 the IMF also made available around EUR 366 million in emergency assistance to Jordan under the Rapid Financing Instrument to help the country deal with the impact of the pandemic. The IMF Board completed the first review under the EFF in December 2020, releasing around USD 148 million immediately, and bringing total IMF disbursements to Jordan in 2020 to USD 689 million. A staff level agreement on the second review was reached in March 2021, with the IMF noting that the \"program remains firmly on track, with strong progress on key reforms\". Under this review, the authorities have requested an augmentation of Fund access of USD 200 million. The agreement is subject to the approval of the IMF's Board. 1.3.Structural reforms In 2020, the short-term policy priorities of the Kingdom were shifted to health and social protection, as the authorities sought to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. The government implemented a timely package of growth-friendly policy measures, including reducing temporarily the tax burden on businesses and individuals and the Central Bank's move to increase liquidity for commercial banks, ease debt burdens and support SMEs (see Section 1.2). At the same time, despite the sizeable challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Syrian crisis, the Jordanian authorities remain committed to their structural reform agenda and the conditionality in the MFA programme. The Kingdom's reform agenda is underpinned by a number of strategies, namely Vision 2025, the Jordan Economic Growth Plan, and the comprehensive Five-Year Reform Matrix (2018-2022). The Matrix prioritises deep structural reforms needed to stimulate inclusive and sustainable growth and job creation, and achieve fiscal stability. Despite a delayed start, Jordan is progressing well with the implementation of the Reform Matrix. By end-2020, the implementation rate stood at 47%. Delayed implementation is concentrated in four sectors, namely water, public transport, energy and agriculture. In 2020, the Jordanians launched the mid-term review of the Matrix, aiming to update it for the years 2021-2022 and prioritise new areas. The priorities moving forward are in the areas of trade facilitation, investments, export, water, agriculture, tourism and transportation. The Reform Matrix is being consulted with different stakeholders, and should be approved by government sometime during 2021. Despite the setbacks brought along by the pandemic, and the uneven success in implementing reforms, the Kingdom still achieved important milestones in 2020. These include (but are not limited to) the following steps taken by the Jordanian Government: i) submitted to parliament an amended draft organic budget law, to improve the fiscal framework, ii) submitted to parliament amendments to the Illicit Enrichment Law, to tackle corruption, iii) requested a comprehensive Fiscal Transparency Evaluation, to enhance fiscal transparency, and iv) approved amendments that enhance Anti-Money Laundering\/Combating the Financing of Terrorism. Furthermore, in the area of taxation, Jordan maintained efforts to strengthen tax administration (including tax compliance), successfully shifted the majority of tax services online, enhanced coordination and data sharing between tax and customs agencies, and established a \"gold list\" of tax compliant companies. On top, in September 2020, Jordan signed the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (to tackle cross-border tax evasion and avoidance), and is in the process of ratifying it. At the same time, progress in other crucial reform areas was less visible. These include delays in the submission to parliament of amendments to the Investment Law to address tax arbitrage and transfer pricing abuses, the adoption of a plan to reform electricity tariffs and the implementation of a digital track-and-trace monitoring system to reduce cigarette smuggling. Going forward, the tasks of the new government (ushered in October 2020) will be to address Jordan's pre-existing vulnerabilities, namely debt sustainability, energy tariff reform (where a complex web of cross-subsidisation distorts incentives); labour market reform (in particular to promote youth and female labour participation); and improve competition, governance and transparency. Status of economic reforms Jordan 1. Price liberalisation Prices are largely market-driven, but there are oligopolistic conditions in several sectors. Fuel subsidies were eliminated in November 2012. Electricity tariffs and prices for some basic foodstuffs are still subject to administrative controls. In 2017 the government adopted an automatic adjustment of electricity tariffs based on fuel prices and abolished subsidies on bread. 2. Trade regime Jordan has a relatively liberal trade regime. It joined the WTO in 2000 and ratified an Association Agreement with the EU in 2002. It is also one of the EU's partner countries that could potentially benefit from a DCFTA agreement. It is a member of both the Greater Arabic Free Trade Area (GAFTA) and the Agadir Agreement and has also concluded FTAs with the United States, Syria, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and Singapore. On 19 July 2016, the EU approved a 10-year relaxation of rules of origin for a wide range of industrial products produced in 18 selected special economic zones in Jordan, provided that each company uses a minimum share of Syrian refugee labour in the production. 3. Exchange rate regime Since October 1995, the dinar has been pegged to the US dollar. 4. Foreign direct investment Jordan is largely open to foreign investment. It signed the OECD's Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises in 2013. As part of the Five-Year Reform Matrix (2018-2022), Jordan made good progress in adopting progressive economic liberalisation policy that favours foreign investment (e.g.: opening of 22 service sectors to full foreign ownership in 2019 and implementation of the Jordan Customs National Single Window System). 5. Monetary policy The CBJ enjoys an independent and autonomous corporate identity, although its capital is owned entirely by the government. Its main monetary policy tools are fixing the interest on monetary policy instruments and open market operations. The CBJ has developed a credible track record of maintaining exchange rate stability, while also ensuring price stability and promoting growth. 6. Public finances and taxation The taxation system shows a number of structural weaknesses which limit tax revenue mobilisation, including: a number of differentiated corporate tax segments, widespread tax exemptions, a narrow general sales tax base and capacity constraints in tax administration. There is scope for revenue mobilisation policies including strengthening tax administration and digitising tax collection. 7. Privatisation and enterprise restructuring Privatisation started in 1986 in the aftermath of an economic crisis and has made significant progress since then. Nevertheless, direct state ownership in certain sectors such as mining and public utilities remains significant. 8. Financial sector The financial sector is relatively well developed and dominated by banks, which are generally profitable and well capitalised. Banks have already started implementing Basel III. However, the narrow and shallow institutional investor base restricts the development of domestic capital markets. The Central Bank implements a financial inclusion strategy to increase access to and the use and quality of financial services. 5.Tunisia 1.4.Macroeconomic performance Tunisia's economic performance severely deteriorated in 2020 following the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related lockdown measures imposed by the authorities to halt the spread of the pandemic. Several fiscal and monetary measures were adopted to mitigate the economic impact, including fiscal stimulus measures (representing around 2.3% of GDP, with another 2% in off-budget measures and guarantees) and the easing of monetary policy, in an attempt to bolster activity, protect businesses and employment while ensure additional financing for healthcare needs. The country faced the recession with limited policy buffers and the downturn has put severe pressure on employment and social stability. In 2020, GDP declined by 8.8% driven by sharp contractions in private consumption and investment, in addition to the drop in trade volumes. Almost all sectors contracted, notably those linked to external demand and global value chains such as tourism (hotel & catering -43.6% yoy), transport (-28%) or manufacturing (-9.3%) with only agriculture and fisheries making small positive contributions to growth. Tourism collapsed due to mobility restrictions, with revenues down by 64% y-o-y, in line with the over 80% decrease in overnight stays, underlining the country's vulnerability to the pandemic. The economic downturn also caused a sharp increase in the unemployment rate to 17.4% in December 2020, with women particularly affected (24.9%). Monetary policy eased further, as the central bank lowered its key interest rate by 125 basis points to 6.25% in two steps (March and October 2020), in an attempt to bolster activity. The banking sector remains stable but suffers from low liquidity and the central bank supported the sector, introducing additional refinancing instruments elligible collaterals. It also supported the private sector, requesting banks to defer loan repayments or suspend a number of payments and fees. In October 2020, the parliament allowed a direct monetary financing plan from the central bank to the government budget. Inflation remains high but on a downward trend, at 5.7% on yearly average and 4.9% year-on-year in December 2020. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, decelerated slightly but remained at persistently high levels (+4.3%) notwithstanding the slump in demand. The fiscal stance has deteriorated markedly in 2020, with the fiscal deficit widening to 10.4% of GDP (with the IMF estimating a higher 11.5%), as revenues collapsed (-5.3%) and social expenditure increased. Provisional data show that the impact of reduced activity was particularly negative on VAT collection (-7.6%) and corporate taxes (-18.6%). Public expenditure increased by 15.5%, due to the growth in current expenditure, notably in salaries (+14.5%) and debt service (+16.6%). Wage expenditure (around 17.4% of GDP) will remain critical to control the deficit ahead. This was partly compensated by the moderation in transfers, mostly falling fuel subsidies (-42%) given lower oil prices. Public debt has subsequently increased to 83.5% of GDP in 2020 (with the IMF posting 87.6%, up almost 16 pps from last year) and debt service costs increased significantly (+15.9%). The deficit has been increasingly covered though domestic borrowing (over four times that of 2019) and to a lesser extent by external financing. However, external debt still represents 66% of the total debt stock, but mainly from international partners at concessional rates. The IMF considers Tunisia's public debt as sustainable, given continued strong policy implementation, although sustainability risks increased substantially in 2020. The current account deficit narrowed but remained elevated at around 6.8% of GDP in 2020. Its main determinant was the narrowing of the trade deficit (-34.4%) following the slump in imports at a faster pace than that of exports (-18.7% and -11.7%, respectively). This reflects lower domestic demand and global energy prices, with a weaker external demand hitting exports. External imbalances persist and record remittances (+13%) only compensated partly the substantial drop in tourism revenues (-64% compared to 2019). There was a substantial drop in foreign direct investment inflows (-28.8% compared to 2019, to around 1.5% of GDP). At the end of the 2020, foreign reserves stood at USD 8.5 billion, equivalent to around 5.2 months of imports. The economy is expected to recover modestly in 2021 (latest IMF forecast: 3.8%), dependent on the evolution of the pandemic in the country and its major partners, with some rebound in domestic demand and most sectors hit by the crisis.

Moreover, as part of the MFA package adopted in the context of COVID-19, the European Parliament and the Council agreed on a new MFA programme of EUR 600 million to Tunisia. The MoU and the LFA were signed on 24 November 2020, ratified by the Tunisian Parliament on 15 April 2021 and entered into force on 11 May 2021, upon publication in the Tunisian Official Gazette. The programme's policy conditionality focuses primarily on four thematic areas: (i) public finance management and civil sector reform; (ii) reforms in state-owned enterprises; (iii) social protection; (iv) and investment climate. The MFA is to be provided in two tranches of EUR 300 million each. The first instalment, subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights) was disbursed on 1 June 2021. The second instalment is expected to be disbursed in the second half of 2021, once the policy conditions are met. The assistance is meant to complement resources made available by other donors including the IMF, under its Rapid Financing Facility programme with Tunisia of USD745 million (around 685 million) approved on 10 April 2020. 1.6.Structural Reforms Reform implementation had very limited progress in 2020, mostly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the country's challenging political situation following the 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections that resulted in a fragmented political landscape. The protracted formation of a new government, that only took office at the end of February 2020, was followed by continued instability and additional government changes in September 2020 and January 2021, which de facto halted the long-term reform agenda. In 2020, the short-term policy priorities of the country focused on pandemic response. The government approved some fiscal stimulus measures to try to mitigate the negative impact of the crisis, in an exceptional effort to protect businesses and employment, while ensuring additional financing for healthcare needs. The Central Bank eased monetary policy and liquidity management, while the parliament approved a direct monetary financing plan from the Central Bank to the government budget. It also announced a package to support the private sector, requesting banks to defer payments on existing loans and suspend any fees for electronic payments and withdrawals. Over the reform agenda, the authorities have also continued work to set up a national digital registry of needy families, a key component to establish a better-targeted cash transfer system and reforming subsidies. At the end of 2020, the government also introduced a number of fiscal measures in the 2021 Finance Law, including the amendment of the transfer pricing rules and the establishment of a single standard corporate tax rate of 15%. The crisis has exacerbated Tunisia's reform paralysis, in a context of rising structural challenges and deep imbalances between regions and sectors. A strong and credible reform plan is needed to foster growth and restore a sustainable fiscal and external financial situation, without which the IMF now assesses that public debt would become unsustainable. Debt sustainability risks are compounded by real exchange rate and financing risks, as well as SOE contingent liabilities and guarantees, so an ambitious medium-term reform programme is absolutely essential to support recovery and inclusive growth, foster subdued investment and guarantee fiscal and external sustainability. A perceived excess of bureaucracy also acts as a discouraging factor to private investment and limited measures have been also taken to combat informality. Other remaining challenges include addressing vested interests, improving governance and the business environment, as well as increasing competition across the economy in order to attract private investors, including in emerging sectors such as digitalization and renewable energies. The country will likely remain in a vulnerable position over the coming years, due to vast structural weaknesses, high financing needs, reliance on external funding, and risk of domestic and external shocks. Reforms should aim to restore sustainable macroeconomic positions and address relevant items for public expenditure such as the exceptionally high civil service wage bill, the targeting of energy subsidies and SOE liabilities that appear to crowd out much-needed social expenditure and growth-enhancing public investment. Such reforms should also aim to foster inclusive growth through private sector initiative and competition, in a context where the country will probably still need substantial support from external partners in the coming years. Status of economic reforms Tunisia 1. Price liberalisation Most prices are market-driven, but regulated prices exist for fuel, electricity, transport and food products. The government started reducing its energy subsidies in 2017 and some minor changes took place in 2018 and 2019. Additional reforms are expected, while preserving social tariffs for poor households and improving social safety nets, where better targeting is also needed. 2. Trade regime Tunisia joined the WTO in 1995 and was the first Mediterranean country to sign an Association Agreement with the EU in 1995. The negotiations for an EU-Tunisia DCFTA started in 2016 but have been shown little progress since 2019. Technical contacts took place in 2020 on the possible accession to the revised rules of the Pan-Euro-Med convention on rules of origin. Tunisia ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area Free on 30 November 2020. 3. Exchange rate regime The Central Bank of Tunisia changed its operational framework for exchange rate policy in 2012 to make rates more flexible, providing multiple-price foreign exchange auctions since August 2018 and net foreign exchange purchases since May 2019. Despite officially floating, the IMF classifies the de facto exchange rate arrangement as crawl-like. 4. Foreign direct investment The implementation of the 2016 investment law continued in 2018\/19, namely through the operationalisation of the Investment Authority, reforms for the off-shore regime and legislation to improve the business climate and investment attractiveness, although the process was interrupted by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tunisia was officially removed from the list of \"gray\" jurisdictions of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in October 2019. 5. Monetary policy The Central Bank of Tunisia is independent and its mandate is to ensure price stability. However, the parliament approved a derogation of the article 25 of the CBT statutes in 2020, allowing for the first time a direct monetary financing plan to the government budget, interest-free facility for a maturity up to 5 years, of which one year's grace. 6. Public finances and taxation Public expenditure is mostly devoted to salaries and subsidies, crowding out investment and other budget priorities. Efforts will be needed to restrain the wage bill, untargeted subsidies and SOEs liabilities, while expanding and better targeting social expenditure. The 2021 Budget introduced some fiscal measures, including the amendment of the transfer pricing rules and a single standard corporate tax rate but further reforms are needed to widen the base, improve collection, reduce evasion and rebalance the tax burden. The system could also benefit from enhanced international information exchanges and elimination of distortions with the off-shore sector. 7. Privatisation and enterprise restructuring The privatisation and restructuring of public banks and SOEs has long been under discussion but little progress has been made, faced with strong opposition from vested interests. Despite some progress with transparency, significant governance and financial challenges remain. There are over 100 SOEs (including seven of the ten largest firms in the country) covering most sectors and often with a monopoly position. The sector remains burdened with debt (around 40% of GDP in 2019 for the 30 major ones), government guarantees, and arrears, which were exacerbated by the pandemic. 8. Financial sector The financial sector has been supported by accommodating policies from the CBT and relief in prudential provisions, but the full impact of the pandemic is yet to be observed. The sector entered the crisis with some underlying vulnerabilities, including high non-performing loans, substantial exposure to credit risk to affected sectors and SOEs, relatively shallow capital buffers and tight liquidity. Strengthening its resilience and broaden access to finance remain key challenges. 6.Albania 1.7.Macroeconomic performance Albania was hit by two major shocks in quick succession: after a strong earthquake in November 2019, the first COVID-19 infections were discovered in early March 2020. In 2020, Albania managed the COVID-19 pandemic with a short strict lockdown and a rapid expansion of its very limited hospital capacity. However, due to rising infections since February 2021, the Government tightened restrictions again. The vaccination campaign is ongoing since January 2021. The Albanian government and the Bank of Albania took swift actions to support business and households, which prevented an increase in unemployment and kept the external position and the financial sector relatively stable. The government disbursed direct assistance of 1% of GDP, in addition to providing sovereign guarantees of about 1.65% of GDP to affected businesses, while the Bank of Albania lowered its policy rate, provided liquidity and faciliated loan payment deferrals and loan restructurings. In 2020, Albania's GDP contracted by 3.3%, as the pandemic-related domestic and international restrictions caused large losses in tourism and manufacturing. The good performance of the large agricultural and construction sectors buffered the downturn of the economy, which began showing signs of a moderate recovery in the last quarter of 2020. Unemployment (15-65) increased slightly from 12% at the end of 2019 to 12.3% by the end of 2020 and labour market participation decreased to 68.3%, with women having been more affected than men on both accounts. In addition to lowering the policy rate to 0.5% in March 2020, the Bank of Albania (BoA) provided liquidity to the banking system to keep up lending to the private sector, enhanced its operational capacities to guarantee a sufficient cash supply to the economy, suspended banks' dividend payments until end-2021 and facilitated electronic payments. Between March and August 2020, the BoA temporarily facilitated the deferral of loan instalments to help borrowers hit by the crisis and allowed banks to restructure loans without additional provisioning, but accompanied by increased reporting requirements. The still high non-performing loans ratio continued to decrease, to 8.1% by the end of 2020, even after the moratorium of loan repayments ended, a sign for the sector's stability and the prudent loan restructuring. Inflation rose slightly from 1.4% in 2019 to an average of 1.6% in 2020. The government revised the 2020 budget four times to accommodate the revenue losses from a 8.5% drop in tax revenue and a 9.1% expenditure increase for the support packages, additional funding for the health sector and post-earthquake reconstruction. Compared with 2019, the revenue ratio decreased from 27.4% to 26.5% of GDP, while the expenditure ratio climbed from 29.3% in 2019 to 33.4% of GDP. Overall the fiscal deficit increased sharply from 1.9% of GDP in 2019 to 6.9% of GDP in 2020 and the public debt ratio climbed by about 10 pps to 76.1% of GDP, including the actual provision of the sovereign guarantees of the government (about EUR 110 million or 1.65% of GDP foreseen) for loans to enterprises affected by the pandemic. The current account deficit widened by about 1 pp. to 8.9% of GDP at the end of 2020, due to the strong contraction of typical inflows from tourism, exports of goods as well as a significant decline in remittances, all reflecting the pandemic impact. However, as imports dropped for the same reasons as exports, the trade balance improved slightly (the trade deficit decreased 16% y-o-y). Capital inflows from a Eurobond issue and concessional loans have helped to finance the external shortfall even as FDI inflows dropped. Overall, the exchange rate depreciated only 1.6%. Gross external debt is estimated at 65.8% of GDP at end-2020, up from 60.4% one year earlier, but Albania's vulnerability from an increasing external debt ratio is mitigated by solid forex reserves and dominance of concessional debt. In 2021, a recovery of private consumption, investment and exports from a low base, coupled with an exceptionally high level of public investment in post-earthquake reconstruction, are expected to boost real GDP growth to some 5.5%. The government plans for a limited reduction of the fiscal deficit and public debt to support the economic recovery and address the elevated needs for health care, vaccination and social assistance.

In response, as part of the COVID19-MFA package adopted May 2020, the European Parliament and the Council agreed on an MFA programme to Albania of EUR 180 million. The Member States Committee on MFA delivered a positive opinion on 24 June 2020 on the MoU. However, the Albanian legislation requires a lengthy authorisation and ratification process of these kind of loan agreements, which delayed the signature of MoU and the LFA to 3 November 2020. While the MoU entered into force upon signature on 3 November, the LFA had to be ratified by the Albanian parliament and entered into force on 26 January 2021. The programme's policy conditions aim to address some of the weaknesses in public finance management, the financial sector, good governance and fight against corruption and social protection policies. The MFA is to be provided in two tranches of EUR 90 million each. The first instalment was subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights), and was disbursed in March 2021. The second instalment is expected to be disbursed in the second half of 2021, once the policy conditions are met. The assistance is meant to complement resources made available by other donors including the IMF, under its Rapid Financing Facility programme RFI with Albania of EUR 174 million, approved on 10 April 2020. The IMF deemed important that Albania maintains an adequate reserve coverage, given its vulnerability to external shocks and endorsed the government's policy measures and the related increase of the fiscal deficit and public debt as adequate in view of the reduced revenues and additional spending needs on reconstruction of earthquake damages and to limit the impact of COVID-19. 1.9.Structural reforms In March 2020, the European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Albania, but before formally launching negotiations with the first intergovernmental conference, Albania ought to implement a number of specific conditions, including the adoption of electoral reform, continued implementation of judicial reform, and strengthening the fight against corruption and organised crime. These key priorities for Albania have been integrated into the draft negotiating framework, which the European Commission presented to Member States on 1 July 2020. The EU-Albania Stabilisation and Association Council of 1 March 2021 noted that Albania fulfilled the specific conditions and is ready to hold the first intergovernmental conference. The Albanian authorities continued their efforts to address structural obstacles highlighted in the European Commission's 2020 Albania Report and the 19 May 2020 Joint Conclusions of the Economic and Financial Dialogue between the EU and the Western Balkans and Turkey. The delivery of public services and the administrative burden on business continued to improve with the expansion of e-services, VAT refunds were disbursed fully and in time to SMEs and the overall stock of arrears did not increase. Preparation continued for introducing the \"fiscalization\" in 2021, obliging business to use electronic invoicing and registration of sales, which will directly help the Tax Administration to obtain real-time and accurate data and lower informal transactions. The reform of the Public Finance Management (PFM) system (since 2014) continued with the implementation of the updated PFM reform strategy for 2020-2022, albeit taking into account the negative impact of the earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic without changing the objectives. As the previous Business and Investment Development Strategy (BIDS) has expired in 2020, the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) is designing a new BIDS and Action Plan for the period 2021-2027, for the development of SMEs and investment. End of 2020, the Albanian government began to consult on the draft start-up law and develop the concept of a new \"Online Ecosystem Portal\" to facilitate access to financing for start-ups and innovations. However, the adoption of the draft Unified Law on Investment, which will align Albanian legislation with international standards, is postponed to 2022 and despite recent institutional changes in the state cadastre, only limited progress has been made in clearing ownership conflicts over land titles. Efforts should be stepped up to combat informality and level the playing field for private companies by improving public investment management, simplifying tax system and procedures and strengthening the capacity of the public administration. Further reforms are also needed to enhance legal enforcement of contracts by resolving issues with property rights and the bailiff system. Status of economic reforms Albania 1. Price liberalisation The vast majority of prices are not subject to regulation and Albania reports very low levels of state aid, but the state aid commission needs more independence. Electricity prices are regulated by the energy regulator, and in May 2020, the country amended the Power Sector Law with a view to improving compliance with the EU energy legislation and allowing for effective unbundling of the distribution system operator. 2. Trade regime Albania joined the WTO in 2000. In 2006, Albania signed the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. The agreement, which was ratified in 2009, liberalized trade relations between the EU and Albania in terms of tariff barriers for agricultural and industrial goods. Since 2007 the country is a member of the multilateral Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). 3. Exchange rate regime The Bank of Albania commits to a free-floating exchange rate regime, where supply and demand movements in the foreign exchange markets determine the value of the domestic currency against other currencies. The Bank intervenes regularly in the markets with the purpose of maintaining adequate levels of foreign reserves on a pre-set schedule of auctions. 4. Foreign direct investment Overall, foreign and domestic investors are treated equally in Albania, with the exception of the acquisition of real estate, which the government has committed to address, but the necessaray legislative adjustment is still pending. A new \"unified investment law\" has been drafted, which will improve the protection of foreign and domestic investors in line with Albania's international investment agreements and ensures that investors' rights can be enforced through courts and international arbitration. The government postponed the adoption of the law from 2020 to 2021. 5. Monetary policy The primary objective of the central bank, as set out in the Law on the Bank of Albania (BoA), is to achieve and maintain price stability. BoA is financially independent and has sufficient instruments, competence and administrative capacity to function effectively and to conduct an efficient monetary policy. The monetary policy is conducted with a standard set of instruments: i) open market operations; ii) standing facilities; iii) required minimum reserves and within a free-floating exchange rate regime. 6. Public finances and taxation Albania follows an orderly budget preparation cycle, publishes timely relevant data and its public finance management has all main components in place. Since 2014, the PFM reform strategy, which has been extended to 2022, addresses weaknesses and progress was achieved with regard to transparency, arrears, tax administration and monitoring of fiscal risks. However, it still needs additional capacity and to continue addressing persisting weaknesses (eg: low revenue mobilisation and intransparent public investment management). 7. Privatisation and enterprise restructuring Overall state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are not dominant in the Albanian economy and concentrated in the energy sector but lack transparency and effective oversight, and rely on state funding. Monitoring of the sector improved with the growing capacity of the Ministry of Finance and Economy's fiscal risk unit but still needs to expand to cover the large number of Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs) and SOE's in the energy and water sector. 8. Financial sector Albania's banking sector is well capitalized, liquid and profitable. Banks' relatively large exposure to government securities (averaging 25% of their assets) and the high use of Euro in the economy (half of all bank loans and deposits are denominated in euro), continue to pose risks to the banking sector and complicate the transmission of monetary policy. 7.Bosnia & Herzegovina 1.1.Macroeconomic performance When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Bosnia and Herzegovina in early March 2020, its economy was already in a phase of a slowdown, with GDP growth having decelerated from 3.3% in 2018 to 2.8% in 2019. This was largely the result of a deteriorating external environment and a sustained domestic political stalemate, delaying overdue structural reforms and investment. During 2020 and in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the authorities adopted supplementary budgets, envisaging additional spending of up to 2% of GDP, providing additional health spending but also tax relief and income support to households and enterprises. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, economic output dropped by 4.5% y-o-y in 2020. The main factors behind the economic contraction were declining tourism revenues, lower private consumption and investment due to lockdown measures and decreasing remittances, and weaker external demand. The unemployment rate had been on a downward trend since 2014, dropping from 27.5% to 15.7% in 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment rose again, but so far only slightly, reaching 16.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Unemployment remains an important challenge, in particular for young people (around 23% unemployment in the age group of 15-24 years). There is also a substantial brain drain, with a high share of the qualified and mobile labour force leaving for job opportunities abroad, which has a negative impact on the country's growth potential in the medium-term. Annual consumer price inflation turned negative during 2020, largely due to low domestic price pressures as well as decreasing prices of energy imports. Average inflation decreased from 1.4% in 2018 to 0.6% in 2019 and to -1.1% in 2020. International institutions expect only a moderate GDP recovery in the post-crisis years, of some 3.5% and 3.25% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The country's monetary regime is defined since 1997 by the country's exchange rate peg to the euro as the anchor currency. This approach has served the economy well so far. However, it also implies that the burden of adjustment to external shocks has to be accommodated by other policy areas, in particular fiscal policy, necessitating the build-up of sufficient fiscal buffers and a stronger emphasis on medium-term stability, and structural reforms to improve the functioning of markets. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the banking agencies adopted a loan repayment moratorium for restructuring credit arrangements for individuals and legal entities that were severely affected by the pandemic. This moratorium expired on December 31, 2020. Banking Agencies also asked banks to closely monitor portfolios' exposures and to consider additional customer relief. Furthermore, a temporary suspension of dividends or bonuses was applied to all banks, although the restriction on bonuses was relaxed at end-2020. The country's nominal effective exchange rate appreciated markedly during the last 5 years, mainly due to exchange rate movements of the euro vis-a-vis the US dollar, the Turkish lira and the Russian rouble. However, in real terms, the effective exchange rate remained more stable, benefitting from the country's low inflation rate. Like in the case of other Western Balkan countries, the degree of euroisation is rather high (39% of deposits and 51% of private sector loans were denominated in euro as of January 2021). Public finances benefitted in recent years from strong revenue growth, but also repeated delays in implementing investment spending due to political stalemates. This resulted in fiscal surpluses, reaching some 2% of GDP in 2018 and 2019. The spending structure still is dominated by the public sector's wage bill and transfer payments, while the level of public investment remained very low, reflecting among others administrative weaknesses in implementing planned investment projects. There is a significant degree of non-alignment with EU public sector accounting standards, which strongly impedes the assessment of the country's actual fiscal position. As a result, both the deficit and debt ratio could be significantly higher than reported. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, the deficit is estimated to have increased markedly, reaching 4%-5% of GDP in 2020. In 2021, the deficit could come back to about 2% of GDP. According to the IMF, the country's public debt can be considered to be sustainable, although there are downside risks, such as contingent liabilities, in particular in the area of public enterprises. Bosnia and Herzegovina's balance-of-payments position remained largely unchanged in 2020, as lower exports, in particular of tourism services, and a sharp drop in workers' remittances, which in recent years amounted to some 10% of GDP, were more than compensated by lower imports. Nevertheless, remittances provided substantial support to household incomes, in particular in the lower income groups. As a result, the trade deficit of goods and services remained at some 15% of GDP. Net foreign direct investment remained low at some 2% of GDP in 2020, largely consisting of reinvested earnings.

The MoU and the LFA were signed on 15 January 2021, and will enter into force once the ratification process in the country is complete and upon publication in the Official Gazette. The MFA will be provided in two instalments. The first instalment (EUR 125 million) is subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights) and could be released after the MoU enters into force. The second tranche (EUR 125 million) will be released not earlier than three months after the release of the first tranche and is subject to the fulfilment of a set of policy conditions agreed in the MoU. The policy measures fall into the following four thematic areas: economic governance and institution building, financial sector stability, transparency and fight against corruption and a better functioning of the labour market. The assistance is meant to complement resources made available by other donors including the IMF, under its Rapid Financing Facility programme of EUR 330 million approved on 9 April 2020. 1.3.Structural reforms The country submitted an EU membership application in February 2016. In May 2019 the European Commission issued the Opinion on the application, which was subsequently endorsed by the Council in December 2019. The Opinion identifies 14 key priorities for the country to fulfil in order to be recommended for the status of EU candidate country. These priorities lie in the areas of democracy and functionality of institutions, rule of law, fundamental rights and public administration reform. The authorities continued their efforts to address structural obstacles highlighted in the European Commission's Bosnia and Herzegovina 2020 Report and the 19 May 2020 Joint Conclusions of the Economic and Financial Dialogue between the EU and the Western Balkans and Turkey. Notwithstanding some progress on improving the financing of the pension system, the overall quality of public finances remained very low, with substantial spending inefficiencies, particularly in the health sector, and a poor targeting of social transfers. The level of public investment remained very low, largely due to administrative weaknesses, such as inadequate project appraisal, weak project management and lack of transparency during execution. Some progress has been made in preparing the restructuring of the railway company in the Republika Srpska entity, which could reduce the fiscal burden of this company to the country's taxpayers. Efforts continued to facilitate business registration while some steps have been taken to strengthen the support for foreign investors. Improvements in the area of rule of law and the functioning of the judiciary have remained very limited. Despite the improved degree of registration in the labour market by increasing labour market controls, the informal economy remains large, at some 25-35% of GDP. Although official data on recorded state aid points to a relatively low and declining level of support of some 0.9% of GDP in 2019, a number of public and private companies benefit indirectly from the accumulation of payment arrears of taxes and, in particular social security contributions. Draft legislation on the Personal Income Tax as well as on social security contributions with a view to reduce the tax wedge has been prepared, but has not been adopted yet. The country participated for the first time in the 2018 PISA study and the results indicate that the students' performance ranks not only well below the OECD average, but is also low when compared with some countries in the Western Balkan region. Political uncertainties negatively affected transport and energy infrastructure investment while necessary steps for modernising the regulation of the energy and transport markets were further delayed. As a result, the markets for electricity and gas remain fragmented and dominated by key incumbent companies. The privatisation and\/or restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) would reduce the fiscal burden and have positive effects on other businesses and competition. A further movement to overcome the country's internal institutional and economic fragmentation by strengthening a common internal market within Bosnia and Herzegovina would help improve the quality of the business environment. Also, simplifying business registration, licensing and permitting, introducing e-signatures and improving bankruptcy laws would support the post-COVID-19 economic recovery. Status of economic reforms Bosnia & Herzegovina 1. Price liberalisation There is a wide range of administrated prices in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the authorities introduced temporary price freezes and \"fair\" profit margins for certain commodities, such as food and hygenic articles, but also oil products. There is no information available on the weight of administrated prices in the country's consumer basket. 2. Trade regime In December 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), which became operational in November 2007. In June 2008, the country signed the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union which officially entered into force on June 1, 2015. 3. Exchange rate regime Bosnia and Herzegovina runs a currency board arrangement, with the convertible mark pegged to the euro at an exchange rate fixed by the Law on the Central Bank. 4. Foreign direct investment About two thirds of the country's stock in FDI is originating from EU countries. A countrywide strategic framework to encourage foreign direct investments is not yet in place. The Republika Srpska entity adopted procedures for granting direct investments incentives and transferred the responsibility for foreign direct investments to the Ministry of Economy and Entrepreneurship in order to better connect foreign investors with domestic firms. 5. Monetary policy The Central Bank's objective is to keep the domestic currency stable which is in contrast with the primary objective of monetary policy in the EU, price stability. This approach has served the economy well so far. However, it also implies that the burden of adjustment to external shocks has to be accommodated by other policy areas, in particular a responsible fiscal policy, necessitating the build-up of sufficient fiscal buffers and a stronger emphasis on medium-term stability, and structural reforms to improve the functioning of markets. 6. Public finances and taxation Due to the weaknesses of country-wide fiscal data, the country's overall fiscal position is difficult to assess. The reporting of public sector data in line with the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) remains very limited and the alignment of the underlying statistical framework with ESA 2010 requirements and definitions is still very low. Fiscal rules remain at the level of one of country's two entities and there is still no independent fiscal institution to monitor and coordinate fiscal policy of the various stakeholders. The medium-term budgetary framework remains insufficiently developed and underused as a policy-guiding instrument. In the taxation area, some progress was made with the signing of the OECD\/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC). The Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina ratified the MAC in June 2020. 7. Privatisation and enterprise restructuring The privatisation process is still not complete and restructuring efforts have made little progress. Attempts to sell earmarked public companies have been largely unsuccessful. The due diligence procedures for two local telecommunication companies have been completed. Strategic sectors such as transport and energy are still dominated by poorly managed and often inefficient state-owned companies. 8. Financial sector The financial sector has remained largely stable despite some negative effects from COVID-19, but a high degree of complexity and fragmentation in the institutional and regulatory set-up is hampering banking supervision. The sector consists of a few large, mainly foreign owned banks, accounting for some two thirds of the sector, a limited number of smaller, local banks and two state-owned development banks. The number of banks (23) is high in relation to the market size. 8.Kosovo 6 * 7 8 8.1Macroeconomic performance The COVID-19 pandemic took a heavy toll on Kosovo's macroeconomic performance in 2020. Sluggish growth at the beginning of the year evolved into a recession due to the pandemic-related lockdown and travel restrictions. Based on quarterly data for 2020, the provisional estimate of annual GDP contraction is 3.9%. The main drivers of the contraction were severely falling service exports and investment. The IMF estimates an annual contraction of 6% in 2020. The recession was somewhat mitigated by rising government spending and faltering imports. In response to the crisis, the government adopted an emergency package in spring, which was later enlarged to the Economic Recovery Programme, amounting in total to 5.2% of the 2020 GDP. The main measures were increased allocations for the health system, higher wages for medical and emergency workers, higher social transfers and subsidies for vulnerable households, support for formal and informal employment and support to firms in the form of salary subsidies and easier access to borrowing. The labour market situation, which had been a concern already before the outbreak of COVID-19, deteriorated in the second quarter, but rebounded somewhat in summer with the unemployment rate standing at a similar level (24.6%) compared to the same period of 2019. Employment and labour force participation rates declined slightly to 30% and 40%, respectively. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, the mostly foreign-owned banking sector remained stable in 2020. In response to the crisis, the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK) allowed for a 3-month loan repayment moratorium in spring and loan restructurings of up to one year in June-September. These measures helped contain the need for banks' loan-loss provisions and supported credit growth, which has decelerated, but remained at 7.1% y-o-y in December as compared to an average of 10.8% over the previous two years. The growth of deposits declined to 8.6% y-o-y in September, but rebounded to 11.5% in December, which is in line with the average of 10.9% over the previous two years. Financial soundness indicators in the banking sector remained satisfactory. For the banking system as a whole, the ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities stood at 36.1% in October and the capital adequacy ratio was at 16.9%, both standing well above the regulatory minima of 25% and 12%, respectively. Despite lower bank profitability, with the average return-on-equity ratio declining to 14% in 2020 from 18.9% in 2019, the risks in the banking sector seem contained. In line with contracting economic activity, average annual inflation declined to 0.2% in 2020 with negative monthly readings since July. A positive contribution to inflation came from food prices while negative contributions came from energy prices and the elimination of import tariffs on goods from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in April 2020. Falling tax revenues and rising public spending led to a deteriorating fiscal outcome in Kosovo. The headline deficit widened to 7% of GDP in 2020 from 2.9% in the previous year. Tax revenue contracted by 9.3% while the public spending rose by 6.5% as compared to the outcome of 2019. The large deficit resulted in a steep increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, which is estimated to have reached 21.8% in 2020 from 17.5% in the previous year. The IMF assesses public debt as sustainable but points to relatively large financing needs and vulnerabilities arising from the absence of external market access. The current account deficit is estimated to have widened to 7.1% of GDP in 2020 from 5.6% in 2019. The main driver was a severe decline in service exports, which considerably outweighed an increase in exports of goods and led to overall exports contracting to 25.4% of GDP from 29.3% in 2019. Due to travelling restrictions, workers' remittances, which were sent via official channels, increased by 15.4% and stood at 13.9% of GDP in 2020, partly offsetting the trade deficit. On the financing side, net inflows of FDI increased to 5% of GDP due to lower profit repatriation in the financial sector. In contrast, gross FDI declined by 10% in 2020. Official reserves were covering 3.2 months of imports at the end of 2020. While the outlook is surrounded by high uncertainties related to the evolution of the pandemic, the IMF projects economic growth to recover to 4.5% in 2021, which is in line with the average growth rate observed over the past five years.

The MoU and the LFA entered into force on 8 September 2020. The programme's policy conditionality focuses primarily on strengthening public finance, enhancing financial stability, tackling informality, advancing the rule of law, and improving employment prospects for the youth. The MFA is to be provided in two tranches of EUR 50 million each. The first instalment was subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights) and was disbursed on 6 October 2020. The second instalment was disbursed on 1 June 2021, after Kosovo fulfilled the attached policy conditions. The assistance is meant to complement IMF funds (EUR 52 million) under the Rapid Financing Facility (RFI) (50% of Kosovo quota in the Fund), approved on 10 April 2020. The IMF acknowledges the urgency of external and fiscal financing gaps and points to Kosovo's commitment to macroeconomic stability. COVID-19 mitigation measures, including a temporary suspension of the fiscal rule, are deemed as appropriate, given Kosovo's commitment to reinstate the fiscal rule once the pandemic recedes. 1.6.Structural reforms Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the country's authorities continued their efforts to tackle structural obstacles highlighted in the European Commission's 2020 Kosovo Report and the 19 May 2020 Joint Conclusions of the Economic and Financial Dialogue between the EU and the Western Balkans and Turkey. With respect to the business environment, progress has been made in streamlining business registration as the implementation of the unique identifier number (UIN) for enterprises started in February 2020. A general inspection reform is ongoing with the aim of reducing the number of (overlapping) inspections from 36 to 15. The central register for permits and licences is still being updated. The adoption of the Law on voluntary mediation (2019) contributed to the progress of contract enforcement while some progress was achieved in bringing the procedures for notification of State aid closer to the EU acquis and in staffing the state aid department. The quality of education remains a concern, as it does not provide students with the skills currently required by the labour market, which translates into very long school-to-work transitions and intermittent or permanent periods of informal employment. Kosovo made some progress in improving road infrastructure, but there are large gaps in railway and energy infrastructure. In April 2020, the approval of the connection agreement between the European Network of Transmission Systems Operators of electricity (Entso-e) and Kosovo's transmission system operator (KOSTT) marked a major development towards Kosovo's integration in regional energy networks. Although investments in renewables are gradually increasing, Kosovo remains reliant on a predominantly coal-based, outdated and unreliable energy production system. The digitalisation of the economy is gradually advancing as Kosovo achieved the mid-term targets of its 2013-2020 digital agenda. Going forward, Kosovo faces the challenge to streamline its social security system and revise the war veteran pension scheme in order to address concerns related to its fairness and fiscal sustainability. Improving the governance and economic performance of publicly owned enterprises (POEs) would reduce fiscal risks. The business environment would benefit from advancing reforms related to the functioning of the judicial system and from further steps on the fight against widespread corruption, informality and tax evasion. Active labour market measures seem essential to support employment and increase labour force participation, coupled with stronger incentives for workers to join formal employment. Accelerating sustainable investments in infrastructure and energy would enable Kosovo to improve the reliability of energy supply, reduce pollution and speed up its green transition. Status of economic reforms Kosovo 1. Price liberalisation Price formation is liberalised with a few exceptions. Administrative prices are limited to public utilities, medical services co-payments, parking, driving lessons, some postal services, national parks, school textbooks, pre-primary education, public kindergarten, motor vehicle insurance and administrative fees. The regulatory agency sets electricity prices for households using as a reference the Hungarian energy exchange HUDEX. Fuel prices are updated in accordance with their fluctuations on international oil market and the euro\/dollar exchange rate. 2. Trade regime Kosovo is a small and open import-dependent economy. Exports are dominated by tourism services to the diaspora. Kosovo's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU entered into force in 2016. Kosovo is at an early stage of preparation for applying for WTO observer status. Trade under free trade agreements (FTAs) accounts for about 80% of foreign trade. In June 2020 Kosovo completely abolished the 100% tariffs on goods imports originating in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were in violation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and hampered the development of a regional economic area (REA) in the Western Balkans. 3. Exchange rate regime Kosovo unilaterally introduced the Deutsche Mark in 1999, and subsequently the euro in 2002, as sole legal tender. 4. Foreign direct investment Kosovo is open to FDI; its only FDI restrictions relate to acquiring and exchange of property and agricultural land. The economy relies on net inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), which finance a large share of persistent current account deficit. Net FDI inflows showed resilience in 2020, partly as a result of decreased profit repatriation of the financial sector. 5. Monetary policy The Central Bank of Kosovo was established in 2008 with functions mostly related to banking supervision and running the payment system, the only effective monetary instrument being its reserve requirement policy. 6. Public finances and taxation Kosovo's total revenue-to-GDP ratio is rather low, at 26.5% of GDP in 2019, relying mainly on indirect taxes. Reforms to modernise and digitalise the tax administration are progressing. The Tax Administration has developed a good taxpayer service focus, in particular with the widespread use of e-filing and e-payment. However, most of the adjustment needs to happen on the spending side, by making social spending more efficient and improving the implementation of capital projects. 7. Privatisation and enterprise restructuring The privatisation process of socially-owned enterprises is advancing very slowly. The Privatisation Agency (PAK) in 2019 sold 222 of 400 planned SOE assets to the value of EUR32 million. Since the PAK board began operating, 48 of 589 SOEs have been put into liquidation, while 15 liquidation proceedings were concluded. 8. Financial sector Overall, the financial sector remains stable with adequate capitalisation and comfortable liquidity buffers. Due to the reprogramming measures undertaken by the CBK, the ratio of non-performing loans remained low at 2.7% in October 2020. Banks continued to be financed by deposits, predominantly from households. 9.Montenegro 1.7.Macroeconomic performance After a relatively soft first wave of COVID-19 infections in spring 2020, a much bigger and extended second wave followed soon after. The shock had widespread effects across the economy, depressing not only tourism and retail services, but also trade, investment and public finances. As a result, the economy plunged by 15.2% y-o-y in 2020. The labour market is recording growing unemployment as well as an increasing share of economically inactive population. As a result, the unemployment rate reached 21.5% at the end of December 2020, compared to 16.1% a year earlier. To support the households and the economy, the authorities have implemented so far five economic support packages, including wage subsidies and temporary tax reductions for businesses and individuals, while the Central Bank introduced several measures to support banking-sector liquidity and facilitate loan restructuring for both households and businesses. Credit growth kept decelerating due to increased COVID-19 related uncertainties and growing unemployment. Although the central bank of Montenegro cut the minimum reserve requirement ratio by 2 pps. to help banks increase their liquidity and boost their lending potential, bank lending growth eased to 3.2% y-o-y in December from 4.5% a year before. Overall, the banking sector has so far proved resilient to the COVID-19 crisis, with banks' capital adequacy ratio comfortably above the regulatory minimum and the level of impaired loans stabilised thanks to payment deferrals and loan restructuring. The deflationary trend which commenced in March 2020 persisted during the rest of the year. Consequently, the decline in consumer prices (HICP) averaged 0.8% in 2020, compared to an increase by 0.5% a year earlier. Lower oil prices, combined with subdued domestic demand related to the coronavirus were the key disinflationary factors. The combination of the pandemic-induced decline in tax revenues and higher COVID-19-related spending deepened Montenegro's budget deficit. Thus, in 2020, the general government registered a cash deficit of 11.0% of GDP, compared to the revised budget plan's deficit target of 7.2% of GDP for the whole year. The deficit expansion came after budget revenues fell by 13.1% y-o-y in 2020, while expenditures rose by 4.8% y-o-y. Revenues in nearly all categories, except for corporate tax income, were lower compared to the same period of 2019. The spending increase was driven by higher expenditure in the health sector, as well as spending on wage subsidies. In contrast, capital expenditure fell by 30.6% y-o-y. The stock of public debt surged to 105.1% of GDP in 2020, up from 76.5% of GDP a year before. On 9 December, the government issued a EUR 750 million (or 16% of GDP) seven-year Eurobond with an interest rate of 2.875%. The bond issue aims to help the government cover its financing needs for 2021 and 2022. The current account usually posts strong surpluses in Q3 due the tourism receipts generated during the peak of the summer tourist season. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic revenues from tourism fell sharply, which meant that the usual inflows to partly offset the chronically large merchandise trade deficit did not materialise. Consequently, Montenegro's current account deficit jumped to 26% of GDP in 2020, compared to 15% of GDP in the same period one year earlier. The increase in the deficit was mainly due to the much lower surplus in the services account. Moreover, the surplus in the secondary account also contracted as the coronavirus crisis negatively affected remittances. The primary account recorded some moderate increase. The merchandise trade deficit contracted by 2.6 pps. y-o-y to 39% of GDP in 2020, due to the sharp import decline in the period. Foreign direct investment inflows remained resilient, with a net inflow of EUR 468 million (corresponding to 11.0% of GDP) during 2020 compared to 7.5% of GDP in 2019. In December 2020, gross foreign currency reserves (including gold and SDRs) stood at EUR 1.7 billion, which is equivalent to around 8 months of imports of goods and services.

The MoU and the LFA were signed on 28 August 2020, and entered into force on 28 August 2020 and on 15 September 2020, respectively. The programme's policy conditionality focuses primarily on strengthening public finance and the fight against corruption, enhancing financial stability, improving the business environment, and reforming social protection. The MFA is to be provided in two tranches of EUR 30 million each. The first instalment was subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights) and was disbursed on 6 October 2020. The second instalment was disbursed on 1 June 2021, after Montenegro fulfilled the attached policy conditions. The assistance is meant to complement IMF funds (EUR 75 million) under the Rapid Financing Facility (RFI) (100% of Montenegro's quota in the Fund), approved on 24 June 2020. The IMF acknowledges that given the current health emergency the authorities are not in a position to design or implement a Fund-supported programme at this time, and points to the country's intentions to pursue sound fiscal and economic policies, as well as its track record of cooperation with the Fund, of servicing its obligations and its access to international capital markets. 1.9.Structural reforms Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Montenegro has continued to show its commitment to its accession path and delivered further tangible results in key areas. On 30 June 2020, eight years after the launch of accession negotiations with Montenegro, the EU opened the last negotiating chapter (competition policy). At present, all 33 chapters are opened for negotiation, 3 of which have already been provisionally closed. Montenegro continued to implement the action plans for rule of law (chapters 23 and 24) and other strategic documents in this area. It worked towards addressing the outstanding challenges highlighted in the European Commission's 2020 Montenegro Report, and the 19 May 2020 Joint Conclusions of the Economic and Financial Dialogue between the EU and the Western Balkans and Turkey. As regards specific structural reforms, the main challenges posed by COVID-19 highlighted the need to strengthen the public health sector, preserving employment and improving social protection, enhancing the business environment and providing support to the private sector. The pandemic put the health system under stress, revealing persistent under-funding and weak capacities to cope with the crisis. Following improvements in the labour market in the pre-crisis years, the pandemic also put jobs at risk, including in the informal sector. Underfunded, inadequate and insufficiently targeted social assistance and unemployment benefit schemes became further stretched. The crisis also underlined the need to review the social protection system with the aim of improving its coordination with employment activation and its capacity to reduce social exclusion and poverty. Businesses, in particular SMEs, self-employed and small family enterprises were considerably affected by the pandemic, requiring urgent support, such as provision of liquidity and further easing the regulatory and tax burdens. The effectiveness of support measures depends on good governance, coordination and inclusiveness, taking into consideration the large informal sector. Work on legislative alignment with EU acquis and institution-building continued across the board, with certain remaining challenges, including in the area of judicial reform. The COVID-19 pandemic created additional challenges in this area and contributed to certain objective delays in Montenegro's work on its rule of law agenda. Concerning judicial reform, Montenegro is making further progress to develop and promote the system of alternative dispute settlement resolution and on the judiciary's IT system. An analysis to feed into the new strategy for rationalisation of the judicial network is underway. It remains important that Montenegro does not reverse earlier achievements on judicial reform and that it continues building track records, in particular on the fight against corruption and organised crime, while ensuring genuine independence of all the respective institutions. Status of economic reforms Montenegro 1. Price liberalisation Price formation is liberalised with a few exceptions. Administrative prices are limited to public utilities, maintenance charges in buildings, medical services co-payments, parking, driving lessons, postal services, national parks, school textbooks, pre-primary education, public kindergarten, motor vehicle insurance and administrative fees. The regulatory agency sets electricity prices for households using as a reference the Hungarian energy exchange HUDEX. Fuel prices are updated in accordance with their fluctuations on international oil market and the euro\/dollar exchange rate. 2. Trade regime Montenegro is a small and open import-dependent and services-orientated economy. The country ratified a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in 2007, entering into force in 2010. In 2012, Montenegro joined the WTO. Trade under regional trade agreements (RTAs) continues to account for more than 80% of total foreign trade. Montenegro participates in five RTAs with a total of 41 economies. Montenegro does not apply any export duties. 3. Exchange rate regime Montenegro unilaterally introduced the Deutsche Mark in 1999, and subsequently the euro in 2002, as sole legal tender. 4. Foreign direct investment Montenegro is open to FDI; its only FDI restrictions relate to the ownership of land and assets within one kilometre of the border line and agricultural land. The economy relies substantially on net inflows of foreign direct investment, given its large net external liability position and persistent current account deficits. FDI flows showed resilience in 2020, and supported the continuation of ongoing investments, in particular within the energy sector. 5. Monetary policy The Central Bank of Montenegro was established in 2000 with functions mostly related to banking supervision and running the payment system, the only effective monetary instrument being its reserve requirement policy. 6. Public finances and taxation Montenegro's total revenue-to-GDP ratio is relatively high, averaging 43.5% in the period 2007-2019. Reforms to modernise and digitalise the tax administration are well advanced, with the introduction of fiscal electronic invoices since January 2021. Most of the fiscal adjustment needs to happen on the spending side, by reducing the size of the state (local as well as national) and making social and health spending more efficient. 7. Privatisation and enterprise restructuring The privatisation process is practically completed, with only a few companies in transport, tourism and utilities sectors still under state ownership. 8. Financial sector Overall, the sector appears stable, liquid and well capitalised. The strong liquidity position of the banks before the COVID-19 crisis helped mitigate some of the negative effects from the decline of liquid assets. The Central Bank of Montenegro introduced several moratoria on the repayment of loans and cut the rates on the reserve requirement by 2 pps. to help banks increase their potential liquidity and boost their lending potential. However, the very shallow institutional investor base restricts the development of domestic capital markets. 10.North Macedonia 1.10.Macroeconomic performance In 2020, North Macedonia's accelerating economic growth and positive outlook were brought to an abrupt halt by the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of cases went up rapidly, and wide-ranging containment measures, including shop closures and curfews, dampened domestic demand. Lower foreign demand due to the global recession and supply chain disruptions affecting the production of automotive components hit the external sector. As a result, real GDP dropped by an estimated 4.5% in 2020. Beginning in March, the government has adopted five packages of support measures so far, which include wage subsidies, tax deferrals, and interest-free loans. The labour market held up well, supported by government support to employers. In the third quarter, employment dropped by 1.8% y-o-y, while the labour force diminished by 2.4% y-o-y, reflecting discouraged workers and transition to the informal economy. The unemployment rate declined to 16.5%. The activity rate (15-64 years) decreased slightly, to 65%, backtracking on the gradual increases of past years. The central bank supported bank lending and asset quality through regulatory easing and gradual cuts in the policy rate to the historic low of 1.5%. In March, the bank lowered reserve requirements for loans to the most affected sectors, and in May it expanded the range of securities accepted from banks as collateral in liquidity-increasing operations. It also allowed commercial banks to temporarily ease credit standards, including two moratoriums allowing for temporary deferral of loan repayments. In addition, banks could raise the threshold for loans to reach non-performing status (from 90 to 150 days). These measures helped to sustain credit growth to the non-governmental sector, which attained 6.5% on average in 2020, and to further lower the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio, to 3.4% at end-2020. Banks remain well-capitalised, as own funds were bolstered through reinvestment of earnings throughout 2020. Capital adequacy increased to 15.5% at end-2020. Annual inflation amounted to 1.1% on average. Moderate pressures arose from food prices and core inflation, while energy prices acted in the opposite direction. The crisis left a deep mark on public finances in 2020. The general government fiscal deficit almost quadrupled, to 8.2% of GDP, given the decline in economic activity and additional expenditure and foregone revenue from anti-crisis measures. Government revenue declined by 6.9% y-o-y, while current expenditure increased by 13.9%. The strongest drop in revenue came from VAT income, while revenue from social contributions was boosted by government subsidies to employers' contributions. Financing needs for the government's four support packages in 2020 necessitated a budget reallocation in April, cutting the originally planned amount for capital expenditure by 15%, and two budget revisions, in May and October, which raised allocations for transfer payments by cumulatively 13%. On account of heavy external funding to bridge the government's crisis-induced financing gap in 2020, the general government debt level has increased sharply to 51% of GDP (+10.4 pps y-o-y). Public debt, which additionally includes the borrowing of the heavily indebted Public Enterprise for State Roads, amounted to 61% of GDP. The current account deficit increased slightly in 2020, to 3.5% of GDP, as the merchandise trade deficit widened and private transfers from abroad declined. The shortfall was not covered by FDI inflows, which were some 40% lower y-o-y, on account of significant outflows of intercompany debt, and amounted to only 1.9% of GDP, compared to 3.1% one year earlier. External debt rose to 81% of GDP at end-2020, mainly on account of the heavy government borrowing abroad. Apart from assistance provided by the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, foreign financing includes a six-year EUR 700 million Eurobond issued in May 2020. These inflows bolstered foreign exchange reserves, which covered some 4.6 months' worth of prospective imports at end-2020. The share of intercompany debt and trade credits, which are less volatile components of foreign debt, remained high, at some 40% of total external debt. Provided the pandemic is receding and no new containment measures are introduced in the country, the economy is expected to recover in 2021 (latest IMF forecast for real GDP growth in 2021: 5.5%), based on a rebound of domestic demand. Households' disposable income would be bolstered by the recovery of remittances, and public investment is projected to increase significantly.

The MoU and the LFA were signed on 17 July 2020, and entered into force on 20 July 2020 and on 15 September 2020, respectively. The programme's policy conditionality focuses primarily on strengthening public finance and the fight against corruption, enhancing financial stability, improving the business environment, and reforming social protection. The MFA is to be provided in two tranches of EUR 80 million each. The first instalment was subject to the general political pre-conditions for MFA (respect for effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, the rule of law and human rights) and was disbursed on 6 October 2020. The second instalment is was disbursed on 1 June 2021, after North Macedonia fulfilled the attached policy conditions. The assistance is meant to complement IMF funds (EUR 176 million) under the Rapid Financing Facility (RFI) (100% of North Macedonia's quota in the Fund), approved on 10 April 2020. The IMF acknowledges that given the current health emergency the authorities are not in a position to design or implement a Fund-supported programme at this time, and points to the country's intentions to pursue sound fiscal and economic policies, as well as its track record of cooperation with the Fund, of servicing its obligations and its access to international capital markets. 1.12.Structural reforms In March 2020, the European Council decided to open EU accession negotiations with North Macedonia and on 1 July 2020 the European Commission presented to Member States a draft of the negotiating framework. Once the latter is adopted by the Council, the first intergovernmental conference (the formal start of the negotiations) will follow. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the country's authorities continued to tackle structural obstacles highlighted in the European Commission's 2020 North Macedonia Report and the 19 May 2020 Joint Conclusions of the Economic and Financial Dialogue between the EU and the Western Balkans and Turkey. The work on sound budgetary policies and further alignment of fiscal policy with the EU Directive on Requirements for Budgetary Frameworks has advanced with the adoption of the draft organic budget law by the government in December 2020, which is currently discussed in the Parliament. The draft organic budget law provides for, inter alia, the introduction of fiscal rules, the establishment of an independent fiscal council, and a medium-term budgetary framework. The transparency of public finances was further improved through the introduction of the new web platform 'Open Finances', which documents budget transactions of central level budget users; the quarterly publication of budget execution of municipalities, at consolidated level; as well as revenue and expenditure of central level public enterprises. The government adopted an action plan to improve the management of public investment, and, in the framework of the 2021 budget, introduced a capital expenditure rule, which allows for reallocation of unused funds of users at specific intervals, in order to improve the execution of budgeted capital expenditure. Also in December, the government adopted the Tax System Reform Strategy, which aims, inter alia, at improving revenue collection. In the context of improving the business environment, in 2019, an amendment to the Law on Financial Discipline to further align it with the respective EU Directive on combatting late payment in commercial transactions as well as the new Law on business inspections to ensure transparent unselective inspections, were adopted. The national e-services portal became operational at the end of 2019 and a register of parafiscal charges was established in 2020. The new bankruptcy law, intended to facilitate market exit by reducing the cost and time of procedures, is still under preparation. The Energy Law, in force since January 2019, liberalised the electricity market for micro and small companies and households. In February 2020, the country adopted a comprehensive Law on Energy Efficiency, transposing the relevant EU directives. Shortcomings in the rules and institutions of state aid, including the lack of a proper state aid registry, have not been addressed, amplifying existing concerns about its efficiency and transparency. There are still significant infrastructure and private sector productivity gaps that could be narrowed through higher public investments in transport, energy, education and sustainable environmental infrastructure (for example, water and wastewater treatment, and solid waste management), along with improved planning and implementation. The persistently high level of youth unemployment indicates that the education system does not meet the needs of businesses. Ongoing reforms in education, if stepped up, can help improve the situation. Status of economic reforms North Macedonia 1.Price liberalisation Tariffs for electricity and gas are set by the Energy Regulatory Commission. In 2019, the regulation of electricity prices for the main electricity producer (state-owned company ELEM) was abolished. However, based on the number of customers eligible to choose a supplier, liberalisation amounts to roughly half of total. By the end of November 2019 there were 35 licensed electricity suppliers and 61 licensed electricity traders. 2. Trade regime North Macedonia became a member of the Central European Trade Agreement (CEFTA) in 2000. In February 2001, the country signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. A critical component of the SAA is a preferential trade agreement that allows products from North Macedonia to enter the European Union duty free. The agreement also provides for a gradual reduction of duty rates for EU products entering North Macedonia. North Macedonia has been a member of WTO since 4 April 2003. 3. Exchange rate regime There is a pegged exchange rate system to the euro. 4. Foreign direct investment Large current account deficits are predominantly financed by net FDI inflows which amounted to 1.9% of GDP in 2020, lower than one year earlier (3.2%). FDI flows are mainly channeled to the production of machinery and transport equipment, including automotive supplies. 5. Monetary policy The primary objective of the National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia (NBRNM) is to achieve and maintain price stability. It shall support the general economic policies without jeopardizing the achievement of primary objective and in conformity with the principle of open market economy and free competition. The NBRNM conducts an efficient monetary policy with a standard set of instruments within a stable exchange rate of the denar against the euro. 6. Public finances and taxation At 30.7% of GDP on average over the past 5 years, the revenue ratio is low by regional comparison. VAT typically accounts for about one fourth of total revenue. The range of tax expenditures is large and the government has recently undertaken a stocktaking, including a fiscal impact calculation. In December, it adopted the Tax System Reform Strategy, which contains a number of revenue-raising initiatives. The structure of public finances is heavily tilted towards current expenditure, notably transfer payments. Budgeted capital expenditure is regularly cut in mid-year to make room for further current spending. There has been some progress in increasing the transparency of public finances in recent years. 7. Privatisation and enterprise restructuring The number of companies in which the government held a stake remained the same in 2019 as in the three preceding years (16 companies in full state ownership and 40 companies in partial ownership, most of these with a state ownership share of below 1% of issued capital.). The total value of state ownership in enterprises remained at 10.7% of GDP, according to government data. 8. Financial sector The banking sector remains well capitalised and liquid. The quality of the loan portfolio has been improving gradually since end-2014, with the ratio of non-performing to total loans dropping to 3.4% at the end of 2020, while provisioning for loan losses remains high. Regulatory easing, including the possibility for banks to delay debtors' due loan payments, bolstered bank lending and asset quality. However, a rise in non-performing loans is likely once these measures are phased out.

Conclusions and recommendations 1.1. Payments are at the forefront of the digitalisation of financial services, and frictionless payment methods are crucial for entrepreneurs and merchants in allowing them to successfully start up and grow their businesses. COVID-19 has accelerated the trend towards cashless and e-commerce payments and increased the need for retailers to adopt omnichannel tools to accept offline, online and mobile-based payments. Adopting these tools, which requires investment in IT systems and hardware, is putting an additional burden on small and medium-sized retailers in particular. 1.2. The EESC shares the Commission's view on the strategic importance of payments and that further work is needed to enable payment transactions within the single market using new home-grown, pan-European payment solutions. The EESC supports the view that the Commission should act as a political catalyst, whilst it is the private sector that should design the innovative digital payment solutions. 1.3. The EESC emphasises that cash remains consumers' preferred means of payment for their point-of-sale and person-to-person retail transactions. Cash is crucially important for social inclusion, and access to basic services. 1.4. The EESC supports the view that a digital euro should be complementary to existing central bank liabilities, that it should not seek to crowd out the private sector, that the private sector should have a role in distributing solutions related to the digital euro and that users' rights and obligations must be clearly defined. Privacy of transactions as an important right of the user should be considered along with other features, similar to those of cash. 1.5. The EESC calls on the Commission to: 1.5.1. Prioritise actions and efforts, given the high number of key actions identified in the strategy. 1.5.2. Reduce the current uncertainties as regards a sustainable business model for instant payments. 1.5.3. Consider as premature any legislative action on the area of payment instruments. The EESC prefers to let market players develop suitable products for customers, and consider legislative action if no suitable solutions are found. 1.5.4. Ensure full enforcement of the SEPA Regulation by the Member States, particularly when it comes to lack of compliance by payers and payees with Article 9 (so-called IBAN discrimination), whereas EU consumers should be able to use a single payment account for euro transfers and make cross-border euro bank transfers within SEPA just as easily as within their home country. 1.5.5. Focus its efforts on interoperability among existing and nascent e-ID solutions; it feels that the private sector, together with the authorities, should be better enabled to create e-ID solutions, to be used partly to carry out Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for payment transactions. A universally accepted public electronic identity is needed, based on consumers' choice, their consent and the guarantee that their privacy is fully respected. 1.5.6. Harmonise the acceptance of cash at EU level, as this currently differs significantly from one country to another. 1.5.7. Extend data-sharing between different sectors with provisions covering all financial service providers in line with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (1) to unlock further benefits for European consumers, as this can promote an innovative and competitive financial sector. 1.5.8. Propose legislation which seeks to secure the right of access under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions to infrastructure technologies considered necessary to support the provision of payment services. 1.6. The EESC believes that relevant market players should be subject to appropriate legislation, supervision and oversight, ensuring a level playing field among those offering the same services and activities. 1.7. The EESC understands the need to ensure an open and accessible payment ecosystem and to assess the inclusion of payment and e-money institutions in the scope of the Settlement Finality Directive (SFD). 1.8. The EESC welcomes the proposed actions seeking to secure a commitment to reduce the global average cost of remittances to less than 3 % by 2030 and encourages the Commission to play an active role in monitoring and ensuring support for the relevant actions defined in the Financial Stability Board's Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments. 2. Commission strategy 2.1. In its Communication from December 2018, the Commission supported 'a fully integrated instant payment system in the EU, to reduce the risks and the vulnerabilities in retail payment systems and to increase the autonomy of existing payment solutions' (2). 2.2. Digital innovation is radically reshaping the provision of financial services. With digitalisation and changing consumer preferences, cashless transactions are increasing rapidly (3). The COVID-19 pandemic has further reinforced the shift to digital payments and confirmed the vital importance of safe, accessible and convenient (including contactless) payments for remote and face-to-face transactions. 2.3. There have been substantial improvements in recent years, mostly thanks to the development of the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) and to the harmonisation of retail payments legislation. However, the EU payments market remains, to a significant degree, fragmented along national borders, as most domestic payment solutions based on cards or instant payments do not work cross-border. The dynamism of the European payments landscape shows that there is however a risk of inconsistencies, that requires a clear 'governance' framework to underpin the EU retail payments strategy. 2.4. The Commission's objective is that of a highly competitive payments market, benefitting all Member States, whichever currency they use, where all market participants are able to compete on fair and equal terms to offer innovative payment solutions which comply fully with the EU's international commitments. 2.5. As payments are at the forefront of digital innovation in finance, implementing this strategy will contribute to the Commission's broader vision for digital finance and to its objectives of removing market fragmentation, promoting market-driven innovation in finance, and addressing new challenges and risks associated with digital finance whilst ensuring technology neutrality. 2.6. This strategy is therefore presented alongside the digital finance strategy for the EU (4) and the two legislative proposals on a new EU framework for strengthening digital operational resilience (5) and on crypto-assets (6). It is also complementary to the updated retail payments strategy presented by the ECB\/Eurosystem in November 2019 (7). 3. General comments 3.1. Digital financial services are increasingly important for European consumers and businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the importance of digitalisation in societies, including in financial services. Payments are at the forefront of digitalisation of financial services and frictionless payment methods are key for entrepreneurs and merchants in allowing them to successfully start up and grow their businesses. COVID-19 has accelerated the trend towards cashless and e-commerce payments and increased the need for retailers to adopt omnichannel tools to accept offline, online and mobile-based payments. This adoption requires investment in IT systems and hardware, which is an additional burden particularly on small and medium-size retailers. 3.2. The EESC welcomes the support of the Commission to modernise and simplify EU merchants' payment acceptance facilities through funding and training options. It is important to underline the key role that SMEs play in the European economy. It is a critical sector because about 90 % of European businesses are SMEs, and they represent more than 50 % of jobs. Small and medium-size businesses can contribute to a strong economic recovery. 3.3. The EESC shares the Commission's view on the strategic importance of payments and that a persisting lack of pan-European digital payment solutions that can be used across Europe poses the risk of further market fragmentation, while global players capture the whole intra-European cross-border payments market. Therefore even if European consumers and businesses already have access to efficient, competitive and innovative payment solutions and payment instruments further work is needed in order to enable payment transactions within the single market through new home-grown, pan-European payment solutions. The EESC supports the view that the Commission should act as a political catalyst, whilst it is the private sector that should design the innovative digital payment solutions. 3.4. The EESC believes firmly that instant payment solutions are paramount. However, it calls on the Commission to clearly prioritise actions and efforts given the high number of key actions identified in the strategy. Some of the key actions and the overall objectives of the Retail Payments Strategy, in particular the objective of home-grown, pan-European payment solutions, will require considerable efforts on the part of the industry in order to materialise. The EESC considers that any additional requirements and regulatory projects should be carefully assessed. 3.5. The EESC calls on the Commission to pay particular attention to instant payment fraud levels and take appropriate action if necessary. 3.6. The EESC insists on the urgent need to improve digital skills and literacy through education and training. This must be done partly by building on the Digital Competence Framework and encouraging Member States to improve lifelong education for the skills that will be most in demand, at all levels of education. The goal is to ensure that individuals become data-savvy actors, with greater awareness of and control over their data, big data applications and data governance, and understand their digital environment and its risks (e.g. personalisation). 3.7. The EESC would like to prevent consumers becoming 'disconnected' and prone to financial exclusion because of a lack of digital skills or tools, which is a clear risk among the growing number of older people in Europe. 4. Specific comments Pillar 1: Increasingly digital and instant payment solutions with pan-European reach 4.1. The EESC strongly supports efforts to equip the European payments market with several home-grown, pan-European payment solutions. These should bring added value to consumers and businesses as end users, should enable European market actors to better compete with currently dominating market actors and emerging and possibly dominant markets actors, such as BigTechs, and would enhance the international role of the euro. Given the current market situation and the well-established position of the incumbents in the card market, creating such a pan-European payment solutions would be a major undertaking for the European payments industry. 4.2. The EESC supports the idea of analysing the possibility of using direct debits across Europe for payments in shops. The electronic direct debit (ELV) model, which is widely used in Germany, could be extended. This would expose market-dominant card schemes to competition on the basis of direct debit (SEPA Direct Debit). 4.3. In order to enable the development of pan-European payments solutions based on instant payments, it is essential for market actors to have clarity regarding the business model. Without this, investment decisions cannot be expected to be made. The EESC calls on the Commission to reduce the current uncertainties as regards a sustainable business model for instant payments. 4.4. In terms of the number of Payment Service Providers (PSPs) offering euro-denominated instant payments and signed up to the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme (SCT Inst), there is already good coverage of PSPs in particular in the euro area. However, it is not yet sufficient to achieve full coverage of instant payments. The market is striving to increase the levels of adherence of PSPs and to have broader coverage and provision of instant euro-denominated credit transfers. The EESC supports measures that seek to address amongst others the adherence, interoperability and other issues arising from the widespread use of SCT Inst, including issues related to consumer protection. 4.5. The EESC agrees with the Commission that end-user solutions should be interoperable and accessible, add value and meet the needs of a broad range of users and have features equivalent to other, corresponding payment instruments. The EESC considers that it is premature to ponder any legislative action in this area and that it is preferable to let market actors led by existing market competition develop suitable products for customers and contemplate legislative action if no suitable solutions are found. 4.6. The EESC fully agrees with the Commission on the need to ensure full enforcement of the SEPA Regulation by Member States, particularly when it comes to lack of compliance by payers and payees with Article 9 (so-called IBAN discrimination). As laid down in Article 9, EU consumers should be able to use a single payment account for euro transfers and make cross-border euro bank transfers within SEPA just as easily as within their home country. However, many operators today still refuse cross-border direct debit requests from customers with non-domestic IBANs or even SEPA credit transfers to non-domestic IBANs. This is a major barrier to the Single Market and limits the ability of customers to access cross-border services. Member States should be called upon to take a stricter stance to enforce this regulation which has been in force since 2014. 4.7. Electronic identity solutions (e-ID) are an essential part of digital services, including financial services. eIDAS has been a first step in enabling cross-border recognition and usage of nationally recognised e-ID schemes. However, it is clear that the current eIDAS framework is not sufficient and cannot achieve the needed outcomes. A universally accepted electronic identity is needed, based on consumers' choice, their consent and the guarantee that their privacy is fully respected. The EESC encourages the Commission to focus its efforts on interoperability among existing and nascent solutions and believes that the private sector, together with the authorities as in the Nordic countries, should be better enabled to create e-ID solutions, to be used partly to carry out Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for payment transactions. 4.8. Widespread acceptance of digital payments is an essential part of a modern payments market. The EESC supports measures to assess the level of acceptance of digital payment means by merchants, and find ways to increase and facilitate this acceptance, especially by SMEs and smaller merchants. For society at large, it is crucial to preserve access to and ensure acceptance of cash. However, the same is true for digital means of payment as consumers should be given the choice. 4.9. The EESC emphasises that cash remains the most preferred payment instrument by consumers for their point-of-sale and person-to-person retail payments, as demonstrated by the European Central Bank's recently published 'SPACE' study (8). The characteristics of cash differ greatly from those of digital payments. Cash is the only payment instrument which protects privacy. Cash is public money for which the central bank is liable. Should all electric and electronic devices go black (a 'digital coronavirus'), it will be the only remaining solution in terms of means of payment in the economy. In addition, cash is crucially important for social inclusion, and access to certain basic services. The Commission and the ECB should look very closely at the issues of access and acceptance of cash, taking appropriate measures if needed. 4.10. One of the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis has been that many retailers have decided (temporarily) not to accept cash. As indicated by the Commission, cash is legal tender ensured by the Treaties. The evolution in the use of cash should be demand-driven. Rules on acceptance of cash are different from one country to another. There is a need for harmonisation at EU level. 4.11. Given the ongoing developments, it is understandable that the ECB is studying the possible issuance of a digital euro and that the Commission is supporting these efforts. The impact of a digital euro could potentially be unprecedented, and should be assessed very carefully. The EESC supports the principles put forward by the ECB, namely that a digital euro should be complementary to existing central bank liabilities, that it should not seek to crowd out the private sector, that the private sector should have a role in distributing solutions related to digital euro and that users' rights and obligations must be clearly defined. Privacy of a transaction as an important right of the user should be considered along with other features, similar to those of cash. The same approach should be valid for any CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) initiatives in EU Member States, outside the eurozone. Pillar 2: Innovative and competitive retail payments markets 4.12. The implementation of the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) (9) has been a major undertaking for the payment services industry and is still partly ongoing. PSD2 introduced two major changes: the introduction of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and Third Party Provider (TPP) access to payment accounts. In some instances in particular with regard to SCA for e-commerce transactions, the implementation deadline was the end of 2020. The EESC urges the Commission to examine in detail the impact of PSD2 before proposing a review. 4.13. The EESC supports moves to build an 'open finance' framework for Europe. Open finance has the potential to unlock further benefits for European consumers as it can promote an innovative and competitive financial sector. The EESC believes that a broad open finance framework cannot be built on the basis of the same principles as PSD2, as this directive deals only with payment accounts and payment services providers and provides for one-sided data sharing by part of the market. There is a need for a specific text covering all financial services providers in line with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (10) and to explore the potential to extend data sharing between different sectors. The Communication on digital finance strategy (11) indicates that the Commission will make this proposal by mid-2022. 4.14. Contactless payments have become increasingly common and are important in the current COVID-19 pandemic context. In most countries, the maximum amount(s) for contactless payments were increased during the first stages of the pandemic, in many cases to the maximum allowed by PSD2 (EUR 50 per transaction and EUR 150 euros cumulative), as a reaction to requests from merchant communities in particular. Any change in these legal maximum amounts as part of a PSD2 review should be carefully assessed to balance ease of use with security and liability considerations. 4.15. The EESC agrees with the Commission that as part of the PSD2 review, the risks stemming from currently unregulated services should be brought within the scope of legislation. Such providers, ancillary to the provision of regulated payment or e-money services, remain outside the regulated perimeter while being major market players. The EESC understands that whenever they are very relevant to market dynamics and are perceived by customers as providing a payment service, they should also be regulated and supervised as payment service providers. It is important that all relevant market actors be subject to appropriate legislation, supervision and oversight, ensuring a level playing field among those offering the same services and activities. Pillar 3: Efficient and interoperable retail payment systems and other support infrastructures 4.16. The EESC understands the need to ensure an open and accessible payment ecosystem and to assess during the review of the Settlement Finality Directive (SFD) (12) whether it would be beneficial to extend the directive's scope to include payment institutions and e-money institutions in order to allow them to directly access payment systems and infrastructures such as TARGET2 and TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS). The EESC emphasises the need to safeguard the security and integrity of major payment systems. This will be even more important should the directive's scope be extended during the PSD2 review to market actors currently not covered by the legislation, such as technical providers. Again, this emphasises the need to guarantee that all parties have access under the same conditions on a level playing field basis. 4.17. The EESC fully supports the Commission's objective of proposing legislation which seeks to secure right of access under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions to infrastructure technologies considered necessary to support the provision of payment services. Currently some important technologies supporting the provision of payment services, such as the Near Field Communication (NFC) antenna on some mobile devices, have restricted access, which has the effect of limiting competition in the area of contactless mobile payments, forcing banks to pay a fee to a third party for simply allowing a consumer to use a technology (like NFC) for their everyday payments. Those fees paid by banks may in some cases be subsequently passed on to the consumer. While this issue has already been tackled in some Member States, it is important to take this up at European level in order to allow all EU citizens to benefit from increased competition in this area, enable a level playing field for PSPs, and increase widespread adoption of mobile contactless payments. The legislation should ensure that all participants have the same rights and obligations and are subject to the same licensing and other regulatory requirements. Pillar 4: Efficient international payments, including remittances 4.18. The EESC agrees with the importance of improving global cross-border payments and the actions identified by the Commission, such as promoting the adoption of global international standards for payments, like the SWIFT GPI (Global Payment Initiative) and ISO20022, that improves cross-border payments across the corresponding banking network. 4.19. Remittances remain the most expensive type of payments. The EESC welcomes the proposed actions which seek to secure a commitment to reduce the global average cost of remittances to less than 3 % by 2030 and encourages the Commission to play an active role in monitoring and ensuring support for the relevant actions defined in the Financial Stability Board's Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments. Fees can disproportionally harm those financially disadvantaged. Competition and technology advances have already helped improve access to quicker and less expensive means of cross-border remittances, but much remains to be done. For remittance operators working to\/from countries in the EU's neighbourhood, better access to the EU-based payment infrastructure may provide a basis for cost reduction. Brussels, 24 March 2021.

The tourism ecosystem comprises sectors such as accommodation, transport, gastronomy, culture, sport and leisure, as well as tour operator services. It includes a total of around 2,4 million enterprises, of which more than 90 % are SMEs; 4. supports the recommendations and guidelines of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), as well as the One Planet vision for the sustainable recovery of tourism and the promotion of the UN 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the fields of tourism and transport; 5. subscribes to the UNWTO's definition of sustainable tourism as one that 'takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment and host communities'; 6. underscores the fact that the crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 has brought about dramatic change, with immeasurable cost to life and devastating economic consequences which have severely affected Europe, resulting in personal losses, serious financial difficulties and numerous companies going bankrupt, especially in the tourism and transport sectors; 7. recognises that these difficulties are exacerbated in the case of the EU's outermost regions, which rely heavily on the tourism sector, and whose prospects for economic recovery are seriously jeopardised by their almost exclusive dependence on air transport and the impossibility of using other modes of transport; 8. underlines the need to promote sustainable tourism services that take into account Europe's rich historical and cultural heritage as well as its unique natural heritage; 9. notes the cross-cutting nature of tourism, which this crisis has exposed, as a decline in tourism activity not only affects sectors such as accommodation, restaurants or transport, but also many areas of the economy with high value; 10. points out that Europe must maintain a proactive stance and show leadership in this and any subsequent crises that may arise, being quick to take the necessary measures to prevent the collapse of the tourism sector; 11. recognises that the current health crisis caused by COVID-19 has brought to the fore the particular vulnerability of tourism in island regions, whose resources are scarce; 12. reminds the Member States and the EU institutions of the importance of allocating sufficient financial resources to save the sector and of developing a long-term European tourism policy for a sustainable, quality tourism industry, based on respect for the environment and the fight against climate change; 13. maintains that now it is time to take action and focus on how to improve the present tourism and transport models, ensuring that they are fully sustainable from the social, economic and environmental perspective and using the crisis to spark a debate that will lay the foundations for resilience and sustainability in times to come in the tourism and transport sectors; On the impact of COVID-19 on the tourism and transport sector in Europe and the EU's short and medium-term recovery and resilience response: the tourism and transport package 14. notes that the UNWTO has estimated that losses caused by the pandemic in the global tourism industry in the first five months of 2020 were already more than three times higher than those recorded in the 2009 international financial crisis (1); 15. calls for closer coordination between Member States, in imposing bans and lockdowns to help reactivate the sector, reducing confusion among tourists and encouraging people to travel; and welcomes the efforts made by the European Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to provide objective and accurate information about the developments of the pandemic; 16. underlines how important it is for the resumption of tourism to adopt a common strategy on the mobility of people within the EU to foster greater confidence in travel, in particular by testing COVID-19 in the country of departure, i.e. before people start their journeys, increasing travel safety and avoiding the need for quarantine; 17. welcomes the EU's swift response in coming to the rescue of tourism and transport, in particular the European Commission's communication on Tourism and transport in 2020 and beyond and its accompanying recommendations and guidelines namely the tourism and transport package. These have helped Member States to re-establish safe and unrestricted freedom of movement and to re-open the internal borders, tackling the liquidity crisis and restoring consumer confidence; 18. it is also pleased to see that the following have been approved: the Temporary Framework for State aid measures (2), enabling Member States to provide more support to businesses; the new European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (3) (SURE), to boost household incomes and preserve productive capacity and human capital in businesses and the economy; REACT-EU (4), enabling managing authorities to change the allocation of the European Structural and Investment Funds in order to tackle the most urgent effects of the crisis; the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which benefits workers in the tourism sector who have been laid off as a result of the crisis; and projects such as Re-open EU (5) an online platform to disseminate up-to-date information on travel restrictions in Europe, public health and security measures; 19. appreciates the Commission's efforts to promote the fluidity of increased volumes of State aid to save European businesses, and proposes that some of the rules (including the modified de minimis rule) remain in force for as long as necessary in regions that have been particularly badly hit by the crisis; 20. urges all Member States to use all types of aid that are temporarily allowed under the framework to address urgent liquidity needs and cover immediate requirements of working capital and investment, and that make it possible to rescue businesses that have fallen into acute difficulty due to the outbreak of COVID-19 (6), thus giving them the opportunity to adapt and develop their activities; 21. welcomes the measures agreed on by the EU Member States, representing, in the words of the president of the European Committee of the Regions, 'an example of solidarity'; deems it essential for the EU budget and the Recovery Plan to be made rapidly available to cities and businesses in all Europe's cities, regions and municipalities in order to tackle this unprecedented crisis; 22. calls for efforts to ensure that the agreement achieves genuine partnership between all levels of governance, promoting shared responsibility and avoiding excessive centralisation; 23. asks the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to adopt a set of EU-specific guidelines and checklists for local and regional authorities to serve as instructions for the initial days of disasters, even before national and EU actions kick in; notes that the guidelines contained in the tourism and transport package are already an excellent point of reference; 24. considers the measures in the tourism and transport package an important first step in improving the response capacity of local tourist destinations in dealing with new waves in the pandemic and other potential disasters that could pose a challenge to recovery in this sector; 25. considers that due to the pandemic there is urgency for new strategies that will support the Horeca sector, and the development of touristic activities on local level, such as rural tourism, local gastronomy, or local traditions. The trends have changed on a global scale and smaller touristic locations, isolated destinations, where families and smaller groups can travel safely have become more attractive. For tourism to survive in the next 2-3 years, we need to direct our tourists to our own destinations; 26. stresses that the costs arising from COVID-19-related precautionary measures in public transport could be incorporated into public service contracts (PSCs), so as to avoid shifting high additional financial charges to transport authorities, which are often local and regional authorities; 27. voices its support for gradually rolling out visa exemptions in the long term to boost visitor arrivals from third countries and encourage tourists to come back to Europe; 28. hopes that in future the European authorities and border regions will be informed in advance of any decision on the part of national authorities to issue travel bans and temporarily close borders, something that will improve coordination and ensure timely access to information; 29. staunchly supports the recovery plan for Europe to help remedy the economic and social damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, start the European recovery process and preserve and create jobs; On the need for action to make tourism more sustainable 30. notes that tourism has been one of the industries that has enjoyed the most rapid growth in recent years growth that has laid bare the difficulties in achieving balanced development in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability; 31. sets store by the Commission's communications on Europe, the world's No 1 tourist destination: a new political framework for tourism in Europe (2010) and A European Strategy for more Growth and Jobs in Coastal and Maritime Tourism (2014); 32. points out that tourism is now faced with new, high-impact challenges that will have to be addressed, such as climate change, increasing congestion, excessive pressure on infrastructure and water and energy consumption, environmental degradation, that need to be addressed urgently and primarily and the loss of identity and respect for the authenticity of local communities; 33. affirms that tourism can be a model activity in the sustainable environmental transition announced in the Green Deal, and believes that Europe can be transformed into the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 through economic adaptation to the digital age and by promoting equality and social inclusion; and strongly encourages the EU institutions and MS (Member States) to take the means necessary to achieve those goals; 34. acknowledges that it will only be possible to achieve these goals if they are based on solid foundations clearly defining the scope, obligations and implications of introducing genuinely sustainable development in this sector, with a strong commitment to guaranteeing implementation; On transport modes for travel 35. observes that tourism is a complex value chain comprised of numerous stakeholders with a direct link to passenger transport activities; 36. points to the need to progress in the tourism industry towards making the circular economy in tourism a reality; 37. notes that forecasts by the UNWTO and the International Transport Forum point to an increase of around 25 % in carbon emissions of transport connected with tourism by 2030; 38. therefore acknowledges the need to explore and put in place or implement ways of enhancing the connectivity of Europe's cities and regions, of supporting the less polluting options and of improving intermodality in line with the ultimate objective of the Green Deal; thus welcomes the Strategy for sustainable and smart mobility launched by the Commission in 2020; 39. strongly encourages the EU Member States to join forces to urgently address the lack of sustainable transport alternatives and invest in developing and revitalising long-distance train routes, including night trains, making low-carbon travel a more attractive option; 40. supports linking public aid to airlines to commitments by those airlines to meet pollutant emission reduction targets; 41. argues that the same commitment should be encouraged in the different modes of transport, including both road and maritime transport, paying special attention to cruise ships because of their high environmental impact; 42. regrets that support for bus and rail transport (key modes of local and regional transport) is lower than that for aviation, something that places greater pressure on funding for more sustainable forms of transport; calls for a strong commitment to scale up sustainable mobility opportunities throughout Europe by rail transport, reiterating that the Commission listed improving the contribution of the rail sector to sustainable tourism in the EU as one of the targets for 2021; 43. draws attention to the importance of carrying out an impact assessment, in the implementation of the future measures on CO2 emissions in air and maritime transport envisaged in the European Green Deal and in the new Sustainable Mobility Strategy, on the outermost regions of the EU, whose economic and social cohesion depends heavily on air and maritime transport for both the mobility of their citizens and the development of their economic activity 44. stresses the need for financial support to enable public transport operators, who have suffered a dramatic drop in revenue, to develop a more sustainable transport fleet with zero and low emission vehicles; 45. is interested in working on initiatives linking train travel with cultural discovery and tourism once the crisis is over, developing the #DiscoverEU scheme and cooperating closely with representatives of EU regions to promote rail tourism opportunities during and beyond the European Year of Rail (EYR2021); 46. points to the importance of recognising EuroVelo (7) as another TEN-T (Trans-European Transport Network) in addition to the existing networks of roads, railways and inland waterways; this will make cycling infrastructure safer, more direct, well-integrated and connected, benefiting all categories of cyclist and providing a significant added boost to cycling tourism; On the impact on the natural environment 47. is concerned that global warming may reduce the attractiveness or even jeopardise the livelihoods of some tourist destinations and reaffirms its determination to combat climate change in a timely manner and according to the latest state of science using the range of initiatives and policy measures set out in the opinions of the European Committee of the Regions; 48. points out that tackling climate change will be crucial for destinations including many coastal and island regions at risk of rising sea levels, ski resorts affected by lack of snow and regions struck by forest fires, floods or blizzards (8); 49. considers that tourism has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to Europe's circular economy ambitions and insists that regions and cities must be part of the discussion on how to move the agenda forward on the ground; 50. recommends that the tourism and transport industry boost the supply of climate neutral products by using clean energy, reducing the use of harmful chemicals and plastics, and implementing rainwater and domestic waste water recycling processes (9) that significantly reduce demand for drinking water from the supply network, and recycling of waste, and that these processes be used more systematically; 51. draws attention to the need for greater support for cycling tourism, which benefits local economies by making it possible to visit areas that are normally off the beaten tourist track and using local firms and services; moreover, the infrastructure required for cycling also benefits local residents by increasing connectivity, helping to guarantee long-term sustainability in local communities; 52. is in favour of continuing the work of the DG Mare-European Boating Industry working group on end-of-life of vessels with a view to developing a joint EU research and innovation roadmap to increase recycling of materials for building boats; 53. stresses the importance of promoting sustainable coastal maritime tourism that fosters activities to interpret and preserve the marine environment. In addition, sees great potential in navigation, wind and wave sports, diving and water sports in general for science, environmental awareness, ocean mapping and research on environmental issues; 54. highlights the importance of tourism for rural development, which should no longer be interpreted exclusively in terms of agricultural development, but as a driver for the progress of less developed rural areas, with farmland that is marginal and of low productivity but of great value to the environment and landscape and for protecting biodiversity; for this reason,, the European institutions should make appropriate efforts to include tourism and the opportunities it offers in the Biodiversity Strategy, the Farm to Fork Strategy, the new Common Agricultural Policy and the Natura 2000 network and in the long-term vision for rural areas; 55. considers it important to promote more sustainable tourism with greater added value for the regions by including zero-mile products in tourism services, and believes it is necessary to promote natural and protected areas and the potential of the sky as a tourist resource (astrotourism); 56. points to the importance of using 5G, IoT, AI and Big Data digital technologies to provide innovative, sustainable, scalable smart tourism services, with high added value, capable of promoting new, more efficient, accessible and inclusive tourism models, extended to all regions, with a special focus on rural areas, and to the importance of having telecommunications technologies that provide sufficient connectivity in these areas; On the social and economic impact and the need to avoid tourism being perceived as a problem 57. reiterates that tourism, and in particular overtourism (exceeding the physical, ecological, social, economic, psychological and\/or political capacity of destination thresholds (10)), like all human activities, has an impact on the social environment where it is carried out; 58. draws attention to the need to avoid the negative impact of overtourism, resulting in: more congestion; pressure on infrastructure; increased energy and water demand; environmental degradation; damage to historical sites and monuments; loss of identity and authenticity; and increased cost of living for local residents, not to mention rising inequality among them; finds that measures and initiatives should urgently be considered by the EU institutions and Member States to avoid the negative impact of overtourism; 59. underlines that promoting and developing tourism in rural areas can lead to economic development and create wealth, helping to attract people to or halt population decline in areas affected by depopulation; 60. recommends that policies be implemented to promote and empower women. Women play a key role in preserving tourist businesses, as they are the main players in combating depopulation. Making sure they are employable is a way of anchoring people in an area. This means assessing their needs and giving them targeted training with tools to acquire skills and become more competitive; 61. points out that some models of tourism based on the intensive use of low-cost means of transport and mass passenger travel encourage overtourism; at the same time, social media and peer-to-peer exchange platforms may also go too far in advertising destinations; for this reason calls for debates on the growth and quality of tourism; 62. defines the Barcelona Declaration of NECSTouR 'Better Places to Live, Better Places to Visit' as a benchmark demonstrating that the sectors of tourism and cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible, can work closely together for the benefit of the people of Europe and cultural heritage; 63. points out that tourism should be seen as part of the solution and not as the problem; therefore highlights the need to propose new initiatives that are different from and provide a more decisive boost to those that are already under way; to this end, notes the need to regulate the new forms of tourism and the collaborative economy platforms so that they comply with fair competition criteria, to strengthen monitoring and inspection systems and to guarantee the quality and legality of services provided within a common framework of free commercial competition; at the same time, the heritage, culture, identity and quality of life of the resident population must be preserved; 64. notes, in this regard, the benefits of disseminating best practice, strategies and methodologies for sustainable tourism developed in the various European programmes such as PANORAMED, MED horizontal projects, MITOMED+ and WINTERMED, in order to promote their capitalisation and replicability; 65. consequently, recommends continuing the European Capital of Smart Tourism Award; On digitalisation and data, and their advantages in setting up a monitoring and traceability system for actions 66. draws attention to the significant changes in distribution channels and in the way tourism is consumed, enabling many companies to reach their customers directly, an opportunity that has not been sufficiently exploited by small firms; 67. highlights the fact that information is a raw material that is fundamental for tourism, something that is being used by more disruptive initiatives in this sector; 68. points to the importance of the UNWTO initiative Towards a Statistical Framework for Measuring the Sustainability of Tourism (11), including the economic, social and environmental perspectives; 69. underlines that regarding data, the level of detail, quality, interpretation and correct usage will have a direct impact on the effectiveness of the political action to address the COVID-19 crisis and the pursuit of a climate-neutral Europe; 70. is concerned about the lack of harmonisation and the fragmentation of data in terms of the economic impact of tourism, a state of affairs that undermines systemic decision-making in support of the tourism and transport sector; 71. stresses that official data cannot produce information fast enough to keep up with the current situation, meaning that regions and cities have had to resort to other measuring mechanisms that are not yet included in official data; 72. welcomes the fact that in March 2020 the Commission reached an agreement with collaborative economy platforms (12) to publish key data on tourism accommodation, and encourages it to jointly explore indicators to define recovery strategies that will benefit the tourism sector; 73. recalls that collaborative economy platforms are rising local housing costs by shifting the destination of the dwellings from serving local residents to serving travellers. Despite the decision of the European Court of Justice, collaborative economy platforms are not a simple information provider. Therefore, calls the European Commission to legislate to give the possibility to regional and local authorities to regulate the activities of such platforms in their territories to make sure that it complies with the same administrative rules concerning summer renting comparing to more traditional stakeholders; 74. points to the need to establish standardised tools that can guide cities, regions and the business sector in their search for more sustainable policies that are embedded in the new European statistical programme and that strengthen the economic, social and environmental monitoring of tourism; highlights the need to facilitate accessibility to data, to enhance the updating and interconnection of such data and to provide a harmonised mapping system; 75. recommends that a legal framework be defined for producing and publishing Tourism Satellite Accounts in each of the EU Member States; 76. calls for better data collection at NUTS level 3 on the number of tourists and people going on trips, on other new forms of accommodation and on the type of transport, together with a regional breakdown and the main local destinations according to accommodation statistics; 77. recommends introducing a measuring system for monitoring water consumption and emissions produced by the tourism sector, including the tourism industry and its characteristic products, in statistical accounts for water, air and energy; 78. encourages Eurostat to further explore big data as a source for tourism statistics, taking into account the challenges related to collection, independence, trustworthiness, access, quality and availability over time; 79. calls for the problem of overtourism to be analysed by including qualitative data on the attitudes of residents to tourism in studies on incomes and living conditions, in flash estimates of the impact of tourism and in the report entitled Quality of life in European cities drawn up by the Commission; 80. recommends that further action be taken to make use of and optimise the extensive work carried out in recent years by the Commission, such as the ETIS system of indicators, the S3 Platform (13) for digitalisation and safety for tourism and the Tourism of Tomorrow Lab; 81. urges the Commission and the European Parliament to include in the next European statistical programme systems and monitoring tools that are better tailored to meeting the specific needs of regions and cities, allowing for proper traceability of the tourism policies implemented; On the need for renewed recognition of tourism as a key EU policy commensurate with its contribution and potential for growth and for tourism to be more committed to sustainable development 82. hopes that the current crisis will act as a wake-up call, encouraging the European Commission to pursue a more ambitious tourism policy for Europe at the environmental, economic, and social levels; 83. welcomes the Commission's initiative to organise a European tourism convention in order to draw up a roadmap for 2050 towards a sustainable, innovative and resilient European tourism ecosystem (European Agenda for Tourism 2050) where regions are actively involved; 84. states its willingness to organise a stakeholder conference involving public and private bodies in order to share experience related to the recovery routes chosen by the different destinations and the shape of EU tourism in the future; 85. expects the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism to join forces with the CoR in seeking a robust tourism policy in the EU; 86. proposes a joint session of the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism and the CoR's NAT commission to discuss the future of EU tourism policy in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, tying in with discussions on the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027; 87. looks forward to maintaining close cooperation with the European Parliament's Tourism Task Force and asks to be fully associated with it so as to bring the local and regional voice into its discussions; 88. reiterates how important it is for Member States and their regional authorities to include tourism priorities in their post-2020 operational programmes in order to promote access to European funding to finance tourism projects; 89. points out that it is difficult for SMEs and destinations to access the current funding mechanism and proposes introducing practical tools (one-stop shop or online tool), linked to the managing authorities of the European funds, to facilitate applications and processing; 90. recommends that the European Committee of the Regions strengthen its cooperation with the UNWTO through a memorandum of understanding and the development of joint action plans; 91. calls on the Council to involve the European Committee of the Regions and its local and regional authorities in Council working groups and meetings on tourism; 92. proposes drawing up a new European Sustainable Tourism Framework, aligned with the Green Deal and the UN 2030 Agenda, taking account of relevant regional strategies and incorporating the various policies that the EU is developing and may develop in this area, such as: supporting the digitalisation of the sector, promoting smart tourist destinations, decarbonising activity, promoting the circular economy, boosting inclusive and accessible tourism, curbing rural depopulation, and improving participatory governance and public-private partnerships; 93. calls on the European Commission to look into the possibility of setting up a dedicated directorate-general for sustainable tourism, and likewise asks the European Parliament to give thought to establishing a special parliamentary committee focused on sustainable tourism.

The Directive regulates the collection, processing and retention of PNR data in the European Union and lays down important safeguards for the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data. The deadline for the Member States to transpose the Directive into their national law was 25 May 2018. This report is in response to the obligation of the Commission under Article 19 of the PNR Directive to conduct a review by 25 May 2020 of all the elements of the Directive and to submit that report to the European Parliament and the Council. The report sets the PNR Directive in its general context and presents the Commission's findings in reviewing its application two years from the transposition deadline. As required by Article 19 of the Directive, the review covers all the elements of the Directive, with a particular focus on the compliance with the applicable standards of protection of personal data, the necessity and proportionality of collecting and processing PNR data for each of the purposes set out in the Directive, the length of the data retention period, the effectiveness of the exchange of information between the Member States and the quality of the assessments including with regard to the statistical information gathered pursuant to Article 20. It also draws a preliminary analysis of the necessity, proportionality and effectiveness of extending the mandatory collection of PNR data to intra-EU flights and the necessity of including non-carrier economic operators within the scope of the Directive. In addition, the review describes the main issues and challenges encountered in the implementation and practical application of the Directive. In preparing the review, the Commission gathered information and feedback through a variety of sources and targeted consultation activities. These include the deliverables of the compliance assessment of the PNR Directive, based on the analysis of national transposition measures; discussions with the national authorities responsible for the implementation of the Directive and with the travel industry within the framework of regular meetings and dedicated workshops; statistical data submitted by the Member States pursuant to Article 20 of the Directive; and field visits to six Member States. 2 In order to illustrate how PNR data are used in practice to combat terrorism and serious crime, where possible, the report refers to real life examples provided by national authorities drawing on their operational experience. The accompanying Staff Working Document provides more detailed information and a comprehensive analysis of all the matters covered by this report. 2.General context In recent years, an increasing number of countries not limited to the Member States and international organisations have recognised the value of using PNR data as a law enforcement tool. The establishment of a PNR mechanism and the implementation of the PNR Directive should be seen against the background of this broader international trend. The use of PNR data has been an important element of the EU's international cooperation against terrorism and serious crime for almost twenty years. The 2010 Communication on the global approach established a set of general criteria which were to be fulfilled by future bilateral PNR agreements, including, in particular, a number of data protection principles and safeguards. 3 These formed the basis of the renegotiations of the PNR agreements with Australia, Canada and the U.S., leading to the conclusion of new PNR agreements with Australia 4 and the U.S. 5 Further to a request by the European Parliament, on 26 July 2017 the Court of Justice of the EU issued an Opinion declaring that the envisaged agreement with Canada could not be concluded in its intended form because some of its provisions did not meet the requirements stemming from the Charter of Fundamental Rights. 6 To address the Court's concerns, the EU and Canada proceeded to renegotiate the agreement. These negotiations concluded at the technical level in March 2019 and the finalisation of the agreement is currently pending Canada's legal review and political endorsement of the text. 7 In addition, on 18 February 2020 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Japan for the conclusion of an agreement on the transfer of PNR data. 8 The negotiations with Mexico, launched in July 2015, are currently at a standstill. At EU level, the adoption of the PNR Directive in April 2016 constituted an important milestone in the internal policy on PNR. As indicated above, the Directive lays down a harmonised framework for the processing of PNR data transferred by air carriers to the Member States. The Commission has supported the Member States in implementing the Directive by coordinating regular meetings, facilitating the exchange of best practices and peer-to-peer support, and providing financial assistance. In particular, the Budgetary Authority reinforced the 2017 Union budget with EUR 70 million for the Internal Security Fund-Police (ISF-Police), specifically for PNR-related actions. 9 The Commission has also funded four PNR-related projects under the Union Actions of the ISF-Police. These projects aimed to ensure that Passenger Information Units of the Member States developed the capabilities needed to exchange PNR data or the results of processing such data with each other and with Europol. In 2016, the EU also modernised its legislation on the protection of personal data through the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 (the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR) 10 and Directive (EU) 2016\/680 (the Directive on data protection in the law enforcement sector, also known as the Law Enforcement Directive). 11 On 24 June 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication on aligning the former third pillar instruments with the data protection rules 12 and published the results of the first review and evaluation of the GDPR. 13 In the context of this review, it should be noted that the Belgian Constitutional Court has made a reference for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice on the Directive's compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaty. 14 More recently, the Cologne District Court also made a request for a preliminary ruling relating to the PNR Directive. 15 The Commission has submitted observations in the first of these proceedings and will do the same in the second in due course. At the global level, in December 2017 the United Nations adopted Security Council Resolution 2396 requiring all UN States to develop the capability to collect, process and analyse PNR data and to ensure PNR data are used by and shared with all their competent national authorities. 16 To support States in developing such capabilities, in March 2019 the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) launched the process to draft new PNR standards. These standards, which will be binding on all ICAO member countries unless they file a difference, were adopted by the ICAO Council on 23 June 2020. The Commission has actively engaged in this process, as an observer representing the EU, to ensure the compatibility of these standards with the EU legal requirements, so that they can contribute to facilitate transfers of PNR data. 3.Main findings The main findings of the review process can be summarised as follows: 3.1.Establishment of an EU wide PNR system The Commission welcomes the efforts made by national authorities to implement the PNR Directive. At the end of the review period, 24 out of 26 Member States had notified the Directive's full transposition to the Commission. Of the two remaining Member States, Slovenia has notified partial transposition and Spain, which has not notified any transposition measures, was referred to the Court of Justice on 2 July 2020 for failure to implement the Directive. The vast majority of Member States established fully operational Passenger Information Units, which are the designated units responsible for collecting and processing PNR data. These Passenger Information Units developed good levels of cooperation with other relevant national authorities and the Passenger Information Units of other Member States. All the Member States designated their competent authorities entitled to request and receive PNR data from their Passenger Information Unit only for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime, such as the police and other authorities responsible for fighting against crime. 3.2.Compliance with data protection standards in the Directive The analysis of national transposition measures points to an overall compliance with the data protection requirements of the PNR Directive, even though some Member States have failed to fully mirror all of them in their national laws. 17 In addition, the overview of their application confirms the commitment of national authorities to respect these safeguards and to implement them in practice. The Commission will continue to encourage the dissemination of best practices developed in this regard through its regular meetings with the Member States and the projects financed under the ISF-P Union actions. At the same time, the Commission will not hesitate to use its powers as guardian of the treaties, including by launching infringement procedures if necessary, to ensure that Member States fully respect the requirements set out in the Directive, in particular on the protection of personal data. The data protection safeguards contained in the Directive, where implemented correctly, which is the case in the majority of Member States, guarantee the proportionality of PNR data processing and aim to prevent abuse on the part of national authorities or other actors. The purpose limitation ensures that data processing is only carried out for the objectives of fighting terrorism and serious crime. The prohibition of the collection and processing of sensitive data constitutes an important safeguard to make sure that PNR will not be used in a discriminatory manner. The fact that Member States maintain records of processing operations, as required by the Directive, enhances transparency and allows to control the lawfulness of data processing in an effective manner. Data Protection Officers can independently control the lawfulness of data processing, in particular when they are not members of the staff of the Passenger Information Unit and are not subordinated to the Head of the Passenger Information Unit. In addition, their presence in the Passenger Information Unit ensures that a data protection perspective is embedded in the daily functioning of these units. On a practical level, the interaction between the Passenger Information Units and their Data Protection Officers appears to be working well and the role of the Data Protection Officer is seen as adding value to the operations of the Passenger Information Unit. The Data Protection Officers play a particularly important role in monitoring data processing operations, approving and reviewing pre-determined criteria and providing advice on data protection matters to the staff of the Passenger Information Unit. In most Member States, the Data Protection Officers have been designated by law as the contact point for data subjects and contacting them is also facilitated in practice. 3.3.Other elements of the review The necessity and proportionality of collecting and processing PNR data The review shows several elements confirming the necessity and proportionality of collecting and processing PNR data for the purposes of the PNR Directive. In the limited time since the transposition deadline, PNR has proven to be effective in achieving its aims, which correspond to an objective of general interest, i.e. to protect public security by ensuring the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of serious crime and terrorism in the Union's area without internal borders. According to the Member States, the different means of processing of PNR data available to them (i.e. real time, reactive and proactive) have already delivered tangible results in the fight against terrorism and crime. Without claiming to be exhaustive, Member States have provided the Commission with qualitative evidence 18 that illustrates how the comparison of PNR data against databases and pre-determined criteria has contributed to the identification of potential terrorists or persons involved in other serious criminal activities, such as drug trafficking, cybercrime, human trafficking, child sexual abuse, child abduction and participation in organised criminal groups. In some instances, the use of PNR data has resulted in the arrest of persons previously unknown to the police services, or allowed for the further examination by the competent authorities of passengers who would not have been checked otherwise. The assessment of passengers prior to their departure or arrival has also helped to prevent crimes from being committed. National authorities highlight that these results could not have been achieved without the processing of PNR data, e.g. by using exclusively other tools such as Advance Passenger Information. Under the PNR Directive, the processing of PNR data concerns all passengers on inbound and outbound extra-EU flights. The assessment shows that such broad coverage is strictly necessary to achieve the Directive's intended objectives. As to the data collected, the categories in Annex I reflect internationally agreed standards, in particular at the level of ICAO. National authorities have confirmed that the possibility to collect such categories of PNR data corresponds to what is strictly necessary to achieve the objectives pursued. Concerning the level of interference with the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data, the following considerations are relevant. Importantly, the PNR Directive strictly prohibits the processing of sensitive data. While PNR data may reveal specific information on a person's private life, such information is limited to a specific aspect of private life, namely, air travel. In addition, the PNR Directive contains strict safeguards to further limit the degree of interference to the absolute minimum and ensure the proportionality of the methods of processing available to national authorities, including as regards the performance of automated processing. As a result of these safeguards, only the personal data of a very limited number of passengers are transferred to competent authorities for further processing. This means that PNR systems deliver targeted results which limit the degree of interference with the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data. Finally, PNR data are not used to establish an individual profile of everyone, but to establish risk and anonymous scenarios or 'abstract profiles'. The length of the data retention period The retention of PNR data of all passengers for a period of five years is necessary to achieve the objectives of ensuring security and protecting the life and safety of persons by preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. Firstly, the need to retain data for five years stems from the nature of PNR as an analytical tool aimed not only at identifying known threats but also at uncovering unknown risks. Travel arrangements recorded as PNR data are used to identify specific behavioural patterns and make associations between known and unknown persons. By definition, the identification of such patterns and associations calls for the possibility of a long-term analysis. Indeed, such an analysis requires that a sufficient pool of data are available to the Passenger Information Unit for such a relatively long period. Such data can then be transferred to the competent authorities only in response to 'duly reasoned' requests, on a case-by-case basis, within the framework of criminal investigations. Secondly, the retention of PNR data for five years is needed to ensure the effective investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. Investigating and prosecuting such offences usually involves months and, often, years of work. In this vein, Member States have confirmed that the five-year retention period is necessary from an operational point of view. The availability of historical data ensures that, when an individual is accused of having committed a serious crime or being involved in terrorist activities, it is possible to review the travel history and see who travelled with him or her, identifying potential accomplices or other members of a criminal group, as well as potential victims. In addition, the safeguards provided in the PNR Directive concerning access by the competent authorities to the data stored by the Passenger Information Unit and in relation to the depersonalisation and re-personalisation of data have shown to be sufficiently robust to prevent abuses. The Court of Justice examined the time limits for the retention of PNR data in its Opinion 1\/15 on the envisaged EU-Canada PNR agreement and, to address the Court's concerns, the Commission negotiated a new draft agreement with Canada. In this respect, it is important to note that the Commission considers the factual and legal circumstances of the PNR Directive are different from the ones considered by the Court of Justice in that case. In particular, the PNR Directive clearly seeks the objective of ensuring security in the Union and its area without internal borders, where the Member States share responsibility for public security. In addition, unlike the draft agreement with Canada, the Directive does not concern data transfers to a third country, but the collection of passenger data on flights to and from the EU by the Member States. In this respect, the nature of the PNR Directive as secondary law means that it is applied under the control of the national courts of the Member States and, in the final instance, of the Court of Justice. Furthermore, national laws implementing the Law Enforcement Directive also apply to the processing of data provided for in the PNR Directive, including any subsequent processing by competent authorities. The effectiveness of exchange of information between the Member States The cooperation and exchange of PNR data between the Passenger Information Units is one of the most important elements of the Directive. While the exchange of data between the Member States based on duly-reasoned requests functions effectively, the possibility to transfer PNR data on the Passenger Information Unit's own initiative is much less prevalent. The information provided by the Member States suggests that law enforcement authorities are more willing to use cooperation procedures based on clear and precise regulations, such as those concerning transfers in response to a request. In contrast, the broad and relatively unclear formulation of the Directive's provision on spontaneous transfers has led to a certain reticence in its application. The quality of the assessments including with regard to the statistical information gathered pursuant to Article 20 Article 20 of the PNR Directive requires Member States to collect, as a minimum, statistical information on the total number of passengers whose PNR data have been collected and exchanged, and the number of passengers identified for further examination. The analysis of this information shows that only the data of a very small fraction of passengers are transferred to competent authorities for further examination. Thus, the statistics available indicate that, overall, PNR systems are working in line with the objective of identifying high risk passengers without impinging on bona fide travel flows. In this respect, it should be noted that the statistics provided to the Commission are not fully standardised and therefore not amenable to hard quantitative analysis. In a similar vein, it is also necessary to recall that in most investigations PNR data constitutes a tool, or a piece of evidence, among others, and that it is often not possible to isolate and quantify the results attributable specifically to the use of PNR alone. In the present analysis, the Commission has mitigated these difficulties by collecting various types of evidence to establish a solid evidence base for the review. The Commission will also continue working closely with the Member States to improve the quality of the statistical information collected under the Directive. Feedback from the Member States on the possible extension of the obligations and the use of data under the PNR Directive All Member States except one have extended the collection of PNR data to intra-EU flights. National authorities see the collection of PNR data for intra-EU (and in particular intra-Schengen) flights as an important law enforcement tool to track the movements of known suspects and to identify suspicious travel patterns of unknown individuals who may be involved in criminal\/terrorist activities travelling within the Schengen zone. As Member States already effectively collect PNR data on intra-EU flights, the Commission does not consider it essential to make the collection of PNR data in intra-EU flights mandatory at this stage. The review has shown that, from the operational point of view, Member States would consider information from non-carrier economic operators of crucial added value. Given the number of reservations made by tour operators and travel agencies, an important share of passengers' data are currently not collected and processed by the Passenger Information Units, which creates an important security gap. The Commission recognises this challenge. Nevertheless, any possible extension of the obligation to collect PNR data to non-carrier economic operators will require a thorough assessment of the legal, technical and financial impact of such collection, including a fundamental rights' check, in particular in the light of lack of standardisation of data formats. The review has also shown that some Member States collect PNR data from other modes of transportation, such as maritime, rail and road carriers, on the basis of their national law. Despite the operational value of collecting such data, this issue raises significant legal, practical and operational questions. Before taking any steps to extend the obligation to collect PNR data under the Directive, the Commission will conduct a thorough impact assessment, as also recommended by the Council in its conclusions of December 2019, on 'widening the scope of passenger name records (PNR) data legislation to transport forms other than air traffic'. 19 While the PNR Directive only allows the processing of PNR data for the fight against terrorism and serious crime, several Member States have also pointed out that the use PNR data could constitute a valuable tool to protect public health and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, for example by facilitating contact tracing as regards persons who have been sitting near an infected passenger. This issue has gained even more prominence since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more Member States indicating that there is a need to allow for the use of PNR data to tackle such health-related emergencies. 3.4.Key operational challenges The Commission takes stock of the challenges reported by Member States based on the limited experience gained in the application of the PNR Directive over the first two years of application. In particular, additional measures, such as the mandatory collection of the passengers' date of birth by air carriers, may be necessary to enhance data quality, which is important to allow for an even more targeted and efficient data processing. Data quality improvements, as well as a careful reconsideration of the purposes for which PNR data may be used, may also be required to better align the PNR Directive with other EU instruments for law enforcement cooperation. Any changes to this effect to the Directive will require a thorough impact assessment, in particular as regards their impact on fundamental rights. To avoid that air carriers are faced with conflict of law situations preventing them from transferring PNR data to and from the Member States, ways to allow the transfer of PNR data to third countries, in compliance with EU law requirements, will need to continue to be addressed in the context of the Commission's external PNR policy. 4.Conclusions The Commission's assessment of the first two years of application of the Directive is overall positive. The main conclusion of the review is that the Directive is contributing positively to its key objective of ensuring the establishment of effective PNR systems in the Member States, as an instrument to combat terrorism and serious crime. The Commission has supported Member States throughout the implementation process by coordinating regular meetings, facilitating cooperation between national authorities and providing financial assistance. At the same time, the Commission has not hesitated in launching infringement proceedings against Member States which failed to transpose the Directive on time. The Commission will continue to work closely with the Member States to ensure that all the issues and challenges identified above are duly addressed so that the EU PNR mechanism becomes even more efficient, while ensuring full respect of fundamental rights. The Commission's monitoring of the implementation of the PNR Directive will continue beyond the completion of the present review. This report, which should not be considered as a definitive assessment of compliance of the national transposition measures, will facilitate dialogue with the Member States in addressing any deviations from the Directive's requirements. In that context, the necessity to launch infringement proceedings for non-conform implementation will also be assessed. The Commission takes the view that no amendments to the PNR Directive should be proposed at this stage. After a first period in which the priority was to achieve full transposition, it is now time to focus on ensuring that the Directive has been implemented correctly. Moreover, some of the issues arising from the PNR Directive's practical application, described above, will require further assessment. This is the case, for example, for the aspects related to a possible extension in the Directive's scope. Such assessment should also take into account the additional evidence stemming from the on-going evaluation of the Advance Passenger Information Directive. The decision of whether to propose a revision of the PNR Directive will also be informed by the outcome of the preliminary ruling requests currently before the Court of Justice. 20 (1) Directive (EU) 2016\/681 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the use of passenger name record (PNR) data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime, OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 132.

Conclusions and recommendations 1.1. The EESC welcomes the Commission proposal for a European Partnership on Metrology as this supports research and innovation in advanced communication technologies such as 5G, the internet of things (IoT), the smart grid and smart homes, next-generation automotive technologies and smart manufacturing, to name a few. 1.2. The EESC considers the proposal to be an important step towards a European economy that aims to be at the forefront of industry, technology and digitalisation. Advance metrology can play a supporting role in some of Europe's biggest challenges, from healthcare to climate change. However, harmonisation and cross-border compatibility in metrology is key to all this. 1.3. The EESC is of the view that European Metrology Networks (EMN), with their strong focus on stakeholders and their needs, will contribute more effectively towards the research and innovation agenda of the European Partnership on Metrology. 1.4. The EESC also welcomes the funding of joint research projects in this area as this will no doubt accelerate innovation using metrology solutions, capabilities and infrastructure. This is likely to enhance opportunities for new or significantly improved products and services produced or provided by EU companies. 1.5. The EESC believes in the importance of engagement with stakeholders along the metrology value chain to maximise uptake of emerging technologies and contribute to addressing major societal challenges. 1.6. The EESC is also of the view that enhancing Europe's competitive edge in emerging technologies and new product development can only be maintained by adopting a pan-European approach to metrology. This proposal supports this objective by avoiding fragmentation in identifying metrology solutions in the EU. 1.7. The EESC emphasises the importance of metrology as an integral part of the innovation required to support economic recovery across the EU as well as the commitment on the part of Metrology Institutes to support collaborative research and innovation in metrology. The EESC also notes that advanced metrology helps reduce energy consumption and achieve climate change targets in line with Next Generation EU objectives. 1.8. The EESC recognises the role that improved and harmonised measurement and standards could play in the efficient functioning of the Single Market, particularly when EU citizens have adequate information about the products available in the Single Market. Advanced metrology helps achieve this as well as reducing transaction costs associated with participating in the Single Market. 1.9. The EESC believes that precise measurement standards must be accessible and understandable to all stakeholders involved, particularly small businesses and consumers. This will reap significant benefits for the EU's economy as it emerges from its COVID-induced slowdown, particularly as it transitions towards a greener, more digital Europe, while also promoting trust along the entire supply chain. 1.10. Finally, the EESC highlights the evident need to raise awareness among EU citizens of the importance of metrology in areas such as healthcare, manufacturing, advanced communications technologies and the safety of workers in the workplace. 2. Background 2.1. Metrology deals with the scientific study of measurements with respect to industry standards and various units of parameters. Measurements are essential for innovation as they not only impact quality but also influence different technical parameters. In the manufacturing industry, for instance, metrology allows companies to meet consumer design specifications; expected functional outcomes; and compliance regulations and standards. 2.2. Measurement techniques are constantly evolving and this together with rapid technological advancement is supplementing the demand for accurate and reliable metrology products. In response to this, on 23 February 2021, the European Commission published its proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the participation of the Union in the European Partnership on Metrology jointly undertaken by several Member States. 2.3. Metrology was acknowledged by the co-legislators as one of the priority areas identified for possible Institutionalised European Partnerships based on Article 185 or Article 187 TFEU under the Horizon Europe Regulation. The present proposal for a European Metrology Partnership builds on the lessons learnt from the European metrology research programme (EMRP) and the European metrology programme on innovation and research (EMPIR). However, the present initiative represents a new partnership to meet new challenges. It is not intended as a mere continuation of previous programmes. 2.4. The Metrology Partnership shall, through the involvement and commitment of partners in designing and implementing a programme of research and innovation activities, pursue the following general objectives: (a) to develop a sustainable coordinated metrology system on a European level; (b) to ensure that state-of-the-art metrology capabilities are taken up directly by innovators in their ecosystems; (c) to increase the impact of metrology on societal challenges in relation to the implementation of policies, standards and regulations to make them fit for purpose. 2.5. When implementing the general objectives set out above, the Metrology Partnership shall pursue the following specific objectives: (a) to develop by 2030 new research capabilities which are built within the framework of new European Metrology Networks and which perform in terms of calibration and measurement capabilities at least equal to the leading metrology institutes outside the Participating States; (b) to support, by 2030, sales of new innovative products and services through the use and adoption of the new metrology capabilities in key emerging technologies; (c) to contribute fully and effectively, by 2030, to the design and implementation of specific standards and regulations that underpin public policies addressing societal challenges. 3. General comments 3.1. The world is facing an economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As has happened to other markets, this has also led to a decline in the growth rate of the industrial metrology market, especially in 2020 and 2021. This is because organisations in most of the major demand-generating verticals are currently, or were, non-operational in various countries, thereby negatively impacting the industrial metrology market. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted operations on a massive scale, and manufacturers are facing the challenge of assessing the impact. Past and current lockdowns resulting in the shutdown of manufacturing facilities have put a lot of strain on the industrial sector. 3.2. Prior to the global pandemic, the market had witnessed significant growth over the past years, mainly owing to the rising demand for big data analytics, and increasing demand for automobiles in emerging economies. In the future, however, the global industrial metrology market is expected to grow from USD 9,8 billion in 2021 to USD 13,2 billion by 2026. The reasons for this are the increasing adoption of cloud services in the integration of metrological data and the increase in demand for metrology in industry. The latter shall considerably boost the industrial metrology market in the coming years with the hardware segment expected to dominate the industrial metrology market. 3.3. Europe as a global player faces increased global competition in metrology in terms of scale and focus of investment as well as long-term financial commitment to metrology objectives. In the last decade, the US, China and India increased their investments in metrology by 60 %, 50 % and 52 % respectively. Investments in European institutes, however, remained relatively static and did not respond to new and increasingly important research fields. The apparent inadequate level of investment in Europe, coupled with the fragmentation of metrology capabilities, has resulted in efforts being spread out too thinly, without any strategic focus and a relative inability to capitalise on potential economies of scale and strategic complementarities. 3.4. In recent years, related investments outside the EU have surpassed those within the EU. In the US, for example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which is the country's national metrology institute, has a comparatively huge annual budget for its research programme for fundamental measurements and quantum science. The same applies for the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) in China with its targeted research programme for metrology. By comparison, PTB, the national metrology institute (NMI) in Germany and the largest in Europe, covers both research and metrology services for industry and society with its budget. 3.5. The EU's global competitors are making these strategic investments because of the growing need for metrology solutions targeting emerging technologies and new product development. In the Asia-Pacific region, for instance, the rapid increase in industrialisation and rapid evolution of technology is driving market demand. The surge in demand for high quality products in manufacturing and automation sector in countries like China, India and other growing economies is in fact fuelling the expansion of the metrology market in this part of the world. 3.6. Evidently, the metrology market is growing because of an increase in demand for accuracy and precision measurements in multiple industries with the consequence of increasing competition among the key players in the global metrology market such as Carl Zeiss (Germany), Hexagon AB (Sweden), Mitutoyo Corp. (U.S.), Renishaw (U.K.), Nikon metrology (Belgium), Metrology software products Ltd. (U.K.), 3D Digital Corporation (U.S.), Perception Inc. (U.S.) and Faro Technologies (U.S.) and others. 3.7. The metrology market can be segmented on the basis of type, product and end-users. On the basis of type, it is segmented into industrial metrology, scientific metrology and legal metrology. On the basis of products, the market is segmented into coordinated measuring machines (CMM) and optical digitisers, 3D scanners, laser trackers and others. On the basis of end-users, the market is segmented into aerospace, automotive, consumer electronics, industrial, energy and power among others. On the basis of region, the global metrology market is segmented into North and South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world. Europe has the potential to be a dominant player with an increasing share in the global metrology market and this can be achieved with further technological advancement and investment in research. 4. Specific comments 4.1. Reliable measurements are essential for innovation in economies and societies: metrology, the science of measurement, is vital for scientific research, trade and industry. New societal challenges and emerging technologies increase the need for accuracy, precision and novel measurement capabilities. Advanced communication technologies such as 5G, the internet of things (IoT), the smart grid and smart homes, next-generation automotive technologies and smart manufacturing, to name a few, all depend on advances in metrology. Hence, the EESC welcomes the Commission proposal for a European Partnership on Metrology. 4.2. The EESC considers the proposal as a building block for a European economy that aims to be at the forefront of industry, technology and digitalisation. It also recognises the important role the metrological infrastructure can play in innovation and tackling some of Europe's biggest challenges, from healthcare to climate change. Though individual Member States and individual systems may have their own specificities, achieving harmonisation and cross-border compatibility in metrology is an important objective and one which the EESC fully supports. 4.3. The establishment of sustainable EMNs in highly competitive and emerging areas, able to compete with the top global performers, is crucial for the future of European economies and could also support economic recovery following COVID-19 and its effects. The EESC considers that EMNs, with their strong focus on stakeholders and their needs, will contribute more effectively towards the research and innovation agenda of the European Partnership on Metrology. 4.4. The EESC also welcomes the funding of joint research projects as this will no doubt accelerate innovation using metrology solutions, capabilities and infrastructure. This is also likely to enhance opportunities for new or significantly improved products and services produced in the EU or by EU companies based in third countries. Moreover, financial support for joint research projects would boost efforts to increase and coordinate the role of metrology in the design and implementation of more evidence-based public policies. 4.5. The EESC also believes that the engagement with stakeholders along the metrology value chain to maximise uptake of emerging technologies and contribution to addressing major societal challenges is very important. A European Partnership on Metrology would also support a wide range of European policies, commerce and public services. In addition, further opportunities for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) could help accelerate Europe's global lead in metrology research and stimulate new innovative products, responding to new demands for precision-products. 4.6. The EESC is also of the view that enhancing Europe's competitive edge in emerging technologies and new product development can only be maintained by adopting a pan-European approach to metrology. This proposal supports this objective by avoiding fragmentation in identifying metrology solutions in Europe which could and place Europe at the top of global performers in providing metrology services for existing, complex measurement challenges and new technologies. This approach also supports Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that rely on metrology in both research and services in the development of quality products. 4.7. The EESC emphasises the importance of metrology as an integral part of the innovation required to support economic recovery as well as the commitment on the part of Metrology Institutes in the EU to support collaborative research and innovation in metrology. At its core, metrology links science and economic activity closely as measurement is a cornerstone for economic transactions, optimisation of production, consumer and business confidence and innovation. Advanced metrology also allows companies to have an optimum scale of production which results in carbon neutrality. Hence, reducing energy consumption in industry is consistent with one of the main objectives of the Recovery and Resilience Facility of Next Generation EU. Furthermore, ongoing research and innovation in metrology supports both innovation and climate change targets. Also relevant is that advances in metrology support public services in implementing regulation much more effectively than is the case today. 4.8. The EESC also identifies further economic benefits resulting from research and innovation in metrology, namely limiting market failure, reduced transaction costs, and increased overall economic efficiency. Improved and harmonised measurement and standards could play an important role in the efficient functioning of the Single Market. It would operate far more efficiently or effectively if EU citizens have adequate information about the products available in the Single Market. Asymmetric information between buyers and sellers is one of the most common sources of market failure, which occurs when the buyer cannot determine with a high degree of accuracy the quality of a product. Through the provision of more advanced measurement and standards, buyers can measure the quality of products given there are agreed standards and they can therefore differentiate between lower and higher quality products. This then eliminates the asymmetric information, as well as correcting the market failure present, thus increasing the efficiency of the Single Market. 4.9. Another obstacle to the Single Market is transaction costs associated with participating in an economic exchange. Transaction costs arise as a result of the information between consumers and producers being asymmetric and incomplete. This could be addressed by more advanced metrology with the buyer spending less time searching for goods if he or she is assured about the quality of the product being purchased. Clearly, the need for standard, transparent and seamless measurement is critical, both for clients\/consumers and businesses. 4.10. In effect, advanced metrology benefits producers in the design of products in accordance with a standard. This allows producers to incur fewer costs associated with correcting defects to meet specifications. This, in turn, facilitates certification and consumer trust in the certification and performance of a product. 4.11. A further point worth mentioning is the continued need for measurement standards and units to be not only accurate and transparent but also accessible and understandable to all stakeholders involved, particularly small businesses and consumers, who form the backbone of the EU economy. This will not only assist in overcoming the market challenges mentioned above, but also reap significant benefits for the EU's economy as it emerges from its COVID-induced slowdown, particularly as it transitions towards a greener, more digital Europe, while also promoting trust along the entire supply-chain. Thus, such considerations related to accessibility must be at the forefront of any strategy aimed at boosting investment in advanced metrology. 4.12. Finally, the EESC highlights the evident need to raise awareness among EU citizens of the importance of metrology. Companies rely on metrology to produce precise specifications for a quality final product which, in turn, meets market demand. Industries turn to advanced measurements to scale up production, including for vaccines, and avoid huge losses. Metrology also makes manufacturing plants safer for workers. Just as important is the relevance of metrology in support of emerging technologies such as quantum technology and so the EU needs to enhance its capacity to develop advanced metrology systems and rely less on other competitor nations.
