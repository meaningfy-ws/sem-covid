EUROPEAN COMMISSION Brussels, 24.8.2020 COM(2020) 470 final 2020\/0223(NLE) Proposal for a COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION on granting temporary support under Council Regulation (EU) 2020\/672 to Bulgaria to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency situation following the COVID-19 outbreak EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL Reasons for and objectives of the proposal Council Regulation 2020\/672 (\"SURE Regulation\") lays down the legal framework for providing Union financial assistance to Member States, which are experiencing, or are seriously threatened with, a severe economic disturbance caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Support under SURE serves for the financing, primarily, of short-time work schemes or similar measures aimed at protecting employees and the selfemployed and thus reducing the incidence of unemployment and loss of income, as well as for the financing, as an ancillary, of some health-related measures, in particular in the workplace. On 7 August 2020, Bulgaria requested Union financial assistance under the SURE Regulation. In accordance with Article 6(2) of the SURE Regulation, the Commission has consulted the Bulgarian authorities to verify the sudden and severe increase in actual and planned expenditure directly related to two wage subsidy measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the two measures provide wage subsidies to undertakings, which, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, have experienced a significant reduction in their activity or revenue and in the absence of the measures they would not be able to preserve employment. The monthly wage subsidy to the eligible undertakings amounts to 60% of the monthly gross salary (including employer's social security contributions) of the benefitting employees. Bulgaria provided the Commission with the relevant information. Taking into account the available evidence, the Commission proposes to the Council to adopt an Implementing Decision to grant financial assistance to Bulgaria under the SURE Regulation in support of the above measures. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The present proposal is fully consistent with Council Regulation 2020\/672, under which the proposal is made. The present proposal comes in addition to another Union law instrument to provide support to Member States in case of emergencies, namely Council Regulation (EC) No 2012\/2002 of 11 November 2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) (\"Regulation (EC) No 2012\/2002\"). Regulation (EU) 2020\/461 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which amends that instrument to extend its scope to cover major public health emergencies and to define specific operations eligible for financing, was adopted on 30 March. Consistency with other Union policies The proposal is part of a range of measures developed in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic such as the \"Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative\", and it complements other instruments that support employment such as the European Social Fund and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI)\/InvestEU. By making use of borrowing and lending in this particular case of the COVID-19 outbreak for supporting Member States, this proposal acts as a second line of defence to finance short-time work schemes and similar measures, helping protect jobs and thus employees and self-employed against the risk of unemployment. 2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY Legal basis The legal basis for this instrument is Council Regulation 2020\/672. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The proposal follows a Member State request and shows European solidarity by providing Union financial assistance in the form of temporary loans to a Member State affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. As a second line of defence, such financial assistance supports the government's increased public expenditure on a temporary basis in respect of short-time work schemes and similar measures to help them protect jobs and thus employees and self-employed against the risk of unemployment and loss of income. Such support will help the population affected and helps to mitigate the direct societal and economic impact caused by the present COVID-19 crisis. Proportionality The proposal respects the proportionality principle. It does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives sought by the instrument. 3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS Stakeholder consultations Due to the urgency to prepare the proposal so that it can be adopted in a timely manner by the Council, a stakeholder consultation could not be carried out. Impact assessment Due to the urgent nature of the proposal, no impact assessment was carried out. 4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The Commission should be able to contract borrowings on the financial markets with the purpose of on-lending them to the Member State requesting financial assistance under the SURE instrument. In addition to the provision of Member State guarantees, other safeguards are built into the framework in order to ensure the financial solidity of the scheme: A rigorous and conservative approach to financial management; A construction of the portfolio of loans that limits concentration risk, annual exposure and excessive exposure to individual Member States whilst ensuring sufficient resources could be granted to Member States most in need; and Possibilities to roll over debt. 2020\/0223 (NLE) Proposal for a COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION on granting temporary support under Council Regulation (EU) 2020\/672 to Bulgaria to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency situation following the COVID-19 outbreak THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Council Regulation (EU) 2020\/672 of 19 May 2020 on the establishment of a European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) following the COVID-19 outbreak 1 , and in particular Article 6(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, Whereas: (1)On 7 August 2020, Bulgaria requested financial assistance from the Union with a view to complementing its national efforts to address the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and its socio-economic consequences for workers. (2)The COVID-19 outbreak and the extraordinary measures implemented by Bulgaria to contain the outbreak and its socio-economic and health-related impact are expected to have a dramatic impact on public finances. According to the Commission's 2020 Spring forecast, Bulgaria was expected to have a general government deficit and debt of 2.8% and 25.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) respectively by the end of 2020. According to the Commission's 2020 Summer interim forecast, Bulgaria's GDP is projected to decrease by 7.1% in 2020. (3)The COVID-19 outbreak has immobilised a substantial part of the labour force in Bulgaria. This has led to a sudden and severe increase in public expenditure in Bulgaria in respect of two wage subsidy measures, as set out in recitals 4 and 5. (4)More specifically, \"Decree No. 55 from 30 March 2020 of the Council of Ministers\" 2 , as it is referred to in Bulgaria's request of 7 August 2020, introduced a measure that provides wage subsidies to undertakings, which, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, have voluntarily or by law reduced or stopped their activity. The employment of employees is required to be maintained during participation in the measure and for an equal period afterwards. The monthly wage subsidy to the eligible undertakings amounts to 60% of the monthly gross salary (including employer's social security contributions) of the benefitting employees. (5)Furthermore, \"Decree No. 151 from 3 July 2020 of the Council of Ministers\" 3 , as it is referred to in Bulgaria's request of 7 August 2020, introduced a measure that provides wage subsidies to undertakings, which, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, have suffered a revenue reduction of at least 20%. The employment of employees is required to be maintained during participation in the measure and for an equal period afterwards. The monthly wage subsidy to the eligible undertakings amounts to 60% of the monthly gross salary (including employer's social security contributions) of the benefitting employees. (6)Bulgaria fulfils the conditions for requesting financial assistance set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2020\/672. Bulgaria has provided the Commission with appropriate evidence that the actual and planned public expenditure has increased by EUR 511 000 000 as of 1 February 2020 due to the national measures taken to address the socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. This constitutes a sudden and severe increase because the new measures cover or are intended to cover a significant proportion of undertakings and of the labour force in Bulgaria. (7)The Commission has consulted Bulgaria and verified the sudden and severe increase in the actual and planned public expenditure directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures referred to in the request of 7 August 2020, in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2020\/672. (8)Financial assistance should therefore be provided with a view to helping Bulgaria to address the socio-economic effects of the severe economic disturbance caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. (9)This decision should be without prejudice to the outcome of any procedures relating to distortions of the operation of the internal market that may be undertaken, in particular under Articles 107 and 108 TFEU. It does not override the requirement for Member States to notify instances of potential State aid to the Commission under Article 108 TFEU. (10)Bulgaria should inform the Commission on a regular basis of the implementation of the planned public expenditure, in order to enable the Commission to assess the extent to which Bulgaria has implemented that expenditure. (11)The decision to provide financial assistance has been taken taking into account existing and expected needs of Bulgaria, as well as requests for financial assistance pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2020\/672 already submitted or planned to be submitted by other Member States, while applying the principles of equal treatment, solidarity, proportionality and transparency, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Bulgaria fulfils the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2020\/672. Article 2 1.The Union shall make available to Bulgaria a loan amounting to a maximum of EUR 511 000 000. The loan shall have a maximum average maturity of 15 years. 2.The availability period for financial assistance granted by this Decision shall be 18 months starting from the first day after the entry into force of this Decision. 3.The Union financial assistance shall be made available by the Commission to Bulgaria in a maximum of eight instalments. An instalment may be disbursed in one or several tranches. The maturities of the tranches under the first instalment may be longer than the maximum average maturity referred to in paragraph 1. In such cases, the maturities of further tranches shall be set so that the maximum average maturity referred to in paragraph 1 is respected once all instalments have been disbursed. 4.The first instalment shall be released subject to the entry into force of the loan agreement provided for in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020\/672. 5.Bulgaria shall pay the cost of funding of the Union referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2020\/672 for each instalment plus any fees, costs and expenses of the Union resulting from any funding. 6.The Commission shall decide on the size and release of instalments, as well as on the size of the tranches. Article 3 Bulgaria may finance the following measures: (a)wage subsidies to undertakings as provided for by Decree No. 55 from 30 March 2020 of the Council of Ministers; (b)wage subsidies to undertakings as provided for by Decree No. 151 from 3 July 2020 of the Council of Ministers. Article 4 Bulgaria shall inform the Commission by [DATE: 6 months after date of publication of this Decision], and every 6 months thereafter of the implementation of the planned public expenditure until such time as that planned public expenditure has been fully implemented. Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Bulgaria. Article 6 This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

(2) The dates applicable to the new emission limit values, referred to as 'Stage V' in Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628, are set out in order to provide manufacturers with clear and comprehensive information and an appropriate period of time for the transition to Stage V, whilst at the same time substantially reducing the administrative burden for approval authorities. (3) The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a disruption in the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limit values than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628. (4) As a result of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it is very likely that non-road mobile machinery manufacturers, referred to as 'original equipment manufacturers' or 'OEMs' in Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628, will not be able to ensure that engines and the machinery fitted with those engines benefiting from the transition period under Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628 meet the deadlines set out in that Regulation without these manufacturers sustaining serious economic damage. (5) Given the current circumstances, and in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market, to provide legal certainty, and to avoid potential market disruption, it is necessary to prolong certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628. (6) Given that the prolongation of the transitional provisions will have no environmental impact, as the transition engines concerned have already been produced, coupled with the fact that it is difficult to predict the exact duration of the delays caused by the COVID-19 disruption, the extension of the relevant periods should be 12 months. (7) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to prolong certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union ('TEU'). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (8) In view of the urgency entailed by the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it was considered to be appropriate to provide for an exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the TEU, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. (9) Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628 should therefore be amended accordingly. (10) In view of the fact that the transition period provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628 for certain engine sub-categories is to expire on 31 December 2020 and that OEMs had until 30 June 2020 to produce non-road mobile machinery fitted with transition engines of those sub-categories, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and should apply from 1 July 2020. Such an application is warranted by the unforeseeable and sudden nature of the COVID19 outbreak as well as by the need to ensure legal certainty and equal treatment of OEMs regardless of whether they produce non-road mobile machinery before or after the date of entry into force of this Regulation, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628 is amended as follows: (1) paragraph 5 is amended as follows: (a) the second subparagraph is replaced by the following: 'For engines of sub-categories of category NRE for which the date set out in Annex III for the placing on the market of Stage V engines is 1 January 2020, Member States shall authorise the extension of the transition period and of the 18-month period referred to in the first subparagraph by an additional 12 months for OEMs with a total yearly production of less than 100 units of non-road mobile machinery equipped with internal combustion engines. For the purposes of the calculation of that total yearly production, all OEMs under the control of the same natural or legal person shall be considered to be a single OEM.'; (b) the third subparagraph is replaced by the following: 'For engines of sub-categories of category NRE for which the date set out in Annex III for the placing on the market of Stage V engines is 1 January 2020, used in mobile cranes, the transition period and the 18-month period referred to in the first subparagraph shall be extended by 12 months.'; (c) the following subparagraph is added: 'For engines of all sub-categories for which the date set out in Annex III for the placing on the market of Stage V engines is 1 January 2019, except for the engines referred to in the fourth subparagraph, the transition period and the 18-month period referred to in the first subparagraph shall be extended by 12 months.'; (2) in paragraph 7, the following point is added: '(d) 36 months from the applicable date for the placing on the market of engines set out in Annex III, in the case set out in the fifth subparagraph of paragraph 5.'.

Trans-European networks shall enable citizens of the Union, economic operators and regional communities to derive full benefit from an area without internal frontiers. They shall also take account of the need to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union and to promote its overall harmonious development. The trans-European transport network (TEN-T) policy aims to develop a European multimodal and interoperable transport network of roads, rail, inland waterways and maritime routes which is linked to urban nodes, ports, airports and other terminals. The network shall enable smooth global transport flows of both freight and passengers, in particular by improving cross-border connections and removing bottlenecks and missing links. It shall also enhance accessibility and connectivity of all regions, including remote, outermost, insular, peripheral and mountainous regions as well as sparsely populated areas. The first 'Community Guidelines' for the establishment and development of a trans-European network in the transport sector (TEN-T) were adopted in 1996 2 . Since then, TEN-T policy has been steadily advancing marked by geographical network extensions arising from enlargements of the European Community \/ the European Union and by expanding the scope of TEN-T as to strengthen infrastructure quality. This development was supported by growing responsibility and commitment of EU Institutions and by an increasing 'ownership' behaviour of Member States and other stakeholders. Key elements and features of the TEN-T policy Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 on Union Guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network 3 , which is currently in force, has been the result of the first substantial revision of the TEN-T Guidelines since 1996. Following a broad consultation process and an impact assessment, it led inter alia to the following key changes in TEN-T policy with important new features: The introduction of a Europe-wide dual layer network approach which is based on a coherent EU-wide planning methodology 4 acknowledged by Member States. Indeed, instead of the prior focus on a certain number of priority transport projects across the EU, the current Regulation introduced a transport network of EU added-value composed of a 'comprehensive' network (i.e. the ground layer to ensure accessibility of all European regions) and a 'core' network (i.e. the part of the comprehensive network of highest strategic importance and of highest implementation priority) (see chapter 3). The introduction of ambitious and binding infrastructure standards and requirements for all transport modes to achieve interoperability and quality of the network, with most ambitious standards established for the core network featuring high capacity and high quality standards. The introduction of common completion deadlines for the core (2030) and the comprehensive network (2050), accompanied by a strong new implementation instrument for the core network, i.e. the core network corridors (a subset of the core network representing between 70 and 80% of the core network length, depending on the transport mode). This instrument of core network corridors aims to facilitate the coherent and timely implementation of 'corridors' and is led by European Coordinators. Increased focus on network nodes, both transport nodes and urban nodes as important interfaces to enable seamless clean multi-modal transport, including sustainable and safe first and last mile connections in cities. TEN-T implementation structure and EU coordination and financing framework The introduction of the above key elements in a new legal form a Regulation has strengthened the legal base of the Union's infrastructure policy and, in line with the functionality-based network policy, reinforced the basis for the direct involvement of a broad range of stakeholders. The TEN-T Regulation provides all relevant actors (i.e. Member States, regions, cities, transport industry, infrastructure managers of all transport modes, users etc.) thus with a common policy framework, binding standards and requirements as well as fixed deadlines for completion of the network. It works towards the gradual completion of the common and consistent European transport infrastructure network. As such, it adds a European perspective to national infrastructure planning and addresses needs and benefits beyond single national approaches. However, the planning and construction of transport infrastructure projects is subject to sovereign responsibilities of Member States. In other words, the realisation of the TEN-T network is based on national infrastructure plans and programmes. The EU aims at aligning such national planning as much as possible with the TEN-T objectives. Over the more than 25 years of the existence of TEN-T policy 5 , the interplay of Member States' sovereign planning responsibilities and established EU policy objectives has led to an increasing mutual alignment: EU planning both builds on and gives direction to national transport infrastructure planning and investment. Demand in terms of major transnational transport flows is duly reflected in this planning approach. To ensure a better alignment of EU level and national planning, TEN-T policy has introduced a set of implementation instruments: first of all, European Coordinators have been appointed as \"ambassadors\" for the nine core network corridors as well as the two horizontal priorities of the TEN-T (European Rail Traffic Management System, Motorways of the Sea). They monitor the implementation of the network in view of its compliance with the standards and assess whether network deficits are addressed by planned or ongoing infrastructure projects. To this end, they have established a database of around 3000 ongoing\/planned projects on the TEN-T network which is regularly monitored and updated according to a wide range of criteria (such as financial maturity, permitting and procurement status, reach of KPI standards etc.). In addition, the European Coordinators push forward the implementation of the corridors by bringing the relevant stakeholders together in so called \"Corridor Fora\". They also push for and monitor progress of the implementation of the major cross-border projects, e.g. by being member of the respective project boards. Last but not least, they draw up so called \"work plans\" and where applicable also \"implementing decisions\" for specific projects as to set the priorities and milestones for the network. Unlike in the energy and telecommunication sectors, transport infrastructure policy is strongly related to Member States' budget decisions. Indeed, the major share of the investments on the TEN-T network is made by Member States, in accordance with the relevant procedures and processes in place in each Member State. This also means that the main responsibility for the implementation of projects contributing to the achievement of the TEN-T objectives, standards and requirements has to be assumed by the Member States concerned and, as appropriate, other public and private actors. The EU complements the TEN-T infrastructure implementation through support from the Connecting Europe Facility, the European Structural and Investment Funds as well as through instruments such as InvestEU or interventions from the European Investment Bank. Furthermore, in its external dimension, it establishes a basis for EU funding in the field of pre-accession, enlargement, foreign policy cooperation and development aid. All projects contributing to the completion of the network qualify as 'projects of common interest'. So these could be a variety of projects, starting from physical or smart projects, projects filling a gap up to projects leading to an upgrade to target standards. Contrary to the preceding TEN-T Regulation, no selection of \"priority projects\" has been made. Indeed, all projects contributing to the TEN-T objective may benefit from EU support under the relevant EU financing instruments mentioned above. However, the CEF Regulation defines certain geographical sections (not projects) on the network which have a higher priority \/ relevance to be funded (see Annex I of Regulation (EU) 1316\/2013). In a nutshell: The competence to build transport infrastructure lies with the Member States and TEN-T planning is thus also based on Member States' national infrastructure plans and programmes. However, TEN-T planning adds the EU perspective and addresses needs and benefits beyond the single national approaches. Delegated Regulations Since the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013, the European Commission adopted delegated Regulations, aiming to adapt the maps of the network to evolving conditions: Delegated Regulation (EU) 473\/2014 was essentially a technical corrigendum of certain maps. Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017\/849 of 7 December 2016 adapted the network to take account of certain changes resulting from the quantitative thresholds for freight terminals, ports and airports and to adjust the maps to reflect implementation progress. A second category of Commission Delegated Regulations was linked to the strengthened cooperation with third countries in TEN-T policy one of the new fields of action introduced in Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013. Based on high-level agreements on transport infrastructure networks between the Union and neighbouring countries, the TEN-T Regulation in its Article 49(6) empowers the Commission to adapt the TEN-T to include indicative maps of neighbouring countries. At this point in time, such indicative maps have been adopted for the EFTA (European Free Trade Association: Norway, Island, Switzerland, Lichtenstein), the Western Balkans, Turkey and the Eastern Partnership countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) 6 . The purpose of these extended TEN-T maps is that the TEN-T standards are applied also on the networks of third countries as to allow for seamless connections. As such, they also provide a sound basis for foreign investments in these countries in line with European objectives. Interaction with other relevant legislation TEN-T policy depends on complementary policies even more it is in combination with other policy areas a pillar of EU transport policy. As the EU transport infrastructure policy, TEN-T policy is not a purpose in itself. The standards and requirements set in the TEN-T Regulation are directly connected with the relevant objectives and needs in other transport sectors\/fields and thus with other more sector-specific legislations (e.g. per transport mode). This means, for example, TEN-T rail infrastructure for the sake of seamless cross-border transport and mobility has to incorporate interoperability legislation which is set in railway policy. Similarly, road infrastructure has to take up EU legislation on road safety. TEN-T policy can thus not be separated from those policies. The comprehensive network is thereby the geographical basis for all related transport legislation through its standards and requirements and thus also the reference base for EU funding from different sources (CEF, ESIF, and others). The core network features higher standards and requirements as it is of highest strategic importance for transport policy overall and captures the major transport flows. Consequently, by implementing the core network the highest benefits can be gained for wider transport policy objectives (e.g. decarbonisation objectives; user benefits through lower transport costs and shorter travel times). In this respect, it seems not so much a matter of separating the impacts of the TEN-T Regulation against those of other transport legislation but of ensuring their complementarity and synergies for the overall purpose of sustainable transport. TEN-T performance on indicators such as for modal shift, better service quality, spreading of clean vehicle fleets etc. is depending on coordinated efforts in TEN-T and related policy fields. The evaluation: purpose and scope The present evaluation covers Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 including its related delegated acts concerning network adaptations in EU MS as well as in terms of indicative network extensions to third countries. In terms of geographical scope, the reports covers the EU 27 excluding the UK. Neighbouring countries have also been looked at in a specific case study (see Evaluation Question 13). In terms of time period, the evaluation looked at 2013 onwards. This evaluation aims to assess if the implementation of the core and comprehensive networks by the 2030 and respectively 2050 milestone is well on track. In addition, it aims to assess whether its objectives and related standards and requirements are still relevant and coherent in view of the increased ambitions of the EU's environmental and climate change policies. As such, this evaluation assesses on one side the implementation progress by highlighting and illustrating in particular a number of specific examples (see Chapter 3). On the other side the direct contributions to the specific objectives are outlined (see Chapter 5), in particular: 1.Contributing to efficient transport flows in the internal market through the removal of bottlenecks; 2.Contributing to cohesion through better interconnection between long-distance, regional and local traffic; 3.Contributing to sustainability of the TEN-T through standards and requirements enabling better conditions for zero and low emission transport along the TEN-T; 4.Enabling increased user benefits through infrastructure standards ensuring safe and secure transport as well as by enabling efficient and high quality service for freight and passengers. It can be noted that these four objectives are mutually reinforcing each other and one does not need to be favoured to the detriment of the other. Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 basically defines a horizon for its implementation. However, as this Regulation does not govern an EU programme with a corresponding budget allocation but sets the long-term framework for the development of an EU policy overall, there will be need for further action in the future (e.g. to take account of changing demand, ensure continuously high quality, adjust to innovation etc.). Given the very broad scope of TEN-T policy, this evaluation has been a complex exercise. The evaluation looks backward at what has been achieved since 2013, and it looks forward at what would be achieved on the basis of the current TEN-T Regulation; are there any initial objectives which will not be achieved and why, and what new challenges need to be taken up in TEN-T policy. This evaluation is carried out almost at mid-term on the way between the last substantial revision of the Regulation and the first key milestone of TEN-T policy: The year 2030, when the Union will have to prove to its citizens and economic operators that TEN-T policy has been successful. It assesses to what extent the implementation efforts so far have led to the expected results and benefits and if implementation is on the right track towards the 2030 milestone. In this context, \"expected results\" means that the ongoing and\/or planned projects on the TEN-T network are at this stage in so much advanced in their implementation and sufficiently mature (also in terms of financial maturity) so that their full completion can be expected by 2030. It also means that all projects are ongoing and\/or planned which are needed to fully address the lack of compliance issues on the network, i.e. that each section not yet compliant is being addressed by an investment planning project which will be realised in due time. To this end, a project database of around 3000 projects is regularly being monitored. New developments in transport policy and the wider political environment of the EU require a thorough assessment of the existing Regulation in its entirety. Therefore, in spring 2019, the Commission services launched an evaluation of the Regulation. The evaluation: Expected deliverables and input for policy making The European Green Deal 7 , adopted by the Commission in December 2019, aims at tackling climate change and reaching the objectives of the Paris agreement. Since transport accounts for a quarter of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions, the European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction of transport emissions until 2050. The climate neutrality objective by 2050, which the Commission proposed in 2018 8 and the European Council 9 and Parliament 10 endorsed, is one of the central elements of the Green Deal. The Commission has proposed to enshrine climate neutrality into EU law 11 . In order to set the EU on a sustainable path to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, with the Climate Target Plan 12 the Commission has proposed an EU-wide, economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030 compared to 1990 of at least 55%. In this context, the TEN-T revision is expected to specifically address how these targets can be achieved. Thereby, the potential of TEN-T policy to contribute to the decarbonisation challenge rests upon two pillars: 1)Ensuring the integration of all modes and their intelligent components into a single network; thereby creating a unique basis for efficiency and sustainability enhancements of the transport system as a whole and 2)Ensuring cross-border continuity and coherence of charging and refuelling infrastructure for alternative fuels in transport; thus helping to stimulate an accelerated market penetration of low and zero emission vehicles, aircrafts and vessels. To address the main issues that are of key importance to inform policy making, content-wise, the evaluation work has been structured to cover 1) objectives and provisions of a more traditional transport infrastructure policy nature and 2) areas with a clear focus newer transport policy objectives such as decarbonisation, digitalisation or resilience. Key areas addressed by the evaluation 13 The form \/ design of the network, i.e. its geographical structure of the network covering both rail, road and inland waterway links as well as ports, airports and other multi-modal terminals; addressing urban nodes as network components; considering the link with active transport modes; besides the strengthening of long-distance freight rail and the reinforcement of synergies between TEN-T and Rail Freight Corridors looking at weaknesses and opportunities of passenger rail; at bottlenecks resulting from changing transport flows which may have an impact on demand and thereby on the network design. The features \/ quality requirements of the network, i.e. the setting of binding transport infrastructure standards in accordance with related EU transport legislation in fields such as interoperability, safety, security or accessibility for persons with reduced mobility; provisions on infrastructure requirements as a basis for seamless, sustainable and efficient transport and mobility solutions in line with broader transport policy objectives (e.g. equipment and connectivity of transport terminals, intelligent infrastructure components to enable transport telematics solutions, deployment of certain alternative fuel infrastructures, resilience of infrastructure); promotion of innovative solutions, stimulating the use of new technologies to enhance user services and advance decarbonisation; The identification of infrastructure needs from the perspective of private and commercial users, e.g. the needs of providers of sustainable freight transport services, of mobility services for passengers or of other multi-modal solutions; of transport operators seeking to enhance their service performance (e.g. railway undertakings), of infrastructure managers aiming to improve the efficient use of the assets under their responsibility (e.g. port authorities) or of regional and local authorities seeking smooth first and last mile connections. The status of TEN-T implementation at the moment of the evaluation and the prospects for achieving the network completion targets; the effectiveness of relevant EU instruments notably of the core network corridors and the European Coordinators in their lead and the coordination of such instruments; the responsibilities of Member States and other stakeholders in implementing TEN-T projects. To evaluate measures expected to help substantially modernising TEN-T policy in the light of the more ambitious decarbonisation objectives, a number of specific issues were studied in more detail (please refer also to the evaluation method under point 4). These address the role of urban nodes in TEN-T policy, digitalisation, new transport technologies including zero and low emission vehicles infrastructure, infrastructure resilience, high-performance passenger rail and seamless mobility for the \"Trans-European passenger\" 14 . Specific attention was also given to TEN-T cooperation with third countries, an area which is gaining increasing importance in view of changing global trade relations and progressing EU neighbourhood policy. Finally, given their vital role in ensuring an efficient and sustainable TEN-T policy overall, infrastructure standards and requirements for all modes and for multi-modal infrastructure were assessed more thoroughly, and a more in-depth evaluation was also undertaken for the functioning of the core network corridors as the key instrument to facilitate core network implementation. Evaluation criteria applied In line with the Better Regulation guidelines of the European Commission 15 , Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 has been evaluated against five main criteria: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and added value. These criteria have been applied to evaluate the entirety of the legal provisions of the Regulation as well as the approach to, and the intermediary results of, its implementation. Issues such as those set out above have been specifically in the focus of the evaluation, but they have not been its sole subject. The 'relevance' criterion has proven to be of critical importance, especially when comparing existing provisions of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 with new needs related to the European Green Deal or to technological developments which were not foreseeable a decade ago. The preparedness of the TEN-T for a substantial progression to zero and low emission mobility, digitalization and automation or resilience clearly challenges the 'relevance' criterion in particular. 'Coherence' has been key in assessing the extent to which TEN-T policy is aligned with relevant transport policy needs and developments. Discrepancies may have occurred over the last years as a result of evolving transport policy, for example in areas such as urban nodes, railway policy, aviation or maritime transport. Coherence is certainly of vital importance when ensuring continuous equipment of TEN-T with charging and refuelling infrastructure for zero and low emission vehicles, aircrafts and vessels, in line with relevant EU initiatives. Similarly, 'coherence' may be at stake when assessing needs to adjust the network to climate adaptation, security or other new infrastructure resilience challenges; thus, 'coherence' between TEN-T policy and other policy areas beyond transport. 'Effectiveness' is of major importance for assessing the ability of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 to stimulate the achievement of the general TEN-T objectives facilitation of the internal market and contribution to social and territorial cohesion as well as the wide range of specific objectives. Chapter 3 below will showcase some representative examples, illustrating the implementation progress made since 2013, outlining success factors or obstacles related to the development to date and assessing strengths and weaknesses towards full completion targets. Such an evaluation can only be made in an exemplary way, given the broad scope of the TEN-T and the wide range of areas combined in it. The implementation of the TEN-T core network is facilitated through a number of implementation instruments such as the core network corridors, European Coordinators, work plans and corridor fora involving a large number of stakeholders. Furthermore Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 empowered the Commission, subject to Member State approval, to draw up Implementing Acts for the cross-border and horizontal dimensions (ERTMS, MoS) of the core network corridor work plans. The evaluation has been looking into the 'Efficiency' of these instruments and assessed in how far they are deemed useful and appropriate by stakeholders. Furthermore the evaluation assessed if and in how far Member States fulfil their reporting obligations under Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 and the burden associated to this. Finally the evaluation looked at the efficiency of the integration between Rail Freight Corridors and core network corridors and explored whether the Regulation provided for an efficient use of the TEN-T to the benefit of freight and passenger transport. Last but not least, the evaluation looked at the added value of TEN-T policy overall. In relation to future TEN-T policy challenges, notably in the fields of decarbonisation and digital\/technological transition, new perspectives may be at stake to further strengthen the EU added value of TEN-T policy. Even more than the 'traditional' TEN-T infrastructure approach, such developments may imply unique opportunities to boost the European added value thanks to a well-established and integrated infrastructure policy. 2.Background to the intervention (Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013) 2.1.Base line and points of comparison The Impact Assessment accompanying the 2013 revision of the TEN-T guidelines 16 highlighted the success of the policy since its beginnings in terms of infrastructure development, interconnecting national networks, overcoming technological barriers across national borders and deploying intelligent transport systems. At the same time it concluded that the European Union does not dispose yet of a complete trans-European infrastructure network due to several factors: The infrastructure network in the EU was still fragmented geographically, i.e. connections between Member States (cross-border links) were insufficient and major European transport axes presented significant gaps and lacked continuity; TEN-T infrastructure availability and quality diverged between eastern and western parts of Europe; missing connections with neighbouring and overseas countries had negative impacts on international trade flows that fed the European internal market. The network was fragmented in terms of infrastructure quality levels of transport modes and lacked appropriate \"multi-modal\" infrastructure, hampering connections between modes and the development of integrated services. Interoperability was insufficient. The level of integration of \"hard\" and \"intelligent\" infrastructure to enable decent telematics services within and between all modes was insufficient. Reasons for these persisting problems were identified in the Impact Assessment: An insufficient EU-level planning of the network and a spatial configuration that lacked a genuine European design. A predominantly bottom up approach to infrastructure development that no longer corresponded to the framework conditions (increasing mobility vs environmental and public budget constraints). An insufficient implementation of common standards. Lacking integration of binding rules for interoperability into the TEN-T. A limited cooperation among Member States in project implementation. A lack of sufficient priority setting and conditionality of TEN-T funding instruments. The Impact Assessment concluded that without EU intervention, these problems would continue to affect transport flows within the internal market and between the Union and third countries, to impair social, territorial and economic cohesion within the EU, to constrain smooth accessibility of all regions of the Union (including peripheral, insular and outermost regions) and to hamper the achievement of sustainability and efficiency objectives in transport (see below on the expected impacts and Annex 3 for details on how the situation might have developed without TEN-T). With the adoption of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 on Union Guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), the Union intended to reinforce the legal basis in order to overcome these problems and to further enhance this policy in view of its fundamental objectives enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 17 (TFEU). Description of the logic of the EU Intervention and its objectives 18 Taking the 2013 Impact Assessment as a starting point, this chapter describes the presumed logic underlying Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 (see Annex 4). It reflects the following categories, which have been endorsed by the Steering Group (see Annex 1) accompanying the main evaluation study and the overall evaluation process: General objectives of the 2013 TEN-T Regulation Expected outcomes (connected with specific objectives set out in the Regulation) Expected Outputs Actions needed Inputs needed General objectives On 21 December 2013, Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 on Union Guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network entered into force, about two years after the publication of the impact assessment and the submission of the Commission's proposal 19 . The TEN-T Regulation builds directly on Title XVI of the TFEU and abides to the fundamental objectives enshrined therein. Furthermore, it was guided by the Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area 20 (the 2011 Transport Policy White Paper setting out the overall EU Transport Strategy for the period until 2050) and the Europe 2020 strategy 21 (promoting sustainable and efficient transport as a cornerstone of sustainable growth and the flagship \"Resource efficient Europe\"). On this basis, the Regulation has aimed at generating positive impacts on the following overarching EU policy objectives: 1.To support the smooth functioning of the internal market; 2.To strengthen the social, economic and territorial cohesion of the Union; 3.To contribute to further economic growth and competitiveness in a global perspective as well as to sustainability. Specific objectives\/outcomes As an overarching objective TEN-T shall contribute to the creation of a single European transport area which is efficient and sustainable, increases the benefits for its users and supports inclusive growth and cohesion. These four specific objectives are further broken down as shown in the table below: Table 3: Specific objectives and targets underpinning them, laid down in Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 22 Specific objective \/outcome Contributing to efficient transport flows in the internal market Contributing to cohesion Contributing to sustainability of the TEN-T Enabling increased user benefits To be achieved through Removed bottlenecks and bridged missing links across the EU Geographically balanced infrastructure across the EU TEN-T modes which are socially and environmentally sustainable and contribute to environmental objectives Coherent and continuous infrastructure requirements as basis for high-quality, efficient and sustainable transport services in line with user needs Optimized interconnections and interoperability of national transport networks for all transport modes; Connectivity and accessibility for all EU regions Enhanced enabling conditions for zero and low emission transport along the TEN-T Infrastructure standards ensuring safe and secure transport Promotion of efficient, high quality transport contributing to economic growth; Reduced infrastructure quality gaps Enhanced sustainability and inclusiveness in economic terms Seamless mobility and accessibility for all passengers, with an additional focus on responses to natural and human-made disasters, unforeseen events etc. Enhanced connectivity between the EU and neighbouring and other third countries Better interconnection between long-distance, regional and local traffic Enabling efficient use of infrastructure and cost-efficient application of innovative technologies Source: Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013, own elaboration This matrix summarizes the four specific objectives of the TEN-T and the targets underpinning them, as set out in Article 4 of the TEN-T Regulation. However, this structuring must not be interpreted as a rigid attribution of individual targets to specific objectives. The four specific objectives of the Regulation - contributing to efficient transport flows in the internal market, contributing to cohesion, contributing to sustainability of the TEN-T and enabling increased user benefits - are intrinsically linked and complement one another. Taking the example of investments in cross-border railway infrastructures, it can be shown that these lead to more efficient transport flows benefitting the internal market and at the same time increase the sustainability of the transport system. Through improved connectivity, they also address the cohesion objective and benefit users through improved transport services. As such, there is no trade-off between the different objectives but rather complementarity. In an approach which builds on a reinforced integration of infrastructure and related transport policy objectives as a key towards the achievement of the challenging decarbonisation objectives of transport, this complementarity of the objectives creates synergies for the whole transport system. Outputs Pursuing these outcomes and specific objectives has been geared towards two key outputs of the initiative: 1.Two layers of the network structure The dual layer TEN-T structure comprises the comprehensive and the core network which display strong functional interrelations. They result from a coherent and transparent methodological approach, enable a resource efficient infrastructure management, as well as the provision of seamless and sustainable transport services of high quality and user benefit. While the core network is based on a more EU level approach based on major transport flows and key geographic criteria, the comprehensive network builds more a bottom up approach connecting national networks of the Member States. As such, both networks are complementary. In addition, the comprehensive network is the geographical basis for all related transport legislation (through its standards and requirements) and the reference base for EU funding from different sources. Figure 1: TEN-T core network for passenger rail to be completed by 2030 23 Source: Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 2.TEN-T Cooperation with neighbouring and third countries Agreements with neighbouring and third countries have been signed in order to support cooperation, notably with a view to connecting the TEN-T with infrastructure networks of neighbouring countries. Amongst the main outputs in this area have been the indicative extension of the TEN-T maps to neighbouring regions through adoption of Commission Delegated Regulations (see chapter 1). Besides this adoption of indicative TEN-T maps, policy cooperation with different geographical areas of the world includes inter alia exchanges of experience and common analysis on subjects of mutual interest. 2.2.Expected impacts (based on the 2011 Impact Assessment) In order to address the problems identified in the 2011 Impact Assessment substantial changes were introduced to the 2013 TEN-T guidelines. The main impacts, which were expected to be generated from these changes (notably the genuine, dual layer network approach, coherent infrastructure standards and requirements including for smart, innovative and more efficient infrastructure management, core network corridors as an implementation tool) are the following: Expected impacts on the transport sector: The changes were expected to lead to modal-shift towards the most sustainable modes of transport and to support a concentration of trans-national traffic and long-distance flows (freight and passengers) on major TEN-T axes as well as to enhance resource efficiency, both in infrastructure provision and use. Innovative information and management systems were expected to provide support for logistic functions, inter-modal integration and sustainable operation in order to establish competitive door-to-door transport chains in line with user needs. Increased multimodality and the introduction of the core network corridors was expected to contribute to a reduction in congestion. Expected impacts on the economy: the new TEN-T approach was expected to further enhance the infrastructural basis for economic operators and citizens to benefit from the internal market and the free movement; to help stimulating balanced economic development in all regions of the Union; to contribute to the global competitiveness of the Union through enhanced connections with third countries and to stimulate economic development in innovative sectors. Overall: to contribute to economic growth, both during infrastructure construction and, in the long-term, through improved connectivity and efficiency of trade flows within Europe and with the rest of the world. Expected impact on economic, social and territorial cohesion: The changes were expected to have positive impacts on connectivity and accessibility for all regions of the Union, including peripheral, outermost and insular regions with benefits for territorial, economic and social cohesion within the Union. Notably the new network structure, ensuring complementarity between the core and comprehensive network layers, aimed at strengthening cohesion. In this context, the development of TEN-T was expected to overcome remaining differences in network structure and quality between States joining the Union before or after 2004 respectively. Expected social impacts: the genuine network structure, including the introduction of coherent standards and enabling intelligent solutions, was expected to make a positive contribution to employment and jobs - not only in the short term through construction, but also long term through the enhanced efficiency of a real network. Furthermore, on the basis of the improved infrastructure policy, significant positive employment effects were expected in the transport sector overall, notably through the enabling of new service opportunities within and across all modes. Expected impacts on public health and safety: positive impacts were mainly expected through a reduction in road accidents (through higher infrastructure safety standards), the implementation of intelligent transport systems as well as by modal shift. Expected impact on climate change: Positive impacts were assumed to result especially from efficiency gains in the transport system overall brought by the new network structure, including its enhanced multi-modal basis and the promotion of sustainable modes, as well as by a more coordinated approach to project implementation within this network; by the promotion of more sustainable modes of transport, the implementation of intelligent transport systems and the stimulation of technological innovation in transport and infrastructure development. Expected impact on air pollution: Overall, the efficiency enhancements of the new TEN-T policy were expected to lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (see above, impact on climate change) and of other air pollutants. Congestion reduction, as a benefit of the new network structure and the related efficiency gains, was expected to significantly contribute to this objective. Furthermore, the promotion of \"greener\" transport solutions, notably through the deployment of infrastructure enabling the use of renewable energy sources, was expected to strengthen this impact. Expected impacts on energy use: These impacts were expected to be closely related to the impacts on climate change and air pollution, building on two pillars: efficiency gains and enabling cleaner vehicle technologies. Expected impact on noise emissions: It was expected that positive impacts could be achieved - despite, an increase in transport activity - through the implementation of higher quality transport infrastructure, the promotion of more silent vehicles and to some extent through modal shift. Expected impacts on land use and biodiversity: Transport projects may have negative effects on land use and biodiversity, resulting in particular from physical reduction of natural habitats, landscape fragmentation, migration barriers, collision of vehicles with animals, emissions of noise and air pollutants, changes to the water regime and others. However, the multi-modal core network \/ corridor approach, which is expected to lead to a concentration of traffic flows on major axes, was expected to contain these negative effects. Furthermore, at the level of individual projects, in any case the relevant EU legislation on environmental protection has to be complied with and, additionally, solutions which are generating positive environmental effects, are given increasing importance. 3.Implementation \/ state of Play Description of the current situation (progress between 2013 and 2020) Since the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 on 21 December 2013, significant progress has been made by Member States and a wide range of other public and private actors (transport infrastructure managers, regional and local authorities, transport industry etc.) to implement projects of common interest which contribute to the gradual completion of the core and comprehensive networks. As the short outline of TEN-T policy principles has shown, this trans-European network encompasses a broad scope of infrastructure fields. They range, for example, from the traditional railway infrastructure construction project to 'intelligent solutions' or to charging and refuelling infrastructure for low and zero emission mobility. The implementation efforts both time- and budget wise may vary significantly between the different project types. A major cross-border construction project, usually, requires long preparatory times for intergovernmental agreements, budgetary decisions, permitting and procurement procedures, technical studies etc. and it is implemented in phases. For these kind of projects, the seven-year evaluation period at stake may have seen the deployment of enormous efforts (planning, permitting, construction) while there is no direct impact felt yet (no new sections on the network, no new user services) as preparation, construction or testing are still ongoing. The reporting of impacts for example in terms of user benefits, modal shift and decarbonisation effects or economic development - remains therefore limited. Other project categories - of a shorter term nature - are implemented in large numbers and show more immediate effects. In the following, the current status of the implementation of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 shall be presented in two ways: A.through a general overview of the progress and further prospects of TEN-T implementation, including the overall status of projects along the nine core network corridors and B.through a specific demonstration of achievements or challenges in selected areas which illustrate the broad scope of TEN-T policy. The information in this part essentially builds on the following sources: The work concerning the nine (geographical) core network corridors and the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) as a horizontal core network priority, which is facilitated by European Coordinators, designated by the European Commission (in agreement with the Member States concerned, and after consulting the European Parliament and the Council) and who are acting on its name and behalf 24 . This coordination instrument at EU level was introduced in the 2013 Regulation in order to streamline the implementation of the core network. Secondly, the information is based on sectoral work within the Commission, specifically in the fields of inland navigation 25 and 'Alternative Fuel Infrastructure' 26 . Lastly, the findings of the study on 'National Plans and Programmes in Member States' with a view to TEN-T development have been drawn upon (see Chapter 4 'data sources'). A.General overview on the status and prospects of TEN-T implementation Member States' approaches to meeting TEN-T development objectives To enable the Commission to assess the status of network planning and implementation prospects for the TEN-T as a whole, Article 49(2) of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 obliges Member States to inform the Commission about their national plans and programs, drawn up with a view to the development of the trans-European transport network. Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 obliges Member States to fully implement their respective national sections of the network which - altogether - generate network benefits beyond the sum of gains at national level. From this perspective, as part of the TEN-T evaluation, a study was undertaken (see chapter 4 for details) which focused on two key questions: Are Member States (each of them individually) covering the corresponding TEN-T objectives, in their respective plans and programs, in a sufficient way? Are all major TEN sections \/ projects \"secured\", especially with regard to the 2030 completion target for the core network? Concerning the first question, it can be concluded that existing national plans and programs on transport infrastructure development vary significantly between Member States. Differences relate to time horizons (from very short term to up to 12-year perspectives), nature (legally binding or non-binding, master-plan type or more project based approach) or reference to TEN-T objectives (identifiability of projects etc.). This diversity, which is related to traditional national approaches, makes it a challenge for the Commission to monitor planning and implementation of the network in a harmonized way. In spite of this diversity in formal terms, the study results show that, de facto, TENT policy objectives and corresponding commitments by Member States, are reasonably well addressed in national planning and programming approaches. The TENtec information system and the systematic stock taking in the framework of the technical analysis of the core network corridors has helped the Commission overseeing the situation. Nevertheless, some way of ensuring more coherence and strengthening commitment could enhance effectiveness in TEN-T implementation. Member States' responses to the second question showed that, in spite of incoherence in the approaches to infrastructure planning and implementation, the key TEN-T policy milestone - the completion of the core network by 2030 - heads in the right direction: The analysis found that only between 5 and 10 major infrastructure construction projects are not covered in national plans. Between 40 and 50 projects out of the around 3000 projects of the project list face delays which may put at risk the achievement of the 2030 deadline, although most Member States concerned appear confident that they will be able to remedy this situation. Especially Cohesion States underline that their compliance with the deadline depends on the allocation of substantial contributions from the Cohesion Fund. A number of other projects - for justifiable reasons - are well underway but expected to be completed a few years after 2030. Even in case there are delays on certain sections, the investments and developments of the rest of the network remain useful as the development of infrastructure is a long-term activity and the benefits of such investments will be seen for very long time after finalisation. Setting a common deadline for the achievement of the core network has proven to be very useful in mobilising authorities and infrastructure managers, giving also more reassurance that individual investments on the network will yield higher benefits through network effects of investments on other sections on the network. Overall, this situation shows that the efforts made since 2013 to move from a fragmented project implementation approach towards a genuine Europe-wide network approach have been successful. The TEN-T has been a key framework for Member States to concentrate investment on. This alignment of national action with a common European objective can be seen as one of the principle achievements of this EU policy. The dual layer network approach Today the TEN-T network is based on a coherent EU-wide planning methodology that has been acknowledged by the MS. It consists of a dual layer network structure: The comprehensive network layer: The TEN-T Regulation (Chapter II) sets out a wide range of requirements, to be met by the infrastructure of the comprehensive network, so as to enable it to duly contribute to the above four specific objectives. Such requirements include, inter alia, binding rules on safety or interoperability, provisions on smart infrastructure equipment to generate telematics applications within and between all transport modes or infrastructural needs for the seamless integration of terminal infrastructure into the network. The core network layer: The core network must feature at least the same standards and requirements as the comprehensive network. In many cases, it is subject to higher standards and requirements both in terms of quality and capacity needs. Given the high concentration of cross-border traffic flows on the core network, its contribution to the expected outcomes \/ the achievement of the specific objectives of the TEN-T Regulation is particularly high. Therefore, its completion is of particular priority for the EU, its Member States and other public and private stakeholders. This clearly justifies the binding target year 2030. The overall status of TEN-T planning in Member States with regards to the coverage of TEN-T objectives and the completion deadline 2030 is described in chapter 3b. It is outlined there that TEN-T policy objectives and corresponding commitments by Member States, are reasonably well addressed in national planning and programming approaches and the completion of the core network by 2030 heads in the right direction (with only a small number of projects expected to miss this deadline see also point 4 below). The comprehensive network The TEN-T bring together networks of all transport modes. The geographical scope of the three land transport modes is shown in the following overview table for the 27 EU Member States 27 : Table 1: TEN-T network length by mode: comprehensive network TEN-T Railway network TEN-T Road network TEN-T Inland waterway network Length (km) 28 * 113.000 106.600 15.700 * The respective modal network lengths, as adopted with Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013, have been rounded up or off to hundred. The detailed network alignments are continuously monitored through the geographical information system TENtec, which is publicly accessible. The 'comprehensive network' referred to in Table 1 includes, besides rail, road and inland waterway connections, also ports, airports and multi-modal transport infrastructure. It serves as the geographical reference for EU legislation and policy objectives in relevant fields of transport. Such legislation concerns, inter alia, railway policy (with interoperability as a key pillar of TEN-T policy, or with the integration of Rail Freight Corridors), inland navigation (with the taking over of standards agreed upon in international agreements) or road safety (with the integration of relevant EU legislation). Amongst the transport policy related requirements of TEN-T infrastructure are features to enhance multi-modal transport solutions (e.g. equipment and accessibility of nodes) as well as smart infrastructure equipment to facilitate efficient infrastructure use. The particular importance of the 'comprehensive network' resides in its relatively dense structure as key basis for accessibility of all EU regions, in particular outermost regions recognised in article 349 TFEU 29 , as well as other peripheral and insular regions Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 foresees its full completion by 2050. The comprehensive network, through its geographical structure 30 as well as the set of infrastructure components, requirements and development priorities 31 provides the fundamental basis for the identification of 'projects of common interest'. Any project, which aims at filling a missing network link or at reaching common TEN-T infrastructure standards and requirements, is defined as a project of common interest 32 . Besides Member States, bearing the largest share of the responsibility, such projects may be identified, prepared, implemented and financed by any other relevant actor, depending on the projects' specific nature. While all projects of common interest have to comply with the requirements set out in the TEN-T Regulation, questions of detailed alignment, technical design, procedural approaches etc. belong to the respective national responsibility (subject to obedience to relevant EU legislation in fields such as interoperability, environmental protection etc.) In order to ensure steady implementation of such projects of common interest, striving towards the completion of the common European transport infrastructure network by 2050, a combination and concentration of financial efforts is needed at various levels: public and private, European and national. Projects of common interest may benefit from EU support under relevant EU financing instruments, notably the Connecting Europe Facility, the Cohesion Fund and the ERDF. The main responsibility for the implementation of TEN-T projects, however, has to be assumed by the Member States concerned and, as appropriate, other public and private actors. The core network The TEN-T core network has been designed on the basis of the comprehensive network, i.e. it is a \"selection\" of comprehensive network infrastructure 33 . While the planning of the comprehensive network was significantly building on a bottom-up method, the core network results from a Europe-wide planning method which combines economic and territorial criteria. The core network emphasizes the TEN-T infrastructure of highest importance for major international transport flows and for a balanced interconnection of all EU regions. It links the major cities and transport nodes as economic centres and key transhipment hubs. The heavy concentration of EU-wide transport flows makes the core network both a critical factor for the interaction of infrastructure and transport policy and a possible showcase for its success. Therefore, in a number of cases, Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 sets higher quality and capacity requirements than for the comprehensive network, and it sets a much more ambitious completion target, namely 2030. The following overview shows the scope of the core network in the 27 EU Member States 34 , as adopted by Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013, and it illustrates the extent of the upgrading and construction works needed for its full completion until 2030: Table 2: TEN-T core network length by mode and state of infrastructure Total length (km)* Existing infrastructure in line with core network standards and requirements Existing infrastructure, to be upgraded to core network standards 35 or for capacity extension 'Missing links' in core network Rail 63.100 32.800 22.000 8.300 Roads 47.800 33.700 10.800 2.300 Inland Waterways 15.800 36 14.000 900 900 *The respective modal infrastructure lengths, as adopted with Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013, have been rounded up or off to hundred. The detailed network alignments are continuously monitored through the geographical information system TENtec, which is publicly accessible. The necessary upgrading and new construction projects, including enhancements in transport nodes, represent a key challenge for the core network completion until 2030 and thereby of TEN-T policy overall. The coordinated and timely completion of these projects entails genuine opportunities and generates substantial benefits beyond nationally-focused infrastructure policies. It sets the direction for public and private investment in infrastructure construction and upgrading along the TEN-T and contributes to an efficient use of financial resources. At the same time, it stimulates and channels innovative solutions which enhance the sustainable and efficient functioning of the core network as a whole. All this makes TEN-T policy vital as enabler of seamless cross-border-mobility and transport for private and public users. Table 2 shows that there are differences in terms of reached compliances between the different transport modes. Indeed, there is far less non-compliant road infrastructure than rail or IWW infrastructure. This lies in the fact that a large part of the road core network was already existing upon the entry into force of the Regulation while this was less the case for rail and IWW. In addition, the standards required for road are far less ambitious than those for road. Core network corridors as the key instrument to stimulate and coordinate project implementation The revision of the TEN-T Regulation in 2013 introduced several instruments aimed at facilitating the implementation of the TEN-T as an integrated system. One of these tools are core network corridors (CNCs). The key objective of CNCs is to facilitate an efficient implementation of the core network, thereby concentrating in particular on a coordinated development of the TEN-T infrastructure (in particular cross-border sections and the removal of bottlenecks), the integration of transport modes as well as interoperability. In geographical terms, they cover nine corridors of a length between 3000 km (RhineAlpine) and more than 9000 km (ScandinavianMediterranean and Atlantic) 37 . In total, they represent between 70 and 80% of the core network overall. These corridors are complemented by two Horizontal Priorities, the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and the Motorways of the Sea concept (MoS) that support the network optimisation and which are both also supported by a respective European Coordinator. While MoS, 38 are introducing new intermodal maritime-based logistic chains, ERTMS deployment 39 is about introducing and enforcing a European wide rail traffic management, safety and signalling system. Since each of the geographical CNCs represents an \"extract\" of the core network with all its transport modes, nodes as well as standards and other requirements coordination needs are enormous. They reach from efforts to harmonising investment in key projects to stimulating soft initiatives; from ensuring the smooth interconnection of transport modes for effective multi-modality to the corridor-wide implementation of coherent infrastructure standards. This requires strong lead by the European Coordinator respectively concerned (see chapter 4 for details); it depends on active involvement of a wide range of stakeholders directly concerned by the challenges at stake; it calls for comprehensive technical analysis to underpin decisions, which is ensured by the Commission with the help of external expertise. The nine CNC (see figure 2 below) follow the most important long-distance transport flows along the core network. Integrating rail, road and (where available) inland waterway axes and connecting the major urban centres and transport nodes (ports, airports, terminals), they offer unique opportunities to enhance resource-efficient functionality and to advance sustainable transport solutions. This approach, aiming to optimise the functioning of the corridor for the benefit of major long-distance transport flows within the EU and beyond, allows to concentrate investment (public and private, including from EU sources) and to set priorities from a cross-national perspective. In work plans, published about every two years and approved by the Member States concerned, each European Coordinator takes stock of developments and defines action towards the respective corridor objectives until 2030. Since 2013, there have been rounds of exchanges with the TRAN Committee of the European Parliament on four work plan editions. Members of the European Parliament show strong interest in this process and support it in various ways. Figure 2: The nine TEN-T core network corridors Source: DG MOVE\/TENtec The CNC instrument has been implemented since the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 (see also chapter 5). Notably rail and inland waterway projects have been in the centre of the promotional efforts both in terms of coordination and financial support. Financial support has been, in the first instance, provided from the Connecting Europe Facility and the Cohesion Fund. Especially in countries eligible for Cohesion Fund support, corridor work has also helped filling major gaps on the road network. Particular emphasis of Coordinators' work has been placed on key cross-border projects of the core network such as the Lyon-Torino or Brenner base tunnel projects, the Fehmarn Belt fixed link, the Rail Baltica or the Seine Scheldt inland waterway project. Today, there is confidence that all these projects will be completed until 2030. Such a positive prospect would have been unthinkable without the steady efforts of the European Coordinators concerned. Although somewhat less in the limelight, European Coordinators have also been very successful in ensuring smooth connections between land transport and maritime and aviation infrastructure. The interconnection of maritime ports with rail, inland waterway and road links of the corridors, in particular, has been vital for their efficient overall functioning. Infrastructure quality enhancements in the transport nodes, such as maritime ports have also been in the focus of Coordinators' work. This has included infrastructure and equipment enabling smooth multi-modal operations, but also pilot action on alternative fuel infrastructure to contribute to cleaner transport solutions. Last but not least: An efficient and sustainable functioning of core network corridors is only possible when due attention is paid to urban nodes along these corridors. They are origin, destination or transit sites for most freight or passenger movements on the core network. In this respect, corridor work has included efforts to enhance TEN-T transit infrastructure in major cities. This contributed to reducing congestion, which has negative effects on both urban mobility and the corridor. Another key issue of corridor work in urban nodes relates to the inter-connection of TEN-T nodes, such as airports and rail stations or ports and the rail network. Finally, passenger hubs such as major TEN-T railway stations have been enhanced to facilitate transfer functions between long-distance and local or regional transport. Such last mile connections are key both from a quality and a sustainability perspective: The most modern high-speed railway line will give away benefits when not smoothly connected with the users' final destination. The latest version of the corridor work plans 40 consolidate the progress made with the development of the nine corridors since 2013. The work plans themselves and the analytical work underlying them show that a total of around 1200 projects have been completed along these corridors since 2013. They represent an overall investment of around 110 billion Euro 41 . In this context, it should be taken into account that 'projects' are defined from the perspective of organizational and procedural aspects in the Member State(s) concerned. This implies that a missing link on the TEN-T may be broken down in several such projects, and that the listing also includes a wide range of upgrading and quality enhancing projects of different type and size. Furthermore, it has to be kept in mind that given the long-term nature of TEN-T policy the cost of the completed projects cannot be directly attributed to the 20132020 period as implementation of part of the projects started before 2013. On the other hand, the cost overview neglects that fact that preparation on works are ongoing for other projects. Looking towards the 2030 horizon, the work plans and the studies underpinning them show that around 3000 projects remain to be completed along the core network corridors. European Coordinators are making continuous efforts to facilitate this work. In the majority of the cases, they assess that the prospect for reaching the objectives are sound. Some specific problems (including delays for administrative or financial reasons) call for reinforced efforts. Infrastructure upgrading to reach common standards as a key part of corridor work The quality enhancement of TEN-T infrastructure to reach the standards and requirements set out in the TEN-T Regulation is a major challenge towards the full completion of the core network until 2030. The status of the compliance of the TEN-T infrastructure with such requirements has been assessed in the technical analysis supporting the core network corridor activities. Its results are published in the work plans of the European Coordinators and have been summarized in the latest Progress Report on TEN-T Implementation 42 . Figure 3 gives an overview of this status (reporting date: end of 2017) for 13 important requirements. It has to be taken into consideration that this overview is not directly related to implementation activities during the evaluation period. It reflects the overall status of the infrastructure of the TEN-T as it was adopted with Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013. Large parts of this network were already existing; featuring the required quality levels at the time of the adoption of this Regulation (to a significant extent through TEN-T action under previous versions of the TEN-T Guidelines). The overview, concerning the nine core network corridors, shows that: For rail, the situation regarding binding infrastructure standards which are essential for the provision of continuous services along TEN-T corridors, is largely positive. This concerns especially electrification, the minimum line speed of 100 km\/h and the minimum axle load of 22,5 tons for freight lines as well as the nominal European track gauge of 1435 mm (between 86 and 100% compliance rate). A significant challenge remains the improvement of infrastructure to enable the operation of freight trains with at least 740 m length a key requirement to enhance the capacity for rail freight and thereby the potential for modal shift. Even more problematic is the situation regarding the track side deployment of the European Rail Traffic management System (ERTMS) a key condition for interoperability and the enhancement of safety and more efficient capacity use. For the TEN-T core network infrastructure in the inland waterway sector, 85% of the infrastructure meets the requirements of a minimum draught of 2.5 m and of a minimum height of 5.25 m under bridges. One of the major challenges for the future will be to ensure good navigability conditions on free flowing rivers, also because of increasingly frequent periods of extreme weather events. The high coverage of inland waterways with the European River Information Services (RIS) may contribute to address this problem, and in particular it improves safety, quality and efficiency of inland navigation. Figure 3: Compliance Status 2017 of main TEN-T requirements on the core network corridors 43 Source: Progress Report on TEN-T implementation 2016-2017 For road infrastructure, the TEN-T Regulation requires express road or motorway standard, which is achieved to 100%. Besides this requirement of a rather structural nature, the Regulation includes some specific quality related standards and requirements, such as compliance with EU legislation on road safety. It also requires equipment with safe and secure parking areas, traffic management (intelligent transport systems) as well as alternative fuel infrastructure. The status regarding safety standards will be assessed separately in this chapter. Concerning the infrastructural conditions to enhance multi-modal transport, a positive situation has been reached already with regard to the interconnection of ports to rail (89%). Nevertheless, in the light of the unprecedented challenges of decarbonisation, efforts may need to be accelerated also in the framework of a reviewed approach to the maritime dimension of TEN-T policy, which aims at a reinforced integration of shipping routes, ports and land corridors. Concerning the interconnection of airports with rail, the situation is less advanced at this stage. An area which clearly calls for more attention is the integration of airports in freight transport chains a need which has also become particularly evident in the Covid-19 situation. B.Selected areas illustrating specific challenges The filling of missing links 44 While many of the major infrastructure projects of the TEN-T underwent long periods of decision making and preparation without having got ready for use at the time of this evaluation, for others the long-lasting efforts have yielded results recently. An example is the high speed railway line between Berlin and Munich, which is part of the Scandinavian - Mediterranean Corridor. The project was conceived after the German reunification as one of the \"German unity transport projects\". The 10bn project was approved as early as in 1991 and includes the upgrade and new construction of railway lines between the two cities. First parts where inaugurated already in 2003 and the complete line was put in operation in December 2017. The project is cutting travel times between Munich and Berlin by more than 2 hours (from 6h to under 4h) making rail a viable alternative to air travel. Within one year of its operation rail passenger numbers between Berlin and Munich doubled making rail the dominant mode on the relation with a modal share of 46% (air 30%, car 24%) and saving a considerable amount of CO2. Significant contributions from the TEN-T funding programme and CEF have been made with co-funding rates of up to 20% for works on certain sections of the line since the mid-nineties. In summary this project shows on the one hand the complexity and time intensity of such major transport projects and on the other hand it showcases the concrete impact of EU and national investments into TEN-T and the direct benefits for citizens and the environment. Implementing the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) The overview in figure 3 above shows the extent of the efforts still needed to achieve the 2030 target in specific areas (only 11% compliance rate in 2017). In the light of this seemingly pessimistic status, however, the European Coordinator for ERTMS has set up work plan, which justifies confidence in the achievement of full ERTMS deployment by 2030, in line with the obligation enshrined in the TEN-T Regulation. ERTMS is a key pillar of the \"intelligent\" components of the TEN-T infrastructure. It is a communicating system which includes elements for the equipment of tracks and of rolling stock. Its key benefits include: Table 4: Key ERTMS benefits Objective Specific benefits Contributing to interoperability of railway transport along the TEN-T, as an objective enshrined in the TFEU and in relevant Technical Specifications on Interoperability 45 Enabling full and TEN-T-wide provision of seamless cross-border railway services; strengthening competitiveness of rail as a sustainable transport mode; stimulating competitiveness of EU industry in the supply sector Increasing capacity of the rail system ERTMS allows the reduction of minimum distances or times between trains, leading to capacity gains of up to 30%. Higher performance Reduced likelihood of failure; enhanced reliability of the system and punctuality of services Safety increase Increased overall protection level compared to the majority of national protection systems, thanks to continuous supervision of the speed of train While first discussions on the development of ERTMS started as early as 40 years ago, progress has been steady in an area where national systems have long-standing tradition and transition costs are high. In the 1990s and the first years of the new millennium, Europe spent significant efforts in Research and Development to make this system ready for deployment (Between 2007 and 2013, deployment was stimulated with EU Funds 1.2 billion Euro from TEN-T and Cohesion Fund together). ERTMS has become a big success story outside Europe already, with 51.000 km of lines being equipped on the trackside and 5180 vehicles being in operation or having been contracted as of 2020. Within the EU since the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013, more 5000 km of TEN-T tracks have been equipped with ERTMS along the nine core network corridors. The TEN-T Regulation stipulates full ERTMS deployment for the core network by 2030, and for the comprehensive network by 2050. In 2017, the European Commission adopted an ERTMS Deployment Plan which set deadlines for some sections of the core network corridors for the period 2017 2023. The measures to implement this plan included the attribution of new powers to the European Railway Agency, concerning the fields of trackside approval and vehicle authorization. Furthermore, as regards funding, 2.7 billion Euro (grants from the Connecting Europe Facility and the Cohesion Fund) were allocated to ERTMS between 2014 and 2020 which represents an increase of 125% compared to the previous funding period. This has been complemented by the introduction of innovative financing mechanisms (in 2017), which attracted notably projects for on-board equipment. Building on these plans and their implementation, the new European Coordinator, Matthias Ruete, was in a position to summarize in his work plan published in June 2020 46 , past progress and future objectives with regard to ERTMS equipment of the nine core network corridors as follows: Table 5: ERTMS deployment on the core network corridors 12\/2016 12\/2017 12\/2018 12\/2019 05\/2020 2023 (planned ) 2030 (planned ERTMS in operation 7 % 9 % 10 % 11% 12% 31% 97% Source: First work plan of the European Coordinator for ERTMS It shows that considerable efforts still need to be undertaken to reach compliance with the ERTMS requirements. To meet such challenges, the European Coordinator for ERTMS already made considerable efforts that ERTMS is finally widely accepted by Member States, rail infrastructure managers and rail operators. In addition, detailed milestones and objectives are laid down in the work plan of the European Coordinator which have been agreed upon with Member States. Overall, the work plan underlines that the achievement of this objective is vital for the transport sector overall to meet its zero and low emission objectives, as laid down in the European Green Deal, and not least to make a significant contribution to the digital transition in transport. At the same time, the Coordinator calls for reinforcement of the TEN-T Regulation to ensure achievement of the 2030 objective. This should notably address a reinforced focus on existing gaps and full implementation of highest track side standards as well as the appropriate encouragement of relevant on-board equipment of rolling stock. Inland Waterways in TEN-T The TEN-T inland waterway network consists to a large extent of free flowing rivers and to a smaller extent of canals. For inland waterway transport, coherent infrastructure standards are a key condition for smooth transport operations which cross to a large extent national borders. Besides rail, well performing inland waterways are vital for the shift of long-distance freight transport to sustainable modes. However, in spite of the fact that 85% of the TEN-T inland waterway infrastructure (including locks, bridges etc.) meets key requirements of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 (including through implementation efforts before 2013), performance of inland navigation does not achieve its full potential, notably for the following reason: The current parameters for Inland Waterway Infrastructure (see above, table 3) do not guarantee coherent performance for all waterway stretches, as waterways in Europe are characterised by a heterogeneous hydro-morphology. This suggests that \"navigability\" could be more appropriate as a TEN-T parameter in order to enable the provision of good continuous navigation services along waterways. An Expert Group set up by the Commission assesses needs for an adjusted approach. It addresses both a more mode-specific solution on infrastructure and its complementing with \"navigability\" requirements. Especially the long draught period in 2018 led to a sharp drop in inland waterway transport on all major TEN-T inland waterways. This calls for a more tailored solution beyond fixed and uniform inland waterway standards. Infrastructure requirements such as the depth of the navigable channel and the clearance under bridges, which refer to reference water levels, may require more flexibility. Increasing attention may also need to be given to locks and movable bridge availability. The level of flexibility related to Good Navigation Status can be matched with coherent performance through the definition of a non-deterioration and protection principles for navigable channel depth, bridge height and lock availability, the full use of River Information Services or an adequate density of inland ports in order to ensure that target values are not falling below the values implemented today by Member States but help to shift more freight transport to inland waterways. Enhancing road safety Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 integrated relevant legislation, setting binding standards for the safety of the TEN-T Road Network. This included: The Road Infrastructure Safety Management (RISM) Directive 47 which sets requirements for audits (of new roads), inspections and hot spot identification (of existing roads). The 2019 revision of this Directive 48 extended these provisions, having proven to be very successful on the TEN-T, to other major EU roads. For TEN-T roads, it brought an additional quality requirement, namely the obligation for Member States to carry out network-wide safety risk assessments which must feed into a prioritised action plan. This enhanced TEN-T standard, related to the revised RISM Directive, is expected to save 3 200 lives and prevent 20 700 serious injuries by 2030. The Tunnel Safety Directive 49 which sets minimum safety requirements for road tunnels on the TEN-T and clarifies the organisation of safety management and operating procedures for tunnels. As these provisions were introduced in response to a number of serious crashes in major EU road tunnels in recent decades, it can be assumed that the new binding standards have helped avoiding accidents. Overall, TEN-T policy has triggered substantial investment in the safety of road infrastructure (refurbishment, safety upgrading of existing roads etc.) and not least the filling of missing links, leading to significant safety enhancements especially in newer Member States. Support from EU sources, including from the Cohesion Fund and EIB loans, has been important in this respect. Road safety related TEN-T action has clearly helped to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries. It contributed to the 43% decrease of road death in Europe between 2010 and 2019, in spite of increasing mobility. However, 22,800 people still lost their lives on EU roads in 2019 and about 135,000 were seriously injured. To achieve the EU's ambitious \"Vision Zero\" objectives by 2050, measures in the TEN-T need to be further significantly reinforced. The digital transition, one of the key pillars to be reinforced in the future TEN-T policy, may significantly contribute to this objective. Promoting charging and refuelling infrastructure for zero and low emission mobility Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 includes the objective of promoting low carbon transport. As one important measure to help achieving this objective, it stipulates the provision of infrastructure to facilitate the energy supply for alternative propulsion systems. These provisions address notably electricity supply systems for road transport as well as Liquid Natural Gas (LNG), inter alia in the maritime sector. An EU Directive concerning the deployment of alternative fuel infrastructure with a close connection to the TEN-T infrastructure was adopted 10 months after the entry into force of the TEN-T Regulation (AFID) 50 . This Directive sets certain requirements for the equipment of TEN-T infrastructure, which had to be reflected in relevant National Policy Frameworks. The provisions of the TEN-T Regulation, aiming to stimulate and facilitate developments in this area, allowed for the first time in TEN-T policy for EU funding of relevant projects under the Connecting Europe Facility. This resulted in a considerable number of projects - both on e-mobility and alternative fuel solutions having been supported since 2014. In the e-mobility sector, for example, the following pilot actions mobilized actors across national borders and helped paving the way for a clean mobility future: A study on a pilot deployment of 29 multi-standard fast chargers along the TEN-T corridors in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, gathering data about market needs, the planning of charger networks and the link with ICT solutions (aiming at an Electric Vehicle Rollout Masterplan for the two States); a study and pilot deployment of 38 fast charging stations along TEN-T corridors in Belgium, France, Italy and the United Kingdom (focusing on issues of interoperability in an EU-wide non-proprietary open standard system as well as on EU-wide business readiness). Pilot deployment of 85 multi-standard fast charging stations along TEN-T corridors in Poland and Slovakia, addressing the issue of battery storage to cover peak demand, interoperability in terms of roaming and customer service management and business models (see figure 4 below). A study and pilot deployment of 221 multi-standard fast charging stations along TEN-T corridors in Germany in Belgium to stimulate an increased coverage of chargers in these States, in view of future roll-out; including the development of an open source ICT-platform across the entire electric vehicles' value chain to facilitate integrated end-to-end services, available to all market participants. Figure 4: Promotion of re-charging infrastructure for e-mobility in Eastern Europe Overall, these actions mirror the advancement of electro-mobility charging infrastructure along the TEN-T during the period 2014 2020 through pilot action, towards the preparation for mass markets. Under point 5, more details are provided on the effectiveness of TEN-T action during the evaluation period in terms of broad scale deployment. This development, however, has now reached a point where further progress towards the ambitious EU commitments for zero and low emission mobility is hampered by the lack of binding standards for charging and refuelling infrastructure for all modes along the TEN-T. Standards, aligned with the ongoing revision of the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive as well as the FuelEU Maritime and the ReFuelEU Aviation initiatives, are expected to strengthen cross-border continuity and to facilitate and accelerate coherent implementation, facilitated by the European Coordinators. 4.Method Short description of methodology and data sources The evaluation of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 on Union Guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network started in September 2018 with the publication of the evaluation Roadmap. An Inter-service steering group accompanied and oversaw the exercise (details in Annex 1). The evaluation builds in particular on the Support study for the TEN-T evaluation by Coffey consultants 51 , on the support study for the TEN-T policy review, by Panteia 52 and experiences in implementing Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013 notably the work carried out in the framework of the core network corridors since 2013. A standard triangulation approach was applied to address the evaluation questions, through different angles: desk research, interviews and surveys. Baseline: The aim for developing the baseline scenario is to assess what would happen in the medium (2030) and long-term (2050) if the TEN-T core and comprehensive network did not develop. The starting point for developing the baseline scenario has been the baseline scenario underpinning the Impact Assessment accompanying the revision of the TEN-T Regulation 53 . Building on this scenario, the macro-economic and technological assumptions have been updated in line with those used for the modelling underpinning the strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy by 2050 (LTS\/Clean Planet for All communication). In addition, policy measures adopted by the end of 2019 have been considered in the baseline scenario, except for the implementation of the TEN-T regulation. In addition, a counter-factual scenario has been developed that assumes the completion of the TEN-T core and comprehensive network. By comparing the two scenarios, this shows the impacts of the revised TEN-T regulation. 1.Evaluation support study 54 The main evaluation study was launched in April 2019 and builds on two pillars: Desk research as well as open and targeted stakeholder consultations. Desk research: an in-depth desk-based review of existing literature and data (global desk research) relevant to the evaluation topics was carried out collecting and analysing data from: Legal documents, including relevant Directives, Regulations, Delegated Regulations and legislative proposals; Studies, documents, work programmes, reports, evaluations and impact assessments linked to TEN-T policy and funding; Existing data\/statistics available at national and EU level; Additional sources retrieved through the exploratory interviews and an initial mapping exercise. Open Public Consultation: the Commission as the first step of the formal revision process between the 24th of April and the 17th of July 2019 carried out an Open Public consultation. The questionnaire was available in all official EU languages. This consultation generated more than 600 responses from a wide range of stakeholders, including public authorities (from international to local), infrastructure managers, commercial transport users, civil society and citizens. Importantly, more than 150 stakeholders - including a number of Member States and key European Associations - used this initial step already to submit position papers highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the policy and notably its future opportunities and needs. The OPC results were analysed in detail by Coffey consult and fed into the overall evaluation process. Targeted stakeholder consultations: the approach to consult expert stakeholders designed by the consultant consisted of three main elements: online surveys, interviews and case studies on issues of specific importance. The aim of the targeted consultations was to collect data from specific stakeholder groups at local, national and EU level. It has to be underlined that this evaluation report presents the stakeholder views at an aggregate level. Generally, stakeholder views showed a very coherent perception of views and no noteworthy distinction could be found between different stakeholder groups, unless otherwise specified in this report. Online surveys: A survey questionnaire (global survey) was designed on the basis of the revised evaluation questions matrix and preliminary findings from the tasks carried out as part of the inception phase. It has been implemented between 20 January and 16 March 2020 in order to collect data on stakeholders' perceptions of and experiences with the TEN-T Regulation, its implementation and outcomes to date, and their views on recommendations for future EU policy developments in this area. Overall, more than 2000 stakeholders with expertise in the subjects at stake have been contacted for online surveys. In total 198 valid responses were received. Part of the stakeholders had used the OPC phase already for elaborate and consolidated contributions (e.g. European Associations having sought common positions amongst their members in targeted conferences.) In other areas (e.g. commercial infrastructure users), the involvement through more specific questions triggered significant response rates at the stage of the targeted consultation. Interviews: In total 44 stakeholders have been interviewed (global interviews) with cross-sections of respondents to the survey and representatives of relevant stakeholder groups. A discussion guide for the interviews has been tailored to the stakeholders interviewed. The main aim of these semi-structured interviews was to gain in-depth insights into the implementation of the TEN-T Regulation, progress achieved and success factors\/challenges from the perspective of different stakeholders. The global interviews complemented the desk research, open public consultation and global survey to explain the quantitative data obtained and fill in any gaps, support the thematic case studies, and elaborate on key issues where data from other sources were unclear or needed further explanation. Specific interview guide modules and samples have been developed for each case study. Case studies: In addition to the general evaluation of the TEN-T Regulation the contractor has designed and implemented nine thematic case studies on selected TEN-T policy areas (for details see Annex 2). They were undertaken in areas in which the Commission's work during the implementation phase of the TEN-T Regulation has produced evidence that there might be a lack of relevance, both in light of developments over the last years and of foreseeable future developments. Each case study has been tailored to address specific evaluation questions and issues, which were further reviewed and updated during the inception and interim phases. The approach to each case study included a combination of desk review of secondary sources, specific survey modules, in-depth interviews and discussions with relevant stakeholders (which complemented the global interviews and global survey carried out as part of the consultation). Three online workshops with stakeholders comprising EU officials, transport stakeholders and social partners have been developed and implemented to validate the findings, and to discuss conclusions and recommendations of case studies 1 (urban), 6 (digitalisation) and 7 (innovation and new technologies). The format and content of the workshops follow an introductory webinar, consultation via an online bulletin board, and a wrap-up session to consolidate the feedback received. Representative examples: In the light of the complexity of the policy, representative examples have been chosen at several instances in the report to illustrate the implementation state of play to date. Those representative examples can be seen as an illustrative evidence of the effectiveness of the Regulation. The large consultation programme involving all relevant stakeholders provides for a robust and cross-checked evidence base for this evaluation. 2.Core network corridor process As laid out in chapter 3 above, Article 45 of the TEN-T Regulation states that in order to facilitate the coordinated implementation of core network corridors, ERTMS and motorways of the sea, the Commission shall, in agreement with the Member States concerned, and after consulting the European Parliament and the Council, designate European Coordinators. The work of the Coordinators and the corridor process have allowed the Commission to gain a very detailed overview of the status of TEN-T implementation along the core network corridors and has given stakeholders the possibility to be directly engaged in this process. It has brought authorities and stakeholders from different Member States together who were not necessarily or sufficiently exchanging about the developments in their network. In addition, the Corridor Forum meetings have gathered representatives of different transport modes around one table to discuss about the respective needs and challenges. Since 2013, the European Coordinators have drawn up four iterations of corridor work plans 55 (based on Art. 47) for each corridor as well as detailed implementation plans for ERTMS 56 and MoS 57 giving an overview of corridor development, identifying gaps and bottlenecks and setting the priorities for the future. The Corridor Work Plans are unique instruments in that they provide transparency on the situation on the corridors, the projects which are ongoing and planned, and even the need to foresee further projects in order to achieve compliance with the standards. The work plans are informed by an in-depth analysis of external consultants that maps the advancement of the corridors according to the TEN-T parameters. Stakeholders have been involved all along the way especially via the corridor fora (based on Art. 46) that bring together representatives of member states, regions, ports, airports, road\/rail infrastructure managers, terminal operators etc. In total, 15 such meetings have been held so far. In addition, Coordinators have set up dedicated working groups looking more in detail into specific issues along their corridors (urban nodes, ports, airports, roads, railways, maritime, cross-border cooperation etc.). Beyond the work in the Corridor Forum and the working groups, the Coordinators have been instrumental in engaging with stakeholders and national decision makers (meetings with ministers, site visits, seminars etc.). Their work has already led to the adoption of three implementing decisions on crucial cross border projects (see efficiency section). Finally, the Coordinators regularly hold seminars between themselves and DG MOVE to exchange on best practices along their respective corridors and to provide policy input to the DG. 3.TENtec TENtec is the database for the monitoring of infrastructure development on the TEN-T network. It shows for instance the compliance of the network for a high number of indicators. The latest data introduced in this system is however from 2017\/2018. TENtec is the main source for the corridor work plans and the TEN-T implementation report which have been widely used in this evaluation. 4.In-house activities and working groups Numerous activities across the modes of transport that have been and currently are ongoing within DG MOVE, have a direct Impact on TEN-T and consequently have fuelled this evaluation exercise. This is for example, the work with regards to alternative fuels where an impact assessment is currently ongoing or the work on the Rail Freight Corridors, the ITS Directive and on urban mobility currently being evaluated as well as the work on Road Safety with two new initiatives recently adopted. Furthermore the evaluation has been drawing on the work of various modal working groups such as the Digital Inland Navigation Area DINA expert group, the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum DTLF or the NAIADES sub-group on Good Navigation Status GNS sub group. Different reports of the European Court of Auditors have equally been taken into account in the evaluation this concerns in particular: the 2016 report on maritime transport 58 , the 2018 report on a European high-speed rail network 59 , the 2020 report on EU transport infrastructures 60 and the 2020 report on the EU road network 61 . 5.Support study on relevant national plans and programs in Member States 62 The general objective of the study has been to assess the national transport and infrastructure plans and programmes of Member States and to examine in how far they are coherent with and aligned to TEN-T objectives and implementation. In a first step the study compiled information on the status of national transport plans and programmes and established an overview of national planning systems through a comprehensive desk research. The second step consisted of an in-depth assessment of national plans and programmes in each individual EU Member State. Main questions answered have been: Are national plans and programmes (including corresponding financing decisions) duly reflecting the obligations under the TEN-T Regulation with regard to network planning and implementation? Is the TEN-T notably the core network sufficiently covered by national planning and programming? Based on the previous aspects, what are \"good practice\" approaches? Where are the gaps and which factors are underlying these gaps? The review and assessment of the national plans and programmes has been complemented by a survey addressed to all member states to validate the findings. Limitations and robustness of findings The main limitation of the evaluation lies in the complexity of the TEN-T policy e.g. through its integrated approach to address all transport modes, in the huge number of projects to be implemented to reach the TEN-T goals and in the variety of their nature as well as in the long-term vision of TEN-T policy (2030\/2050 deadlines). Indeed, decisions and regulations during the evaluated period of 2013-2020 have covered only a limited period of time which represent just an \"extract\" of the way to go to reach full completion of the TEN-T network. In return, this makes it often difficult to define clear-cut results for the specific evaluation period (i.e. 2013-2020) as project preparation and implementation has started sometimes well before 2013 and will continuously go on until 2030\/2050. Moreover, the broad scope of the Regulation i.e. its applicability to all member states, to all modes of transport, different technologies and infrastructure standards leads to a huge amount of available literature and diversity of data sources. Consequently there is also a large number of stakeholders involved with naturally diverging interests and views on the functioning of the Regulation. This diversity in data sources and viewpoints posed a challenge when synthesizing findings into a coherent narrative especially with a view to incorporating the case study findings. Thus the consultants used a systematic and iterative approach to data collection, quality control, analysis, validation, triangulation and synthesis which the Commission complemented with its own analysis. This should help mitigating the effects of different types of bias, help resolve contradictions in the analysis or provide a transparent means of explaining why they occur. Public consultations A general problem throughout the consultation activities has occurred due to the fact that this evaluation, as outlined earlier, is carried out at the half way point between the entry into force of the regulation and the first major milestone in 2030 (completion deadline for the core network). Thus stakeholders, in view of the 2030 deadline, found it difficult to make a mere backward looking assessment of the provisions of the regulation and tended to rather make suggestions for future changes, thus diminishing the evaluative value of their responses. The open public consultation A challenge with public consultations is that they may have limited evaluative value due to the self-selection of respondents and often uneven or skewed participation in the survey from different stakeholder groups and\/or countries. In order to mitigate any potential bias in the findings, the consultant has taken due care when using the results of the public consultation in the final evaluation report. This included the assessment of the need for weighting techniques and triangulating the responses to the public consultation with results obtained from the evaluation surveys, interviews and case studies. In addition, the wording of some questions introduced a bias in the responses provided. Typically, the yes \/ no questions can bias the results as it looks like the responses are positive or negative. In open questions, it was noticed that some respondents provided the exact same response. This seemed to indicate that stakeholders belonging to the same organisation (e.g.) were consulting on the position to put forward in the OPC. Lastly, the OPC generated a very high volume of responses. This reflects the strategic interest in the TEN-T and in the consultation on its key features. But the large number of answers, the number and lengthiness of open-ended questions, as well as the lack of structure of the answers to open-ended questions proved to be an additional challenge in processing the data and ensuring the analysis took into consideration all important aspects mentioned by respondents. 5.Analysis and answers to the evaluation questions 5.1.Relevance Relevance looks at the relationship between the needs and problems that a particular intervention aims to address. The evaluation aims to establish that the intervention, in this case the TEN-T Regulation, is appropriate to address identified needs both when the intervention was first adopted in 2013 and when it is being evaluated. The evaluation questions also explore how fit the Regulation seems to be to tackle future and foreseeable challenges. 5.1.1.Evaluation Question 1: To what extent are the specific objectives set in the TEN-T Regulation still relevant to achieve the general objective of the TEN-T policy, as set out in the TFEU, as well as broader transport policy objectives? To what extent correspond these objectives to current needs, and in how far does the development of the core and comprehensive networks - contribute to their achievement? The four specific objectives of the TEN-T Regulation, as outlined in point 2, derive directly from the general TEN-T policy objectives established in the TFEU. Their relevance with regard to current problems and needs has been a key element of the assessment undertaken in the main evaluation study, with the global desk research, surveys and interviews having paid significant attention to it. Reactions to the Open Public Consultation, especially in a large number of position papers, also contributed to this assessment. Not least, the various activities led by the Commission in analysing, monitoring and promoting the implementation of TEN-T policy under Regulation N 1315\/2013 as well its interrelation with other relevant transport policy action generated rich evidence of the strengths and weaknesses in relation to the four specific objectives. Overall, the benchmark for the relevance of the specific objectives as well as for the targets and measure underpinning them, is the contribution to the development of the core and comprehensive network layers. The specific objective: Efficiency of the infrastructure network in support of the functioning of the internal market Stakeholders agree with the continuous relevance of TEN-T policy in facilitating and enhancing transport flows within the Internal Market - in an inclusive way that involves all regions of the Union and in supporting broader transport policy objectives. For example, about two third of the respondents to the Open Public Consultation found that TEN-T policy has positively contributed to the facilitation of the free movement of citizens and goods. This outcome is underpinned by the Commission's own experience, gained in comprehensive technical analysis and in expert meetings, conferences and other dialogues with the wide range of stakeholders involved in TEN-T policy. The focus on the interconnection and interoperability of national networks, the integration and interconnection of all transport modes as well as the removal of bottlenecks and missing links remains fully relevant. This is continuously confirmed by Member States, transport infrastructure managers, regional \/ local authorities and other stakeholders: They participate actively and support strongly all action related to core network corridors which concentrates on such issues. Also, the findings of the study on National Plans and Programs in Member States document through Member States' commitment to address TEN-T bottlenecks and missing links in their national infrastructure planning, programming and financing processes the relevance of this specific objective. This is also underpinned by the agreement, in the targeted stakeholder consultation (84% of respondents), that the concentration of support from EU Financial Instruments (notably the Connecting Europe Facility and the Cohesion Fund) on bottlenecks and missing links of the TEN-T has been appropriate. While there is thus broad agreement with the relevance of the direction the TEN-T Regulation sets for a coherent and concentrated development of transport infrastructure towards the completion of the core and comprehensive networks by 2030 and 2050, desk research, stakeholder consultations (including specific case studies) and relevant expert work of the Commission also point to certain areas where current problems call for adjustment of provisions. In the light of the huge number of projects to be implemented to ensure timely completion in the first instance - of the core network, and the increasing connection with sustainability objectives and an enhanced user perspective, analytical and governance tools may need to be strengthened. This should also contribute to further enhancing coordination between actors across geographical border and sectors. Not least, this should help addressing concerns raised by the European Court of Auditors. Concerning urban nodes in TEN-T policy: A very large number of stakeholders both in the specific case study (n 1) as well as in all forms of open and targeted consultations (overwhelmingly regional and local authorities, furthermore various user groups, both in the passengers and freight sectors, mobility service providers, transport planners, NGOs (in fields such as people with reduced mobility or environmental protection, climate change, active transport promotion), industry in innovative sectors including zero and low emission mobility and others call firmly for increased attention being given to the integration of urban nodes' action in TEN-T policy. Presupposing the successful implementation of this area in TEN-T policy since 2013 (see EQ 4), they claim advancement of the provisions of the Regulation to meet current needs and more importantly be ready for future challenges. Sources refer to insufficient relevance, notably in the light of new challenges such as decarbonisation, digitalisation\/innovation, demographic change, inclusiveness, efficiency and territorial cohesion. Case study n 1 evaluated a wide range of urban nodes of different size, geographical location and socio-economic importance, while paying particular attention to their functionality from a TEN-T perspective. Its key conclusion was the insufficient complementarity between TEN-T policy and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans, including their innovative dimension. Furthermore, the case study called for more openness about the number of urban nodes to be addressed with TEN-T policy. The area of urban nodes also clearly demonstrates the interrelation between the four specific objectives as the provisions on urban nodes are relevant for i) the completion of infrastructure projects within the network, ii) the enhanced accessibility of all regions though urban nodes transfer function between long distance and regional \/ local networks, iii) sustainability through complementarity with urban mobility \/ urban innovation and iv) improved user benefits through the enabling of seamless mobility solutions. The specific objective: Cohesion The objective of cohesion is equally addressed through the actions and efforts outlined in the efficiency chapter above. Member States and a wide range of other stakeholders with a strong direct interest in the territorial, economic and social cohesion are fully committed to these broad and common efforts. The alignment of EU support under the Connecting Europe Facility and the Cohesion Fund under the common TEN-T policy objective is essential in this respect. However, there have been calls in the Open Public Consultation, the Targeted Stakeholder Consultation and in various expert fora to reinforce provisions for accessibility of the most remote EU regions the outermost regions recognised by art 349 TFEU as well as peripheral and insular regions. Accessibility and connectivity of such regions can also be enhanced by expanding TEN-T policy on urban nodes to the comprehensive network, as highlighted in case study n 1. Also the Own Initiative Report of the European Parliament on the revision of the TEN-T regards it as important to \"further develop the TEN-T to focus on the interconnection between the core and comprehensive networks in rural, peripheral and outermost regions 63 and islands\". 64 Regional needs in general were highlighted by certain stakeholders as an area to be better reflected. The importance of further strengthening cohesion between Member States with different economic power was recalled as was the need to make better use of the economic potential of peripheral regions. Responding to such issues seems to be a matter of both strengthening specific targets, reinforcing the implementation of the current objectives and strengthening coherence between TEN-T and Regional Policies including the outermost regions' policy which commits the Commission to \"better meet the outermost regions accessibility needs and facilitate their participation in the Trans European Transport Network\". 65 The specific objective: Sustainability The specific objective of sustainability aims at ensuring an efficient transport infrastructure in Europe while at the same time enabling low carbon and clean transport. The findings of the literature review highlighted the indispensable role played by the TEN-T Regulation as an enabler for decarbonisation of the transport system as a whole. Projections show that the completion of the Core Network Corridors could lead to significant CO2 reduction from 2015 - 2030. The literature also points out that the completion of projects along the TEN-T corridors stimulates modal shift, especially through the implementation of major rail and inland waterway projects, as well as through the enhancement of a multi-modal transport network and the inclusion of components such as alternative fuels infrastructure, intelligent and innovative transport systems, etc. 66 However, the modal shift in practice will only be achieved once the projects are finalised, especially for the major cross-border projects which can be seen as a game changer in making modal shift possible. About one third of the respondents of the stakeholder consultation, however, believe that the relevance of the provisions underpinning the \"sustainability objective\" are insufficient in the light of new climate targets, notably those as set in the European Green Deal 67 , the European Strategy for Low-Emission Mobility 68 and the Climate Target Plan. In strengthening the relevance of the TEN-T objectives in this respect, particular importance should be given to the full and binding equipment of TEN-T infrastructure with charging and refuelling infrastructure for zero and low emission vehicles, aircrafts and vessels. This need for adjustment of the sustainability objective is expressly underpinned by the new political priorities of the European Commission, and also by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). An adjustment of objectives on TEN-T urban nodes, which are hotspots for greenhouse gas and other harmful emissions, also further supports the sustainability objective. The specific objective: Benefits for users Stakeholders seem to be less in agreement that TEN-T policy objectives address the current and foreseeable infrastructure needs from the perspective of users (34% in the targeted survey disagreed or strongly disagreed). Interviewees noted that TEN-T policy should take a more nuanced approach to meeting user needs by catering to different categories of users, both commercial and individual. Also case study n 8 (on enabling passenger services) clearly supports this assessment. According to this evidence, and not least to a variety of expert work undertaken by the Commission (in fields such as freight logistics, sustainable mobility, passenger rights), TEN-T infrastructure lacks appropriateness to enable in a better integrated way - seamless, sustainable and efficient freight logistics and mobility chains for passengers. This should take account of innovative technological solutions and changing user expectations. Furthermore as confirmed in the urban nodes' case study, it should also include seamless 'last mile connections for TEN-T users, including with active transport modes. Network structure The TEN-T, consisting of the comprehensive and core network layers which result from a single European a planning methodology 69 , constitutes the key output of TEN-T policy. It can be seen as unanimously accepted by Member States and stakeholders, and their planning and programming since 2013 - towards the 2030 \/ 2050 - has been geared to this network. Not least, the dual layer network structure is in the centre of a wide range of EU action. Departing from it now would negate significant value generated from efforts spent so far. Given the role of the TEN-T as an important reference basis for various EU legislation on transport, significant network changes could also entail legal ambiguities. Significant changes to the network would not only hamper the value of the investments and connectivity gains already realised but would also very likely reduce the economic and employment benefits assessed for the completed network (see question n 4). On the other hand, minor network adjustments - compliant with the methodology applied for the 2013 network design - may be justified. Changing transport flows (for example in relation to the UK's decision to withdraw from EU membership or changing global transport flows) may entail a need for network adjustment in order to avoid economic loss for the Union or part of its Member States. Findings from the desk research underline the importance of the comprehensive network in reaching greater territorial cohesion and linking peripheral, insular and outermost European regions. According to the Passenger Transport Executive Group 70 , the comprehensive layer of the TEN-T is essential to ensure the access function of the core network, being crucial for easing congestion as well as for reaching other overarching objectives set out in the TEN-T Regulation. 5.1.2.Evaluation Question 2: explores the appropriateness of the Regulation to respond to new technological needs (in particular in relation to the digital transition), to the demand for new mobility solutions, to the uptake of research and innovation results as well as to the adaptability to changing trends and needs This question, both with regard to the relevance of the TEN-T Regulation in relation to the needs and problems faced between 2013 and 2020, as well as to foreseeable future needs, has been covered by the global survey and interviews of the main evaluation study. In the first instance, however, this question has been in the centre of two specific case studies undertaken in the context of this evaluation study: n 4 on the TEN-T as an enabler of a future-oriented mobility system and n 6 on Digitalisation. The findings of these \"external\" assessments are complemented by some reference to related internal work of the Commission. Megatrends, such as climate change, demographic and technological change, including increased digitalisation and automation, bring significant opportunities to the mobility. Some fast-moving trends in those areas have emerged since the current version of the TEN-T Regulation entered into force in 2013. They are expected to gain pace in the future. The evaluation acknowledges the key role of the TEN-T Regulation in enabling transport solutions, and in this respect, its capacity to keep abreast with new trends and developments requires in-depth assessment. The literature review, undertaken in the framework of the evaluation support study, suggests that transport activity and mobility of passengers and transport of goods will increase further in the years to come. TEN-T policy tries to owe up to these developments by focussing on two main areas: a) the full and timely completion of the core and comprehensive network in its physical dimension (i.e. the removal of bottlenecks and missing links, interconnection of modes, interoperability) and b) new and innovative solutions (technological and organisational) along this full-scale network. This should enable step changes in transport and mobility for freight and passengers, thereby making substantial contributions to the sector's ambitious objectives on greenhouse gas emission reduction. Respondents to the Open Public Consultation for example, expressed the view that TEN-T policy still has to deal, to a large extent, with more \"traditional\" infrastructure in order to complete the physical network. At the same time, foresight experts saw a need to focus more on the digital layer of infrastructure in the future as this could significantly help to make a better use of existing infrastructure. TEN-T policy and digitalisation Looking into the appropriateness of the current TEN-T Regulation for digitalisation, the assessment found that the objectives and provisions of Regulation N 1315\/2013 TEN-T Regulation have already enabled the deployment of a wide range of digital projects in all transport sectors. It has allowed to promote a number of projects at EU level (with the support of CEF funding) which are intended to pave the way towards a more systematic approach to digitalization in TEN-T, aligned with relevant objectives in broader transport policy and other related policy fields. Regarding digitalisation, the case study (including desk research, interviews and an expert workshop), looks into projects across the different transport modes, which are referred to in the TEN-T Regulation (Article 31) as \"telematics applications\", and which have been subject to significant CEF support under its 'horizontal priorities'. These projects include the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS), the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR), the Vessel Traffic Management and Information System (VTMIS), River Information Services (RIS) as well as projects in the field of Intelligent Transport Systems in the road sector (ITS). The case study confirms that, in these areas, the borderline between \"telematics\" and digital solutions has been, or is about to be, passed. Such projects have been progressing well in line with continuously evolving developments and needs, independently of a certain stagnation in the relevant TEN-T terminology. . New and genuinely digital - projects are generated, building on extensive work of expert fora set up by the Commission such as the Digital Transport Forum, or on initiatives of stakeholder consortia supported by EU bodies such as the European Railway Agency. Amongst such digital \"forerunner\" TEN-T projects are: ELETA 71 is a rail specific and targeted project that tackled the particular issue of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) data within the whole rail supply chain management. FEDeRATED builds upon the work of the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF). It aims to contribute to the development of a federated network of platforms for data sharing in the freight transport and logistics domain at EU level (and beyond) and to enable a smooth and effective public involvement with logistic chains for the execution of public duties. 72 With a view to the future,, the digital transition involves unprecedented new challenges and opportunities for TEN-T policy, which need to be seized in a more comprehensive way. Hence, case study on digitalisation concludes that there is a need to update the concept of digitalisation in TEN-T policy (e.g. its components, coverage and objectives) and to pass from individual actions to a coherent network-wide approach. Besides the technological side, this is vital to boost the efficiency of TEN-T infrastructure use, the generation of new and attractive user services for passengers and freight and, thereby, to substantially enhance the \"efficiency pillar\" of transport decarbonisation. TEN-T policy as enabler of a future-oriented mobility system Case study N4, looking into the \"TEN-T as an enabler of a future-oriented mobility system\", concentrated on understanding whether the current provisions of the Regulation are future-proof in more general terms. Results showed that stakeholders generally agreed or strongly agreed that the TEN-T Regulation has enabled innovation in the mobility system across all modes and at a multi-modal level (77%), although the effectiveness varies across modes. The current provisions were particularly appropriate to support future developments in the aviation (72% agreement ratio) and road (65%) sectors. However, with a view to future opportunities, the case study has shown some elements of rigidness in the Regulation that might limit the development of new and forward-looking transport solutions of relevance to TEN-T policy. One challenging issue in this respect concerns the adequateness of the current TEN-T provisions to enable an appropriate integration between infrastructure, vehicles and connected services across all modes. Less than half of the respondents from the case study survey (46%) responded positively to this question. Three examples of future-oriented mobility solutions have been explored in more detail; examples from three areas that have the potential to create significant breakthroughs in the EU transport policy, namely Connected and Automated Mobility, the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management System (SESAR) and the Hyperloop. As explained in literature, connectivity and automation are not only complementary technologies. Instead, they reinforce each other and may merge completely over time. The same underlying principle might be applicable to vehicles, which, with growing communication and connectivity with the infrastructure and supporting services, might become part of the infrastructure at large over time. This scenario will challenge the \"traditional\" layout of hard and digital infrastructure components. Moreover, automation and digitalisation are key enablers for all modes of transport. Therefore, experts interviewed in the frame of Case Study N4 considered that a high level of flexibility is needed to incorporate transport concepts that might disrupt the current mode-oriented structure of the Regulation. Desk research in the framework of this case study makes the case for a flexible regulation with regard to upcoming road automation (as the requirements for road automation are not yet clear), new transport solutions (e.g. Hyperloop) and further developments in the SESAR programme (where artificial intelligence has already been playing a significant role). In this regard the Regulation should be more appropriately linked with the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (2020) 73 and consistently build on EU data sharing policies, such as the Open Data Directive (2019) 74 and the Inspire Directive (2007) 75 . Regarding innovative mobility solutions overall, there was agreement in stakeholder interviews that automation and digitalisation components need to be better addressed in the TEN-T Regulation. Requirements and priority targets should be set out for comprehensive and core networks. Interoperability is crucial in this respect not only for the effective deployment of digital solutions for both passenger and freight transport but also in order to ensure that different systems can communicate, thus avoiding a situation where a multitude of independent solutions are developed in silos. Desk research on Hyperloop, for example, showed that this mode of transport results from a combination of technologies used in other modes of transport. In reality, most fundamental technologies required for Hyperloop have an equivalent technology in either the rail (Maglev) or aviation sector, combining efficiently components from aerospace, railway and the vacuum industries. Therefore, Hyperloop systems correspond to another example that challenge the mode-oriented structure and layout of the TEN-T Regulation. As far as the adaptability of the TEN-T Regulation to changing needs is concerned, most evidence collected through the several data sources and tools pointed out that the 2013 Regulation has been sufficiently flexible and adaptive so far. However, the transport ecosystem is changing very rapidly, which suggests needs for adjustment to keep the TEN-T abreast with future changes. This should take account of the specific nature of such new technologies compared to more traditional infrastructure. Possible particularities in terms of requirements have been referred to in the stakeholder workshop under case study 6, including issues such as openness for unforeseeable developments, data needs etc. Core network corridors have been identified as being an instrument able to act as test-bed for new technologies, working across borders and connecting systems and services, as well as facilitating knowledge exchange and cooperation. Furthermore pilot projects for real business cases may be deployed on the corridors which can later be used in the rest of the network. Infrastructure for alternative fuels (enabling zero and low emission mobility and transport) has been covered in the TEN-T Regulation essentially as a new technology (Article 33) and a call upon LNG refuelling stations, without however setting specific requirements. All evidence (from the main evaluation study as well as from initiatives in DG MOVE on alternative fuels solutions in the road, maritime and aviation sectors), the European Green Deal and Climate Target Plan objectives) confirm that the TEN-T regulation has become irrelevant in this field. The current Regulation has enabled the promotion of a wide range of pilot action to prepare for large scale rollout. However, the challenge is now to ensure continuous network-wide coverage of alternative fuel infrastructure, which is coherent (see chapter 5, question of coherence) with relevant EU legislation; legislation being prepared in parallel with this evaluation process but for which clear orientations are already available (for further details, please refer to question. 5.1.3.Evaluation question 3: How relevant is the set of infrastructure standards and requirements, as included in the TEN-T Regulation, to help achieving TEN-T and transport policy objectives? To what extent are the provisions on standards and requirements appropriate to incorporate market developments, to enable an efficient use of the TEN-T infrastructure and to achieve new, high-quality transport infrastructure and transport innovation \/ reduce infrastructure quality gaps? Network-wide infrastructure standards, introduced in Regulation N1315\/2013 are fundamental enablers for a well-functioning European Single Transport Area. The adequate implementation of these infrastructure standards is seen as key for a more sustainable, seamless and smarter network 76 . Network infrastructure standards in TEN-T cover both: the binding transport infrastructure standards resulting from the EU legislation in relevant transport policy fields (i.e. technical standards for interoperability, safety); and the transport infrastructure requirements enabling the achievement of various transport policy objectives (such as modal connections in transport nodes, safe and secure parking, intelligent transport systems, provisions for equipment to facilitate use functions, etc.). Chapter II of the TEN-T Regulation sets out the current standards applicable to the comprehensive network, while Chapter III sets higher-level requirements for the infrastructure of the core network which constitutes the most strategic part of the comprehensive network. The TEN-T Regulation has brought new opportunities for infrastructure development, promoting safer and more efficient sustainable development for all modes. By setting infrastructure standards and requirements, the TEN-T has taken up relevant legislation and policy objectives in various transport sectors, namely on road safety, interoperability or equipment for innovative, smart and clean transport solutions. About two third of the respondents to the Open Public Consultation supported the promotion of harmonised standards and other common infrastructure qualities in TEN-T policy, given their importance for the free movement of citizens. However, with a view to new challenges in transport, interviewees in fields such as intelligent transport systems and innovation pointed to the particular need for strengthening infrastructure requirements enabling decarbonisation. In line with this, global survey results suggested furthermore that a more efficient use of the infrastructure could be achieved through reinforcing provisions for soft infrastructure in the TEN-T Regulation, notably in the field of future-oriented mobility schemes (digitalisation, automation, smart mobility chains, as well as other transport infrastructure requirements related to EU policies on environmental protection and climate). The main evaluation study included in particular two case studies (n 3, on standards and requirements of TEN-T infrastructure and n 7 (on infrastructure quality \/ resilience and the connection between R&I and the deployment on TEN-T) which looked in more detail into the relevance of standards and requirements in general, as well as into the specific aspect of infrastructure quality requirements from the perspective of resilience. Relevance of TEN-T infrastructure standards and requirements in general (case study n3) In the online survey of case study 3, a large majority of stakeholders (80% of the respondents) agreed or strongly agreed that the setting of a wide range of other infrastructure requirements 77 aiming to advance the TEN-T towards a broad basis for an efficient and sustainable transport policy overall has been relevant in relation to different objectives. There was broad consensus among stakeholders who confirmed the relevance of TEN-T infrastructure requirements notably in the following areas: advancing the basis for an efficient and sustainable transport policy: While there was a high agreement on the need for such standards, only slightly more than half found them sufficiently clear enhancing infrastructure interconnections in urban nodes and facilitating last mile connections (84% agreement) safety enhancement (87% agreement) Accessibility for all users (82% agreement) Security (80% agreement) On the contrary only between 50 and 60% of the respondents found the provisions relevant in relation to the needs of users of transport nodes, such as ports, airports or multi-modal terminals, as well as of the providers of cross-border transport operations which confirms the outcome from evaluation question n1, namely that there is a lack of relevance of the TEN-T objectives in relation to the needs of users, especially in relation to integrated door-to-door services across modes. Hence, as also confirmed by the Commission services own work, there is a significant need to advance certain infrastructure standards and requirements to better align them with various new transport policy objectives. Besides the areas referred to above, this is in particular the case in areas such as railway policy, inland navigation, charging and refuelling infrastructure for zero and low emission vehicles, aircrafts and vessels as well as smart and digital infrastructure features. On the hand the standards on tunnel safety will remain relevant in their current form as confirmed in a recent impact assessment. The case study assessed the approach to setting higher infrastructure standards and requirements for the core network, compared to lower level standards for the comprehensive network which may be seen as some kind of \"dual layer approach\" in terms of TEN-T standards and requirements. Survey results and interviews with stakeholders (to a large extent European Associations representing all transport modes at stake, as well as user representations) show that this approach is seen as relevant by a large majority of the survey respondents and interviewees. This is supported notably for the following reasons: Ensuring continuity of standards throughout the network (94% agreement) Strengthening quality and capacity of the core network where the highest volumes of inner-EU traffic are concentrated (96% agreement) avoiding disruptions which may result from exemptions enshrined in related legislation, for example on interoperability (90% agreement) allowing a smooth absorption of increasing transport flows from and to third countries (84% agreement) advancing solutions to enhance efficiency and sustainability of the transport system overall (89% agreement) making the core network the forerunner of innovation and new technologies in transport (80% agreement). Nevertheless, according to the Commission's own expert work (based on various working groups, involving Member States and expert groups), there is a need to extend certain (higher) standards from the core to the comprehensive network. This is expected to address shortcomings which have been identified in areas such as urban nodes, enhanced railway services or user requirements. Not least such an approach appears also necessary to address innovative and sustainability objectives such as charging and refuelling infrastructure for alternative fuel or digitalisation \/ automation which are more of a horizontal scope. With the specific example of maritime transport, it shall be demonstrated that the current Regulation lacks relevance in the light of new challenges, although it can be stated that the current provisions have been relevant and yielded good results. Concerning maritime transport and Motorways of the Sea, a wide and intense consultation process both inside the Commission services and outside with Member States' representatives and EU maritime associations, the relevant section of the TEN-T Regulation (Articles 20 23) 4 present relevance problems in relation in relation to new emerging trends (e.g. new market realities and societal challenges) and new legal drivers of the maritime sector. Most importantly, all experts agreed on the fact that the concept of Motorways of the Sea is overly complex and poses implementation problems. It could greatly benefit from simplification and integration in an overarching and integrated concept of the TEN-T covering ports, shipping and all other maritime infrastructure elements for the benefit of the entire 'European Maritime Space'. Both sea-shore and port-hinterland connections lack coherence and strong focus on multi-modal connectivity in ports. The role of maritime ports as strategic multimodal nodes, energy and digital hubs are insufficiently recognised in the Regulation. According to the maritime experts, representing Member States and Associations, also a particular view on maritime links with islands, peripheral and outermost regions as well as third countries would help addressing remaining problems. Finally, the evaluation undertaken by these experts shows that the inclusion of eligibility criteria into the TEN-T Regulation (Article 21) has proven to be inappropriate. They therefore strongly call to remove them from the Regulation and to incorporate them instead in a CEF 2 multi-annual work programme or in specific call texts in line with what is already done for other funding priorities. Such elements of inappropriateness of the current TEN-T Regulation could be overcome by fostering a more holistic and harmonised approach of the TEN-T maritime dimension. Infrastructure quality \/ resilience and connection between R&I and TEN-T policy (case study n 7) Stakeholder consultation, interviews and a workshop undertaken in the framework of this case study points to lacking relevance in the TEN-T provisions in relation to climate adaptation \/ infrastructure resilience. Analysis in different policy sectors within the Commission services also highlights the need for a revised approach, with the introduction of additional infrastructure standards and requirements, in fields such as security, climate adaptation, civil protection or structural infrastructure quality. The provisions of the Regulation appear insufficient in relation to the different facets of resilience of the TEN-T. The Regulation refers to such issues in a scarce and unspecific way (notably in Articles 34 and 35 with references to safe and secure infrastructure and to resilience to climate change and natural and environmental disasters). The period since the adoption of Regulation N 1315\/2013, however, has seen a number of developments which suggest adjustment in the field of infrastructure resilience. The continuity of transport flows within the Union may be suddenly interrupted for a number of reasons: extreme weather events which become increasingly frequent, security challenges or severe accidents on critical sections of the TEN-T infrastructure. Preparedness of TEN-T infrastructure for such situations needs to be enhanced, in line with relevant EU action in fields such as civil protection, military mobility, cyber security and climate adaptation. This assessment has been confirmed through various initiatives, including inter alia, the military mobility action plan 78 or the preparation of an EU strategy on climate adaption. Examples of challenges to TEN-T resilience One recent event has particularly highlighted the need to enhance the relevance of the Regulation on structural infrastructure quality: the collapse of the MORANDI Bridge in Genova in 2018. Case study n 7, has looked into this aspect in more detail. It proposes to pay increased attention to minimum requirements for particularly vulnerable parts of the TEN-T, such as bridges. This is complemented by calls from stakeholders to foresee alternative routes for particularly critical infrastructure sections. The case study also highlights the need for a life-cycle approach, making sure infrastructure assets are maintained at a high structural quality level throughout the time of their use. It is recommended to draw on new technologies (such as drones etc.) for regular monitoring of critical TEN-T infrastructure assets and to streamline maintenance procedures on this basis. The COVID-19 outbreak has led to a disruptive impact on transport and mobility, jeopardising the transport of essential goods across borders. Therefore, in March 2020, as part of the EU's response to the coronavirus crisis, the European Commission issued a communication on green lanes regarding a cross-border management tool for freight transport by road and rail. It also issued other guidance documents aimed at easing the impacts of the health crisis on transport across the EU 79 . The guidance regarding green lane border crossing points was heeded in respect of relevant internal border-crossing points of the TEN-T, ensuring the supply of essential goods and the seamless functioning of the Single Market for goods and essential services. This can be seen as example to demonstrate that even unspecific provisions of the TEN-T Regulation, seen in the context of the general and specific objectives of TEN-T policy as a whole, have been highly relevant to undertake successful action in a case of crisis. 5.2.Effectiveness Effectiveness looks into the successfulness of the TEN-T regulation in achieving or progressing towards its objectives. It assesses the progress made to date and the role the TEN-T regulation has played in delivering the observed changes. Furthermore it looks at areas where progress is lagging and the underlying reasons for that. 5.2.1.Evaluation Question 4: To what extent has the Regulation delivered to date in relation to its specific objectives as well as to the dual layer network structure? Which factors have hindered or promoted the achievement of these specific objectives? To what extent has the Regulation been effective in relation to the following areas: urban nodes, the promotion of new technologies and innovation as well as cooperation with third countries? To what extent have implementing tools, reporting and monitoring provisions been effective in achieving of the objectives of the Regulation? The latest two Progress Reports on TEN-T implementation which, according to Article 49(3) of the TEN-T Regulation, have to inform the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions every two years about the delivery of TEN-T policy on its objectives, provide an overview of the two reporting periods 2014\/2015 80 and 2016\/2017 81 . They show that substantial investments have been concentrated on the core and comprehensive networks, namely in the order of 90 billion Euro respectively. (This combines national and European, public and private sources). These investments reflect the gradual advancement with the implementation of the wide range of projects of common interest under the common EU-wide TEN-T policy objective. For the core network more specifically, the work of the European Coordinators has been instrumental for effective progress. During the period 2013 2020, a total number of more than 1200 projects has been completed along these corridors, representing a total investment of around 110 billion Euro. They include a wide range of activities of varying size and nature, and they cover the whole project life-cycle, from studies or geographical explorations to implementation work. On all corridors, the overwhelming part of the investment was concentrated on rail, with the completion and entry into operation of major projects such as the full high-speed railway line Paris Strasbourg in 2016, of the Tours Bordeaux high-speed railway line in 2017 and of the full Berlin Munich high-speed railway line as well as of the Treviglio Bresica and Antequera Granada high-speed rail sections. 82 Besides these achievements, which led to travel time reductions and facilitated modal shift from air and road to rail, a large number of projects concerned smaller action such as the improvement of rail access to freight terminals, ports and airports, rail capacity upgrades in urban centres, the extension of sidings for freight trains, electrification, modernization or upgrading for 740m trains in terminals. For other major railway projects, such as the Karlsruhe Basel line (connecting the North Sea ports in the Netherlands with Italy via the Swiss Alpine tunnels) or the \"EuroCapRail\" line Brussels Strasbourg Luxemburg, significant sums have been spent to ensure steady implementation progress. The financial efforts made by Member States for such projects have been substantially supported from the Connecting Europe Facility. The share of the total CEF contribution, attributed to rail, is generally high. It differs from corridor to corridor and reaches, for example, 86% on the Mediterranean corridor (where the Cohesion Fund envelope of CEF has allowed high co-funding rates in part of the States concerned.) Also in the inland waterway sector, important achievements can be reported for the 2013 2020 period. Upgrading has been completed in the Western German Canal system as well as on inland waterway locks in the Netherlands. Good progress has also been made with the implementation of the Seine Scheldt project (in particular in Belgium), with further inland waterway upgrades in the Netherlands or with lock modernisations in Romania. The achievements with projects in these two transport modes (partly building on investments under previous TEN-T Guidelines) have contributed to enhancing efficiency, quality and sustainability of services. However, they will bring their full benefit only once the core network as a whole is completed. In line with the multi-modal dimension of the TEN-T, appropriate investment in road and multi-modal infrastructure have been and will continue to be of no less importance for the gradual network completion and its efficient and sustainable functioning. In the 2013 2020 period, Corridor work has also included activities in fields such as intelligent transport systems \/ digitalization or alternative fuels. Unlike for 'physical' projects, however, such action has been more isolated and less subject to a coherent and corridor wide project identification and implementation. To draw full benefit from such and other innovative approaches, more continuity along the whole network (with its full completion as vital precondition) will be vital for the future. With regard to the further project identification and implementation towards the 2030 deadline, the work related to the core network corridors shows that core network projects (based on technical analysis and Coordinators' work plans) shows at this stage that, to date, up to 3000 projects remain to be completed for full core network completion until 2030. This includes all (potential) projects at decision-making, preparatory or construction stage. The adoption of the Directive \"Streamlining Measures for Advancing the Realisation of the TEN-T\" (based on a Commission proposal from 2018, at an advanced stage of negotiation 83 ) is expected to facilitate and accelerate preparatory processes for the most critical of these projects. The Coordinators' Work Plans 84 , regularly assess the development of the corridor under the respective Coordinator's responsibility and get the approval of the Member States directly concerned. All four series of work plans adopted so far have been subject to exchanges of views with the Committee on Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament, and received strong support. A large part of the identified corridor projects concerns upgrading of the infrastructure towards TEN-T standards and requirements set out in the TEN-T Regulation and will lead to infrastructure quality enhancements. Furthermore, particular efforts are concentrated on key cross-border projects, which involve high cost, not least as they at the same time cross major natural barriers (mountains or water). Overall: Continuous efforts are going on coordinated between the Commission, Member States concerned, infrastructure managers and other public stakeholders to steadily deliver milestones on the different types of projects. Depending on the type and size of the projects concerned, they generate continuously positive impacts on parts of the network. Besides the work plans of the European Coordinators, further evidence for the effectiveness of TEN-T implementation is provided in many sources and on a regular basis: online reports of the work of the European Coordinators, project promoters' and national governments publications on project completion and reports of European Associations etc. The specific category of urban nodes' projects shall be referred to here again, given the particular attention attributed to it by individual stakeholders and stakeholder associations as well as the good coverage by literature. While the provisions, which were newly introduced in 2013, proved to be rather effective in a number of respects, they lack appropriateness in the light of foreseeable new needs to boost sustainability and to enhance seamless mobility services for the benefit of users (see EQ n 1). However, the introduction of urban nodes into TEN-T policy in 2013 has generated a strong momentum, stimulating commitment amongst cities, other stakeholders and experts in relation to relevant TEN-T objectives. This enhanced, for example, the interrelation between urban nodes and TEN-T corridors, put emphasis on the challenging issue of multi-level governance in urban nodes and on the importance of seamless last mile connections as a key TEN-T interest, highlighted the decarbonisation potential in urban nodes, addressed their freight dimension and not least made it possible to fund a significant number of urban nodes' projects under the Connecting Europe Facility, with a substantial share concerning decarbonisation and innovation. TEN-T action on urban nodes developed into a sound policy basis for activities in related areas, such as research and innovation (e.g. the Vital Nodes project, initiatives like CIVITAS 85 or websites like ELTIS 86 ) or promotional activities through organisations like Eurocities 87 . In conclusion: The impacts thus generated support all of the specific objectives of Regulation N 1315\/2013: 1) The efficiency of the network in support of the internal market, 2) Cohesion, 3) Sustainability and 4) User benefits. This has been clearly confirmed in the various stakeholder consultations, literature review and further analysis both by external experts and within the Commission. 5.2.2.Evaluation Question 5: Have the current provisions for the identification and definition of projects of common interest achieved their purpose? To what extent have they enabled the identification and definition of projects of common interest in all areas covered by the TEN-T Regulation (physical and others, including traffic management, nodes etc.), and to what extent have these projects contributed to the specific priorities of the Regulation, including the tackling of capacity problems? To which extent have the implementing tools foreseen in the Regulation helped implementing these projects? Article 7 of Regulation N 1315\/2013 defines the meaning of a \"project of common interest\". Essentially, a \"project of common interest\" (within the spirit of the TENs Title of the TFEU) is any project that contributes to the completion of the trans-European transport network. Given the wide range of objectives to be achieved, and of requirements to be fulfilled, projects of common interest encompass a broad variety of categories of action, notably including: filling missing links; removing capacity bottlenecks upgrading infrastructure in line with the established common TEN requirements enhancing multi-modal infrastructure, intermodal connections well as the access to them equipping infrastructure to enable telematics applications \/ the provision of intelligent transport services introducing innovative solutions to TEN-T infrastructure; enhancing and equipping the TEN-T infrastructure in any way that helps enabling its sustainable, efficient, high-quality performance within the European transport system. The definition of such projects has been most clear and coherent, and the identification most straightforward, in the fields of filling missing links and of infrastructure upgrading to ensure compliance with the standards and requirements This is also reflected in the various reports issued by the Commission (Two-Years Progress Reports and in particular the work plans of the European Coordinators), which document high levels of effectiveness especially in relation to the coherent and successful implementation of common TEN-T standards and, as a result, positive impacts on targets such as interoperability and continuity. This has been instrumental in enabling seamless transport and mobility across national borders and along the TEN-T infrastructure more generally. Thereby, it contributed to all of the specific objectives of the Regulation. At the same time, the evaluation has also increasingly brought out views claiming that technical standards, and compliance with them, is not in all cases sufficient. In specific cases, it may need to be complemented by key performance indicators guided by service objectives. The identification and prioritisation of projects addressing capacity needs from a TEN-T (rather than national) perspective often in situations where international, national, regional and local traffic overlap and where smart solutions may help enhancing the efficient use of infrastructure resources has been more difficult. The analytical assessment that underpins the work of the European Coordinators in relation to their respective corridors (the so called corridor studies 88 ) addresses this issue by using the best available methodological approaches. When identifying and prioritising projects from an overall corridor perspective, beyond the perspective of national infrastructure plans, due account is taken of national plans as well as of relevant stakeholder initiatives, input from corridor fora and working groups. In this way, lists of projects of common interest are established, which are to contribute to core network completion by 2030 and which underpin the respective work plans of the European Coordinators. In a more discontinuous and diverse way (so far) these lists also include projects in smart or innovative sectors which may positively influence the optimal corridor functioning. This approach has been of key importance for the identification of funding priorities from EU sources The effectiveness of this approach so far, including its benefits for transport, trade, economic development, cohesion and the environment have been continuously endorsed over the 2013 2020 period by Member States, EU Institutions, professional stakeholders or NGOs. A different type of challenge has been inherent in the identification of projects of common interest in the field of telematics\/intelligent transport systems. In this area, the situation depends on whether there is a single Europe-wide policy that drives action all across the TEN-T, ensures interoperability and coherent user benefits. This is notably the case in the aviation (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management SESAR), railway (European Rail Traffic Management System ERTMS) and river information services (RIS) sector. The identification and development of individual projects in these areas is guided in a coherent and complementary way by a single European concept throughout the different parts of the Union. Such projects have been the result of long EU-driven preparatory processes. They all started as EU research projects and led via pilot deployment on the TEN-T gradually to larger scale implementation. In the case of ERTMS, for example, the objective is full-scale deployment along the core network as the only solution considered. This approach to transport telematics which is now quickly moving towards digitalisation and automation generates significant benefits in economic and environmental terms, enhances safety or quality and reliability of services. In these areas, the instrument of the European Coordinators has been supportive. However, it would need to develop further in the coming years to be ready to take up new challenges in the first instance to boost the different dimensions of transport decarbonisation (efficiency enhancement and the binding equipment with infrastructure for low and zero emission mobility) and digitalisation. 5.2.3.Evaluation question 6: To what extent has the Regulation, and the investments made on its basis, enabled smooth, safe, secure and sustainable transport flows in all transport modes and at a multi-modal level; i.e. to what extent has it facilitated the generation of transport services of high quality and in line with the needs of users? Have the needs of all users (including PRM) been sufficiently covered? Have the following issues, as key enabling factors for high quality user services, been effectively tackled: the removal of infrastructure quality gaps \/ coherent infrastructure quality status, multi-modal infrastructure and the application of digital solutions? Amongst the goals of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) is to ensure efficient transport flows and to enable services providing seamless, safe and sustainable mobility of persons and goods. With regard to infrastructural developments, this builds to a large extent on performant trans-national transport axes, free of bottlenecks and missing links. It is, furthermore, dependent on strong multi-modal infrastructure and its smooth network integration, encompassing besides the physical interconnection - also the smart \/ digital TEN-T dimension. Evidence from the evaluation indicates that, overall, the TEN-T is very effective in facilitating trans-national transport flows. However, stakeholder consultations in the evaluation study as well as the Commission's own analysis suggest that there is significant room for TEN-T policy to improve its capacity to stimulate the generation of high-quality services such as: Services for individual and commercial users, Services for freight transport and passenger mobility (encompassing journeys from users' origin to their final destination), Services across transport modes (including components such as the organisation and delivery of actual transport operations as well as planning, ticketing and real time information tools for clients \/ users) To achieve this objective, a traditional infrastructure approach resting strongly upon the delivery of major infrastructure connections and ensuring continuity of standards, comes to certain limits. It calls for enhancing the effectiveness of TEN-T policy by gearing it more towards the stimulation of seamless multi-modal transport and mobility chains for freight and passenger transport. This requires a more effective combination of TEN-T elements, varied in scale and nature and coordinated from the user benefits' angle. On the 'traditional' infrastructure side, the enhancement of multi-modal infrastructure (ports, airports, rail\/road terminals, railway stations) and its smooth network integration an important condition for high-level services across modes - has been pretty much in the focus of TEN-T policy already. Multi-modal infrastructure has been given due attention in the Core Network Corridor approach, which contributed to enhancing multi-modal services along these corridors. This observation has been supported by 83% of the stakeholders in the targeted consultation. Nevertheless, the evaluation shows that there is a need to further boost the effectiveness of the multi-modal infrastructure of the TEN-T as a key basis for better and more sustainable user services. In the Open Public Consultation, only 39% of the respondents saw the TEN-T Regulation as being sufficiently effective in promoting modal shift towards the most sustainable transport modes. EU funding, which has been largely concentrated on sustainable transport modes (notably on rail and inland navigation axes) has been indispensable but can deploy its full benefits only when linked with a strong policy on multi-modal infrastructure. This situation led the Commission already to strengthening the connection between land transport corridors and the maritime dimension of the TEN-T; thus to better integrate core network corridors and ports \/ motorways of the sea. Amongst the further paths for improvement, which have been identified and put on track by the Commission already, is the strengthening of freight terminal infrastructure in the context of the revision of the Combined Transport Directive and its integration with the TEN-T Regulation. In the field of passenger mobility, it should be noted that infrastructure improvements through TEN-T are only one of the means to improve passenger mobility. Indeed, pricing and ticketing, timetabling and availability as well as reliability of services play an important role. When it comes to infrastructure, the Commission still expects a more in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of airrail connections and suggestions for possible enhancement, resulting from an ongoing study. Stakeholders participating in consultations (OPC and surveys), finding from case study n 8 as well as from specific expert work of the Commission hint to possibilities for enhancing effectiveness by addressing weaknesses in seamless mobility chains for passengers. Inter alia they see important potential in the strengthening of railway stations as genuine transfer hubs between TEN-T and last mile journeys. In the framework of the main evaluation study, the case study on \"Seamless and barrier-free mobility for the trans-European passenger\" (case study n 8) has explored the effectiveness of the TEN-T Regulation in stimulating sustainable user services of high-quality in more detail. Furthermore, the case study on \"Digitalisation\" (case study n 6) has addressed aspects of importance to the facilitation of seamless and sustainable user services. Seamless and barrier-free mobility for the trans-European passenger (Case study 8): Regulation n 1315\/2013 includes, in the Article on New Technologies and Innovation (Article 33), references to issues such as integrated ticketing or the coordination of time tables; thus to service related requirements which should be enabled by TEN-T action. Some pilot action has been promoted on this basis, for example in fields such as Mobility as a Service, promoting data sharing between companies. Case study n 8 found that TEN-T policy has been quite effective in enabling passenger hubs to fulfil their transfer function (around 75% agreement rate in surveys). However, only 30% of survey respondents saw the TEN-T as sufficiently effective in enabling them to carry out the entirety of trips along the TEN-T in accordance with their expectations. The case study led to the clear suggestion that TEN-T policy should adopt an integrated approach under the user's perspective, taking into account service requirements. Examples for such requirements given by stakeholders included: provision of complete and reliable information across all modes of transport from door-to-door; user-oriented design of hubs, also in intermodal transport; integrated ticketing for the complete traffic route; coordinated travel chains. In addition stakeholders highlighted that stronger connections with the ITS Directive and other relevant EU policies would ensure that developments on passenger services are harmonized and not overlapping, as well as guarantee greater focus on user needs. Furthermore strengthening the role of urban nodes would enable a seamless flow of passengers between the core and local networks and strengthen more sustainable transport modes in urban areas. A specific dimension of case study 8 addressed the accessibility and mobility of all transport users. In this respect, the TEN-T Regulation aims to ensure, inter alia, accessibility for elderly people, persons with reduced mobility and disabled passengers. Furthermore, Article 37 on accessibility for all users includes a provision that the design and construction of TEN-T infrastructure should comply with the relevant requirements in Union law, to allow seamless mobility and accessibility for all users. However, at present, besides Member States' procedures, there is no system or framework to check or to monitor whether these standards are systematically implemented (e.g. along the core network or at multimodal connecting points or terminals), and if not where these issues are located and how severe these are 89 . However, the full implementation of technical specifications for interoperability related to accessibility of the Union's rail system for persons with disabilities and reduced mobility (PRM-TSI) 90 will give a boost in this situation 91 . More generally, online survey respondents to case study 8 were divided on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the TEN-T Regulations provisions on accessibility (specifically for elderly people, passengers with reduced mobility and passengers with a disability). Digitalisation (Case study n 6) Digitalisation plays an increasingly important role in enabling smooth, safe, efficient and sustainable user services in the passengers and freight sector. In particular on freight, the work of the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF) aims at enhancing the effectiveness of services (building on current TEN-T provisions on sustainable freight transport services, innovation and telematics). Findings from Case Study 6 showed mixed views on the contribution of digital aspects to the achievement of the Regulation's objectives of ensuring smooth, safe and sustainable transport flows. For freight and logistics, respondents did see a clear contribution of digitalization aspects to safe and smooth transport flows mainly as a result of the combined contribution of TEN-T and other initiatives ongoing in parallel. For passenger transport, the situation was slightly less positive. The main barrier identified was the lack of 4G and high-speed mobile internet availability in a number of areas which restricts the use of digital solutions. Given that many solutions for passengers are mobile phone based, this basic connectivity is an important condition for the effective deployment of digital solutions (Even though it is outside the scope of the TEN-T Regulation). On the other hand, the evaluation pointed to positive examples of digital technologies in air transport. The desk research suggested that the SESAR project has so far contributed to promoting a common vision towards reaching the goals established for improving Air Traffic Management (ATM). The emergence of drone-related services is also prompting a surge of innovation in air traffic management, which the European Commission is championing through its U-space initiative for the safe and secure integration of drones alongside manned aviation. 5.2.4.Evaluation Question 7: How effective has the Regulation been in enabling and stimulating investment in a sustainable and decarbonised transport system? More specifically (in addition to more system-efficiency focused side addressed in question n 6): To what extent has the implementation of alternative fuel infrastructure along the TEN-T been effective? How effectively has EU funding stimulated this process? The European Green Deal 92 sets out ambitious targets for decarbonisation, calling for and proposing legal ways to ensure the European Union becomes carbon neutral by 2050. In this context, the transport sector is committed to reach a 90% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, compared to the 1990 level. TEN-T policy plays a key role as provider of an integrated and all-encompassing infrastructure network and as the \"hard\" basis for the provision of charging and refuelling infrastructure for low and zero emission vehicles, aircrafts and vessels. From evaluation question n 6, it comes already out rather clearly that investments in TEN-T have been successful notably in one respect: Removing bottlenecks and filling missing links along major TEN-T axes and in a reasonable way integrating urban and transport nodes into the network and enhancing their connectivity and functionality. The overwhelming part of TEN-T financing, both investment from Member States and relevant funding from EU sources, have contributed to this objective. In the course of the evaluation period, roughly 40 billion Euro have been spent every year for this purpose along the core network, both from national and EU sources (also including EIB loans). By focussing funds from EU sources, notably from the Connecting Europe Facility and the Cohesion Fund, on the highest network development priorities and the most sustainable transport modes, effective contributions have been made to enhancing the physical basis for sustainability and decarbonisation. Besides this, Member States and a broad range of public and private investors have implemented with or without EU support a large number of complementary \"soft-type\" TEN-T projects in support of decarbonisation and sustainability objectives (e.g. intelligent transport systems). However, the findings from question n 6 above show also that potential benefits remain unused, given that infrastructure development possibilities from the perspective of user services are not yet fully exploited. Ultimately, decarbonisation effects are generated from an efficient use of the infrastructure; from innovative and sustainable transport and mobility solutions along the TEN-T and from a strong shift to sustainable modes. Reasons behind effectiveness shortages in this area are varied and include: a lack of a broader user perspective in the TEN-T Regulation (see question n 6 above); difficulties in generating and implementing relevant action due to complex governance issues; unlike for larger infrastructure projects - funding frequently based on individual projects rather than on more holistic approaches which reflect broader transport policy objectives. This suggests that: Indeed, investments have been strongly concentrated on the development and gradual completion of the physical network structure and on coherent and interoperable technical standards. Nevertheless, this has not yet been sufficiently translated into a strong boost of integrated, highly efficient and sustainable services and may have given away efficiency gains with a view to decarbonisation. Intelligent transport services in all modes, however, have been already quite effective in this respect. Quantifying the specific impacts of ITS deployment is not easy, as so many different factors can contribute to improvements in road safety, traffic congestion and emission reductions. Thankfully, specific evaluations of ITS implementations along the ITS corridors and TEN-T Core Network Corridors, harmonised and coordinated by the EU EIP project, have researched and highlighted the benefits of ITS for road users, in terms of less hours spent in (congested) traffic, reduction of injuries and fatalities, but also the reduction of CO2-emissions to the benefit of everyone. The returns on investment for these projects were achieved between 3 to 5 years. The EU EIP has developed common KPI definitions, levels of service definitions and an Evaluation Toolkit 93 to support any ITS-related project in gaining a better understanding of the effects of their implementation. The Toolkit has been developed into a publicly accessible online tool for searching ITS Evaluation results by 6 key criteria (Deployment KPI, Benefit KPI, Location, Corridor, ITS Directive Priority Area and ITS Directive Priority Action) and enables users to directly locate Evaluation Reports. The Toolkit was launched in 2019 and will continue to be periodically updated as new results become available. The second key pillar of enhancing sustainability and contributing to greenhouse gas reductions in transport concerns the provision of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for zero and low emission mobility along the TEN-T. The findings of the main evaluation study as well as a wide range of other evidence from expert associations and the Commission's own analysis show one particularity in TEN-T policy: a quite general provision in Regulation n 1315\/2013 (under \"innovation\", in Article 33) has triggered enormous action to stimulate alternative propulsion systems, in particular electro-mobility. In the early phase of the time-period under evaluation, a number of pilot projects was stimulated with support from the Connecting Europe Facility. Gradually, the scope of such action was growing. In addition to CEF, the Blending Facility (bringing together CEF grants, financing from implementation partners and project promoters as well as, where appropriate, from International Financial Institutions), has contributed to a massive increase in the deployment of charging points. Between 2013 and today, 12100 charging points where deployed with EU support in the field of TEN-T, covering both the TEN-T road network as well as urban nodes. In spite of the absence of specific TEN-T standards, EU funding was granted on the basis of a number of basic conditions, including open access, data sharing arrangements or the availability ad hoc payment possibilities. While the large number of charging points appears impressive, it masks the fact that there is a lack of balanced geographical coverage across the Union. Commitment for charging correlates with vehicle market prospects. The advancement in high-level political agreements towards a carbon neutral economy has entailed fast developments on legislative initiatives in transport in relation to recharging and refuelling infrastructure for zero and low emission mobility. In particular the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive (AFID) as well as the Fuel EU Maritime Initiative and the ReFuel Aviation Initiative - all in the process of preparing new legislation - are directly related with TEN-T policy. Relevant binding requirements would have to be integrated into a revised TEN-T Regulation, thereby ensuring a coherent coverage of recharging and refuelling infrastructure along the whole TEN-T. Both stakeholder consultations and literature review, undertaken in the main evaluation study, also clearly underpinned this conclusion. There are strong calls for more specific, binding requirements in the new TEN-T Regulation which set a clear framework for action and ensures continuity and coherence along the trans-European network. 5.3.Efficiency Efficiency considers the relationship between the resources used by an intervention and the changes generated by it. Efficiency analysis aims to assess whether the benefits of the TEN-T Regulation are perceived as proportionate and reasonable when compared to the costs of its implementation, governance and compliance. Costs are understood in a broad sense, considering not just monetary costs, but also the administrative burden. 5.3.1.Evaluation Question 8: Are the costs of the Regulation (mainly governance and advice mechanisms of the CNCs) and the sharing of responsibility between the different actors reasonable and proportionate in relation to the benefits? Are the reporting and monitoring provisions clear, simple and easy to report? To what extent was the application of innovative, technological and operational concepts cost efficient? Extent to which cost of governance and advice mechanisms (Coordinators, stakeholder fora, committees, work plans etc.) of the Core Network Corridors are reasonable in relation to the benefits Evaluation findings suggest that the cost of governance and advice mechanisms are generally reasonable, but suggestions were made to improve their efficiency. Evidence from the global desk research pointed out that the TEN-T corridor approach is recognised as a multi-level governance system which has brought transport stakeholders (such as representatives of EU regions and infrastructure managers of all modes) to work together and has effectively focused on delivering EU added value. 94 Most respondents from the global survey (67%) agreed or strongly agreed that studies, such as corridor studies, carried out by European coordinators and their consultant teams and the related corridor fora and working groups, are a cost-effective tool to implement the core network. Furthermore they stressed that the cost of governance and advice mechanisms of the core network corridors are reasonable in relation to the benefits they bring (63%). These findings were confirmed in Case study N2. Interviewees from the global interviews expressed a more nuanced view on this question. Some mentioned that they found that costs and workload are appropriate and echoed the sentiment that the \"benefits have outweighed the costs by far\". Other interviewees felt that the governance and advice mechanisms are time-consuming (participation in corridor fora, revisions of work plans) and did not see added value of certain reporting provisions, such as regularly updating project lists. Personnel and travel costs (mainly to attend meetings of the corridor fora) were highlighted by interviewees as the main costs with regard to governance and advice mechanisms. Figure 5: Cost effectiveness of different elements of Regulation 1315\/2013 (n=198) Source: Support study for the evaluation of Regulation (EU) N 1315\/2013 global survey Given the length and complexity of the core network corridors in their geographical representation (above 9000 km in some cases, including all transport modes and hundreds of important transport and urban nodes), the capacity deployed (staff and time) in relation to the analytical and coordination challenges involved is modest. In spite of this constraint, the identification and prioritisation of projects from a corridor-wide perspective has been seen as effective and beneficial. This was, amongst others, endorsed in regular exchanges of views between European Coordinators and the Committee on Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament. Requests especially in the OPC, from regional authorities and economic operators (business associations or transport service providers), to complement, adjust or combine corridor alignments, hint to certain difficulties in matching geographical corridor routes with transport demand 95 . Related to this, also the overlapping of corridor alignments (about 15% for rail) entails some questions when it comes to identifying, prioritizing and implementing projects from the perspective of the overall corridor functionality and use. In the case of the study on the impact of TEN-T completion on growth, jobs and environment, for example, the assessment of economic impacts of TEN-T investment was confronted with methodological difficulties and the risk of project double counting resulting from corridor overlaps. This problem may possibly increase when as it is called for in the global survey and in interviews as well as in several case studies - the focus of TEN-T infrastructure on zero and low emission mobility, digitalization and new technologies or urban nodes would be reinforced. It should be noted that at least in the case of member states, which have the highest reporting burden of all actors, costs related to TEN-T governance (travel, personnel) can be covered by so called Programme Support Actions financed through the CEF programme. Looking at these PSAs over the last years allows to get a rough impression of MS financial burden with regard to the participation and contribution in the governance of the TEN-T regulation. From 2014 2017 figures show that MS on average claimed costs of 84.500 EUR annually for participation in corridor fora, working groups and TEN-T days as well as delivering input to corridor studies and corridor work plans. Only some Member States use these support actions to support their filling of the TENtec database. When putting these figures into relation with the number of TEN-T corridors per MS one gets to approximate costs of 20.000 EUR annually per TEN-T corridor per MS. 96 Extent to which the sharing of responsibility between the different actors is reasonable in relation to the benefits The way responsibilities between the actors involved in implementing the TEN-T regulation are shared were generally seen as an area were improvements would be needed. Among the respondents to the global survey, only 42% agreed or strongly agreed that the sharing of responsibility between the different actors (including national, regional and local authorities, managers and users of infrastructure, as well as industry and civil society) is well-balanced, while 38% disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement (see figure 5 above). Interviewees where more positive on this topic and added that the sharing of responsibility between the different actors promotes an effective and efficient way of working towards achieving the TEN-T objectives. Nevertheless, a few national authorities held a more critical view, noting that a disproportionate share of responsibility rests on national governments and other public authorities in contrast to stakeholders from the private sector. At the same time, Member States' paramount responsibility for planning, financing and implementing TEN-T projects (notably the filling of missing links and the removal of bottlenecks along rail, inland waterway and road axes) is inherent in the basic principles of TEN-T policy. The results of the study on national plans and programmes (see chapters 3 and 4), assessing Member States' compliance with their responsibilities in ensuring the achievement of TEN-T objectives respectively at national level, provide a sound evidence that the majority of Member States acknowledges this responsibility and is fully committed to it. On the other hand, in the broad range of survey activities, interviews, the different case studies and the Commission's expert work, significant responsibilities of non-state actors are appreciated. Stakeholders like the European Seaport Organisation (ESPO) or INE, as well as CPMR of individual ports (participating in the OPC and being very active in the targeted stakeholder consultation) show that they are strongly and actively committed to contributing to TEN-T policy. In contrast, with a view to the current lack of appropriateness of the TEN-T in areas such as infrastructure for zero and low emission mobility as well as for digitalisation and other innovative technologies (coming out from a broad range of stakeholder opinions) private sector actors are indeed called upon to assume much stronger responsibility. While Member States largely stand by their (formal) responsibility for TEN-T implementation, case study n 2 also enquired about the extent to which Member States feel accountable for their respective contribution to the common objective of completing the TEN-T fully and within the agreed time horizon. In this respect, interviewees agreed that there is a lack of accountability. Part of the Member States still seemed to undervalue the incentive and additional benefits of aligning action across all Member States. This was underpinned by the opinion of an interviewee who felt that the TEN-T Regulation gave limited powers to the Commission for ensuring that Member States effectively implement projects in line with the agreed planning. In cases where political will or funding are limited, the Commission lacks the means to effectively enforce the implementation of projects. This has also been highlighted in a recent European Court of Auditors report 97 . Consequently, in case study n 2, interviewees saw possibilities for improving the accountability of Member States through agreements with the Commission on binding timelines for the implementation of individual projects, including a stronger role of European Coordinators in enforcing such agreements. This would also help setting a clearer perspective and commitment in terms of national financing and EU support. Not least, this could also strengthen the political responsibility for TEN-T project implementation at national level, in response to certain tendencies (as perceived by some interviewees) of blaming Europe for failure and claiming success at national level.) In principle, Article 47(2) of the current TEN-T Regulation allows such agreements already. It grants the Commission the power to adopt implementing acts for the cross-border and horizontal dimensions of the core network corridor work plans. However, it has been used only to a limited extent. So far there are Implementing Acts for three such projects: for the Evora-Merida 98 railway line between Portugal and Spain, for Rail Baltica between Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland 99 as well as for the canal Seine-Scheldt 100 between France and Belgium. In addition to this assessment, and to first responses at the level of cross-border sections and significant corridor sections, the study on 'national plans' and programs assessed the sharing of responsibility especially between Member States and the Commission at a more strategic level. In spite of a good coverage of TEN-T objectives in relevant national plans and programmes, it also identified some shortcomings in the alignment. On this basis, this study suggests to consider means of reinforcing legal obligations for Member States in order to ensure complete coverage of TEN-T objectives at the level of Member States. Extent to which reporting and monitoring provisions are clear, simple and easy to report About half (49%) of all global survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the administrative burden linked to updating and reporting provisions of the TEN-T Regulation is proportionate to the benefits. While 23% disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement, 28% reported that they \"did not know\". Member states authorities interviewed were more critical on this point especially when asked about the existing reporting tools. While recognising the need and usefulness of reporting and monitoring tools, interviewees mentioned existing issues in relation to TENTec such as: sections defined in TENTec not matching sections defined at the national level, making data entry complex 101 ; data for reporting and monitoring not being available in the required format, so often not included; duplication with other reports (e.g. those submitted to the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency - INEA) Interviewees agreed that there is scope to improve the system, for example automating and better linking the information. However, many also recognised that as a new system, it requires time for familiarisation and that in the future reporting and monitoring on TENTec should become less burdensome. Although not necessarily involved in TEN-T reporting 42% of Open Public Consultation respondents had previously used the TEN-Tec system. Of those, the majority (59%) reported that they found it 'very useful' or 'useful' while (36%) considered it only somewhat useful. Extent to which application of innovative technological and operational concepts were cost efficient There was limited information from the evaluation on this sub-question due to a lack of information in literature as well as limited stakeholder understanding. 5.3.2.Evaluation Question 9: How efficiently is the integration of Core Network Corridors and Rail Freight Corridors based on the Regulation on a \"European rail network for competitive freight\" working 102 ? To what extent has, the TEN-T regulation addressed key efficiency measures and enabled efficient use of TEN-T infrastructure for freight transport and high quality and innovative passenger mobility services 103 . Extent to which the integration of the Core Network Corridors and Rail Freight Corridors have addressed key efficient measures The RFCs and CNCs are two complementary EU transport policy tools, pursuing the same objectives, in particular modal shift. Since entry into force of the TEN-T Regulation, the RFCs are considered as the rail freight backbone of the CNCs. Cooperation between the two structures is already addressed in legislation, in Article 48 of the TEN-T regulation (\"adequate coordination shall be ensured\") and in recital 10 of the RFC Regulation (which requests consistency between the implementation of the RFCs and the TEN-T network, at a time when the CNC concept did not exist). Cooperation and coordination between the two structures and their stakeholders have been set up as from the creation of the CNCs. There have been many initiatives, good practices, past or ongoing, going from mere exchange of information to defined activities to achieve a commonly agreed goal. Such cooperation has been done mainly on a corridor basis - although there have been a few horizontal and harmonised initiatives over the years with the Coordinators' involvement. In this respect, a few observations can be done: The competences and areas of intervention of the two corridor governance structures are largely of different nature. The RFCs are mainly focused on operations and dealing with timetabling, traffic management, removal of administrative and technical barriers, performance monitoring and development of services. In particular, the RFCs need to be close to market needs, while TEN-T infrastructure development requires long-term project and investment planning. This obviously justifies differences in organizational structures and stakeholder involvement. The RFCs have a competence as regards infrastructure development and its coordination across borders (Article 11 and recital 16), in particular the drawing up of an investment plan of medium and long-term investment for infrastructure, including a list of projects and a plan for removing identified bottlenecks. The entry into force of the TEN-T Regulation and the creation of the CNCs has raised and raises questions on the status of those provisions. Besides, given the on-the-ground expertise of the RFC stakeholders, there is potential for increased synergy RFC\/CNC in terms of identification of investment needs and investment planning for rail freight. Although the geographical alignment is largely the same, since the TEN-T Regulation has aligned in 2013 the nodes of the RFCs with those of the CNCs, there are still differences. These differences makes coordination more complex, for instance when it comes to planning the deployment of the TEN-T parameters for freight, or to determining the scope of the transport market studies. There are two main reasons for this misalignment. First the RFC Regulation allows for the creation of new corridors and the extension of existing corridors, upon request of the Member States. Second, there can be different railway lines linking a given pair of nodes resulting in a different choice for the RFC and for the CNC (especially when a line is more dedicated to freight traffic). Linked to the above, despite Article 48 of the TEN-T Regulation, there is a certain degree of overlapping of activities (e.g. as regards transport market studies or studies for the deployment of the TEN-T parameters). In terms of overall visibility and communication of the Commission transport policy, vis-a-vis the sector, citizens and public authorities, the co-existence of two different concepts of corridors is sometimes difficult to explain. However findings from the global survey, interviews and case studies also confirmed broad agreement that cooperation of the Core Network Corridors and Rail Freight Corridors has addressed key efficiency measures, namely the removal of bottlenecks, the bridging of missing links as well as the optimisation, interconnection and interoperability of national transport networks. Looking at the sources individually most respondents from the global survey agreed or strongly agreed that cooperation between core network and rail freight corridors has addressed key efficiency measures in a number of areas. More specifically, more than half agreed or strongly agreed that the cooperation between the CNCs and RFCs has facilitated the use of new and existing infrastructure (58%); helped to optimise interconnection and interoperability of national networks within the European transport network (56%); and has contributed to removing bottlenecks and bridging missing links (54%). Figure6: In your view, to what extent has the cooperation between core network and rail freight corridors addressed key efficiency measures in the following areas (n=198) Source: Support study for the evaluation of Regulation (EU) N 1315\/2013 global survey There was less agreement that the cooperation between core network and rail freight corridors supported the application of innovative technologies (47%), reduced operational and administrative barriers (40%) and addressed the issue of completion and thus capacity between freight and urban transport (29%). There were significant differences between EU regions, with global survey respondents from Western Europe rating the extent to which cooperation between core networks and rail freight corridors addressed key efficiency measures pronouncedly lower in all areas, compared with respondents from the remaining regions. Additional contributions to the OPC highlighted that the responsibilities between RFCs and TEN-T CNCs in the field of investment planning indeed need clarification. Furthermore activities between the two should be better coordinated and promoted at EU level, to enable an efficient functioning of the networks across the Union. Findings from case studies 2, 3 and 4 show mixed opinions regarding the degree to which the integration between CNCs and RFCs has been efficient (see box below). While stakeholders generally confirm that, there is a very close relationship between the RFCs and the CNCs they also highlight the need for clarification of the different roles and competences of CNCs and RFCs, and thus confirm the observations above: The RFCs geographical alignments reflect market needs for rail freight. Therefore, the alignments are partly different from the alignments of TEN-T-corridors. Provisions should be included in the new TEN-T Regulation, enabling the RFCs to provide input into the development of the CNC work plan, including their investment needs for all core lines and core terminals designated to a specific RFC. Provisions concerning the relation between RFCs and CNCs should not undermine the CNCs' main responsibility for drafting the investment plans and should in no way infringe on the roles and competencies of the RFCs. In summary, RFCs are broadly aligned with the TEN-T corridors in geographical terms. However, their objectives differ and are complementary. While the TEN-T deals with infrastructure construction and project identification, the RFC look at the operational and customer side (timetabling, slot allocation etc.). Alignment of investment planning and project identification between the two legislations shall be ensured. The full benefit of the RFC will only materialize once the underlying network has been developed. Extent to which the Regulation enables efficient use of TEN-T infrastructure for freight transport Freight transport and logistics are key for European industry competitiveness and sustainable growth but depend on a high-quality transport infrastructure network that allows efficient, seamless, cross-border co-modal transport. In this regard the TEN-T Regulation establishes that in order to ensure the international mobility of passengers and goods, the capacity of the trans-European transport network and the use of that capacity should be optimised by removing infrastructure bottlenecks and bridging missing infrastructure links, thus enabling the efficient use of TEN-T infrastructure. As has been shown in other parts of this document there has been significant progress in implementing the TEN-T network. In the corridor studies and work plans of the European coordinators it is widely acknowledged that implementing the requirements set in the regulation has made the network more efficient. However, given the completion deadline for the core network being 10 years away major bottlenecks and missing links still need to be addressed and the full network benefit has not yet been achieved. For example implementation rate of ERTMS (see chapter 3) remains low, the requirements for 740m trains and minimum 22.5t axle weight are not yet available throughout the network and sufficient multimodal terminal infrastructure is often still lacking throughout the territory. This is penalising the competitiveness of rail freight. In particular the possibility to run 740m long trains would create immediate capacity gains and trains productivity gains. In addition, while the completion of major infrastructure projects such as the HSL Munich-Berlin (see chapter 3), the HSL London-Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam-Cologne or the Oresund fixed link have greatly improved the efficiency of the transport system other major cross-border links such as the Brenner Base tunnel or Rail Baltica are not yet completed. The efficient use of TEN-T infrastructure requires the development of the network as foreseen in the Regulation as a necessary conditions, but further conditions for the efficiency of the network are determined in complementary legislation. An example here are pricing and tolling approaches that can affect modal choice and thus the efficient use of the infrastructure available. However, such measures are determined by MS individually. Another example is the priority setting by Member States in infrastructure construction and maintenance investments. The most noteworthy contributions on this question have been collected through the OPC. Here survey participants were asked to provide their feedback on the extent to which the TEN-T guidelines achieved a better and more efficient use of existing and new infrastructure while increasing benefits for the users. While thirty-two percent of respondents asserted that the Regulation either completely (10%) or mostly (22%) helped to increase the efficiency of infrastructure use and provision in the EU overall and 40% reported that it partly helped the picture for the freight sector was much more negative. Here only 7% of respondents indicated that the aim had been mostly met, while the broad majority was split between those who reported that the objective had been partially met (63%), those who believed that it had not been met (16%) and those who did not have an opinion on this particular aspect. In addition participants from the OPC recommended the adoption of a new EU KPI on infrastructure safety in TEN-T policy and along the TEN-T network in order to ensure a better and more efficient use of existing and new infrastructure. Extent to which the Regulation enables the efficient use of TEN-T infrastructure for high quality and innovative passenger mobility services 104 This question has been replied to under evaluation question N 6. 5.4.Coherence The evaluation of coherence involves assessing whether or not different actions work well together. It helps highlighting areas where there are complementarities or synergies, which improve overall performance; or sheds light on issues that are contradictory or cause inefficiencies. In the evaluation both the \"internal\" coherence - how the various provisions and requirements of the TEN-T Regulation to achieve their objectives and the \"external\" coherence the alignment of the TEN-T Regulation with other EU policies in transport and relevant areas - have been assessed. 5.4.1.Evaluation Question 10: How coherent and consistent are the requirements and provisions set out in the Regulation with one another and with related transport policy fields? To what extent are there differences, overlaps and\/or inconsistencies? Coherence of provisions with one another Most respondents to the global survey agreed or strongly agreed that the different provisions of the TEN-T Regulation are coherent among themselves (79%). Also stakeholders taking part in the global interviews did not see major contradictions or overlaps. Respondents to the Open Public Consultation came to a similar conclusion but also considered that there are a number of gaps and inconsistencies in the TEN-T Regulation. 68% of the respondents to the global survey, for example, saw incoherencies between the provisions for the different transport modes Stakeholders from the maritime sector (notably from ports) who took an active part in the different consultations, pointed to the complexity of the eligibility criteria for Motorways of the Sea and underlined their strong similarity with cross-border projects for land transport modes. They also questioned the differentiation between \"tourists\" and \"passengers\" - which is made in no other sector. Stakeholders from the inland waterway sector saw incoherencies. Especially the findings in the maritime sector are strongly confirmed by expert work within the Commission, which is underpinned by external expert groups around definitions such as \"core\" and \"comprehensive\" inland ports. In spite of the fact, that the majority of the respondents to the different surveys saw a large level of inner coherence between the provisions of the Regulation, the disagreement rate remains high and calls for efforts to enhance this coherence. Gaps and inconsistencies in the Regulation as seen in the OPC, various targeted stakeholder consultations and internal analysis of the Commission Incoherencies between the provisions for the different modes, for example in terms of priority setting (very challenging on inland waterways; lacking attention for national specificities in rail, different levels of detail and clarity for example lack of clarity around power supply and LNG terminals in seaports). Incoherent provisions for the enabling of services for passengers on the one hand and for freight on the other (the lack of a passenger perspective is, for example, highlighted in case study n 8) Repetition around multi-modal infrastructures, where many of the provisions apply in a similar way to the different terminal types and could benefit from horizontal streamlining (support in OPC and strongly underpinned by the Commission's own expert analysis) Incoherencies between objectives, measures and priorities within the provisions of the Regulation Incoherencies between common provisions of the TEN-T Regulation, in level of detail and clarity or applicability\/relevance, e.g. in relation to urban nodes, safety, security, resilience or freight services (results from case study findings, for example n 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 as well as from own expert work of the Commission, backed by expert group input). Need for clearer links between Motorways of the Sea and the Core Network Corridors; Besides the assessment of the current provisions of the Regulation, stakeholders also looked for coherence with new developments, notably on military mobility and infrastructure for zero and low emission mobility. In such areas, the Regulation lacks relevance (see EQs 2 and 3), and the evaluation recommends adjustment of the Regulation to ensure coherence in the future. Coherence of provisions with other transport policy fields As outlined in previous chapters the TEN-T infrastructure policy is directly linked to most other transport policy areas such multi-modality, alternative fuels, digitalisation, freight and passenger transport services, automation etc. Indeed, TEN-T does not only complement such initiatives but is rather the infrastructural basis for them to function. For example, there cannot be modal shift without the respective infrastructure in sufficient capacity in place. However, looking at the coherence with those other transport fields the evaluation has found that even though the provisions of the TEN-T Regulation are mostly coherent with developments in other transport fields, rapid developments in some areas are putting this coherence into question. In this vein, most respondents to the global survey agreed or strongly agreed that the provisions in the TEN-T Regulation are coherent with other ongoing and expected developments in most transport policy areas such as multi-modality (69% agreement); alternative fuels (68%); digitalisation (68%); new technologies (65%); freight transport services (64%); passenger transport services (60%); automation (54%). Agreement was less pronounced in the field of accessibility for all (49%) as well as in the area of new mobility schemes (46%). Respondents to the OPC, partly asked about the same policy fields (e.g. on alternative fuel infrastructure or an automation) and partly about different ones (e.g. urban mobility or new mobility patterns), on the contrary, saw a high degree of incoherence. Only one third found the Regulation to be coherent with ongoing and expected future developments. Interviewees called in particular for strengthened provisions to accelerate decarbonisation in transport and meeting the EU climate-neutral vision laid down in the \"A Clean Planet for All\" Strategy 105 (see also EQ 1 on Relevance). Evaluation findings related to coherence with connected policy areas are further detailed below. Coherence with urban mobility policies Findings from the desk research carried out under Case Study 1 underpinned by stakeholders interviewed showed a certain degree of coherence between urban mobility policies and the provisions of the TEN-T Regulation on urban nodes, specifically highlighting Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) as potential good practices for the connection between TEN-T network infrastructure and local\/regional infrastructure. However, planning principles, such as the top-down approach adopted at TEN-T level and the approach for SUMP planning, as well as the single project focus on TEN-T level and the integrated measure packages for SUMP planning, were seen as contrasting. Comments from online survey respondents in Case Study 1 highlighted that the Regulation lacks a focus on functionalities of urban nodes as hubs for both passenger and freight transport. In addition, survey findings also suggested that the scope on transport nodes is too narrow, as it excludes other relevant local\/regional transport hubs. Moreover, uptake of innovative solutions in urban nodes are not considered to be adequately addressed in the Regulation's provisions. Coherence with developments in the field of alternative fuels The TEN-T Regulation foresees that alternative clean fuels shall be made available along the core network for maritime and inland waterway, road and air transport. As could be seen from the Commission's own work, this focus on the core network is too narrow to really help promoting the uptake of alternative fuels across borders and in all regions of the EU. Furthermore, these provisions lack specificity (while generally respecting the principle of technological neutrality), which entails risks of isolated approaches, cross-border discontinuity or technological barriers. This is due to insufficient requirements in the current AFID Directive which is therefore currently under revision in order to fill this gap. The TEN-T Regulation shall provide the geographical and infrastructural basis for the deployment of alternative fuels, but will not include new standards or requirements for alternative fuels going beyond what the new AFID Directive will define. Consequently, respondents to the global survey stated a general lack of attention in the TEN-T Regulation on the development of renewable energy (infrastructure) and highlighted the need to speed up the deployment of a coherent and accessible cross-border infrastructure for alternative fuels. In this respect, the Regulation was found to be outdated and in need to be brought in line with the aspirations of the European Green Deal. Respondents particularly emphasised that deployment of the alternative fuel infrastructure needed to be made a general priority of the Comprehensive Network as it already is for the Core Network and that the TEN-T Regulation needed to fully recognise the electrification needs in both networks. Relevant ongoing initiatives in the Commission have already fully integrated such stakeholder assessment. The TEN-T Regulation reflects the status of 2013 - in the field of alternative fuels as in many other transport policy areas. The EU Directive on Alternative Fuel Infrastructure 106 (AFID), setting more specific requirements with a direct link to TEN-T core network infrastructure was only adopted in 2014. Therefore, it will now be an obvious matter of coherence, to take up requirements from the AFID as new binding requirements in TEN-T. More importantly, given the fast developments in this sector and their key importance for decarbonisation in transport, the AFID is currently in the process of revision (legislative proposal foreseen for mid-2021). In order to ensure coherence, the evaluation points to a need of aligning TEN-T Regulation and the AFID which will be revised in future. In this context, the work of the Commission also confirms the need for an extension of binding requirements from the core to the comprehensive network. Coherence with research and innovation policies, new technologies and digitalisation More than half (65%) of the respondents to the global survey agreed or strongly agreed that the provisions in the TEN-T Regulation are coherent with expected developments connected to new technologies. However, findings from the desk research showed that the implementation of new technologies and innovation in the TEN-T network still follows an ad-hoc approach 107 . The deployment of new technologies is at times fragmented and unsynchronised and, the level of research and innovation maturity tends to vary between Core Network Corridors. In this respect several stakeholders interviewed in Case Study 4 argued that Article 33 of the TEN-T Guidelines on 'New Technologies and Innovation' could be reinforced to better support innovation by including testing, standardisation, certification and deployment stages for autonomous modes of transport. As regards digitalisation the majority of respondents to the case study 6 survey (65%) agreed or strongly agreed that TEN-T projects in the field of digitalisation are coherent with or complementary to relevant research and innovation projects. However, less than half (39%) agreed or strongly agreed that the provisions of the Regulation are sufficient to ensure coherence between the deployment of digital infrastructure across the TEN-T network, with a larger percentage of respondents (49%) disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with the statement. An example for the deployment of digital infrastructure across the TEN-T to promote an innovative technology and to stimulate sustainable and attractive user services is C-ITS. The lacking relevance of the TEN-T Regulation for such future-oriented transport and mobility solutions was also highlighted in EQ 3 (reference to case study n 4). Coherence with ITS (road) policy, including the basis for multi-modal and new mobility patterns Opinions of respondents to the global survey were divided when asked whether the provisions in the TEN-T Regulation are coherent with expected developments connected to new mobility schemes, with 46% who agreed or strongly agreed, 33% who disagreed or strongly disagreed. Stakeholders consulted in the framework of Case Study 4 expressed more positive views on this issue with more than half (58%) agreeing or strongly agreeing An example of such a new mobility scheme can be found in the ITS Directive, referred to in Article 3 of the TEN-T Regulation. It can for example serve as a basis for the adoption of a coherent set of rules at EU level in order to create a single market for cooperative, connected and automated vehicles. In addition, the Delegated Regulations adopted on the basis of the C-ITS Directive, for instance on road safety, real-time-traffic and multimodal travel information, provide the necessary legal and technical framework to steer and ensure the interoperability of deployed ITS services along the TEN-T network. The Evaluation of the ITS Directive 108 , pointed out that the integration of ITS applications and cooperative systems with transport infrastructure can improve efficiency, usability and reduce costs. Coherence with passenger rights legislation Passengers Rights is a field where constant progress has been made over the last decade. Better protecting consumers and allowing for EU-wide rules and procedures in case of delays and cancellations of transport services has been a clear EU priority. Although TEN-T is an infrastructure policy, its final aim is to enable seamless mobility for passengers and freight across the EU. It can thus be a bridge for the different passenger rights legislations, especially regarding persons with disabilities and reduced mobility. In this regard some stakeholders interviewed for Case Study 8 pointed out that it is important that TEN-T policy acts as a bridge for the different passenger rights legislations, especially regarding persons with disabilities and reduced mobility. However less than half of respondents to the online survey (19 out of 42) agreed or strongly agreed that the definition of accessibility (Article 37) in the TEN-T Regulation is coherent with other European policies, such as the European Accessibility Act and the Regulations on passenger rights. Coherence between passenger and freight transport provisions across modes Findings on Case Study 3 highlighted different views in relation to the coherence between passenger and freight transport in the different modes of Transport. Maritime, inland waterways and multimodal transport stakeholders argued that passengers are not duly taken into account in the TEN-T Regulation. On the other hand, stakeholders related to air transport emphasised the opposite, meaning that passengers are well covered while the same does not happen with air cargo. 5.4.2.Evaluation Question 11: How coherent is the TEN-T Regulation with other EU policy areas and other Trans-European network policies? Coherence with other relevant EU policies While the TEN-T Regulation naturally links to cohesion, internal market, urban and neighbourhood policies it also links to Digitalisation, Climate, Environmental, Energy, public health and Research policies via its provisions on Intelligent Transport Systems, Innovation and Alternative Fuels. Since adoption of Regulation 1315\/2013, these policy areas have been quickly evolving especially with a view to Energy, Climate and Digitalisation policies and the political context has been dramatically changing most notably with the European Green Deal Agenda and the Climate Target Plan. For example the Green Deal calls for GHG emission reductions in the transport sector of 90% between 1990-2050 on the path towards climate neutrality of the economy overall. Literature sources clearly point to the fact that the trans-European networks can help to deliver on long-term green and inclusive growth for the EU 109 and contribute to achieving European climate goals and the objectives from the COP 21 Paris Agreement. 110 The results of the consultation activities undertaken in the course of the evaluation show that the TEN-T Regulation is perceived as coherent with regards to other EU policies to a certain extent, but further alignments are recommended to increase the impact of the Regulation going forward. This is confirmed by stakeholders in the global survey who agreed or strongly agreed that the TEN-T Regulation is coherent with other EU policies in the areas of: environmental, climate and resource efficiency (76%); social\/territorial policy (69%); urban policy (66%); trade\/ international competitiveness (62%); neighbourhood and cooperation with third countries (57%); international agreements related (56%) and research\/innovation (56%). Figure 7: To what extent do you agree that the TEN-T Regulation is coherent with other relevant EU policies (n=198) Source: Support study for the evaluation of Regulation (EU) N 1315\/2013 global survey However, when asked to specify their answers respondents most frequently centred on the topic of environmental, climate and resource efficiency, emphasising the need for a closer alignment between the TEN-T Regulation and the Renewable Energy and Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directives, and calling for stronger coherence between the TEN-T Regulation and the new proposal for a European Green Deal. The responses to the global interviews point in the same direction. While acknowledging the coherence of the Regulation with other EU policies and initiatives, interviewees called for further alignment with the EU Green Deal; Road safety; Alternative fuels; CO2 emission standards; Clean Vehicles Directive. Furthermore respondents mentioned that synergies with other sectors, such as the energy sector, the defence sector (military mobility), the environmental sector and urban mobility (SUMPs) could be better developed. Whereas TEN-T policy provides the strategic framework for a wide and long-distance traffic network, which includes urban nodes as transfer points, urban policy as such addresses local transport within urban nodes. As such there is no inconsistency between TEN-T and urban policy but instead a high complementarity. Answers to the OPC on this question were mixed and in some instances contradictory to the results of the global survey and the interviews. Areas in which more respondents noted that there was sufficient coherence compared to insufficient coherence included: structural and cohesion policy (45%), economic\/trade policy (40%), and sustainable urban mobility policy (37%). Areas in which more respondents reported that there was insufficient coherence included: environmental policy (41%), cooperation with third countries (32%), and social\/employment policy (23%). Coherence with other trans-European networks' policies This section looks at the coherence of the TEN-T Regulation with regards the other two trans-European networks, Energy and Telecommunications. As specified in Article 5 of the TEN-T Regulation the network shall be planned, developed and operated in a resource-efficient way taking into account possible synergies with other networks, in particular trans-European energy or telecommunication networks. While the three regulations objectives are broadly aligned and coherent with each other the evaluation has found very little evidence that those synergies have occurred to the extent anticipated. Consequently, the majority of stakeholders consulted on this question stated that they did not know whether TEN-T Regulation was coherent with TEN-Energy (45%) and TEN-Telecom (60%) as can be seen from figure 7. In case of TEN-Energy 33% expressed agreement or strong agreement that TEN-T was coherent while 21% disagreed or strongly disagreed. In the case of TEN-Telecom, those numbers were 33% and 8% respectively. This hints to a potential for a better alignment and the creation of more synergies between the trans-European policies. The new CEF will rectify this to some extent. More synergies can also be expected due to the revised TEN-E Regulation (e.g. on alternative fuels). Some further evidence on this question could be obtained from the case studies although with a more forward looking angle. According to case study 4 stakeholders, discussing the growing relevance of ITS systems for the completion of the network, and taking into consideration resilience principles, it is important to recognise that the digital layer of infrastructure will allow to expand the benefits beyond the TEN-T network and corridors design, spilling effects over regional and local streets. Nevertheless, 82% of Case Study 4 survey respondents considered that expected future challenges in transport call for more synergies with the other TEN policies, with 40% arguing that the TEN-T Regulation is not coherent with the objectives and priorities laid down in energy and telecommunications. Foresight experts also advocated editing the text of Article 31 (telematics applications) making a direct link to TEN-Telecom. Moreover, further alignment between these three areas has been highlighted by Hyperloop promoters, who confirmed that they are discussing standards with stakeholders from the energy and telecommunication sectors for their prototypes. 5.4.3.Evaluation Question 12: To what extent is the overall concept of the TEN-T, as set in the Regulation, complementary to relevant EU instruments? The ambitious goals to complete the core TEN-T network by 2030 and the comprehensive network by 2050 demand significant efforts to close gaps between the Member States, removing bottlenecks and overcoming technical barriers. The TEN-T provides the policy framework for EU funding in particular from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), as well as for interventions from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Furthermore, in its external dimension, it establishes a basis for EU funding in the field of pre-accession, enlargement, foreign policy cooperation and development aid. More than half of the respondents to the global survey were positive about the contribution of these EU instruments to TEN-T implementation. Furthermore, most stakeholders agreed or strongly agreed that TEN-T policy, besides the main instruments CEF, ESIF and EIB interventions, provides a very good basis for the combination of relevant EU resources. There are, in particular, strong potentials for complementary and the generation of synergies with Instruments such as Horizon 2020 and other EU Research and Innovation programmes (COST or LIFE). Despite these positive views, work still needs to be reinforced in terms of strengthening synergies between programmes and instruments and their alignment with the policy orientation of the TEN-T Regulation. Extent to which TEN-T is complementary to EU funding instruments and programmes supporting transport infrastructure As has been shown in chapter 3 and as outlined in the 2014-2015 111 and 2016-2017 112 Progress Reports on implementation of the TEN-T network significant progress has been made in implementing the TEN-T network since the entry into force of this regulation. While the majority of the funding for the TEN-T network is provided by the member states, the support from the main EU funds available for TEN-T policy has been important. These funding instruments and programmes include: the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) The European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) i.e. the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF). European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and traditional European Investment Bank (EIB) lending. In addition, blending of EFSI with CEF and ESI funds was facilitated in order to maximise the use of the different forms of EU support 113 . Complementarity with the Connecting Europe Facility A broad majority of respondents to the global survey (82%) agreed or strongly agreed that the funding opportunities under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) are aligned with TEN-T priorities (82%). There was consensus that CEF is an important funding mechanism and that the CEF transport blending facility is very useful. However, stakeholders noted that the CEF budget alone was insufficient to fulfil the TEN-T requirements in the Member States. This sentiment was mirrored in the interviews complemented by the criticism that most CEF funding in the current programming period 2014-2020 has been invested in rail networks, leaving insufficient funding for other transport modes. Complementarity with other EU instruments Global survey respondents expressed high levels of agreement on the complementarity between TEN-T and other EU funding instruments, including with Horizon 2020 (75%), ESIF (67%) and other EU Research and Innovation programmes (63%). Although some regional differences could be identified. While most respondents from all regions agreed or strongly agreed that TEN-T is complementary to ESIF, this proportion was smaller among respondents from Western Europe (52%), compared with Central and Eastern (82%), Southern (72%) and Northern Europe (69%). Contrarily, the proportion of respondents who agreed or strongly agreed on the complementarity of EU Research and Innovation Programmes with TEN-T was smaller in Central and Eastern Europe (52%), compared with Southern (72%), Northern (69%) and Western Europe (61%). These regional differences can be explained by the fact that ESIF funds are especially relevant for cohesion countries, most of them Member States from Central and Eastern Europe which joined the EU in 2004 and 2007. The participation of these countries in Research and Innovation projects is increasing but is still lower in comparison to Member States in other regions. 5.5.EU added-value EU-added value looks for changes that can reasonably be argued are due to the EU intervention, and that exceed what could have been expected from national actions by the Member States. Under the principle of subsidiarity (Article 5 TFEU), and in areas of non-exclusive competence, the EU should only act when the objectives can be better achieved by Union action rather than action by the Member States alone. In this evaluation we have explored if the same results would have been achieved in the absence of the TEN-T Regulation, what would have been the impact of its discontinuation, and what value brings an EU-wide approach to the development of a trans-European transport network. 5.5.1.Evaluation Question 13: What is the EU added value of TEN-T policy as set in the Regulation? Could the results have been achieved at national\/regional level without the Regulation and what would have been the impacts of its discontinuation? What is the added value of the broadened stakeholder community in the implementation of TEN-T? Achievement of results at national and\/or regional level The 2011 White Paper on Transport identifies TEN-T as the infrastructure pillar of the Single European Transport Area. The network approach of the TEN-T policy was designed to remove bottlenecks and allow seamless and interoperable mobility throughout high capacity corridors. This ambition could not be addressed by Member States alone, since their jurisdiction ends at national borders. Within TEN-T, the Core Network Corridors are considered the backbone of the TEN-T, connecting international hubs and economic areas, being key to the free circulation of goods, services and workers in the international market, as well as connecting with other national, regional and local infrastructures. By that they are improving the accessibility of regions for citizens throughout the European Union. In the time since the implementation of this approach, the Core Network Corridors have reached maturity, having become an important tool to facilitate trade and international cooperation, which is also strongly driven by the unified efforts for reaching common infrastructure standards. The stakeholder consultation has shown a high level of agreement with regard to the EU added value of the TEN-T Regulation. The vast majority of respondents to the global survey (85% and 84%, respectively) disagreed or strongly disagreed that the results of the TEN-T policy could have been achieved at the regional level and at the national level without the TEN-T Regulation. This assessment was mirrored throughout the Case studies and in the global interviews. Effects if TEN-T policy would have been \/ would be discontinued As explained in chapter 1, TEN-T policy is a well established policy for almost three decades. It has constantly been evolving and broadened in scope. As has been shown earlier Member States have aligned their infrastructure transport plans to TEN-T priorities and objectives acknowledging the need for better pan-European transport connections in order to enhance passenger and trade flows within the internal market. The expected socio-economic effects of a discontinuation of TEN-T policy have been explored in the 2015 study on the cost of non-completion of TEN-T 114 . This study analysed the impact of non-completion of the core TEN-T network by 2030 assuming that core network implementation remains at the status of 2015. This means investment would not be made and transport time and cost savings of the TEN-T would not be achieved. The study found that the economic impacts of non-completion of the core TEN-T would be very substantial. The GDP of the EU would remain 1.8% lower and about 730,000 jobs would not be created in 2030. The study also found that discontinuing TEN-T investments in cross-border projects and in the deployment of innovative technologies would have the highest adverse effects in terms of GDP growth and employment. This confirms the added value of TEN-T in terms of creating cross- border transport links and filling missing links as well as deploying innovative transport solutions along the network. In addition to those findings, a model-based analysis was carried out as part of the evaluation support study (see Annex 3 for details). The baseline scenario developed for this exercise is drawing on the baseline scenario underpinning the Impact Assessment accompanying the revision of the TEN-T Regulation of 2013 but updating the macro-economic and technological assumptions. In addition, policy measures adopted by the end of 2019 have been considered, except for the implementation of the TEN-T regulation. This shows how the situation as regards transport activity and emissions would develop from end 2019 to 2050 in absence of the TEN-T policy. In comparing those results with the counterfactual (see EQ 15 for details) shows the impacts of the TEN-T regulation as revised in 2013. In the Baseline scenario (without the TEN-T Regulation in place) total passenger transport activity is projected to follow a steadily increasing trend from 2010 to 2050. The modal share of road transport (i.e. passenger cars, public transport, 2-wheelers) is found to slightly decrease from 83% in 2010 to 78% in 2050. The reduction in the modal share of road is due to the increase in the growth of aviation. As regards the developments in the passenger railway sector, model results indicate a rather stable modal share throughout the projection period, in absence of railway infrastructure investments related to the core and comprehensive network. In the Baseline scenario, the total freight transport activity is projected to grow in the period 2010-2050 driven by GDP growth. The absence of the TEN-T core and comprehensive network implementation fails to provide sufficient transport infrastructure coverage and inter-modal integration (road, rail and inland navigation) and, as a result, road freight continues to hold a relatively stable modal share until 2050. The modal shares of freight rail and inland navigation (incl. inland waterways and national maritime) are also projected to remain stable throughout the projection period. Overall CO2, NOx and PM emissions would be higher in the Baseline scenario as compared to the scenario with the TEN-T in place. When asking stakeholders on this specific point the vast majority of respondents to the global survey (95% and 92%, respectively) agreed or strongly agreed that through TEN-T European regions and cities and their citizen's benefit from enhanced connectivity and accessibility (see examples in chapter 3). The sentiment was echoed by interviewees who felt that if the Regulation were discontinued the negative impact would be particularly felt in relation to cross-border sections, interoperability and finally the internal market. Ongoing projects would be affected as their progress would be slower, they would be reduced in scope or even fully discontinued. Stakeholders also pointed to the added value in the coherent set of standards and requirements promoted by the Regulation which not only fosters interoperability but is also beneficial to industrial actors. In this respect discontinuing TEN-T would risk creating\/maintaining a patchwork of national and regional solutions hampering cross-border interoperability and negatively impacting competiveness of the European industry. Effects of the Broadened TEN-T community on the development of TEN-T Through the tool of corridor fora led by the European core network corridor coordinators TEN-T has brought together a variety of different stakeholders from different levels of government, different modes and different member states with a common interest to drive the development of their respective corridor (see also chapter 4). In the view of interviewees, this has facilitated the exchange of views and good practice and has fostered collaboration, especially along cross-border sections. Consequently, also 90% of respondents to the global survey agreed or strongly agreed that the broadened TEN-T community adds value to the establishment and development of trans-European networks. Effects in relation to the cooperation with neighbouring and third countries As outlined in chapter one the 2013 revision of the TEN-T regulation newly included indicative maps of the trans-European transport network extended to specific neighbouring countries. Moreover it empowered the Commission to adopt delegated acts extending those indicative maps to further neighbouring regions. From the experience gained with this exercise the indicative maps helped providing a reference point for cooperation on planning transport infrastructure development in those countries, with a view to guaranteeing continuity and fostering transport connectivity of the EU. They have been of strong mutual interest for the enhancement of strategic multi-modal transport connections between the EU and the neighbouring regions concerned as well as for the promotion of economic development and exchange. Their planning is based on the same methodology as that of the TEN-T within the EU and covers both the core and comprehensive network layers. Although these indicative network extensions do not automatically imply mandatory applicability of all TEN-T standards and requirements which have been set for the EU Member States they have helped sharing the EU's methodology for transport infrastructure deployment and for promoting EU's technical standards, regulatory aspects and best practices in terms of financing. They have furthermore given orientation to International Financial Institutions, relevant EU sources as well as national and private investors on where to focus their funding and activities in these region. A further new element is the enhanced cooperation between the EU and especially Asia in order to re-inforce the land transport corridors between those two regions in line with the EU Strategy on Connecting Europe and Asia. Also in this respect the TEN-T regulation including the indicative maps to third countries and the infrastructure standards has proven to be a valuable reference basis in order to align those connections in geographical as well as in technological terms. 5.5.2.Evaluation Question 14: What is the added value of the broad 'infrastructure' scope as defined in the Regulation? To what extent is it adequate to incorporate ongoing and expected future societal, economic and technological developments? To what extent are the binding infrastructure standards sufficient to establish a high-quality infrastructure? As laid out earlier the TEN-T Regulation defines infrastructure in a very broad sense. In addition to the items related to the physical infrastructure which are clearly defined (such as railway lines, bridges, tunnels, stations, waterways, docks, airports, terminals etc.), it includes much more flexible terms such as \"associated equipment\" or \"telematic applications\". Extent to which the 'infrastructure' scope is adequate to incorporate ongoing and expected future societal, economic and technological developments Desk research and interviews confirmed that the main areas where societal, economic and technological changes are expected to impact the current provisions of the regulation relate to digitalisation (including automation), and interoperability. Thus in the framework of the evaluation support study a dedicated case study on digitalisation was carried out. A large majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with statements relating to the added-value of addressing digitalisation at the EU level as related to the TEN-T Regulation. In particular, 77% of survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the TEN-T Regulation is more effective than similar national policies for the deployment of digital technologies across the TEN-T network. According to the stakeholders the reasons for this include: The need for cross-border cooperation in developing standards, specifications and interoperable systems along the network. One example was the creation of eCall call emergency centres (aka PSAPs Public Safety Answering Points). The funding of eCall call centres under CEF Transport, while a measure covered by TEN-T, benefits the whole road network and not simply the TEN-T corridors; The need to develop a European community of users in order to define needs and help shape solutions. Digitalisation efforts require a common understanding, common semantics, and agreements on data types and formats in order for the system to function as a unified and seamless one. Accordingly, it is important to have a pan-EU understanding, and in view of the majority of interviewees, TEN-T would be the right policy instrument to facilitate their development. Looking more ahead interviewees argued that digital infrastructure 115 should be seen as part of the physical infrastructure rather than as an add-on, which is currently the case. For the TEN-T network to take full advantage of the efficiency gains brought about by digitalisation, a minimum level of digital infrastructure needs to be put in place. The need to ensure connectivity along the network was also mentioned as an aspect where synergies with TEN-Energy and TEN-Telecom could be explored. Extent to which binding infrastructure standards are sufficient for establishing a high-quality infrastructure The desk research, the interviews and the survey found that the definition of harmonised standards to reach greater interoperability, sustainability and efficiency of the transport infrastructure network have been generally appropriate and of EU-added value. However, standards are currently applied in case of new construction, renovation and modernisation projects. There are currently no provisions in the TEN-T Regulation that allow for monitoring that the high-quality of the infrastructure, once attained, is being kept over time. While the maintenance of the TEN-T network is the responsibility of Member States, the (predictive) monitoring of infrastructure should be a focus of TEN-T policy. The issue of Monitoring and infrastructure standards has been further explored in case study 7. From the findings, it could be concluded that while TEN-T policy has played an important role in the development and improvement of infrastructure along the TEN-T network, the situation is less positive with regards the reduction in the quality gaps, monitoring and infrastructure maintenance between Member States. Each Member State has a specific inspection regime in place for the monitoring of infrastructure. 116 On the other hand, important strides have been made in the research relating to the monitoring of key infrastructures (such as bridges, tunnels or retaining walls). National and European research have helped develop a number of technologies which are being deployed. As has happened in other fields the TEN-T Regulation could support the sharing of good practices and the rolling-out of these technologies by introducing minimum standards for the monitoring of key infrastructure along the TEN-T network. Case Study 7 found furthermore that in terms of infrastructure construction, there are no binding standards set out in the TEN-T Regulation. Therefore, different standards are being used along the TEN-T network. While the result on the quality might arguably not differ much, the lack of harmonisation in these quality standards can have an adverse effect on the effectiveness of TEN-T objectives relating to infrastructure quality. The most widely used technical specifications are Eurocodes, a set of ten European standards specifying reference design codes for buildings and civil engineering works. They apply to the structural design of these works including geotechnical aspects, structural fire design and situations including earthquakes, execution and temporary structures. The Eurocodes standards are voluntary, but some Member States include them as part of their national legislation. Some interviewees were of the opinion that Eurocodes would be a good basis for technical specification for TEN-T infrastructure. However, there are some barriers to using Eurocodes. In particular, Eurocodes are technical specifications and not standards. As such, they are not compulsory. The case study also found that there were disagreements amongst stakeholders as to whether the introduction of some form of technical requirements for new infrastructure monitoring were necessary. 5.5.3.Evaluation Question 15: To what extent are there socio-economic benefits of the EU-wide network approach as compared to an approach focussing on a 'patchwork' of disconnected projects? This questions aims to establish whether the EU-wide network approach driven by the TEN-T Regulation (see chapter 3) has generated socio-economic benefits that would not have been possible to the same extent in the absence of the Regulation. The positive socio-economic benefits of the TEN-T regulation have been widely acknowledged in literature such as in the aforementioned 2018 study on the impact of TEN-T completion on growth, jobs and the environment. As highlighted above this study concludes that in 2030 by implementing only the TEN-T core network EU-GDP would be 1.6% higher and 800.000 people more would be employed compared to a scenario without TEN-T. The predecessor study on the cost of non-completion of TEN-T (see EQ13 for details) additionally concludes that the implementation of the core network, including the cross-border projects and the innovative technologies, has been key for the growth of Europe's economy during the 2008 post-financial crisis period. Economic impacts of the completion of the core network by 2030, for example, have been assessed in a study undertaken on behalf of the Commission and completed in 2019. This study has estimated that the full completion of the TEN-T core network generates cumulatively 7.5 million person years of employment until 2030. It is expected that the impacts may even increase after 2030, once the entire network is completed and the impacts from improved connectivity and accessibility will fully materialise. Significant employment impacts are expected, besides the direct and indirect effects during construction as well as the stimulation of regional economic activities, in innovative areas. Furthermore, the same study has shown that, thanks to the completion of the TEN-T core network, a 1.6 percent GDP increase will be achieved by 2030 compared to 2017. Furthermore the study showed the positive effects of the TEN-T Regulation on the efficiency of transport flows in the internal market, on social, economic and territorial cohesion (improved accessibility of all regions, entailing new economic opportunities), sustainability (congestion reduction through removal of bottlenecks) and on user benefits. In addition to that a modelling exercise has been undertaken in the framework of this evaluation (see EQ13 and Annex 3 for details). The current trends and policies scenario developed for this exercise assumes the completion of the TEN-T core and comprehensive network by 2030 and 2050 respectively. Comparing it to the baseline scenario (scenario without TEN-T implementation) shows the impacts of the revised TEN-T Regulation by 2050 in terms of transport activity and emissions. In terms of passenger transport activity the model results indicate a shift towards railways starting from 2020 onwards. Railways (i.e. aggregate of conventional and high-speed rail and tram-metro) are projected to increase their modal share by 1.1 p.p. in 2030 and 1.8 p.p. in 2050 compared to the baseline scenario. High-speed rail was found to significantly increase its modal share to 38% of the rail transport activity by 2030 (relative to 34% in the baseline scenario). In absolute terms, the difference in the transport activity of high-speed rail between the two scenarios is projected to be around 48 billion-pkm, in 2030 and 100 billion-pkm in 2050. In terms of freight transport activity the current trends and policies scenario sees the modal share of rail freight transport increasing by approx. 2 p.p. (compared to the baseline in 2030), and by more than 4 p.p. (compared to baseline in 2050) to the detriment of road freight transport. Inland navigation also shows some limited increase in its modal share by 2030 between the two scenarios. Model results indicate higher CO2 emissions in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario, by about 14 and 31 Mtons CO2 by 2030 and 2050, respectively (i.e. 1.8% and 5.4% increase in 2030 and 2050, respectively). In cumulative terms, the baseline scenario shows higher CO2 emissions relative to the current trends and policies scenario of about 73 and 530 Mt CO2 in 2030 and 2050, respectively (i.e. 0.6% and 2.1% increase in 2030 and 2050, respectively). NOx emissions would be about 22 and 36 ktons higher in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario by 2030 and 2050, respectively (i.e. 1.4% and 3.6% increase in 2030 and 2050, respectively). PM emissions are projected to be 2 and 3 ktons higher in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario by 2030 and 2050, respectively (i.e. 1.7% and 5.6% increase in 2030 and 2050, respectively). In cumulative terms, the baseline scenario shows higher NOx emissions of about 138 and 680 ktons NOx in 2030 and 2050, respectively, compared to current trends scenario (i.e. 0.4% and 1.2% increase in 2030 and 2050, respectively). PM emissions in cumulative terms are projected to be 10 and 53 ktons above current trends scenario in the baseline in 2030 and 2050, respectively (i.e. 0.5% and 1.6% increase in 2030 and 2050, respectively). These two examples show the positive socio-economic effects of the TEN-T regulation in terms of employment and GDP growth. It is furthermore shown that the Regulation positively contributes to reductions in emissions (mainly through modal shift, by enabling low and zero emission mobility as well as innovative transport solutions) and thus to the overall decarbonisation of the transport sector, even though the transport activity is overall increasing. Respondents to the global survey also corroborated the findings from the literature review. Asked on the extent to which the EU-wide network approach contributes to socioeconomic benefits, the vast majority indicated that it did so to a great or to some extent. Areas specially highlighted were; improved access to goods and services by users and economic operators (90%); improved mobility and accessibility (90%); time and cost savings (86%); increased competitiveness and attraction of economic activities (84%); wider range of suppliers and market networks (69%). Most respondents also indicated that the EU-wide network approach contributes to socioeconomic benefits to a great or to some extent in the areas of reduction of GHG emissions (69%) and wider access to labour and other social opportunities (69%). 6.Conclusions The overall evaluation of Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013, including two external studies as well as a wealth of internal work of the Commission services leads to the following conclusions: Elements of the Regulation that work well The application of the evaluation criteria shows that the TEN-T Regulation displays important strengths which are summarized as follows: Relevance All four specific objectives of the Regulation remain relevant. Individually and as a package of interdependent and mutually reinforcing objectives, they make relevant contributions to the general objectives of TEN-T policy guided by Title XVI of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (facilitating transport flows in the internal market, contributing to social, economic and territorial cohesion and integrating sustainability objectives). The specific objective \"enhancing efficiency of transport infrastructure to facilitate transport flows in the internal market\": Concrete targets, such as the removal of bottlenecks and missing links within and between all transport modes, the ensuring of interoperability and continuity of TEN-T infrastructure and the setting of common infrastructure standards for both existing and new infrastructure along the whole network, have been highly relevant so far, allowing to make steady progress with the implementation of projects on the core and comprehensive networks. These targets remain fully relevant with a view to completing the core and comprehensive networks by 2030 and 2050. The specific objective \"contributing to social, economic and territorial cohesion\": This objective, substantiated by targets such as the ensuring of a balanced infrastructure coverage of all EU regions, the interconnection between long-distance and regional\/local traffic or the ensuring of accessibility for all EU regions constitutes a cornerstone of the implementation of the integrated TEN-T network approach. It has also been fully relevant for the further process towards the completion of the core and comprehensive networks. . The specific objective \"sustainability\": The sustainable and efficient development of transport modes or the promotion of innovative measures to encourage low-carbon and clean transport, as targets substantiating this objective, have been relevant, but not specific and targeted enough. The combination of infrastructure enhancements (including binding quality standards), the facilitation of multi-modal solutions through strong focus on nodes, the broad coverage of 'telematics' as well as a rather open and flexible approach to innovation have provided an adequate basis for the achievement of the specific sustainability objective. They have provided an appropriate basis for efficiency enhancements or for the promotion of pilot action, but not for the deployment across the TEN-T network. On the other hand, the evaluation clearly shows that a TEN-T that shall keep pace with the new ambitions on decarbonisation until 2030 and beyond, depends on a substantial reinforcement of the concrete targets, measures and requirements underpinning the sustainability objective. The specific objective \"user benefits\": Targets such as the meeting of mobility needs of users in good quality, safety and security conditions or the consideration of needs for people with reduced mobility have been relevant so far. New types of user demand both in the passenger and freight sectors, enabled through technological progress, called for by decarbonisation challenges and stimulated through changing user behaviour, however, will necessitate significant adaptations of targets and measures to keep up with changing challenges towards the 2030 TEN-T policy objectives. The development of the dual layer trans-European transport network with the core and the comprehensive networks the key output of TEN-T policy overall remains relevant on the path towards completion aimed at for 2030 \/ 2050. The complementarity of the two network layers is most appropriate to address notably the \"internal market\" and the \"cohesion\" objectives in a mutually reinforcing way. The core network, which results from a single EU wide planning method and where major international transport flows are concentrated, has been highly relevant in setting a coherent basis for the identification and implementation of major infrastructure projects. This has given clear direction to investment at national and European level, aiming to fill missing links, remove bottlenecks and improve quality standards. Any substantial deviation from the design of this network layer or from its completion date would risk to diminish the efforts already spent since 2013 and reduce benefits. Given the long-term nature of TEN-T policy, furthermore, significant work is continuously carried out already now, with a view to meeting the 2030 completion objective. Core Network Corridors, a governance instrument introduced in 2013 to facilitate the identification and implementation of projects along such geographical corridors (representing between 70% and 80% of the core network), have been extremely relevant in enhancing cooperation across modes, Member States, regions, public and private actors. Indeed, the TEN-T corridor approach is recognised now as a multi-level governance system which has brought transport stakeholders (such as representatives of EU regions and infrastructure managers of all modes) to work together and has effectively focused on delivering EU added value. This has not been the case in the period before 2013. In addition, the identification and prioritisation of projects from a corridor-wide perspective has been seen as effective and beneficial. As a result and given the challenges ahead towards the 2030 objective, the evaluation concludes that this instrument fully maintains its relevance. The comprehensive network, as the 'lower level' network layer, also fully demonstrated its relevance so far. Its role as the reference basis for various EU transport policy legislation (such as on rail interoperability) emerged already in the first Guidelines in 1996. This capacity has been steadily advancing over time, along with progress in the Acquis in relevant transport sectors. The relevance of this dimension of TEN-T policy is expected to significantly grow in the future, towards the 2030 and 2050 time horizons. Especially the objective of zero and low emission mobility necessitates a wide range of new initiatives within and across all transport modes, which can only deploy their full benefits when built on a strong EU-wide infrastructure policy. As set out in the EU Connectivity Strategy on Connecting Europe and Asia, the cooperation with neighbouring and third countries as the second key output of the TEN-T Regulation has also been very relevant. It has been important to facilitate trade between the EU and neighbouring as well as other regions of the world. Third country cooperation on TEN-T policy (for example with China) has also been appropriate in promoting high European environmental and social standards as well as financial sustainability along land corridors to Asia. Common network planning activities with neighbouring countries, leading to indicative TEN-T extensions, on the other hand, are appropriate in setting a stable framework for concentrated transport infrastructure investment supported by EU sources and global international financial institutions. Again, recent international developments (such as the progress in the accession negotiations and signature of the Transport Community Treaty for the Western Balkans region) suggest that this approach remains relevant towards the 2030 \/ 2050 horizons and could further expanded. Effectiveness With the completion of more than 2000 projects along the nine core network corridors between 2013 and 2020, and with the identification of around 3000 projects (mostly already ongoing) towards the completion of the core network corridors by 2030, the implementation of the TEN-T Regulation works effectively. It demonstrates that, led by a single and strong European policy, action at national, regional and local, public and private as well as European level is aligned and implemented in an effective way. The steady completion of individual TEN-T projects generates gains in terms of travel time, service quality or model distribution; leading to economic, social and environmental benefits in the geographical areas directly concerned. The sum of such individual positive effects is, however, expected to be significantly exceeded once the network as a whole will be completed. A study carried out on behalf of the Commission estimated that 7.5 million person-years of jobs will be created cumulatively until 2030 both during construction and operation, thanks to enhanced connectivity and accessibility. Furthermore, for 2030, an additional GDP increase of 1.6% compared to 2017 is expected. These effects may even accelerate after 2030, once the network is fully operational. Areas and instruments that were newly introduced in 2013 (for example TEN-T provisions on urban nodes, provisions on innovation or not least the core network corridors' instrument) have been very effective so far. The new reference to \"innovation\", for example, led to the promotion of 12.000 charging points for e-mobility since 2013 (with the strong support of CEF funding). On urban nodes, the strengthened focus on the interconnection of major transport terminals in cities (e.g. rail and air or maritime terminals) as well as on infrastructure enabling smooth through traffic helped containing harmful emissions and reducing disruption of transport flows along corridors. With a view to the 2030\/2050 horizons especially in relation to new zero and low emission mobility objectives however, further effectiveness gains depend on reinforced relevance of the TEN-T Regulation. Efficiency Governance across Member States and sectors has reached a completely new level of quality which helps to make administrative gains through multilevel governance. The most evident example in this respect are the core network corridors. The coordination between core network corridors (focusing on infrastructure development) and rail freight corridors (focusing on operational aspects) has also led to efficiency gains. This streamlines cooperation between different actors and leads to additional benefits on substance, namely through more efficient management of long distance rail freight services. Coherence The paramount strengths of the TEN-T Regulation on coherence lies in its close integration with all relevant transport policy areas (modal policies, i.e. rail, inland waterways, ports, airports, transport strategies). Coherence was also found to be good in linking the TEN-T as the policy framework with relevant financial instruments (notably CEF, ESIF and EIB loans and Financial Instruments). With a view to new challenges towards the 2030 \/ 2050 objectives, stronger coordination with related EU instruments in fields such as R&I, urban mobility or environmental protection, however, was found to be appropriate. Added value Since its establishment as an EU policy in 1993, the added value of TEN-T policy overall has always been strongly affirmed by Member States, regions, cities and industrial stakeholders. Concentrating efforts towards the creation of a common, Europe-wide transport network is clearly acknowledged as a vision (and well progressing achievement) whose benefits go beyond isolated national action. TEN-T policy also attracts increasing interest outside the EU, notably in neighbouring States but also in other regions of the world, for example in relation to the extension of land transport connections to Asia 117 . Ensuring a common and coherent EU-wide basis for the identification of 'projects of common interest' and, correspondingly, for the alignment of planning and implementation efforts of a wide range of actors is a clear and widely recognised added value. This was made possible due to the introduction of the full (dual layer) TEN-T network approach in 2013. Such a concentration of efforts towards a common EU objective in transport infrastructure policy, in combination with key ambitions of broader transport policy, would not have been possible without Regulation (EU) 1315\/2013. TEN-T cooperation with third countries, as one of the areas which were newly introduced in 2013, also generated significant added value which would have been unachievable through Member States' action alone. Elements of the Regulation that work less well Relevance In the light of new political and societal challenges notably in the fields of decarbonisation, digitalisation and increasing risks of unforeseen crisis events the relevance of the TEN-T Regulation was found to be insufficient, especially with a view to the 2030 and 2050 policy objectives. Most importantly under the two specific objectives \"sustainability of the network\" and \"increased benefits for users\", the evaluation identified a lack of concrete targets and measures needed to ensure the appropriate infrastructural basis for the achievement of the challenging objectives of the transport system as a whole and of the European Green Deal overall. More concretely, in relation to the specific objective \"sustainability\", the Regulation lacks relevance in fields such as digitalisation, automation and other forms of innovation which go hand in hand with infrastructure development and are vital enablers of efficiency enhancements and the massive spreading of zero and low carbon mobility. In this respect, also interoperability needs are insufficiently addressed. Openness for new and unforeseeable developments is inadequately considered. Current provisions are inappropriate to ensure network-wide continuity of relevant requirements (to overcome the present rather isolated approach, largely building on pilot action). Step changes in the digital transition, entailing increasing integration of infrastructure, vehicles and connected services across all modes are not duly reflected in the TEN-T Regulation. The above shortcomings not only hamper the achievement of the \"sustainability\" objective but also the generation of \"increased benefits for users\" which both in the passengers and freight sectors are increasingly connected with digitalisation and innovation. The increase of user benefits through technological progress depends in a particular way on a fully developed 'physical' infrastructure network (including strong complementarity between core and comprehensive networks), and it also challenges the mode oriented structure of the TEN-T. The evaluation found also shortcomings in relation to the functioning of urban and transport nodes (insufficiencies in network integration, design of transfer hubs, accessibility conditions for all users, last mile connections, smooth information services, complementarity between TEN-T and sustainable urban mobility planning, including clean and innovative solutions). They hamper up-to-date responses to new user needs for integrated door-to-door services, building on a seamless and efficient combination of various TEN-T elements. This category of problems again, weakens the achievement of the \"sustainability\" and \"user benefits\" objectives. Although this applies to both passenger and freight solutions, it was found to be more evident in the passengers' sector. Finally, some specific quality requirements for rail, road and inland waterways as well as requirements for the maritime dimension of TEN-T were found to be insufficient or inappropriate. Such problems (for example a lack of coherent equipment of terminals to accommodate 740 m long trains) may affect the continuity and sustainability of services, or they undermine improved social conditions (for example through a shortage of safe and secure parking areas for heavy goods vehicles). Such problems also put the preparedness of TEN-T infrastructure for extreme weather events, security threats or other unforeseen events at risk. Adaptation to climate change, international developments or pandemics, however, require a more resilient TEN-T infrastructure. The increasing functional complementarity of core and comprehensive network layers challenge the sometimes differing ambitions with regard to standards and requirements of both network layers. Effectiveness While the TEN-T Regulation, overall, has been very effective in identifying thousands of projects on the basis of a single Europe-wide policy framework, and while a large number of them is completed and brings benefits in terms of connectivity, accessibility, sustainability and user improved user services already, there remain problems of delays for a number of projects. It should be recognized that the time horizon for the completion of the core network is still nine years ahead and even 29 years for the comprehensive network. On the other hand an in-depth analysis of the implementation of the projects is needed in view of the 2030 horizon for the completion of the core network, in view of identifying the possible measures needed to help Member States reaching this objective (taking into account the limited EU and national budgetary means). As causes for project implementation delays, the evaluation found factors such as complex preparatory procedures, remaining divergences between agreed European objectives and national infrastructure and investment planning or limited EU level governance tools compared with the challenges at stake. There remains a challenge to ensure full alignment of national interests and responsibilities with TEN-T objectives, and in particular the priorities identified in the corridor work plans, while respecting subsidiarity. In addition, delayed projects are very closely monitored and several measures are already taken to reduce such delays (e.g. through the streamlining initiative or via a firm engagement of European Coordinators). Effectiveness was also seen at risk as a result of financial constraints. As far as the TEN-T Regulation is concerned, the latter can be addressed by further boosting resource efficiency and strengthening priority setting, while the provision of budgetary resources is not subject to TEN-T policy. Efficiency While the instrument of the core network corridors, including the European Coordinators, has been found to be both highly relevant and effective, their future efficiency could be hampered by an obvious shortage of capacity\/ resources in relation to the coordination challenge at stake. Coherence A major potential incoherence between the provisions of the TEN-T Regulation and other relevant policy areas was found in the field of infrastructure for low and zero emission transport and mobility. In these areas, concrete legislative initiatives are in preparation (the revision of AFID Directive, FuelEU Maritime and the ReFuel Aviation initiatives). The TEN-T evaluation highlights the importance (in line with the European Green Deal) of alignment of the requirements for the TEN-T infrastructure with the future legal requirements that may be adopted as a consequence of these new initiatives. At the same time, this 'coherence' problem also presents a lack of relevance of the TEN-T Regulation with regard to the need for continuous availability of charging and refuelling infrastructure for low and zero emission mobility along the whole TEN-T. Some gaps were also identified in relation to the inner coherence of the different provisions of the TEN-T Regulation. While the provisions for the different transport modes follow a coherent structure (components, requirements, development priorities), the coverage of transport nodes lacks coherence in this context. Although most of the references to nodes refer to the freight sector, commonalities between the different terminals in functional terms were considered to be insufficiently addressed. The functionality dimension for passengers is basically lacking for waterborne transport and rail (including its key role as transfer points to local and regional transport in cities). Generally, also from the user benefits perspective, freight and passenger transport are treated incoherently. The evaluation also identified some incoherence between the different horizontal provisions of Chapter II on the comprehensive network, e.g. on accessibility for all users, safety, security or 'telematics'. While it has been proven that coordination between core network corridors and rail freight corridors has also led to efficiency gains, potential synergies between the two instruments, e.g. as to ensure better coherence between the infrastructural side of the core network corridors and the operational side of the rail freight corridors, have not been sufficiently exploited. Indeed, the coexistence of two separate structures with sometimes even different geographical alignments or overlapping activities is not optimal. Striving for further synergies between and better alignment of the two instruments would thus certainly be beneficial in terms of investment planning, project identification and governance. Lessons learnt In the following, the main lessons learnt are grouped in accordance with the five evaluation criteria while, at the same time, taking account of the four subject areas which were identified at the beginning of the evaluation (network design, network features\/quality, network use and implementation instruments). Relevance All four specific objectives of the TEN-T Regulation remain relevant. Especially for the objectives \"efficient infrastructure to facilitate the internal market\" and \"territorial, economic and social cohesion\", the targets and measures substantiating these objectives remain also widely relevant. The two objectives \"sustainability\" and \"increasing benefits for users\", on the other hand, require substantial reinforcement of underlying targets and measures. It also needs to be underlined that all objectives remain equally important since there are complementary to each other. Nevertheless, with regard to the specific objectives \"efficiency of infrastructure development to facilitate the internal market\" and \"social, economic and territorial cohesion\", there is a strong need to advance on requirements enhancing the quality of the TEN-T infrastructure. This is essential to cope with future challenges, also in the context of sustainability and improved user benefits. Some reinforcement may also be needed in relation to the accessibility of peripheral, outermost and insular regions. For the specific objective \"sustainability\", the lack of appropriateness to enable decarbonisation in line with the objective of the European Green Deal, to cope with the digital transition and with challenges of natural and human-made disasters or other unforeseen challenges needs to be overcome. This necessitates adjusted targets and reinforced \/ extended requirements. The reduction of transport emissions by 90% by 2050 cannot be achieved without a proper TEN-T network allowing for greener transport. For the specific objective \"increasing user benefits\", the TEN-T Regulation could be advanced to strengthen the identification, combination and implementation of projects from the perspective of integrated door-to-door user services. This current lack of appropriateness seems to be particularly evident in the passengers' sector. In addressing this relevance issue, digitalisation and other new technologies should play a key role. For the dual layer trans-European transport network, the design structure (in accordance with the existing network planning methodology) as well as the completion deadlines of 2030 and 2050 have proven their appropriateness. To achieve the full and timely completion targets, notably for the core network, the evaluation shows the need to reinforce implementation instruments at EU level and to stimulate a stronger commitment of Member States. Complementarity between core and comprehensive networks could be strengthened. This could help overcoming some remaining accessibility and connectivity gaps. Not least, it is expected to help ensuring the broadest possible and most effective coverage of new infrastructure quality parameters, especially for zero and low emission mobility or digitalisation, and it could facilitate a larger reach of innovative user services. Where necessary, strengthened complementarity between core and comprehensive networks could also be ensured through an alignment of standards and requirements in fields such as railway infrastructure, rail safety or urban nodes. Effectiveness Effectiveness of TEN-T implementation especially in the light of the new challenges and objectives that could be correspondingly extended could be further enhanced through a strengthening of EU instruments (e.g. European Coordinators, delegated acts, accountability of Member States). Efficiency The TENtec system works relatively well and is mostly appreciated by stakeholders. In relation to the reporting and monitoring obligations set out in the TEN-T Regulation more generally, the evaluation suggests that there is some need for streamlining and strengthening these tools of TEN-T policy. Coherence Achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal would require that the TEN-T infrastructure requirements are fully aligned with the provisions resulting from the other policy initiatives in the fields of AFID, FuelEU Maritime and the ReFuel Aviation. In an appropriate way (by taking account of their new qualities in relation to TEN-T policy), there is a need to enhance coherence with the challenges of the digital transition and other new technologies. This requires attention to be given to a proper balance between fixed \/ long-term infrastructure requirements and fast progressing developments building strongly on industrial innovation; between infrastructure development objectives and changing user needs. There is some need for enhancing the inner coherence between the provisions of the TEN-T Regulations. Synergies between trans-European network policies in transport, energy and digitalisation are important for higher user benefits, efficiency and the strongest possible contribution to transport decarbonisation. To conclude: Both the work on core network corridors and the relevant procedures in Member States show that the planning and decision making process on TEN-T has been largely suitable to achieve the policy's objectives, in spite of a need for specific reinforcements. When the 2013 revision of the TEN-T Regulation saw a shift from a largely priority projects' based approach to a full network approach, this did not disrupt the continuous transport infrastructure development the EU had embarked on under preceding TEN-T legislation. Key projects (notably the former priority projects, often in pivotal geographical positions) remained vital elements of an overall European network. The additional strong focus on the functional side of the network, through a wide range of common standards and requirements, reinforced the link between infrastructure and transport policy objectives as well as service quality. Member States reflect TEN-T development objectives reasonably well in their transport infrastructure related procedures. All this suggests that TEN-T policy, between 2013 and 2020, has well paved its way as the infrastructural enabler for the achievement of transport policy objectives. However, future challenges of the European transport system overall with ambitious climate change objectives, the digital transition or a significantly enhanced focus on user expectations as embedded in the European Green Deal and more specifically in the Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy will place increasing demand on TEN-T policy towards 2030 \/ 2050. In this regard, focusing only on a recalibration of certain standards or requirements would not be sufficient to meet the overall objectives of greening, digitalisation and modal shift; instead, an integrated network approach centred around interoperability and efficiency increase and addressing all shortcomings and lessons learnt identified above is needed. A thorough assessment of the state of implementation of the projects, in particular the projects located on the core network which should be completed by 2030, is also needed. Based on this assessment possible measures to ensure completion of the network on time and according to the EU standards could be identified.

Consultation of the RSB The evaluation has been selected for scrutiny by the RSB. The RSB received the draft version of the evaluation Staff Working Document on 20 October 2020. Following a hearing held on 18 November 2020, the RSB issued a negative opinion on 20 November 2020. A revised version has been resubmitted to the RSB on 5 February 2021 and a positive opinion has been received on 2 March 2021. Evidence, sources and quality The evidence findings of two external support studies prepared by Coffey (Support study for the evaluation of Regulation (EU) N 1315\/2013 on Union Guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network) and Panteia (Support study for the TEN-T policy review, concerning relevant national plans and programmes in member states.) fed into the analysis of the evaluation SWD. The evidence collection for the SWD is also based on the Commission's experience in monitoring and implementing the Regulation and more specifically on the work of European coordinators on the core network corridors. Response to RSB comments Main issues to be discussed ISSUES COMMENTS (1)The report does not explain well how the TEN-T policy functions, as a combination of national and EU transport infrastructure policies and an EU coordination framework. It does not describe how policies concerning transport demand, and relevant spending programmes complement TEN-T. Two sub-chapters added to chapter 1 'Introduction': 'Key elements and features of the TEN-T policy' and 'TEN-T implementation structure and EU coordination and financing framework' (2)The report is not clear about what the TEN-T policy was expected to achieve by now. It does not sufficiently assess what it has achieved in terms of planning and project completion and if the contribution to its objectives is in line with expectations. It does not draw clear conclusions on the extent to which the planning and decision-making process has been suitable to achieve the policy objectives. Expected results and benefits are addressed in chapter 1 under 'purpose and scope of the evaluation'. (3)The evaluation does not sufficiently discuss how the TEN-T framework manages trade-offs between its different objectives and to what extent it has been successful in doing so. It does not come to a clear conclusion on whether a change or a reprioritisation of these objectives is warranted in light of the current progress and an evolving political agenda, particularly in the context of the Green Deal. Included in chapter 2, sub-chapter 'Description of the logic of the EU Intervention and its objectives' (4)What competences do the EU and Member States have in the TEN-T planning and investment? Does the Regulation interact with other relevant legislation? (boxes 1 and 2) Two sub-chapters added to chapter 1 'Introduction': 'TEN-T implementation structure and EU coordination and financing framework' and 'Interaction with other relevant legislation' as well as graphic illustration (5)Does the report aim to assess implementation progress or also the direct contributions to the specific objectives? (boxes 1, 2 anot add 4) Addressed in chapter 1 under 'purpose and scope of the evaluation'. (6)Is the TEN-T planning and decision-making process suitable to achieve the policy objectives? How does it manage trade-offs between the specific objectives? Does it select the right projects? How well are national interests and responsibilities balanced against the EU's objectives? (boxes 1, 2 and 3) Addressed in the Conclusions under 'Elements of the Regulation that work less well' (under Relevance) as well as under 'What works less well' (Effectiveness) (7)Are the transport networks on track to achieve the 2030\/2050 TEN-T targets? What should have been achieved by now? Is what has been achieved due to Member State action, EU funding or to the EU governance measures? What are the greatest challenges or risks to not fulfilling the targets? (boxes 2 and 5) Chapter 3 has been entirely reworked. (8)With greater political focus on the green agenda, is there a need to streamline TEN-T objectives or install greater prioritisation? What contribution can TEN-T make to reduce transport emissions by 90% by 2050? What are the main obstacles to this under the current TEN-T? Is there a link with the forthcoming green taxonomy? (boxes 3, 4 and 5) Addressed in the conclusions chapter (lessons learnt) 1. Design and methodology (includes scope, baseline, consultation, reliability of data, intervention logic) -The report should clarify the scope of the evaluation: does it cover only the Regulation or does it also consider the related implementing and delegated acts? It would be useful to provide an overview of the different related pieces of legislation, which might have an impact in the same area (e.g. Connecting Europe Facility, the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive, etc.). Scope in terms of legislative acts has been addressed under the sub-chapter 'purpose and scope of the evaluation' of chapter 1. Annex 9 'overview of legislation relevant to TEN-T' added. -The report should clarify the scope of the assessment in terms of geography (all Member States? UK coverage? neighbouring countries?) and period considered. Geographical and time scope has been addressed under the sub-chapter 'purpose and scope of the evaluation'. -When it comes to the background description and the intervention logic, the report should explain briefly the differences between the current Regulation and its predecessor. It should briefly explain the difference between the comprehensive and core network, as well as how projects considered of common interest are selected. The report should also explain the roles of different actors in implementing the policy. The differences between the current and past legislation as well as the roles of different actors in implementing the policy is addressed in sub-chapter 'TEN-T implementation structure and EU coordination and financing framework' of chapter 1 'Introduction'. The difference between the core and comprehensive network as well as the iteration with projects of common interest is now further explained in chapter 3 'the dual-layer network approach'. -The initiative is quite complex with various layers of objectives, priorities and requirements. The report should present how the policy was supposed to work. What weight do user benefits (lower transport costs and shorter travel times) have relative to sustainability (lower emissions)? What role does modernising road transport (supply of alternative fuels) play compared to modal shift (efforts to increase rail transport)? Does infrastructure investment depend on complementary policies to work as an \"enabler\" of sustainable transport? Addressed in chapter 1 under 'Interaction with other relevant legislation' and 'The evaluation: purpose and scope'. -Stakeholder views are presented in aggregate. The report should provide information on whether different groups hold different views. If they do, the report should discuss why this might be the case. Explanation provided in chapter 4 under 'targeted stakeholder consultations'. -The report should systematically cite the evidence to support its statements. It should use evidence from the effects of completed links to inform expected achievements. The report should explain what is collected through the TENTec system and whether this served as basis for any of the findings. Moreover, several connected files are currently being evaluated or revised with accompanying impact assessments (e.g. river information systems, rail freight corridors, alternative fuels infrastructure, passenger rights, etc.). The report should clarify when and if it uses preliminary findings from such analyses. References introduced throughout the document. TENtec as data source has been further explained in chapter 4. -Concerning the implementation section, the report should be more factual, explaining the basis for statements made and distinguishing between what comes from the TEN-T policy and what from other related legislation. For instance, on page 8 the report puts forward the idea that the TEN-T Regulation will contribute to the European Green Deal because of alternative fuels deployment. This, however, is covered by a separate act as well (a directive currently under revision). The relation between the different instruments has been clarified in chapter 1. In addition, chapter 3 has been fully revised in order to address the Green Deal aspect more clearly. -The report should be clearer on its limitations. Is the fact that projects have such long lead times problematic in terms of progress and objectives achieved? Why is this? To what extent could the evaluation consider the results of finalised projects that were launched under the preceding Regulation? How do the different pieces of legislation that apply in the same area influence outcomes? For example, on page 25 the report claims that TEN-T policy triggered investment in safety. However, this is also covered by a separate act; how to distinguish between the effects of the two? The Connecting Europe Facility and other EU sources of funding support many of the actions covered by the TEN-T Regulation. These should be better distinguished in a discussion of effects and outcomes. Integrated in sub-chapter 'limitations and robustness of findings' of chapter 4. The interaction with different pieces of legislation is also outlined in chapter 1 under 'interaction with other relevant legislation'. -The report should explain more clearly how the European Court of Auditors' reports in this area have been considered. For instance, the 2020 report on transport infrastructure projects estimates that 6 out of 8 examined projects will not be finalised by 2030, while the evaluation gives an overall positive impression that 2030 target for core network will be met. Such seemingly divergent conclusions should be explained. Partly addressed in the report. In addition, it has to be noted that the Commission as well as Member States did not accept most of the findings of the 2020 Court of Auditors report especially with a view to the cited delays. Thus findings from this report have only been used to a limited extent. -The report should find a way to better present\/integrate case study findings. How were the case studies selected? Are these the \"representative examples\" referred to on page 10? Is there a risk that the choice of case studies introduces a bias in the analysis and conclusions? For example, many references are made to the urban nodes case how important is this issue compared to other objectives and for TEN-T's future development? Selection of case studies as well as their distinction with representative examples now explained in chapter 4.1. 2. Effectiveness and efficiency -The report should clarify what has been achieved so far, if this is satisfactory and whether the policy is on track to deliver in 2030\/2050. Judgements on effectiveness and efficiency are largely based on stakeholder perceptions. There should be a greater attempt to establish objectively what has been achieved and why (not). The report should assess the extent to which progress so far is due to the TEN-T Regulation and assess the contribution of other factors (other legislation, national action, national and European funding). As explained in chapter 4 ('data sources') this evaluation has been based on a wide variety of data sources, including stakeholder consultations, corridor studies and work plans, TEN-T implementation reports, TENtec database, case studies and representative examples among others. Judgements in the report are therefore not only based on stakeholder perceptions but also underpinned by concrete data (e.g. on compliance indicators). Chapter 4 further refined accordingly. -Is there any tension between the two overarching objectives (ensuring the key flows for competitiveness and connecting remote regions)? Are there any objectives that have been largely achieved and that may be less relevant in a future TEN-T revision? The objectives are complementary to each other, as reiterated in chapter 2 (see 'trade-offs'). -The report should be clearer on the differences in achievements across TEN-T requirements and discuss the reasons. Cross-reference to relevant data sources added to chapter 3 A. -Table 2 (page 6) shows what was missing or not yet upgraded from the core network in 2013. What about for the comprehensive network? What are the implications of the differences between modes? The table shows for instance that almost half seemed to be missing\/not ready for rail. The report should explain this in light of such statements as the one on page 20 that core network corridors are a successful instrument in particular for rail (and waterways). As regards rail, table 5 (2020 data) seems to show that a considerable change would need to happen to reach the 2030 goals (12% deployment in 2020 and 97% in 2030). The report should explain whether this is feasible under the current framework. Table 2 and related paragraph now moved to chapter 3 as to provide for better coherence and readability of the report. Explanations provided in chapter 3 (in relation to table 2) as regards the different to the comprehensive network data, implications of the differences between the modes etc. Explanations for ERTMS now provided below table 5 in chapter 3. 1.What are the problems with capacity projects. What are the implications? How frequent is this problem? Is it a problem of implementation or of the framework or both? 2.What have the European Coordinators achieved? What are the problems? 3.TEN-T has not been sufficiently effective in promoting modal shift (page 49). Why? What is the magnitude of the issue? What are the implications for TEN-T's contribution to the European Green Deal? 4.Do problems identified as regards passenger mobility relate to implementation or a lack of physical infrastructure or other factors? 1.Addressed in Evaluation Question 5. 2.See section 'Core network corridors as the key instrument to stimulate and coordinate project implementation' under chapter 3 3.Addressed in Evaluation Question 1. 4.Addressed in Evaluation Question 6. -The report points to difficulties matching geographical corridor routes with transport demand (page 54). What does that say about whether the right projects are selected? Is there a need to revise network maps? Addressed by footnote 112. -When it comes to efficiency, there seem to be some complaints from stakeholders regarding TENTec. The report should explain its role and how it collects data. If it is from Member States, why does the following problem occur: 'sections defined in TENTec not matching sections defined at the national level' (page 56)? Addressed in chapter 4.3 and footnote 118. -More clarity should be provided on the link between TEN-T and the rail freight corridors legislation and actions. It seems stakeholder views on the extent to which TEN-T guidelines helped with rail freight are not so positive. Beyond views, what is the evidence on what is missing and what is still needed? How much of that depends on TEN-T and how much on other legislation? Addressed at the end of Evaluation Question 9. -The report acknowledges that 'many developments that would enable the efficient use of TEN-T infrastructure are outside the scope of the regulation'. What does that mean for judgement on the effectiveness of the Regulation? Addressed in Evaluation Question 9. -Major projects require a long time to plan, implement and deliver their effects. Given that, the report should explain what the Commission does to determine whether the policy is on track, the right projects are selected and the policy objectives are being achieved. Addressed through the iteration on the corridor work plans and the analytical work on the project list, see chapter 3 'core network corridors' and chapter 1 'TEN-T implementation structure'. -The report should provide a frank assessment of how far ownership and commitment from Member States has been ensured under the TEN-T policy. How far has planning and investments priority setting at national level hampered the coordinated approach towards a connected network that spans the whole EU? What instruments does the Commission have to get Member States on board to deliver specific projects in line with the EU's investments objectives? How effective have they been? See added paragraph on 'TEN-T implementation structure' in chapter 1. -In this context, the report should substantiate (beyond the consultant's assessment) the rather positive view on the Member States' plans and programmes on TEN-T implementation. The report for instance refers to 5 to 10 major infrastructure construction projects not covered by the national plans, and between 40 and 50 facing delays (page 19). What does that mean in terms of overall progress? In a another section of the report, a different figure of around 3000 projects that remain to be completed for full core network completion by 2030 is presented (page 45). What does that mean for the achievement of the goals? See chapter 3.A (Member States' approaches to meeting TEN-T development objectives) -The report should be clearer on the problems it identifies, their relative importance, magnitude and consequences. This should, for instance, be improved for the following issues: 3. Relevance and EU added value -The report finds the sustainability related provisions in the TEN-T guidelines insufficient in light of the European Green Deal and its increased ambitions (page 34). Since modelling was used to show what would happen with and without the TEN-T policy, it would be useful if the report presented what is likely to happen if we continue with the current policy framework. Also in terms of environmental and climate change policy, the report refers to a study forecasting considerable benefits from implementing the core network fully (page 35). What does the forecast say in terms of possible increases in traffic that would increase emissions? Addressed in Evaluation Question 15. -In light of TEN-T achievements so far and greater political focus on the green agenda, do all TEN-T objectives remain relevant? How far do the current objectives incur trade-offs and how effective has the TEN-T been at managing these? Can any lessons be drawn for the future? The objectives are complementary to each other, as reiterated in chapter 2 (see 'trade-offs'). -In this context, the report should justify the role of urban nodes in Trans European networks. To what extent is urban transport a matter for the core and the comprehensive network? See Evaluation Question 1. -When it comes to technological developments and digital tools, the report points to diverging views among stakeholders with some in favour of focusing on finalising the physical network first, while others support focusing on the digital layer to make best use of existing physical network. What is the Commission's judgement on this issue? Should the approach continue with a focus on delivering infrastructure projects or is there a need for priorities for projects and funding to shift? See revised chapter 'conclusions'. -Many of the statements under evaluation question 1 concern effectiveness rather than relevance. For example, the statement that 'TEN-T policy has positively contributed to general objectives, such as the facilitation of the free movement of citizens and goods' clearly is a statement on effectiveness (meeting objectives). The fact that an initiative has been successful in meeting objectives is not an indication of relevance. On the contrary, if objectives are fully met, there is no need for further action, which implies that the initiative is no longer relevant. Evaluation Question 1 revised. -The report points to cooperation with third countries and mentions delegated acts producing tentative maps for linking our network with theirs. It would be useful to provide some explanation of how these maps are generated and how they are used. Amended in chapter 1 'Delegated Regulations'. 4. Coherence -The report needs to be clearer about the problems it identifies. For instance, when it comes to internal coherence, it suggests inconsistencies between measures and priorities. More explanation would help the reader understand the issue and its magnitude. Addressed in Evaluation Question 10. -While the report highlights the differences in approach between urban policy and the TEN-T policy, it should explain better whether this in itself causes problems and if so, their consequences. Addressed in Evaluation Question 11. -The report finds that TEN-T provisions on alternative fuels lack specificity (page 62). It is not clear however why the Alternative Fuels Directive is not sufficient and why the TEN-T policy requires further provisions on something that is legislated under a different act. Addressed in Evaluation Question 10. -The report should better argue how the initiative complements other initiatives to shift transport from roads to other modes, or to reduce the external costs of road transport. Against this backdrop, it should give a critical view of infrastructure investment as an enabler of sustainable transport, and the risks of a mismatch between capacity and user demand. Addressed in Evaluation Question 10 ('Coherence of provisions with other transport policy fields') -The report could further elaborate on coherence between the TEN-T and the various Green Deal initiatives adopted or under development. For instance, how does it relate to the green taxonomy? Will it have an effect on the current project selection process and methods? As this initiative was conceived as a backward looking evaluation, it did not yet look too much into the different Green Deal initiatives. However, this will be done in a possible Impact Assessment. As regards green taxonomy, this is linked to the investment decisions taken under the Connecting Europe Facility. -The report should better explain what inconsistencies it finds between TEN-T and passenger rights. Addressed in Evaluation Question 10. -More clarity could also be provided on the lack of evidence of synergies between TEN-T and the other two trans-European networks. Addressed in Evaluation Question 11. 5. Validity of conclusions and relevance for future action -The report should be clearer about the robustness of the findings in the two support studies. When quoting the case studies for instance or the assessment of the Member States' national planning for TEN-T network implementation, it would be useful to have an idea of the level of confidence implied. Addressed in chapter 4 'limitations and robustness of findings'. -The tone of the conclusions is overly positive. The report concludes without presenting evidence that respecting the 2030 and 2050 deadlines will not be problematic, despite concerns raised by ECA. The report should explain what this finding is based on and explain why an initiative was needed to speed up the network's implementation (Directive on streamlining measures for advancing the realisation of the TEN-T)? What is that initiative supposed to bring in terms of measures and what does it say about the effectiveness of the policy and the progress so far? The report considers that the 'completion deadlines 2030 and 2050 should remain unchanged'. Is this in line with the renewed ambitions under the European Green Deal? Should it not be for the impact assessment accompanying the future revision to determine whether the reinforced climate dimension would not require adapted processes and timelines? Chapter 6 'Conclusions' completely reworked. -Conclusions should build on the evidence and analysis, without bringing new elements. The conclusions on efficiency refer to a possible shortage of capacity and resources, which is not sufficiently covered in the analysis. This is also the case for the finding that there is a need to reinforce individual targets underpinning certain specific objectives. Chapter 6 'Conclusions' completely reworked. -The language of the conclusions should focus on the issues identified and the reasons for them and should not prejudge the outcome of the future revision. The report should therefore avoid being prescriptive about next steps. Chapter 6 'Conclusions' completely reworked. -The conclusions should discuss whether efforts need a reallocation, given the substantial differences in compliance and progress. They should explain whether the Green Deal or other political commitments require a refocusing of the current TEN-T objectives. Chapter 6 'Conclusions' completely reworked. -The report should explain whether the conclusions are based on what has been delivered so far or on estimates and forecasts. If the latter is the case, then the language of the conclusions should be more cautious. Chapter 6 'Conclusions' completely reworked. -The report's conclusions should point to any missing data or data needs not adequately covered that hinder monitoring on whether the policy is on track. Chapter 6 'Conclusions' completely reworked. -Conclusions should help decision-makers determine what to focus on, what are the priorities, what should be usefully changed and why. As such, the report should avoid general statements such as 'there is some need for enhancing the inner coherence between the provisions of the Regulation'. Chapter 6 'Conclusions' completely reworked. 6. Presentation -The report reads well and presents the evaluation of a complex piece of Regulation is an accessible way. -Nevertheless, the report should spell out acronyms, explain jargon and generally not assume pre-existing specialised knowledge on the part of the reader. Amended. -The report should systematically provide references to sources underlying statements and ensure cross-references are completed (in a few places 'please see question x' does not indicate where to look). Corrected. The evaluation was further improved based on the recommendations of the RSB in its positive opinion of 3 March. In particular, the conclusion of the evaluation has been redrafted to highlight: the need to revise the Regulation to support the EU climate and environment ambitions and the fact that the improvement of standards on digitalisation and interoperability of the network are not sufficient; the need for further assessment of the gaps in the implementation of the network, in particular the core network which should be completed by 2030, and the need to analyse possible measures to ensure such completion in time and according to the EU standards. Annex 2: Stakeholder consultation 1.Overview of consultation activities To ensure transparency and the validity of results, the evaluation used complementary methods to collect data from numerous stakeholders. These included public authorities at national, regional and local levels, academics and research institutions, non-governmental organisations, business associations and organisations, trade unions, sectoral organisations, and citizens in general, as well as European Commission officials within DG MOVE and other relevant DGs with links to the TEN-T Regulation. More specifically, the consultation activities consisted of the following: An Open Public Consultation on the TEN-T Guidelines was launched on 24 April 2019 by DG MOVE and remained open until 17 July 2019. In total, 604 responses were received to the questionnaire, in addition to 140 documents with evidence supporting the responses. The evaluation processed, analysed and presented the results of the Open Public Consultation in a stand-alone report. Specifically, the data generated by the consultation has been used as input in the process of designing the approach and tools for the evaluation case studies; evidence to include in the assessment of the evaluation questions and sub-questions; input in the process of formulating conclusions and recommendations based on emerging results and lessons learned. Targeted consultations enabled us to collect data from specific stakeholder groups at local, national, EU level, as well as from third countries, and to gather feedback on their awareness, perceptions and experiences of the TEN-T Regulation, its implementation and outcomes to date, as well as their recommendations for future EU policy developments in this area. These data have fed into our responses to the evaluation questions and assessment of the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and EU added value of the Regulation. The data will also inform the conclusions about the Regulation's impact and causal effects, and the recommendations. The targeted consultations consisted of: the design and implementation of a global online survey that has received total valid sample of 198 respondents; the design and implementation of 44 in-depth interviews with cross-sections of respondents to the survey and representatives of relevant stakeholder groups to further explore views and issues in more detail; the design and implementation of nine thematic case studies, including desk research, in-depth interviews, online survey modules, and online workshops for three of them. The findings from the case studies have also fed into the general evaluation study in line with the Evaluation Questions Matrix. Although each case study had a specific purpose and targeted evaluation questions, the interconnections between the case studies has been exploited to maximise the synergies between them, notably in relation to consultations with key stakeholders, and to arrive at detailed findings. 2.Consultation challenges The scale of the consultation programme has presented conceptual and logistical challenges which we addressed at different stages of the evaluation, resulting in an appropriate coverage of the consultation activities. At a conceptual level, our lists of proposed stakeholders and related tools have been designed to achieve the best possible balance between interest groups and topics. We have designed a global survey questionnaire with skip logic that directed stakeholders to relevant questions based on their profiles and familiarity with key elements of TEN-T. The global survey was complemented by specific survey modules linked to the thematic case studies which were administered only among informed \/ relevant stakeholders for each topic. Likewise, we have developed a global interview guide with general questions on TEN-T and have complemented this with tailored guides for each case study. The stakeholder samples and tools have been discussed extensively with DG MOVE. The sampling strategies were updated as the evaluation progressed and preliminary findings from the initial tasks were made available. Our survey questionnaires and interview guides have been designed in a user-friendly way. The questionnaires have been piloted internally to ensure that the questions are clear, and that the length of the questionnaires is manageable. DG MOVE have also provided a letter of introduction that has been attached to the invitation emails. The strong networks in the transport sector developed by consortium partners have also proved instrumental for engaging with stakeholders in a meaningful way. At a logistical and practical level, the COVID-19 crisis impacted during the data collection phase of the evaluation, leading to the cancellation of the TEN-T days and to the reconfiguration of field work, including workshops that had to be adapted to take place online. Stronger and more tailored dissemination efforts were deployed to increase response rates for the case study surveys and interviews launched during the targeted consultations. For example, we have adapted to stakeholders' requirements (e.g. written input with follow-up conversation with national authorities, interviews in national languages). We have also asked for referrals where the stakeholder was not the appropriate one to interviewees and DG MOVE. 3.Synthesis of consultation Results The following sub-sections provide a brief synthesis of the main consultation tools and key results. 1. 2. 3. 3.1.Open Public Consultation A total of 604 respondents completed the questionnaire with varying levels of response rates for individual questionnaire items (this total number includes the questionnaires completed online and questionnaires submitted by direct email). Responses were collected from 32 different countries, the vast majority from EU Member States. The top three contribution types were from public authorities at national and regional level (37%), followed by EU citizens (20%) and companies\/business organisations (16%). In addition, a total of 140 documents were submitted as a complement to the questionnaire launched in the frame of the Open Consultation. These documents were split per level of detail, in opinion pieces (essentially less structured documents), position papers (more in-depth and well-structured analyses and reasoning) and others, which include surveys, articles and presentations among the main contributions. Key findings from the Open Public Consultation Regarding the general questions on the TEN-T Regulation, the vast majority of respondents declared it was very important to have an EU transport infrastructure policy. The main focus areas in transport infrastructure policy at EU level were around removing physical and other bottlenecks in the network as a whole, facilitating multimodal transport chains, establishing physical cross border infrastructures and ensuring connectivity and accessibility of all regions in the EU. The main areas identified for improvement in EU transport infrastructure policy were eliminating missing links in physical infrastructure, further improving the continuity of the TEN-T network and enabling a better use of existing infrastructure and enhancing multimodal connecting points. The main expected benefits of the EU transport infrastructure policy were identified as the development of a European transport network with uniform standards across the region, increased focus on environmental and sustainability issues and improvement in coordination between different governance levels. On the form of the TEN-T network, the majority of respondents considered the TEN-T corridors as a suitable tool to complete the TEN-T network by 2030. However, they were rather critical regarding complementarity of the comprehensive TEN-T network with the core network, and regarding the adequacy of the core network to meet the needs of the sector and its users. There were also concerns expressed regarding the clear identification of bottlenecks and constraints. Safety and security issues were rated as the most adequate characteristics of the comprehensive TEN-T network, followed by the availability and adequacy of alternative fuels infrastructures. Many participants however declared that the comprehensive TEN-T network was not adequate in terms of its required characteristics, particularly in terms of equipment for automated transport, the above-mentioned availability and adequacy of alternative fuels infrastructures and equipment for ITS and digital mobility solutions. In terms of the features of the TEN-T network, half of respondents had favourable views on the completeness of the standards and requirements for all modes of transport. Those who responded negatively most often indicated missing elements of the standards such as lack of complete standards for waterways and ports or absence of a fully integrated European transport network with uniform standards across the regions. Regarding the achievement of different features of the TEN-T network, stakeholders were most positive about the stimulation of innovative technologies and operational concepts and fostering the uptake of alternative fuels and propulsion systems. They were least in agreement that the TEN-T Regulation helped to promote a clean and low carbon transport system overall, promoting a modal shift and mitigating noise emissions and other harmful impacts on citizens. In relation to infrastructure use, the majority of respondents considered the infrastructure objectives as partly achieved. This was particularly the case of the aim to increase the efficiency of infrastructure use and provision in the EU, as well as the aim to enable attractive sustainable and efficient multimodal transport in both the passenger transport and freight sectors. When asked to reflect on the implementation tools, stakeholders provided mixed responses regarding the coherence between the TEN-T policy and other EU policies. Areas considered to be more coherent with TEN-T policy included structural and cohesion policy, economic and trade policy and sustainable urban mobility policy. On the other hand, areas in which more respondents reported that there was not sufficient coherence included environmental policy, cooperation with third countries, and social and employment policy. More than half of respondents were familiar with the European coordinators and their role. Most respondents who were familiar perceived the usefulness of the coordinators' role in facilitating and accelerating the implementation of the TEN-T core network. 3.2.Global online survey Overall, 204 respondents contributed to the global survey, although the total valid sample is 198 respondents. Respondents from Italy, Belgium, Sweden and France were the most numerous. There were no responses received from Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Slovakia. The top three contribution types were from public authorities at national level and company\/business organisations, and public authorities at regional level. Key findings from the global online survey In terms of the relevance of the TEN-T Regulation, most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the TEN-T policy objectives address current and foreseeable challenges in the areas of growth in transport \/ mobility demand (87%), growth in congestion (78%), changes in freight transport concepts and corresponding transport solutions (74%) and climate change and (71%). More than eight in every ten respondents also agreed or strongly agreed that TEN-T policy objectives address a range of current and foreseeable policy needs, such as ensuring high levels of safety and security, supporting TEN-T implementation through EU instruments, identifying and removing bottlenecks and missing links for all modes and defining clear priorities for TEN-T development and boosting their implementation. However, over one third of respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that the TEN-T policy objectives address challenges related to scarcity of natural resources, infrastructure needs from the perspective of users, and in terms of supporting enhanced transfer between TEN-T and local \/ regional transport. In relation to the effectiveness of the TEN-T Regulation, most respondents indicated that the current provisions for the development of the nodes in the network achieved their objectives to a great extent or to some extent in the areas of freight transport nodes (61%), passenger transport nodes (57%) and logistic \/ railroad \/ combined transport terminals (52%). Most respondents also indicated that the TEN-T Regulation achieved its objectives in a number of other areas to a great or to some extent, notably in facilitating the free movement of people and goods within the EU (73%) and boosting the creation of a single, Europe-wide infrastructure network as the basis for continuous, seamless and interoperable transport and mobility (72%). The wide majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the implementation of TEN-T projects contributed to enhancing the overall European transport network (92%). Most respondents also agreed or strongly agreed that the TEN-T Regulation has promoted increased benefits for users (79%), improved transport connections and \/ or transport flows between Member States (78%) and support to the decarbonisation of all transport modes (68%). Half of all respondents (49%) disagreed or strongly disagreed that the completion of the Core Network until 2030 would be met if no changes to the provisions of the TEN-T Regulation are introduced, and respondents were split on the issue of the completion of the Comprehensive Network until 2050, with 45% of respondents who agreed or strongly agreed and 40% of respondents who disagreed or strongly disagreed. When consulted about aspects related to the efficiency of the TEN-T Regulation, most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that studies, such as corridor studies, carried out by European coordinators and their consultant teams, are a cost-effective tool to implement the core network (67%) and that the cost of governance and advice mechanisms of the core network corridors are reasonable in relation to the benefits they bring (63%). Most respondents also agreed or strongly agreed that the cooperation between core network and rail freight corridors addressed key efficiency measures in the areas of: facilitating the use of new and existing infrastructure (58%); optimising interconnection and interoperability of national networks within the European transport network (56%); and removing bottlenecks and complete missing links (54%). In relation to the external coherence of the TEN-T Regulation, most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the provisions in the TEN-T Regulation are coherent with other ongoing and expected developments in the transport policy areas concerned which are directly connected with TEN-T policy, particularly as regards multi-modality \/ combined transport (69%), alternative fuels and digitalisation (68%, respectively). Most respondents also agreed or strongly agreed that the TEN-T Regulation is coherent with other relevant EU policies, such as environmental, climate and resource efficiency (76%), social \/ territorial dimension (69%) and urban policy, city \/ urban development strategies (66%). Most also agreed or strongly agreed that it is complementary to other EU instruments, such as the Connecting Europe Facility (82%), Horizon 2020 (75%), the ESIF (67%) and EU Research and Innovation programmes (63%). With regards to internal coherence, most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the different provisions of the TEN-T Regulation are coherent among themselves (79%), and a slightly lower percentage considered that the different provisions are coherent across modes (68%). When consulted about the EU-added Value of the TEN-T Regulation, most respondents (85% and 84%, respectively) disagreed or strongly disagreed that the results of the TEN-T policy could have been achieved at the regional level and at the national level without the TEN-T Regulation. The vast majority of respondents (95% and 92%, respectively) also agreed or strongly agreed that European regions and cities and their citizens benefit from enhanced connectivity and accessibility and that the discontinuation of the TEN-T Regulation would negatively impact the establishment and development of trans-European networks. More than nine in every ten respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the TEN-T Regulation is essential to achieve the objectives of EU Transport policy and that the broadened TEN-T community adds value to the establishment and development of trans-European networks. The broad majority of respondents also indicated that the EU-wide network approach contributes to socioeconomic benefits to a great or to some extent, particularly in the areas of access to goods and services by users and economic operators (90%), improved mobility and accessibility (90%), time and cost savings (86%), and increased competitiveness and attraction of economic activities (84%). 3.3.Global interviews 44 in-depth interviews were conducted with representatives of 25 EU Member States, 9 regional authorities 118 , and 8 transport stakeholders representing national and European transport federations and associations, and relevant programmes and interest groups. Key findings from the global interviews In terms of the relevance of the TEN-T Regulation, there was consensus that all four specific objectives of the Regulation should remain at the forefront of EU transport policy-making. However, interviewees suggested that some aspects need stronger prioritisation in the Regulation. This was particularly the case for environmental issues such as decarbonisation and alternative fuels, as well as digitalisation. Approaches to tackling these issues were also found to require harmonisation across Member States. Interviewees found that the specific objectives are still relevant to the current context in their Member State, region or sector, and emphasised environmental aspects (such as greenhouse gas reduction, decarbonisation and alternative fuels) and the COVID-19 crisis as changing needs in their transport sectors. They considered the TEN-T Regulation to be flexible to cope with these changing developments and needs but noted that new environmental challenges require more weight and priority in the Regulation. Interviewees found that the definitions of infrastructure standards and requirements in the Regulation are generally appropriate to achieve TEN-T and wider transport policy objectives but found them limited in the case of alternative fuels and also felt that more alignment is needed between the TEN-T Regulation and the ITS Directive. Interviewees found that it is too soon to assess the effectiveness of the TEN-T Regulation in delivering specific objectives and saw its main achievement at this time in fostering cooperation between Member States and promoting a European perspective in infrastructure development. The main challenges to overcome in this context are limited resources and the prioritisation of national infrastructure strategies over TEN-T objectives in some Member States. Interviewees found that current provisions have achieved their purpose for identifying and defining \"physical\" projects of common interest but noted that more flexibility in the definition would be desirable. In terms of promoting investments, interviewees found that the Regulation has a much stronger emphasis on physical infrastructure rather than user services. Views were also split on the issue whether the Regulation has promoted investments that enhance sustainability and decarbonisation. The Core Network Corridors were found to be very effective at facilitating the implementation of the TEN-T core network. The development of the core network was deemed to be progressing well in line with 2030 targets, but the challenge of funding is a recurrent issue that needs to be overcome. The comprehensive network was considered paramount for achieving connectivity and cohesion in the European Union, but interviewees noted that in terms of completion, priority has been given to the core network due to the more imminent deadline. In terms of the efficiency of the TEN-T Regulation, interviewees were split on the extent that costs of governance and advice mechanisms of the Core Network Corridors have generally been reasonable. Some felt that the costs and workloads are appropriate, while others felt the process is time consuming, did not see added value of reporting annual budgetary planning, and criticised the need to regularly update project lists in particular. In relation to the coherence of the TEN-T Regulation, interviewees found that the requirements and provisions set out in the Regulation are coherent with one another, but not coherent across transport modes given the way that funding is allocated. They also found that the Regulation is coherent with other EU policies and initiatives (e.g. Alternative Fuels Directive, Clean Vehicles Directive, etc.), but also identified gaps such as not enough synergies with other sectors (energy, defence, environment), and limited deployment of ITS solutions beyond the core network. As regards the overall concept of the TEN-T being appropriately supported by relevant EU funding instruments, interviewees considered the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) to be the most important funding mechanism, and appreciated the CEF transport blending facility, but noted the CEF budget alone is insufficient to fulfil the TEN-T requirements in their Member States. Some interviewees noted coherence between H2020, CEF and TEN-T and considered EIB to be a useful funding mechanism. Using ESIF and cohesion funds was mentioned as a significant source of funding particularly by interviewees from Eastern Europe. When consulted about the EU-added value of the TEN-T Regulation, interviewees found that results could not have been achieved at national or regional level without the TEN-T Regulation, and that the Regulation has a strong added value as regards investments, international cooperation, and developing a pan-European transport infrastructure. If the TEN-T Regulation were to be discontinued, impact would most greatly be felt in the areas of cross-border sections, cross-border issues, progression on projects, and in terms of territorial cohesion and the internal market. 3.4.Thematic case studies Nine thematic case studies on selected TEN-T policy areas have been designed and implemented as part of the evaluation. Each case study has been tailored to address specific evaluation sub-questions and issues, which were further reviewed and updated in discussions with DG MOVE during the inception and interim phases. The approach to each case study includes a combination of desk review of secondary sources, specific survey modules, in-depth interviews and discussions with relevant stakeholders (complementing the global survey and interviews carried out as part of the consultation). Online stakeholder workshops were organised as part of case studies 1, 6 and 7 to validate the findings, and to discuss conclusions and recommendations. Overview of the thematic case studies In total, more than 80 interviews have been conducted with stakeholders and representatives of the different policy areas covered by the case studies, and more than 40 stakeholders have participated in online workshops organised by selected case studies. The case study online surveys have collected more than 680 responses. The table below presents an overview of the objectives and focus of each case study and a synthesis of the consultation approach. Findings from the case studies are provided in the respective case study reports and integrated in the answers to the evaluation questions in the main report. Table A2-1. Overview of the nine thematic case studies Overview Consultation approach Case study 1: The role of urban nodes in TEN-T policy Focuses on how appropriate and clear the role of urban nodes is in the TEN-T framework, the effectiveness of the set-up of urban nodes in the TEN-T Regulation and on possible challenges arising between TEN-T and urban nodes in terms of coherence with local to EU-wide policies of various sectors. 20 interviews with representatives of selected urban nodes 89 responses to dedicated online survey Online workshop with 17 attendees Case study 2: Core Network Corridors Assesses the relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of the core network corridors for the achievement of the objectives of the TEN-T Regulation. The Core Network Corridor approach is a means to facilitate the coordinated implementation of the core network and to promote inter-European transport links vital to the economic and social development of the EU. 11 interviews with representatives and stakeholders of Core Network Corridors 131 responses to dedicated online survey Case study 3: Infrastructure standards Evaluates whether the current provisions of the Regulation are still relevant, efficient and coherent with the TEN-T policy as well as with the verified progress in other legislative and binding documents. This case study is mainly focused on the TEN-T infrastructure requirements and standards. 4 interviews with representatives of rail mode (interviews with other modes ongoing \/ in the process of being scheduled) 238 responses to dedicated online survey, including: Road (34), Rail (62), IWW (37), Maritime (48), Air (15), and Multimodal (42) (NOTE: survey is still open to encourage additional responses) Case study 4: TEN-T as an enabler of a future mobility system Aims to understand how well adapted the current provisions of the Regulation are to incorporate expected future policy, technological and scientific innovation and to clarify whether the current version of the Regulation unlocks future mobility concepts and systems or can be better adapted to plausible future changes. To better frame this discussion, we selected three representative areas of the future-oriented mobility system, including road automation, the SESAR project, and the Hyperloop. 15 interviews with representatives of CCAM, SESAR, Hyperloop and foresight experts 65 responses to dedicated online survey Case study 5: High-speed rail Focuses on the specific role of high-speed rail within the TEN-T, paying attention to the effectiveness and relevance of the provisions of the TEN-T Regulation (including the network planning) and their implementation, as well as their coherence with other relevant EU action notably in fields such as railway policy, territorial development or urban nodes. Desk-based approach to the case study Case study 6: Digitalisation Evaluates the extent to which TEN-T Regulation provisions are able to bring the potential of the digital revolution to the TEN-T, and to help define a concept of digitalisation fit for the TEN-T context. To achieve this, we have approached the horizontal issue of digitalisation from two distinct angles: i) digitalisation in passenger transport; and ii) digitalisation in freight transport. 8 interviews with TEN-T stakeholders in the field of digitalisation 52 responses to dedicated online survey Online workshop with 17 attendees Case study 7: Innovation and new technologies Assesses the way new technologies and innovation have been stimulated and implemented in TEN-T policy. The case study also addresses the coherence and complementarity between R&I (notably European but also other R&I) and TEN-T policy. The assessment is done both in general terms and for the example of the quality of TEN-T infrastructure. The case study focuses on the quality of road infrastructure and the methods and standards to ensure the structural quality of the infrastructure; and the difficult transition of innovative solutions and research into practical implications. 7 interviews with TEN-T stakeholders in the field of innovation and new technologies Online workshop with 10 attendees Case study 8: Seamless and barrier-free mobility for the trans-European passenger Focuses on the passenger experience when travelling through the TEN-T network. It is concerned with the question of how seamless and barrier-free mobility can be established for these passengers. Although some relevant provisions are included in the TEN-T Regulation (e.g. Article 37), this is not an area that is extensively or comprehensively covered by the Regulation, particularly with respect to multimodality and the subsequent issues of equal accessibility for all users, integrated multimodal ticketing, coordinated timetables between modes, provision of travel information and consideration of passenger rights in the context of multimodal transport. 13 interviews with key organisations and groups representing passenger services 43 responses to dedicated online survey Case study 9: The external dimension of TEN-T Explores the increased importance of fostering synergies between TEN-T policy and infrastructure network policies and plans in other countries and regions. It reflects new developments that have taken place and have an impact on TEN-T policy cooperation with neighbouring countries, in particular candidates and potential candidates to EU accession in the Western Balkans and Turkey, the Eastern Neighbourhood and the Southern Neighbourhood. It also looks at cooperation initiatives with other third countries. 4 interviews with representatives of Southern Neighbourhood (interviews with representatives of other regions ongoing \/ in the process of being scheduled) 64 responses to dedicated online survey, including: Western Balkans and Turkey (29), Eastern Neighbourhood (19), and Southern Neighbourhood (16) (NOTE: survey is still open to encourage additional responses) Annex 3 Global Survey Participants 119 PROFILE OF RESPONDENTS Overall, 204 respondents contributed to the survey. After cleaning the dataset to remove contributions (n=6) that were limited to contact details for interviews and case study research, but which provided no answers to any of the survey questions, the total valid sample is 198 respondents. Contribution type The top three contribution types were from a national public authority in the EU and a company \/ business organisation, which each comprised 20% of the sample, followed by a regional public authority in the EU (17%), a business association (9%) and infrastructure managers (8%). The figure below shows the respondent sample broken down by stakeholder group. Figure 1: Sample by stakeholder group (n=198) STAKEHOLDER group n % of total sample National public authority in the EU 40 20% Company \/ business organisation 40 20% Regional public authority in the EU 35 17% Business association 18 9% Infrastructure manager 16 8% Local public authority in the EU 12 6% Non-governmental organisation 9 5% EU citizen 3 3% Environmental organisation 2 1% Public authority in a third country (non-EU) 3 2% Transport operator 4 2% Academic \/ research institution 4 2% Other 120 10 4% No response 2 1% Total 198 100% Scope of work, sector and organisation size In terms of the scope of work, the largest proportion of respondents (48%) worked across multiple areas (international, local, national and regional) 121 , followed by 30% who indicated that they worked internationally. Fewer respondents confirmed an exclusively national (10%), regional (10%) or local (2%) scope of work (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Sample by scope of work (n=198) In terms of the transport sector that respondents worked in, most indicated multimodal transport 122 (69%), followed by road (11%), rail (9%) and maritime transport (7%). There were less respondents working on air transport and inland waterways (2%, respectively) (see Figure 3). Figure 3: Sample by transport sector (n=198) Half of all respondents (48%) indicated that they worked for a large organisation of 250 or more employees. 22% indicated that they worked for a medium-sized organisation (50 to 249 employees), and 13%, respectively, for a small or micro organisation (see Figure 4 ). Figure 4: Sample by organisation size (n=198) Geographical distribution The Member State with the largest representation of respondents in the sample was Italy (18%), followed by Belgium (11%), Sweden and France (9%, respectively). The Member States with the smallest representation of respondents in the survey were Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom, at 1% respectively (see Figure 1 There were no responses rec eived from Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Slovakia. The survey was distributed widely and open to all relevant audiences across the EU Member States. While the response rate is not balanced across Member States, to ensure meaningful comparisons , we aggregated the data by EU regions and former and new EU Member States (see section 3.1.4). Figure 5 ). There were no responses received from Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Slovakia.

Further Elements of the Intervention Logic Actions A selection of actions, contributing to the generation of the expected outputs concretely to the completion of the core and comprehensive networks and its indicative extensions is listed below: Implement resource efficiency in planning, development and operation of the two transport network layers, and in particular of the core network; Implement projects of common interest, contributing to core network completion, in accordance with their respective priority and maturity status; ensure completion of all projects by 2030; Strengthen and facilitate cross-border collaboration to overcome particular difficulties, and give highest attention to the timely completion of these most critical core network sections; Integrate binding transport infrastructure standards, resulting from EU legislation, such as on interoperability or safety Develop infrastructure in line with TEN-T requirements which enable sustainable, efficient and smart transport and mobility chains; which stimulate and support the decarbonisation of transport Develop transport infrastructure requirements related to future-oriented mobility schemes; Make use of new technologies and innovation, including telematics applications and clean fuels; Respond to transport infrastructure requirements, related to environmental and climate protection; Ensure engagement of public and private stakeholders (including contribution of Member States and project promoters); at the level of individual projects, ensure the respect of relevant EU legislation, in fields such as environmental protection etc. Cooperate with neighbouring and third countries, in particular on network planning and the implementation of projects Introduce an interactive geographical and technical information system (TENtec) to monitor the status of infrastructure planning and implementation (including the upgrading to standards and other requirements) Apply reporting provisions on TEN-T implementation; Inputs In order to execute the policy actions needed to generate the key output (notably to complete core and comprehensive networks; to facilitate indicative network extensions to neighboring countries), various inputs are necessary. Building on the TEN-T infrastructure assets which are already available namely in the form of existing lines and nodes compliant with the required quality standards the following main inputs are needed: Coverage of 'projects of common interest' (i.e. projects for new construction or infrastructure upgrading) by relevant national infrastructure plans, programs and financing procedures; Engagement of various public and private stakeholders to develop, implement and finance projects of common interest; Stimulating and supporting the action of Member States and other public and private investors: Financial instruments at EU and other levels, including the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the Structural and cohesion funds, the contribution of the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; Coordination at EU level through the European Coordinators and the core network corridors framework; Legislation at EU level, including relevant guidelines, requirements and implementing decisions; Specific financial instruments at EU level (such as the Neighbourhood Investment Platform and Pre-Accession Assistance) and other (non-financial) types of support for neighbouring and third countries for actions related to international cooperation. External factors impaction on Regulation 1315\/2013 To complete the Intervention Logic, reference should also be made to a number of external factors, suitable to have an effect on transport and the related infrastructure development. These include notably: New commitments on zero and low emission mobility and transport, in the framework of the Commission's vision towards a climate-neutral economy (to be addressed notably through efficiency enhancing measures within the integrated network approach) Reinforced commitments on accessibility for all users and social commitments relating to inclusiveness, gender equality etc. (to be addressed through relevant infrastructure quality requirements) Increased safety challenges, for example in the light of initiatives such as the Vision Zero on road safety (to be addressed through relevant infrastructure quality requirements) New security challenges relating to new global risks (to be addressed through relevant infrastructure quality requirements) Increased risks for TEN-T infrastructure in relation to natural and human-made disasters (to be addressed through relevant infrastructure quality requirements, with a particular focus on adaptation to climate change) Changing global trade relations, entailing changing transport flows (to be addressed through network adjustment as necessary) Path-breaking technological innovation and digital transition (to be addressed through new infrastructure requirements reflecting the step change in European transport infrastructure policy. Annex 7: Baseline Scenario and modelling results This section presents the modelling exercise carried out by E3Modelling as regards the development of the baseline scenario of the present evaluation study. The structure of this section includes the methods for the development of the baseline scenario, using the PRIMES-TREMOVE transport model. Key results of the baseline scenario are also provided in an aggregate way for the EU27; more detailed results are also provided in dedicated tables. Further, a comparison of key transport indicators is presented between the baseline scenario and the scenario under current trends and policies (including the implementation of the TEN-T regulation). Finally, the section concludes by providing some high-level findings on the impact of Covid-19 on the EU transport activity. Nevertheless, we note that the baseline scenario does not consider the impact of Covid-19, as this modelling exercise had started before the virus outbreak. 1The Primes-Tremove model The PRIMES-TREMOVE transport model projects the evolution of demand for passengers and freight transport, by transport mode, and transport vehicle\/technology, following a formulation based on microeconomic foundation of decisions of multiple actors. Operation, investment and emission costs, various policy measures, utility factors and congestion are among the drivers that influence the projections of the model. The projections of activity, equipment (fleet), usage of equipment, energy consumption and emissions (and other externalities) constitute the set of model outputs. The PRIMES-TREMOVE transport model can therefore provide the quantitative analysis for the transport sector in the EU, candidate and neighbouring countries covering activity, equipment, energy and emissions. The model accounts for each country separately which means that the detailed long-term outlooks are available both for each country and in aggregate forms (e.g. EU level). In the transport field, PRIMES-TREMOVE is suitable for modelling soft measures (e.g. eco-driving, labelling); economic measures (e.g. subsidies and taxes on fuels, vehicles, emissions; ETS for transport when linked with PRIMES; pricing of congestion and other externalities such as air pollution; accidents and noise; measures supporting R&D); regulatory measures (e.g. CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger and heavy duty vehicles; EURO standards on road transport vehicles; technology standards for non-road transport technologies, deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems) and infrastructure policies for alternative fuels (e.g. deployment of refuelling\/recharging infrastructure for electricity, hydrogen, LNG, CNG). Used as a module that contributes to the PRIMES model energy system model, PRIMES-TREMOVE can show how policies and trends in the field of transport contribute to economy-wide trends in energy use and emissions. Using data disaggregated per Member State, the model can show differentiated trends across Member States. The PRIMES-TREMOVE has been developed and is maintained by E3Modelling, based on, but extending features of, the open source TREMOVE model developed by the TREMOVE 126 modelling community. Part of the model (e.g. the utility nested tree) was built following the TREMOVE model. 127 Other parts, like the component on fuel consumption and emissions, follow the COPERT model. Data inputs The main data sources for inputs to the PRIMES-TREMOVE model, such as for activity and energy consumption, comes from EUROSTAT database and from the Statistical Pocketbook \"EU transport in figures 128 . Excise taxes are derived from DG TAXUD excise duty tables. Other data comes from different sources such as research projects (e.g. TRACCS project) and reports. In the context of this exercise, the PRIMES-TREMOVE transport model is calibrated to 2005, 2010 and 2015 historical data. 2Development of the baseline scenario The following presents the methodology and the key results of the Baseline scenario in an aggregate way for the EU27. The modelling has been carried out at the EU MS level. 2.1Method for the development of the baseline scenario This section presents the approach taken to develop the baseline scenario to support the evaluation of Regulation 1315\/2013 on trans-European Network Guidelines. The aim for developing the baseline scenario is to assess what would happen in the medium (2030) and long-term (2050) if the TEN-T core and comprehensive network would not be completed by 2030 and 2050, respectively. The starting point for developing the baseline scenario has been the baseline scenario underpinning the Impact Assessment accompanying the revision of the TEN-T Regulation 129 . Building on this scenario, the macro-economic and technological assumptions have been updated in line with those used for the modelling underpinning the strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy by 2050 130 (LTS\/Clean Planet for All communication). In addition, policy measures adopted by the end of 2019 have been considered in the baseline scenario, except for the implementation of the TEN-T regulation. A counter-factual scenario has been additionally developed that assumes the completion of the TEN-T core and comprehensive network. By comparing the two scenarios, this shows the impacts of the revised TEN-T regulation by 2050. In liaison with PRIMES-TREMOVE, E3-Modelling utilized the PRIMES-TAPEM 131 sub-module (part of the PRIMES-TREMOVE model) which calculates the evolution of the transport activity by transport mode until 2050 using an econometric approach which correlates transport activity with GDP, fuel prices, length of motorways and railways sections. Once the transport activity projections are derived based on the econometric approach, they were fed to the PRIMES-TREMOVE model to quantify the baseline scenario. The quantification of the baseline scenario using PRIMES-TREMOVE allowed to derive the evolution of key transport system indicators (final energy demand by transport mode and fuel, CO2 emissions by transport mode, etc.) until 2050, by each EU MS. PRIMES-TREMOVE also features the COPERT methodology (i.e. average speed-based functions) for the estimation of the specific fuel consumption in the road transport by transport mode and technology and has captured the effects of increased congestion and average speeds in the road network (i.e. urban roads, motorways and non-urban links). As regards the limitations of the present methodology, we acknowledge that the quantification of this baseline scenario (which focuses on the TEN-T infrastructure) would need to combine the merits of a transport network model along with a detailed energy economic model like PRIMES-TREMOVE. The transport network model, which would need to cover the time horizon until 2050 in 5 or 10-year time steps for the whole EU, would provide a finer representation of the implied changes in transport activity due to the absence of the core and comprehensive transport network. A transport network model requires however detailed specifications for the projects to be implemented at section level. These detailed project specifications are not known yet up to 2050, considering the long term horizon. This was the reason for using the current approach. 2.2Presentation of the main results of the model for the baseline scenario In the following, key results of the baseline scenario are presented. 2.2.1Transport activity The total passenger transport activity is projected to follow a steadily increasing trend from 2010 to 2050. The GDP and population growth drives the increase in the activity of all passenger modes, albeit at different rates. The modal share of road transport (i.e. passenger cars, public transport, 2-wheelers) is found to slightly decrease from 83% in 2010 to 78% in 2050. The reduction in the modal share of road is due to the increase in the growth of aviation. Aviation refers in the figure below to domestic (national) and international intra-EU flights. As regards the developments in the passenger railway sector, model results indicate a rather stable modal share throughout the projection period, as a result of the absence of railway infrastructure investments related to the core and comprehensive network. The modal share of the inland navigation remains relatively unchanged at 1% for the projection period. Figure 2.21: Passenger transport activity in the EU27 in the Baseline scenario Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling Driven, again, by the GDP growth, the total freight transport activity is projected to grow in the period 2010-2050. The rate of growth is greater in the period between 2015-2030 than in the 2030-2050 period. The absence of the TEN-T core and comprehensive network fails to provide sufficient transport infrastructure coverage and inter-modal integration (road, rail and inland navigation) and, as a result, road freight continues to hold a relatively stable modal share until 2050. The modal shares of freight rail and inland navigation (incl. inland waterways and national maritime) are projected to remain stable throughout the projection period. Figure 2.22: Freight transport activity in the EU27 in the Baseline scenario Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling 2.2.2Final energy demand in transport The total energy demand for passenger transport is projected to decrease from 2010 to 2050. Such reduction is driven by the policy assumptions included in the baseline scenario adopted by end of 2019 (but excluding the TEN-T regulation and including the 2030 climate and energy targets). These mainly relate to the implementation of the CO2 standards for light duty vehicles for 2030 but also other policy measures driving the improvements in the efficiency of the transport system and the uptake of sustainable alternative fuels and low- and zero-emission vehicles (e.g. the implementation of 4th Railways Package, Clean Vehicle Directive and Directive on alternative fuels infrastructure, etc.). The energy consumption of road passenger transport is almost halved from 191 Mtoe in 2010 to 112 Mtoe in 2050, as a result of the uptake of more energy efficient technologies and advanced powertrains such as electric ones. The energy consumption of passenger rail and inland navigation remains relatively unchanged at 3 Mtoe and 1 Mtoe respectively through the projected period and hold a small share of the overall passenger transport energy mix. Figure 2.23: Final energy demand by passenger transport mode in the Baseline scenario Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling Figure 2.24: Final energy demand by freight transport mode in the Baseline scenario Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling The energy consumption of freight transport displays a relatively stable trend despite the growing activity, due to measures driving the improvements in the efficiency of the transport system and the uptake of low- and zero-emission vehicles (e.g. the implementation of e-documents for freight, CO2 standards for heavy goods vehicles, Clean Vehicles Directive, etc.). Road freight is projected to continue to hold the largest share of the final energy demand in total freight transport throughout the projection period, also as a result of the relatively stable modal shares in total freight transport activity. Final energy consumption in freight rail and inland navigation is also projected to remain relatively stable. 2.2.3CO2 emissions The total CO2 emissions in transport reduce from around 900 Mtons in 2010 to about 600 Mtons in 2050. The main driver of this outcome is the reduction in the emissions of passenger transport and, in particular of passenger cars, due to the uptake of efficient and cleaner technologies. Despite the absence of the development of the TEN-T core and comprehensive network, the baseline scenario considers the implementation of other existing initiatives like the post-2020 CO2 emission targets on car, van and truck manufacturers as well as the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive, Renewable Energy Directive and Clean Vehicles Directive. Such initiatives are driving the market uptake of low and zero emission fuels in the transport mix by 2030 and onwards. Some reduction in CO2 emissions also takes place in freight transport (mainly to road freight because of the CO2 emission standards for heavy goods vehicles); yet not at the extent of that in passenger transport. Figure 2.25: CO2 emissions by transport mode in the Baseline scenario Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling 3Comparison of the baseline scenario with the scenario under current trends and policies This section presents a comparison of the key results of the Baseline scenario against the scenario under current trends and policies (including the implementation of the TEN-T regulation). Hence, the comparison between the baseline and the current trends and policies scenario (so-called \"LTS current trends\" below) indicates potential impact of the TEN-T implementation by 2030 and 2050. The results are compared at the EU27 level, unless stated otherwise. For passenger transport, the model results indicate a shift towards railways starting from 2020 onwards. Railways (i.e. aggregate of conventional and high-speed rail and tram-metro) are projected to increase their modal share by 1.1 p.p. in 2030 and 1.8 p.p. in 2050 compared to the Baseline scenario. In contrast, road passenger transport is projected to reduce its modal share by about 1 p.p. in 2030 and 1.5 p.p. in 2050 relative to the Baseline. Notably, some small reduction in the national and international intra-EU flights transport activity is taking place in the current trends scenario relative to the Baseline, mainly driven by competition from high-speed rail. Figure 31: Modal shares in passenger transport activity in the EU27 in the Baseline and the current trends and policies scenario Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling High-speed rail was found to significantly increase its modal share to 38% of the rail transport activity by 2030 (relative to 34% in the baseline scenario). In absolute terms, the difference in the transport activity of high-speed rail between the two scenarios is projected to be around 48 billion-pkm, in 2030 and 100 billion-pkm in 2050. Figure 32: Share of High-Speed rail in total EU27 rail passenger transport activity in the Baseline and the current trends and policies scenario Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling In the following, we present the reduction in the passenger rail transport modal share in the Baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario in 2030 and 2050 at the core network corridor (CNC) level. For this assessment, we considered the mapping between the various EU MS and the 9 core network corridors ( Table 3 1 ). The modal share of passenger rail refers to conventional and high-speed passenger rail and has been calculated by aggregating the specific EU MS which are mapped to a specific corridor. Table 31: Mapping of EU Member States by core network corridor Atlantic core network corridor (ATL) PT ES FR DE Baltic Adriatic core network corridor (BAC) PL CZ AT IT SI SK Mediterranean core network corridor (MED) ES FR IT HR SI HU North Sea Baltic core network corridor (NSB) EE LV LT PL DE NL BE North-Sea Mediterranean core network corridor (NSM) IE UK FR BE NL LU DE Orient East Med core network corridor (OEM) DE CZ AT SK RO BG GR HU Rhine Alpine core network corridor (RALP) NL BE DE FR IT LU Rhine Danube core network corridor (RHD) DE AT CZ SK RO HR BG HU Scandinavian Mediterranean core network corridor (SCM) IT AT DE DK SE FI MT Model results indicate a reduction in the modal share of passenger rail in all core network corridors. The highest reduction is observed in the case of the Atlantic CNC, which is mainly influenced by the large reduction in the high-speed rail in France, Germany and Spain in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and polices scenario. The respective modal share is found to decrease by 1.5 p.p. in 2030 in the baseline scenario compared to current trends and policies. The smallest reduction is projected to take place in the Baltic Adriatic CNC (i.e. 0.9 p.p. reduction in 2030), as all the (related to this specific CNC) EU MS except for Italy and Austria show a relatively smaller reduction in passenger rail transport activity compared to other MS like France or Germany. The modal share of passenger rail in the core network corridors is found to further decrease between the two scenarios in 2050 compared to 2030, in lack of the comprehensive TEN-T network implementation after 2030. The share of passenger rail is projected to decrease in the Atlantic CNC by 2.5 p.p. in the baseline scenario compared to LTS current trends and policies scenario, as a result of significant reductions in the high-speed rail in France, Germany and Spain in 2050. The second largest reduction is projected to take place in the Mediterranean CNC (2.3 p.p. reduction in the baseline scenario compared to the LTS current trends scenario), which is driven by the significant reductions in high-speed rail transport activity in Spain, France and Italy (and to a much lesser extent in the rest of the MS related to this CNC). Figure 33: Reduction in the passenger rail transport modal share in the Baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario (in p.p.), at core network corridor level, in 2030 (left) and 2050 (right) Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling As regards freight transport, the current trends and policies scenario indicates a shift towards freight rail transport compared to the baseline scenario excluding the TEN-T regulation. The modal share of rail freight transport is projected to increase by approx. 2 p.p. in the LTS current trends scenario compared to baseline in 2030, to the detriment of road freight transport. Inland navigation shows some limited increase in its modal share by 2030 between the two scenarios. The modal shift towards freight rail is projected to amplify when looking at the developments by 2050. The modal share of freight rail is found to increase by more than 4 p.p. in the current trends and policies scenario compared to baseline in 2050. The baseline scenario indicates a relatively stable (and slightly reducing in 2050) modal share of freight rail in total freight transport, while the current trends and policies scenario denotes an ever-increasing modal share from 2020 onwards driven by the completion of the core and comprehensive TEN-T network. Figure 34: Modal shares in freight transport activity in the EU27 in the Baseline and the LTS current trends and policies scenario Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling Figure 3 5 presents the reduction in the freight rail transport modal share in the Baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario in 2030 and 2050 at the cnc level, using the mapping between the various EU MS and the 9 core network corridors ( Table 3 1 ). Model results indicate a reduction in the modal share of freight rail in all core network corridors. The highest reduction is observed in the case of the Baltic Adriatic, Orient East Med, Rhine Danube and Scan-Med CNC, which are mainly influenced by a large reduction in the freight rail transport activity in Germany, Austria and Finland in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario. The respective modal share is found to decrease by 2.4 p.p. in 2030 in the baseline scenario compared to current trends and policies scenario. The modal share of freight rail in the core network corridors is found to further decrease between the two scenarios in 2050 compared to 2030, in lack of the comprehensive TEN-T network implementation after 2030. Figure 35: Reduction in the freight rail transport modal share in the Baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario (in p.p.), at core network corridor level, in 2030 (left) and 2050 (right) Source: PRIMES-TREMOVE model, E3Modelling Energy demand in the EU-27 passenger transport sector is projected to be higher in the Baseline scenario relative to the current trends and policies scenario (assuming the implementation of the TEN-T regulation) by 2030 and 2050 (by 2% and 4% or 2.4 and 4.8 Mtoe, in 2030 and 2050, respectively), due to higher energy use in the road transport sector and aviation. Such developments are the result of higher road and air passenger transport activity in the baseline compared to the current trends scenario, due the detriment of rail (including high-speed rail). The picture is relatively similar in the freight transport sector. The baseline scenario shows higher energy use in road freight compared to the current trends scenario (approximately 2% and 5% higher in the baseline scenario compared to current trends scenario in 2030 and 2050, respectively), due to the higher road freight transport activity.

The baseline scenario indicates a higher consumption of oil products by approx. 5 and 12 Mtoe in 2030 and 2050 compared to the current trends and policies scenario. Electricity use is projected to be lower in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario, driven by the reduced transport activity of railways. In addition, the non-completion of the TEN-T core and comprehensive network is driving some lower electrification of the railways sector in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario from 2020 onwards. The non-completion of the TEN-T core and comprehensive network negatively impacts the uptake of alternative fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen in the baseline scenario, because of the lower or limited availability of alternative fuels infrastructure on the core TEN-T network (e.g. hydrogen refuelling stations, LNG terminals and LNG stations, as well as electricity recharging points). Natural gas consumption is projected to be lower by around 0.9 and 2 Mtoe in 2030 and 2050, respectively in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario, as a result of a reduced demand in road freight and shipping, due to the limited refuelling infrastructure. Total transport CO2 emissions are projected to be higher in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario by 2030 and 2050. The driver of this outcome is mainly associated with the higher energy consumption of the more energy intensive transport modes (e.g. cars and trucks) and the lower availability of alternative fuels in transport because of the lower availability of refuelling\/recharging infrastructure along the TEN-T core network. Model results indicate higher CO2 emissions in the baseline scenario compared to the current trends and policies scenario, by about 14 and 31 Mtons CO2 by 2030 and 2050, respectively (i.e. 1.8% and 5.4% increase in 2030 and 2050, respectively). In cumulative terms, the baseline scenario shows higher CO2 emissions relative to the current trends and policies scenario of about 73 and 530 Mt CO2 in 2030 and 2050, respectively (i.e. 0.6% and 2.1% increase in 2030 and 2050, respectively).

Nevertheless, more in depth analysis would be necessary to assess the impact of the Covid-19 on the EU transport sector and the overall EU economic activity, considering that newer data are also becoming available. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, several governments took drastic measures to contain its wider expansion to the population. As a result, the activity in several economic sectors has slowed down. Particularly, the transport sector has been greatly affected due to international travel bans, confinement measures, stay-at-home requirements, and restricted access to public transport. In addition, global trade between countries and consequently freight transport, decreased to some extent due to lower economic activity and reduction in manufacturing output 132 . International travel restrictions led to a steep decline of domestic, intra- and extra-EU air traffic, through February, March and April (up to almost 90% less than 2019 levels, the lowest throughout the year). From June onwards, analysts anticipate that there will be a gradual recovery of flight activity first from domestic and intra-EU flights, as a result of increased international intra-EU mobility. Moving towards the last quarter of 2020, and assuming no second wave, extra-EU flights are also assumed to recover, but to lower levels than 2019. Figure 41: Reduction of intra- and extra-EU flight activity in 2020 compared to 2019 Source: EUROCONTROL 133 The activity of the sector can also be determined by looking at the emissions of the sector. Figure 4 1 indicates a steep reduction in aviation CO2 emissions in the months of March and April and to some extent May. Preliminary data for June were indicating a recovery of the CO2 emissions and the activity of the sector. Figure 42: Estimated reduction in CO2 emissions from aviation compared to 2019 Note: Estimates based on total number of departing flights by aircraft on ground until 11 June 2020. Source: E3Modelling based on ICOS data 134 During the first months of 2020, Covid-19 outbreak containment measures were aimed at ensuring social distancing in public transport and limiting personal mobility by all modes as EU citizens were increasingly being asked by their governments to stay at home. As such, a reduction in passenger transport activity was observed. Assuming that in the course of 2020 containment measures will be gradually lifted, an overall recovery of passenger transport activity is expected, but to lower levels than before the outbreak. Figure 43: Estimated reduction in road transport activity in Europe by the IEA during the first months of the Covid-19 outbreak Source: IEA 135 Different passenger transport modes are expected to recover at different rates, as norms induced by social distancing may not be fully lifted (e.g. occupancy factors of public modes of transport), particularly demonstrating a preference towards private compared to public transport modes. High speed rail transport activity (in terms of pkm) has also been substantially decreased during the first months of the Covid-19 outbreak, mainly because of the reduction in the number of passengers travelling as a result of a preference of a private transport mode or tele-working. The impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the EU freight transport sector has been less severe than on the passenger transport. Road freight transport, which largely represents intra-EU trade, experienced the lowest reduction in its activity compared to other modes, such as passenger transport modes, because the trade and logistic operations continued during the months of the lockdown. The impact on the Covid-19 on the non-road freight transport is expected to be larger in magnitude than in the road freight transport sector. Annex 8: Costs and Benefits of Regulation 1315\/2013 I.

The Commission is currently preparing a revision of the TENtec system which will among others address such issues (e.g. \"dynamic sectioning\"). (101) There is an ongoing evaluation of the RFC Regulation, which should, when available, provide specific findings on this particular topic that could complement the findings from the current TEN-T evaluation. (102) This final sub-question might be more adequate to contribute to another evaluation question with a focus on passenger transport, as the present evaluation question is more connected to freight transport. Nevertheless, it has been decided to maintain the question structure as the sub-question also falls under the evaluation criterion of efficiency (103) https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0773 (104) Directive 2014\/94\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (105) Issue Papers of European Coordinators - TEN-T Corridors: Forerunners of a forward-looking European Transport System, DG MOVE, 2016 (106) Commission staff working document Ex post evaluation of the Intelligent Transport Systems Directive 2010\/40\/EU {SWD(2019) 369 final}, 2010 (107) Reflection Paper Towards a sustainable Europe by 2030, EC, 2019 (108) European Parliament resolution of 19 January 2017 on logistics in the EU and multimodal transport in the new TEN-T corridors (2015\/2348(INI)) (109) Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Progress report on implementation of the TEN-T network in 2014-2015 https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/transport\/sites\/transport\/files\/com20170327-progress-report-tent-2014-2015.pdf (110) Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Progress report on implementation of the TEN-T network in 2016-2017, August 2020, https:\/\/op.europa.eu\/en\/publication-detail\/-\/publication\/ea150c2a-e796-11ea-ad25-01aa75ed71a1\/language-en (111) Opportunities for the transport sector under the Investment Plan: Non-paper to Ministers for 8 October 2015 Transport Council (112) Cost of non-completion of the TEN-T, Final Report, Schade et al., 2015 (113) Digital infrastructure in the context used here refers to the physical assets required for the technologies to operate. In its widest definition, this includes unmovable sensors (on the road, rail and waterways infrastructure), sensors on vehicles, connectivity solutions, servers and data centres as well as the device used by the final user (mobile phone, GPS device, computer etc). (114) To take the example of bridges, inspections are an important element of the life-cycle approach to these infrastructures. Different procedures are in place to ensure the monitoring of infrastructure in Member States. In France, they are governed by the ITSEOA (Instruction Technique pour la Surveillance et l'Entretien des Ouvrages d'Art). In Spain, there are three levels of inspections, which take place at different intervals, and in Germany, periodical structural health monitoring of bridges take place every 3 to 6 years to grade their structural health.

The model also incorporates additional fuel types, such as biofuels (when they differ from standard fossil fuel technologies), LPG, LNG, hydrogen and e-fuels. In addition, representation of infrastructure for refuelling and recharging are among the model refinements, influencing fuel choices. A major model enhancement concerns the inclusion of heterogeneity in the distance of stylised trips; the model considers that the trip distances follow a distribution function with different distances and frequencies. The inclusion of heterogeneity was found to be of significant influence in the choice of vehicle-fuels especially for vehicles-fuels with range limitations.

As outlined in the action plan, the lack of a clear definition of what is 'environmentally sustainable' currently presents one of the biggest obstacles to scale up green investment. This is why one of the cornerstones of the action plan is the creation of a common classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities, or an \"EU taxonomy\". To this end, the Commission tabled a proposal for a regulation in May 2018, 2 which had the following three goals: (1)to provide appropriate definitions to companies and investors on which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable; (2)to empower end-investors, including retail investors, to channel capital towards environmentally sustainable activities, by limiting the risks of 'greenwashing' through these definitions; 3 and (3)to avoid market fragmentation by providing a single point of reference for investors, companies, and Member States, when defining environmental sustainability for investment purposes. The EU taxonomy will constitute a common language that investors and companies can use to identify investment opportunities for projects and economic activities that make a substantial contribution to climate and environmental objectives. This will help investors and companies to transition their operations towards sustainability. The EU taxonomy will thus help to scale up private and public investments to finance the sustainability transition, in line with the objectives of the European green deal. The taxonomy focuses on environmentally sustainable activities in the areas of: climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. By 31 December 2021, the Commission must publish a report on extending the scope of the taxonomy to cover other sustainability objectives, including social objectives. Once complete, the taxonomy will facilitate the development of standards and labels for green financial products. It will also form an integral part of sustainability-related reporting by financial and non-financial companies. Moreover, as announced in the European green deal investment plan, 4 the taxonomy will also be taken into consideration in the guidance documents on climate and environmental tracking and sustainability proofing as part of InvestEU, 5 to be published in the second half of 2020. Beyond InvestEU, the Commission will explore through a renewed strategy on sustainable finance, to be published in the second half of 2020, how public sector entities can use the taxonomy, in order to achieve convergence of standards between the private sector and public entities and make the most appropriate use of blended finance vehicles. 3.Comments on the position of the Council The position of the Council reflects the political agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council on 16 December 2019. The Commission supports this agreement. The political agreement introduced several changes that deviate from the initial Commission proposal, including on the following points: 1.Extension of the scope of the Regulation: Firstly, the political agreement sets out an additional obligation on the EU to apply the taxonomy for the purposes of any public measures, standards or labels, setting out requirements on financial market participants or issuers in the area of financial products or corporate bonds that are marketed as 'environmentally sustainable'. Second, all financial market participants, as defined in the Disclosure Regulation, 6 will be required to disclose how and to what extent the investments that underlie their financial product support economic activities that are aligned with the taxonomy. Financial market participants that do not wish to disclose taxonomy-alignment, and subsequently do not wish to market their product as environmentally sustainable or as having similar characteristics, will need to make a statement explaining this. Third, large financial and non-financial companies that already have to publish a non-financial statement 7 will need to disclose how and to what extent their activities are associated with those covered by the taxonomy. This includes approximately 6,000 companies and groups across the EU. In line with the guidelines accompanying the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, the relevant reporting key performance indicators (KPIs) include turnover, capital expenditure, and operating expenditure. For financial companies, different KPIs can be further specified in a delegated act that the Commission is set to provide by June 2021. 2.Specification of the types of economic activities that can be considered for eligibility: The political agreement introduces two sub-categories of environmentally sustainable economic activities: enabling activities (applicable to all six environmental objectives) and transition activities (applicable only to the climate change mitigation objective). Enabling activities directly enable other activities to make a substantial contribution to one or more of the environmental objectives. Safeguards have been put in place to prevent greenwashing. The first of these safeguards is that enabling activities cannot lead to a 'lock-in' in assets that undermine long-term environmental goals, considering the economic lifetime of those assets. The second of these safeguards is that enabling activities must have a substantial positive environmental impact on the basis of lifecycle considerations. Transition activities are activities: (i) for which there are currently no technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives available; (ii) and that support the transition to a climate-neutral economy in a manner that is consistent with a pathway to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Similar to enabling activities, a number of safeguards have been put in place, in order to prevent greenwashing. 8 This sub-category of transition activities is only relevant for the climate change mitigation objective. 3.Changes in provisions that relate to specific economic activities of interest: Power generation activities from solid fossil fuels are explicitly excluded from eligibility. The importance of 'climate-neutral energy' for the transition is recognised in a recital to the political agreement, while the reference to 'climate-neutral energy' as part of the climate mitigation objective was deleted. The Commission was asked to carry out an assessment of all relevant existing technologies when selecting the activities that are eligible to be considered as 'transition activities'. In this context, economic activities are considered as 'significantly harming' where the long-term disposal of waste may cause significant and long-term harm to the environment. As part of the political agreement, the text also reinforces the role of life cycle assessments in the development of the technical screening criteria. In the area of waste incineration, the reference to 'avoiding' was replaced by 'minimising' waste incineration as one of the ways an economic activity can contribute substantially to the transition to a circular economy. Moreover, a reference to the principles of the waste hierarchy was added. The 'do no significant harm principle' explicitly states that eligible activities should not lead to a significant increase in the generation, incineration or disposal of waste, granting an exception to the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste. 4.Extension of the minimum social safeguards The political agreement adds three international human rights instruments\/guidelines to the list of minimum safeguards: the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; and the International Bill of Human Rights. 5.Expansion of the membership and tasks of the Platform on Sustainable Finance ('the Platform'): The political agreement expands both the scope of operation of the Platform and its membership, so it can advise the Commission on the following additional points: the possible role of sustainability accounting and reporting standards to support the application of the taxonomy; the possible need to improve data availability and quality; addressing other sustainability objectives, including social objectives; the functioning of the minimum safeguards and the possible need to supplement the existing requirements; the evaluation and development of sustainable finance policies, including on policy coherence issues. In this context, the political agreement specifies that the following actors must form part of the composition of the Platform: the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights; civil society representatives; representatives of relevant financial and non-financial business sectors, including representatives of relevant industries; experts with accounting and reporting expertise. The Platform will operate under the Commission's horizontal rules on expert groups. 9 6.Establishment of a Member State Expert Group The political agreement creates a Member State Expert Group to advise the Commission on the appropriateness of the technical screening criteria and the approach taken by the Platform. This expert group will operate under the Commission's horizontal rules on expert groups. 10 7.Amendments to the Disclosure Regulation The political agreement introduces targeted amendments to the Disclosure Regulation. In particular, these amendments seek to anchor the taxonomy-related disclosure by financial market participants within the larger framework on sustainability-related disclosures by the financial services sector as set out by the Disclosure Regulation. In this context, a number of amendments were made to empower the European Supervisory Authorities (\"the ESAs\") to develop regulatory technical standards to specify the taxonomy-related disclosure requirements in this context. In addition, an article on the principle of \"do no significant harm\" was introduced. This amendment empowers the ESAs to develop an additional regulatory technical standard. This additional regulatory technical standard will specify the details of the content and presentation of the information in relation to the \"do no significant harm\" principle for social and environmental objectives. The \"do no significant harm\" principle on social aspects, as defined in the Disclosure Regulation, should be consistent with the minimum safeguards laid out in the Taxonomy Regulation. Companies should, in turn, use the \"do no significant harm\" principle when implementing procedures to comply with these minimum safeguards. 8.Timeline for the delegated acts The Commission will be required to adopt delegated acts, which will contain the technical screening criteria, for the two climate objectives by 31 December 2020 (entry into application on 31 December 2021), and for the other four environmental objectives by 31 December 2021 (entry into application on 31 December 2022). 9.Review The political agreement extends the review clause to task the Commission with covering the following additional topics when publishing its report: to describe the provisions that would be required to extend the scope of the taxonomy to cover other economic activities, including neutral and environmentally harmful activities; to assess the effectiveness of the advisory procedures for the development of the technical screening criteria (consisting of the Platform and the Member States Expert Group); to evaluate the planned supervisory regime. 5.Conclusion The Commission supports the results of the interinstitutional negotiations and can therefore accept the Council's position at first reading.

(2) In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis under Council Regulation (EU) 2020\/521 (1), it is necessary to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under the Global Margin for Commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security measures. (3) This Regulation is directly linked to financing included in amending budget No 2 to the general budget of the Union for 2020 in the framework of which the Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised to finance measures in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to ensure full coherence with that amending budget, this Regulation should apply from the date of its adoption. (4) Article 135(2) of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community ('Withdrawal Agreement') (2) provides that amendments to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311\/2013 (3) that are adopted on or after the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom insofar as those amendments have an impact on the United Kingdom's financial obligations. Amendments set out in this Regulation are limited to the change of the purpose of the use of the Global Margin for Commitments and do not increase financial obligations. Therefore, it is appropriate to clarify that, for the purposes of Article 135(2) of the Withdrawal Agreement, the amendments set out in this Regulation do not have an impact on the financial obligations of the United Kingdom and, as such, are applicable to the United Kingdom. (5) In view of the COVID-19 outbreak and the need to provide financing as a matter of urgency to enable an appropriate response, it was considered appropriate to provide for a derogation from the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.

The CAA rules should be based on the relevant legislation in force within the European Union, as laid down in Annex IV to this Agreement in particular as regards safety, security and air traffic management. The Agreement was signed on 10 June 2013 and entered into force on 2 August 2020. 2.2.The Joint Committee A Joint Committee is set up by Article 22 of the Agreement. The Joint Committee shall be responsible for the administration of the Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose it shall develop cooperation in a range of areas and shall make recommendations and take decisions where expressly provided by the Agreement. Its main tasks are to develop cooperation by: (a) carrying out its specific tasks in relation to the process of regulatory cooperation, as set out in Title II of the Agreement; (b) fostering expert-level exchanges on new legislative or regulatory initiatives and developments, including in the fields of security, safety, the environment, aviation infrastructure (including slots), competitive environment and consumer protection; (c) regularly examining the social effects of the Agreement as it is implemented, notably in the area of employment, and developing appropriate responses to concerns found to be legitimate; (d) agreeing, on the basis of consensus, on proposals, approaches or documents of a procedural nature directly related to the functioning of the Agreement; (e) considering potential areas for the further development of the Agreement, including the recommendation of amendments to the Agreement; and (f) addressing the application of section A.1 of Annex IV (list of air carriers subject to an operating ban). Additionally, in accordance with: Article 5 (Investment) of the Agreement, the Joint Committee shall examine questions relating to bilateral investments of majority ownership, or changes in the effective control of air carriers of the Parties. Under Article 22(3) of the Agreement, the Joint Committee shall adopt, by decision, its rules of procedure. 2.3.The envisaged act of the Joint Committee During its first meeting, the Joint Committee is to adopt a decision regarding the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee ('the envisaged act'). The purpose of the envisaged act is to adopt, in accordance with Article 22(3) of the Agreement, the rules of procedure underpinning the organisation and functioning of the Joint Committee to allow for the proper implementation of the Agreement. 3.Position to be taken on behalf of the Union The position to be adopted on behalf of the Union should aim at the adoption of the rules of procedure of the Joint Committee established by the Agreement. The position should be based on the draft decision of the Joint Committee. 4.Legal basis 4.1.Procedural legal basis 4.1.1.Principles Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides for decisions establishing 'the positions to be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that body is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, with the exception of acts supplementing or amending the institutional framework of the agreement.' The concept of 'acts having legal effects' includes acts that have legal effects by virtue of the rules of international law governing the body in question. It also includes instruments that do not have a binding effect under international law, but that are 'capable of decisively influencing the content of the legislation adopted by the EU legislature'. 4.1.2.Application to the present case The Joint Committee is a body set up by an agreement, namely, in this case, the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part and the government of the State of Israel, of the other part. The act which the Joint Committee is called upon to adopt is an act having legal effects, since it will be binding under international law on the Parties. The envisaged act does not supplement or amend the institutional framework of the Agreement. In the light of that, the procedural legal basis for the proposed decision is Article 218(9) TFEU. 4.2.Substantive legal basis 4.2.1.Principles The substantive legal basis for a decision under Article 218(9) TFEU depends primarily on the objective and content of the envisaged act in respect of which a position is taken on the Union's behalf. If the envisaged act pursues two aims or has two components and if one of those aims or components is identifiable as the main one, whereas the other is merely incidental, the decision under Article 218(9) TFEU must be founded on a single substantive legal basis, namely that required by the main or predominant aim or component. 4.2.2.Application to the present case The main objective and content of the envisaged act relate to air transport. Therefore, the substantive legal basis of the proposed decision is Article 100(2) TFEU. 4.3.Conclusion The legal basis of the proposed decision should be Article 100(2) TFEU, in conjunction with Article 218(9) TFEU. 5.publication of the envisaged act As the act of the Joint Committee will set out its rules of procedure, it is appropriate to publish it in the Official Journal of the European Union after its adoption. 2020\/0339 (NLE) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Joint Committee established by the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part and the government of the State of Israel, of the other part THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, Whereas: (1)The Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part and the government of the State of Israel, of the other part, ('the Agreement') was concluded by the Union by means of Council Decision (EU) 2020\/952 2 and entered into force on 2 August 2020.

Importers and downstream users are required to start complying with the requirements in stages, according to a series of compliance dates depending on the use for which a mixture is placed on the market. (2) The paints sector has raised a specific concern regarding the workability of the emergency health response requirements in the case of paints formulated in limited amounts on a tailor-made basis for an individual consumer or professional user at the point of sale. In order to satisfy customer demand for very specific paint shades, formulators can be asked to formulate and supply paints with an almost unlimited number of different compositions. Compliance with the emergency health response requirements would therefore require formulators either to submit information and create UFIs in advance for an extremely large number of paints of all possible colour combinations, many of which may never be supplied in reality, or else to postpone each supply at the point of sale until the information had been submitted and the UFI had been created. Either approach would place a disproportionate burden on the bespoke paints industry. (3) In order to avoid disproportionate administrative burden, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, for bespoke paints, the requirements are to be amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020\/1677 (3) to provide for the possibility to exempt bespoke paints from the notification obligations in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1272\/2008 and from the obligation in that Annex to create a UFI. However, in that case, in order to allow poison centres to formulate a suitable emergency health response, the individual mixtures contained in bespoke paints are to remain subject to all the requirements of Annex VIII. (4) In the light of that, it is appropriate to amend Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1272\/2008 in order to lay down a rule for bespoke paints for which no information is notified and no corresponding UFI created requiring the UFIs of all the mixtures contained in the bespoke paint to be indicated on the label of the bespoke paint. In addition, if the concentration of a mixture with a UFI contained in the bespoke paint exceeds 5 %, the concentration should be included in the supplemental information indicated on the label of the bespoke paint, since mixtures in bespoke paints of such concentration are more likely to be relevant for emergency health responses. (5) Considering that the compliance date for mixtures for consumer and professional use of 1 January 2021 laid down in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1272\/2008 is approaching, and that this Regulation enables all sectors to comply with that Annex, this Regulation should enter into force as early as possible. (6) Regulation (EC) No 1272\/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 In Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1272\/2008, the following paragraph is added: '8. In the case of a bespoke paint for which no submission in accordance with Annex VIII has been made and no corresponding unique formula identifier has been created, the unique formula identifiers of all the mixtures contained in the bespoke paint in a concentration exceeding 0,1 % which themselves are subject to notification under Article 45 shall be included in the supplemental information on the label of the bespoke paint, located together and listed in descending order of the mixtures' concentration in the bespoke paint, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of Part A of Annex VIII. In a case falling within the first subparagraph, where the concentration of a mixture with a unique formula identifier in the bespoke paint exceeds 5 %, the concentration of that mixture shall also be included in the supplemental information on the label of the bespoke paint next to its unique formula identifier, in accordance with Section 3.4 of Part B of Annex VIII. For the purposes of this paragraph, \"bespoke paint\" means a paint that is formulated in limited amounts on a tailor-made basis for an individual consumer or professional user at the point of sale by tinting or colour mixing.' Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Conclusions and recommendations 1.1. The EESC considers that the European Union must overcome the COVID-19 crisis by building a new model for society, one which will make our economies more green, just and resistant to future shocks. European recovery funds must enable businesses, innovators, workers and investors to affirm their role as world leaders in the expanding clean energy markets. 1.2. Accordingly, the EESC supports the European Commission's strategy to create an enabling environment to boost supply and demand of hydrogen to deliver a climate-neutral economy. It stresses that clean hydrogen must be prioritised, including by the European Hydrogen Alliance, as this is the only option compatible with climate neutrality. 1.3. The EESC would point out that establishing a clean hydrogen economy in Europe is just one strand of the strategy seeking to link up the EU's various energy sectors more effectively. The EESC therefore emphasises that the EU should revise its ambitions upwards to allow for the emergence of a clean energy system, incorporating renewable energy and energy efficiency, so as to provide European businesses with both a solid internal market where innovation can be rolled out safely and an integrated industrial strategy which can export clean energy solutions to the rest of the world. 1.4. The EESC notes that due to the high production and transport costs, clean hydrogen should be used only in cases where other decarbonisation options are not possible, for example in sectors where it is difficult to reduce carbon emissions (1) or in some very specific applications in the transport and construction sectors. 1.5. The EESC stresses that if clean hydrogen is to take off, European funds should not subsidise fossil fuels, and it calls on the Commission to apply the 'do no harm' principle to all public funding under the MFF, InvestEU, the EU Recovery Fund and State aid. 1.6. The EESC stresses that establishing a hydrogen economy requires buy-in by Europeans in their role as entrepreneurs, workers or consumers. The EESC feels that it is unfortunate that there has been no discussion on the strategy's implementation in the various sectors and calls for Europeans to be given a greater role in this process by means of direct, representative consultation and participation. The EESC also asks the Commission to assess the impact of developing clean hydrogen on energy costs for households. 1.7. The EESC points out that the success of the energy transition will be diluted if some workers lose out or if the most vulnerable are unable to benefit from it. At a time of particularly high unemployment (2), especially among young people, it is crucial that we harness the full potential for job creation in developing sectors, just as it is vital to ensure that the transition does not drag some regions down into economic decline, generating structural unemployment. The EESC therefore calls on the European Commission to carry out a study identifying the skills of workers in declining sectors which would be useful for new hydrogen-related jobs. 1.8. The EESC emphasises the key role played by the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance in speeding up the transformation of European industries (3), and asks to be involved as the representative of organised civil society. The EESC also recommends that the Commission provide a detailed description of the timeframes for transition in each industry, tailored to the specific needs of each sector. The steel, cement and chemicals industries need help to change their production methods; failing that, the EESC points out that these industries which are making a significant contribution to the reduction of CO2 emissions may not survive the transformation. 1.9. The EESC welcomes future partnerships with neighbouring countries. However, it calls for greater clarity from the European Commission on the deployment of 40 GW of electrolysers to produce renewable hydrogen in the EU neighbourhood (4), which currently includes countries that are politically unstable and have very different energy transition and renewable energy development policies. The EESC also stresses that in its Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union (5), the Commission sets itself the objective of reducing the EU's dependence on energy imports (6). 1.10. The EESC would also point out that the competitiveness of European businesses is based on their capacity for innovation. Research and innovation also play a key role in bolstering the resilience of our society which has been buffeted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, the EESC stresses the need to provide sufficient budgetary resources for clean energy under Horizon Europe and the European Innovation Council (EIC). 2. Gist of the European Commission communication 2.1. The Commission reaffirms its ambition to speed up the transition towards a sovereign, competitive climate-neutral economy, at a time when the European economy is being buffeted by the COVID-19 pandemic (7). 2.2. The European Commission points to the key role played by clean hydrogen in creating a sovereign, smarter, more integrated and optimised energy system, in which all sectors can contribute fully to decarbonisation. Clean hydrogen and its value chain can play an important role in offsetting variations in renewable energy flows and supplying sectors which are not suited to electrification. Europe needs to establish a hydrogen economy if it is to realise this potential. 2.3. Accordingly, the Commission has presented a three-phase strategy to run until 2050: 2020-2024: 6 GW of electrolysers to produce renewable hydrogen so as to decarbonise existing hydrogen production, 2025-2030: 40 GW in the EU and 40 GW in the countries located near the EU with exports to the EU to decarbonise new applications, such as the steel industry and some forms of transport, 2030-2050: a huge upscale in the capacity installed so that hydrogen can decarbonise all 'hard-to abate' sectors (8). 2.4. The Commission is focusing on five key dimensions in its strategy to make renewable hydrogen competitive in the EU: investments in the EU, boosting demand and scaling up production, designing the right infrastructure and market rules, supporting research and innovation (R&I), the international dimension. 2.5. In order to build this ecosystem, the Commission considers that between EUR 320 bn and 458 bn will have to be invested throughout the current decade in order to meet the hydrogen strategy's 2030 goals: EUR 24 bn to 42 bn on electrolysers, EUR 220 bn to 340 bn on boosting the production of solar and wind power (80 to 120 GW), around EUR 11 bn on updating existing CCS facilities and EUR 65 bn on hydrogen transport, distribution and storage, and refuelling stations. By 2050, EUR 180 to 470 bn will be needed merely for production capacity. What is more, money will also have to be invested in adapting end-use sectors, such as EUR 160 m to 200 m to convert a typical EU steel plant and EUR 850 m to 1 bn to set up 400 small hydrogen refuelling stations. 2.6. The main strategic levers available to the EU to boost private investment in clean hydrogen are described below. 2.6.1. Developing clean hydrogen applications in industry and mobility will boost demand. In order to achieve this, the strategy proposes a two-phase approach: first, hydrogen will be used to decarbonise steel production and could be developed in captive uses, such as urban buses or some trains when electrification is not cost competitive, as well as for heavy-duty road vehicles in parallel to electrification. The forthcoming strategy on sustainable development and smart mobility, to be published by the end of the year, should tackle the role of hydrogen in transport. With this in mind, demand support policies will be considered and may take the form of renewable hydrogen quotas or minimum percentages in specific end-use sectors (such as chemical and transport applications). 2.6.2. In order to increase production, the Commission emphasises that investors and industry will need greater clarity and certainty. It will therefore propose a common low-carbon standard for the promotion of hydrogen production installations based on their direct greenhouse gas performance. It could also propose a comprehensive terminology and European-wide criteria for the certification of renewable hydrogen, building on existing initiatives such as CertifHy. Furthermore, the next revision of the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) should bring in additional mechanisms to encourage the production of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen. The CCfD (Carbon Contract for Difference), a call for long-term contracts with a public counterpart, could be considered to cover the difference between the CO2 strike price (i.e. EUR 55-90\/tCO2) and the actual CO2 price. Lastly, direct and transparent market-based support schemes for renewable hydrogen, awarded through calls for tenders, might be considered. 2.6.3. The Commission proposes gradually rolling out the infrastructure alongside the roll-out of devices running on clean hydrogen. Initially, demand for hydrogen will be met by on-site or local supply. Subsequently, regional clusters will be developed ('Hydrogen Valleys') leading to a growing need for dedicated infrastructure, not just for industrial and transport applications and electricity balancing but also to heat residential and commercial buildings. The existing gas network could be partly used to carry renewable hydrogen over longer distances and large-scale storage facilities will become necessary. 2.6.4. In order to promote the emergence of European champions, the Commission is establishing a European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, a partnership between public authorities, industry and civil society. The goal of this alliance will be (1) to develop an investment programme and a pipeline of projects; (2) to facilitate cooperation in networks of regional, national and European investment projects along the hydrogen value chain, including important projects of common European interest (IPCEI); and (3) to increase financing to help close the investment gap. The alliance should provide a wide forum to coordinate investments by all stakeholders. 2.6.5. The Commission intends to support strategic investments in clean hydrogen through its recovery and resilience plan, and particularly through InvestEU's European strategic investment window (from 2021). 2.6.6. The Commission will also support research and innovation (R&I) by means of a formal partnership on clean hydrogen and key partnerships on transport and industry, such as 2Zero and Clean Steel. The Commission will provide targeted support for sound projects in the Member States through dedicated instruments (such as InnovFin EDP and InvestEU). An interregional innovation investment instrument with a pilot project on hydrogen in carbon-intensive regions will be financed during the next framework period of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). 2.6.7. Lastly, in order to be proactive in promoting further opportunities for cooperation on clean hydrogen, the strategy proposes rethinking energy partnerships with neighbouring countries and regions (to the east of the EU, particularly Ukraine, and the southern neighbourhood) through the relevant international bodies, such as the Energy Community and the Clean Energy Ministerial. This will be flanked by investment support, with the neighbourhood investment platform and the Western Balkans Investment Framework. The Commission will develop a benchmark for euro denominated transactions in hydrogen in order to consolidate the role of the euro in trade of sustainable energy, and will incorporate clean hydrogen into the EU's international, regional and bilateral diplomacy on energy, climate, research, trade and international cooperation. 3. General comments 3.1. The European Green Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality in Europe by 2050, needs tangible policies to become reality. The European Union is also currently facing a dual health and economic emergency triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Union and the Member States must therefore coordinate their responses to these crises, so that economic recovery can be a springboard for a clean and resilient future. For that future to become reality, the EU's economic sovereignty must be bolstered, partly by developing renewable energy and the relevant storage capacity. 3.2. Accordingly, the EESC supports the European Commission's strategy to create an enabling environment to boost supply and demand of hydrogen to deliver a climate-neutral economy. However, it would point out that the success of clean hydrogen depends on a substantial increase in the efficiency of our energy system and massive deployment of renewable energy in order to extend electrification of uses. 3.3. Whilst the EESC welcomes the strategy's ambitious targets with regard to the deployment of electrolysers for the production of renewable hydrogen, it points out that priority must be given to boosting renewable capacity installed in Europe to meet the growing demand for electricity. This is due to the increase in electrification of end uses, plus the electricity needed to produce clean hydrogen. The development of renewable energy does not currently include hydrogen production, and only about a third of the EU's electricity consumption is sourced from renewable energy (9). 3.4. The EESC welcomes the Commission's clarifications regarding the definition of clean hydrogen, defined as being produced through electrolysis using renewable electricity from wind, solar and hydraulic power or the biochemical conversion of renewable biomass. It is pleased that this is a priority for the EU, since it is the only option which is compatible with climate neutrality. 3.5. The EESC does however note that the strategy remains open in the short and medium term to other forms of low-carbon hydrogen produced using fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS) (10), a technology which is still being deployed. The EESC points out that hydrogen with CCS can never be considered a source of green energy if its use is linked to direct or indirect extraction of fossil fuels. The EESC underscores the need to have carbon analysis tools throughout the hydrogen value chain along with CCS in order to be considered low-carbon rather than zero-carbon (11) and to avoid a situation where the emissions savings are insufficient to meet the long-term emissions targets. 3.6. The EESC would also point out that according to the European Court of Auditors' analyses, EU financing for CCS support, such as NER 300, 'has delivered no successful carbon capture and storage project' (12). There is thus much uncertainty about the technological feasibility of CCS, and little certainty about public support for it. 3.7. The EESC takes note of the Commission estimate that carbon prices in the region of EUR 55-90 per tonne of CO2 would be needed to make fossil-based hydrogen with carbon capture competitive with fossil-based hydrogen. It asks the Commission to describe the financial model for investments leading to this offset cost, particularly the impact of the cost of capital leveraged through private investments which result in projects having a higher price tag. The EESC would ask the Commission to provide details of estimates for the clean hydrogen prices necessary to obviate the need for subsidies and to explore the mechanisms required to achieve these prices, in particular during the forthcoming revision of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). 3.8. The EESC would also point out that whilst renewable hydrogen will have to be able to compete with fossil-based hydrogen and fossil-based hydrogen with carbon capture, most importantly it must be able to compete with fossil fuels. For that, its price must be less than 1 USD\/kg (13). Reducing the investment costs (CapEx) of green hydrogen is therefore key. The EESC asks the European Commission to provide hydrogen price scenarios linked to the cost of financial capital leveraged for green hydrogen projects. 3.9. The EESC would also point out that previous attempts to start up a hydrogen economy have failed, chiefly because the demand for hydrogen has never materialised. The EESC is therefore glad that the Commission has clearly identified end-use sectors which will have to use hydrogen: industry and some forms of transport, as well as stationary electricity storage to boost battery storage capacity. 3.10. Clean hydrogen should therefore be used only in cases where other decarbonisation options are not possible, and the EESC calls on the Commission to focus investments on applications where hydrogen can play a major role, such as industry, mobility (shipping and aviation) and renewable energy storage. Wherever batteries are operational particularly for cars, taxis, bus fleets and urban vans and lorries, as mentioned in the strategy hydrogen is likely to provide less cost-effective solutions. It could also be one of the possible options for decarbonising long-distance road freight (14). 3.11. The COVID-19 pandemic has both worsened and widened inequality in our society and increased poverty in Europe. It is therefore important that the hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe does not leave anyone behind. Accordingly, the EESC asks the Commission to monitor and assess requests for employment restructuring linked to the hydrogen strategy. 4. Specific comments The social dimension 4.1. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting crisis, unemployment is expected to reach 9 % in the European Union, hitting young people and unqualified workers particularly badly. The EESC therefore points out how important it is to provide good quality training for workers and how necessary to make the energy sector more attractive to young Europeans. With this goal in mind, the European Union could set up European centres of excellence for apprentices in jobs specific to the energy transition (such as conducting energy audits and installing heat pumps). By granting subsidies and expanding the ErasmusPro programme, the EU could make young Europeans key actors in the energy transition, particularly in the field of clean hydrogen. 4.2. Fostering job creation by deploying renewable hydrogen necessarily means providing support for European SMEs, which account for almost two thirds of European private sector, non-financial jobs (15). The EESC calls on the Commission to develop specific financial instruments to support them (16). 4.3. The EESC would also point out that in order to make the EU more competitive and resilient, it must keep control of its assets and industries, and address the issue of industrial dumping from other regions of the world. 4.4. Lastly, the EESC calls on the EU to make full use of the new, more sustainable business models which are based on dialogue between all stakeholders, including enabling workers to play a strong role in corporate strategy (17). Investment needs in the EU 4.5. The EESC stresses that European funds should not subsidise fossil fuels, calling on the Commission to apply the 'do no harm' principle to all public funding under the MFF, InvestEU, the EU Recovery Fund and State aid. At any rate, hydrogen produced directly or indirectly by means of CCS cannot be eligible for the green taxonomy of European financing. 4.6. The EESC is very glad that the new recovery and resilience tool supports investments and reforms undertaken by Member States which are crucial for sustainable recovery, particularly in the renewable hydrogen sector. The EESC calls on the Commission to ensure that the Member States' recovery and resilience plans are devised in line with the European Green Deal and the National Energy and Climate Plans. In order to do so, the Commission must make contributing to the green transition a prerequisite when evaluating the Member States' projects. 4.7. The Clean Hydrogen Alliance will play a pivotal role in the deployment of hydrogen in Europe, not least by drawing up the investment programme and the regional, national and European project pipeline. The EESC therefore emphasises just how important it is to ensure that all stakeholders are represented fairly, including civil society in all its dimensions, workers and non-governmental organisations. As it stands at present, it is largely made up of private actors (18). The EESC genuinely represents organised civil society, and as such it must play a part in the discussions and consultations. Boosting demand and stepping up production 4.8. The EESC is convinced that auctions in Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfDs) play an important role in ensuring that industrial processes are rapidly converted to hydrogen. CCfDs can send a positive signal to investors and industry (19). However, the EESC would like to highlight the following two points. 4.8.1. Whilst emphasising the pertinence of CCfDs, the Commission acknowledges that the EU ETS in its present form is not able to send price signals strong enough to trigger the investments needed to achieve climate neutrality. This is partly due to the fact that there are still high subsidies for fossil raw materials in the EU. According to the European Commission's report on energy subsidies, subsidies for natural gas used to produce hydrogen with carbon capture and storage (CCS) have actually increased (20). This has therefore created a massive market distortion, hindering investment in climate protection technologies such as green hydrogen or making them unnecessarily expensive. Moreover, even after being reformed, the EU ETS still does not reflect the true carbon price. If subsidies for fossil raw materials were scrapped and if the ETS were further improved, there would be no need for CCfDs. These two tasks should therefore be the Commission's top priority. 4.8.2. As CCfDs are nevertheless necessary, tenders should be framed in such a way that hydrogen electrolysis will only be financed if surplus renewable electricity is used for this purpose (21). The EESC therefore stresses that a European funding system and specific calls for tenders for renewable hydrogen are essential to ensure that the development of hydrogen involving carbon capture and storage (CCS) is not slowed down. The international dimension 4.9. The EESC questions the justification for developing future energy partnerships which aim to deploy 40 GW of electrolysers to produce renewable hydrogen in the countries located near the EU (22). At a time when the leaders of the Member States are calling for stronger European sovereignty, the EESC urges the Commission to develop a coherent approach. 4.10. The EESC also flags up how difficult it is to attract European investors in politically unstable countries. The EESC would nonetheless recommend that the Western Balkan countries on the path to EU membership be included in all discussions and initiatives related to the implementation of the hydrogen strategy. 4.11. The EESC also calls on the Commission to provide more details on the capacity of these countries to develop these future partnerships, since the strategy currently refers to a very wide range of countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine (23), Syria and Tunisia) which have widely diverging policies on energy transition and the development of renewable energy. In these countries, the arrangements for financial support for SMEs recommended by the EESC must also be given priority, given the high proportion of SMEs in these countries and the considerable level of banking intermediation. 4.12. The EESC questions whether these countries have the capacity to deploy sufficient numbers of electrolysers to produce enough renewable hydrogen to meet European as well as domestic demand. In North Africa and Ukraine, deploying 40 GW would require 76 GW of renewable energy by 2030, tripling the capacity of these countries in a decade (24). Brussels, 27 January 2021.

To limit the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Member States 1 have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on citizens' right to move freely across the European Union. These measures often included restrictions on entry to another Member State or other specific requirements (such as undergoing quarantine) applicable to cross-border travellers, including those moving for economic purposes, such as workers and entrepreneurs. While the measures were intended to safeguard the health and wellbeing of citizens, they have had serious consequences for the freedom of movement inside the Union, with knock-on effects on the internal market. Restoring freedom of movement, while protecting public health, is a priority, whether for work, family reasons, or leisure. Exercising free movement rights, conferred directly by the Treaties on Union citizens, should remain possible while limiting the reintroduction of the virus to areas where it has been brought under control. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Commission has worked closely with Member States to ensure a gradual return to free movement. In March 2020, the Commission issued Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services 2 and Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak 3 , containing guidance on the free movement of frontier workers, seasonal workers and self-employed persons exercising critical occupations. On 13 May 2020, the Commission adopted, as part of a package of guidelines and recommendations to help Member States gradually lift restrictions on free movement, a Communication towards a phased and coordinated approach for restoring freedom of movement and lifting internal border controls 4 , referring also to the flexibility to reintroduce certain measures if required by the epidemiological situation. On 11 June 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council on the third assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU 5 , in which it strongly encouraged Member States to finalise the process of lifting restrictions to free movement within the EU as soon as the epidemiological situation allows it. On 15 July 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on short-term EU health preparedness for COVID-19 outbreaks 6 . On 7 August 2020, the Commission's services sent an administrative letter to the Member States, in which they recalled principles applicable to restrictions and limitations to free movement to inform possible decisions on pandemic-related restrictions to free movement. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, any limitations to this right must be necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedom of others. The letter also aimed at promoting coordination and ensuring clarity and predictability for citizens and businesses. Further progress and additional coordination efforts among Member States remain necessary. Taking into account the evolution of the pandemic, some Member States have maintained or reintroduced certain restrictions to free movement within the EU. Unilateral measures have resulted in significant disruptions. While entry bans have to a large extent been lifted in the meantime, businesses and citizens are still confronted with a wide array of diverging measures, which are often adopted at very short notice, are based on very different criteria, or not sufficiently coordinated with other Member States. This has resulted in a high level of uncertainty for both citizens and businesses. Given the lessons learned from the earlier stages of the pandemic, a well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement is needed. Preventing the spread of the virus, safeguarding the health of citizens as well as maintaining free movement within the Union, under safe conditions, is crucial for the efforts to start safely re-building the EU economy and to ensure a smooth functioning of the internal market. Special attention is needed to ensure unrestricted cross-border economic activity. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area This recommendation serves to implement the existing provisions related to restrictions of the freedom of movement on grounds of public health. Consistency with other Union policies This recommendation is in line with other Union policies, including those regarding public health and internal border controls. 2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY Legal basis The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and in particular Articles 21(2), 46, 52(2), 168(6) and 292. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) Article 292 TFEU enables the Council to adopt recommendations. According to this provision, the Council shall act on a proposal from the Commission in all cases where the Treaties provide that it shall adopt acts on a proposal from the Commission. This applies in the current situation, as a consistent approach is necessary to avoid further disruptions caused by unilateral and not sufficiently coordinated measures restricting free movement within the Union. Article 21(1) TFEU stipulates that every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and by the measures adopted to give effect to them. If action by the Union should prove necessary to attain this objective, the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, may adopt provisions with a view to facilitating the exercise of these rights. Pursuant to Article 46 TFEU, the European Parliament and the Council shall, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, issue directives or make regulations setting out the measures required to bring about freedom of movement for workers, as defined in Article 45. Pursuant to Article 49(1) TFEU, restrictions on the freedom of establishment shall be prohibited. Pursuant to Article 56(1) TFEU, restrictions on freedom to provide services within the Union shall also be prohibited. This includes restrictions on the freedom to receive services in another Member State. By virtue of Article 52(2) TFEU, the European Parliament and the Council shall, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, issue directives for the coordination of provisions intended to provide special measures regarding the exercise of the freedom of establishment adopted on grounds of public policy, public security and public health. In accordance with Article 62 TFEU that provision applies equally to services. Pursuant to Article 168(6), the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may also adopt recommendations for the purposes of ensuring a high level of human health protection in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. Proportionality The adoption of unilateral or uncoordinated measures is likely to lead to restrictions on free movement that are inconsistent and fragmented, resulting in uncertainty for Union citizens when exercising their EU rights. The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary and proportionate for achieving the intended objective. 3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS Ex-post evaluations\/fitness checks of existing legislation n.a. Stakeholder consultations The proposal takes into account the discussions held at regular intervals with Member States since the first temporary restrictions were implemented, the information available on the evolving epidemiological situation, relevant available scientific evidence and direct feedback from Union citizens, including in the context of the numerous letters addressed to the European Commission. Impact assessment n.a. Fundamental rights Freedom of movement is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 45 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedom of others. Article 21 of the Charter prohibits restriction on ground of nationality within the scope of application of the Treaties. In line with Directive 2004\/38\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 , free movement rights can be restricted to protect certain public interests, namely the protection of public health, public policy and public security. Such limitations must be applied in compliance with the general principles of EU law, in particular proportionality and non-discrimination as well as respect for fundamental rights. Measures should be based on public health considerations and cannot therefore extend beyond what is strictly necessary to safeguard the public interest that justified their adoption. Any limitations to the freedom of movement within the Union justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health must be necessary, proportionate and based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. They must be suitable for securing the attainment of the objective that they pursue; and not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain that objective. This Recommendation should not be understood as facilitating or encouraging the adoption of restrictions to free movement put in place during the pandemic. Rather, it seeks to provide a coordinated approach in the event that a Member State were to decide to introduce such restrictions. The decision as to whether to introduce restrictions to free movement remain the responsibility of the Member States, which have to act in compliance with Union law. Equally, Member States retain the flexibility not to introduce restrictions even if the criteria and thresholds outlined in this Recommendation are met. 4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS None 5.OTHER ELEMENTS Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal A coordinated approach among Member States requires joint efforts on four key points: the application of common criteria and thresholds in deciding whether to introduce restrictions to free movement, the mapping of common criteria using an agreed colour code, the adoption of a common approach as to the measures applied to persons moving to and from areas identified as higher-risk, and providing the public with clear, comprehensive and timely information about any restrictions and accompanying requirements. To ensure that the process is manageable and transparent, the proposal focuses on three criteria, namely the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate, test positivity rate, and the testing rate. These criteria should then be applied to the different areas, ideally Member States' regions. Only areas with a testing rate of more than 250 COVID-19 tests per 100 000 population should be assessed according to these criteria, to ensure that sufficiently robust data is available. Using these criteria, restrictions could be applied, if at all, to regions with a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification of 50 or more and a test positivity rate of 3% or more. Restrictions could be applied to regions where the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate is more than 150 per 100 000 population even if the test positivity rate is below 3%. The criteria and thresholds outlined are based on extensive discussions with and data made available by Member States. Using data provided by the Member States, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) will produce regularly updated maps, broken down by regions, that would indicate whether the thresholds outlined above are reached in a given area. Where neither the threshold for the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification nor the threshold for the test positivity rate is reached, the region should be marked as 'green'. Where only one of the thresholds is reached, the regions should be marked as 'orange'. Where both thresholds are reached, the region should be marked as 'red'. Where insufficient data is available or the testing rate is not met, the region should be marked as 'grey'. The maps developed by ECDC should facilitate a coordinated approach to Member States' own decision-making processes, and ensure that any decisions taken by the Member States are consistent and well-coordinated. By way of example, Member States could, using these criteria and thresholds, apply restrictions from an area (a)with a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate of 70 and a test positivity rate of 5.5% ('red area'); or (b)with a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate of 175 per 100 000 population, regardless the test positivity rate ('red area'). In contrast, Member States should not apply restrictions on movement from an area (c)with a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate of 20 and a test positivity rate of 2.5% ('green area'); (d)with a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate of 55 and a test positivity rate of 1.5% ('orange area', submission of passenger locator forms or testing may apply); (e)with a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate of 20 and a test positivity rate of 4.5% ('orange area', submission of passenger locator forms or testing may apply). This map should then serve as the basis for Member States' decision-making processes, which would be coordinated, as much as possible, according to an agreed timeline: (a)Each week: the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publishes an updated version of the colour-coded map. (b)Thursday: Member States intending to apply restrictions to persons travelling from an area classified as 'red' or 'grey' inform other Member States and the Commission of its intention. (c)Monday: the measures notified by a Member States should enter into force, save for exceptional circumstances. Following this agreed timeline would ensure coordination among Member States and increase predictability, legal certainty and compliance that would benefit citizens and businesses. 2020\/0256 (NLE) Proposal for a COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Text with EEA relevance) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 21(2), Article 46, Article 52(2), Article 168(6) and Article 292, first and second sentence thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, Whereas: (1)Citizenship of the Union confers on every citizen of the Union the right of free movement. (2)Pursuant to Article 21(1) of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and by the measures adopted to give effect to them. Directive 2004\/38\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 gives effect to that right. Article 45 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter) also provides for freedom of movement and residence. (3)Pursuant to Article 45(1) TFEU, freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Union. The attainment of this objective entails the right of workers of the Member States to move freely within the Union in order to pursue activities as employed persons subject to any limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. (4)Pursuant to Article 49(1) TFEU, restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in another Member State shall be prohibited. (5)Pursuant to Article 56(1) TFEU, restrictions on the freedom to provide services within the Union shall also be prohibited. This includes the right of service providers to cross the border in order to provide services and the right of service recipients to travel to the country of the service provider in order to receive the service. The attainment of these objectives justifies coordination of measures that Member States may consider adopting in respect of non-nationals on grounds of public health. (6)Pursuant to Article 168(1) TFEU, a high level of human health protection is to be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. (7)On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of novel coronavirus, which causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). On 11 March 2020, the WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. (8)To limit the spread of the virus, the Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on Union citizens' right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, such as restrictions on entry or requirements for cross-border travellers to undergo quarantine. (9)On 13 February 2020, the Council adopted Conclusions on COVID-19 9 in which it urged Member States to act together, in cooperation with the Commission, in a proportionate and appropriate manner to develop close and enhanced coordination between Member States to ensure effectiveness of all measures, including, if necessary, measures regarding travel, while safeguarding the free movement within the Union, to ensure optimal protection of public health. (10)On 10 March 2020, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union emphasised the need for a joint European approach with regard to COVID-19. (11)On 16 March 2020, the Commission adopted Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services 10 . On 17 March 2020, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union endorsed these Guidelines. (12)On 30 March 2020, the Commission adopted Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak 11 to ensure that mobile workers and self-employed persons within the Union, in particular those in critical occupations to fight the pandemic, can reach their workplace. (13)On 15 April 2020, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council set out a 'Joint European Roadmap towards lifting COVID-19 containment measures' 12 , according to which restrictions to free movement should be lifted once the epidemiological situation converges sufficiently and social distancing rules are widely and responsibly applied. (14)On 7 May 2020, the Commission adopted Guidance on free movement of health professionals and minimum harmonisation of training in relation to COVID-19 emergency measures recommendations regarding Directive 2005\/36\/EC 13 to help Member States address immediate staff shortages. (15)On 13 May 2020, the Commission adopted, as part of a package of guidelines and recommendations, a Communication towards a phased and coordinated approach for restoring freedom of movement and lifting internal border controls 14 . The Communication proposes a phased and coordinated approach that should start by lifting restrictions between areas or Member States with sufficiently similar epidemiological situations. The approach should be flexible, including the possibility to reintroduce certain measures if the epidemiological situation requires. According to the Communication, Member States should act on the basis of epidemiological criteria, the ability to apply containment measures throughout the whole journey, and economic and social considerations. (16)On 11 June 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council on the third assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU 15 , in which it strongly encouraged Member States to finalise the process of lifting restrictions to free movement within the Union. (17)On 16 July 2020, the Commission adopted Guidelines on seasonal workers in the EU in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak 16 , in which it provides guidance to national authorities, labour inspectorates, and social partners to guarantee the rights, health and safety of seasonal workers, and to ensure that seasonal workers are aware of their rights. (18)To facilitate the unhindered flow of goods within the Union, the Commission adopted a Communication on the implementation of the Green Lanes under the Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services 17 , Guidelines on Facilitating Air Cargo Operations during COVID-19 outbreak 18 , and Guidelines on protection of health, repatriation and travel arrangements for seafarers, passengers and other persons on board ships 19 . (19)In view of the reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases across the Union during the months of June and July 2020, many Member States lifted restrictions to free movement imposed during the first wave of infections. (20)As numbers of COVID-19 cases started to increase across much of the Union in August 2020, some Member States started reintroducing restrictions to free movement. (21)Restrictions to the free movement of persons within the Union put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19 should be based on specific and limited public interest grounds, namely the protection of public health. They should be applied in compliance with the general principles of EU law, in particular proportionality and non-discrimination. This Recommendation is intended to facilitate the application of these principles, in a coordinated manner, to the exceptional situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the mechanisms put in place by this Recommendation should be strictly limited in scope and time to restrictions adopted in response to this pandemic. (22)Unilateral measures in this area have the potential to cause significant disruptions as businesses and citizens are confronted with a wide array of diverging and rapidly changing measures. This is particularly harmful in a situation where the European economy has already been significantly affected by the virus. (23)This Recommendation seeks to ensure increased coordination among Member States considering the adoption of measures restricting free movement on grounds of public health. A coordinated approach among Member States is required to reduce the impact of restrictions on Union citizens and the economy, enhancing transparency and predictability, while ensuring a high level of human health protection. (24)A coordinated approach among Member States requires joint efforts on the following key points: the application of common criteria and thresholds when deciding whether to introduce restrictions to free movement, a mapping of the risk of COVID-19 transmission based on an agreed colour code, and a coordinated approach as to the measures, if any, which may appropriately be applied to persons moving between areas, depending on the level of risk of transmission in those areas. (25)Six months into the crisis, more information is available as to the most effective measures to take, based on regular exchanges among Member States and the Commission. The criteria and thresholds outlined in this Recommendation are based on the data made available by Member States. (26)In view of the evolving epidemiological situation, the Commission, supported by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, should regularly assess the criteria, data needs and thresholds outlined in this Recommendation, including whether to consider other criteria, such as hospitalisation rates or intensive care unit occupancy rates. (27)Member States should apply a coordinated set of indicators and methodology to the epidemiological classification of areas and regions. To limit restrictions to what is strictly necessary, Member States should, as much as possible, aim to limit restrictions, in a non-discriminatory manner, to persons coming from specific areas or regions particularly affected rather than the entire territory of a Member State. (28)This Recommendation should not be understood as facilitating or encouraging the adoption of restrictions to free movement put in place in response to the pandemic, but rather seeks to provide a coordinated approach in the event that a Member State were to decide to introduce such restrictions. The decision as to whether to introduce restrictions to free movement remain the responsibility of the Member States, which have to comply with the requirements of Union law. Equally, Member States retain the flexibility not to introduce restrictions even if the criteria and thresholds outlined in this Recommendation are met. (29)Restrictions on free movement should only be considered when Member States have sufficient evidence to justify such restrictions in terms of their benefit for public health and they have reasonable grounds to believe that the restrictions would be effective. (30)Maps outlining the status of the common criteria for EU regions should be published and updated weekly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, using data provided by the Member States. (31)To improve coordination among Member States and increase predictability for the public, Member States should use an agreed timeline when considering to impose restrictions on freedom of movement due to the COVID-19 outbreak. (32)To limit the disruption to the internal market and family life while the pandemic is ongoing, travellers with an essential function or need, such as workers or self-employed persons exercising critical occupations, cross-border workers, transport workers or transport service providers, seafarers, and persons travelling for imperative business or family reason, including members of cross-border families travelling on a regular basis, should not be required to undergo quarantine. (33)Clear, timely and comprehensive information of the public is crucial to limit the impacts of any restrictions to free movement put in place, ensuring predictability, legal certainty and compliance by citizens, HAS ADOPTED THIS RECOMMENDATION: General Principles 1.Any restrictions to the free movement of persons within the Union put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19 should be based on specific and limited public interest grounds, namely the protection of public health. It is necessary for such limitations to be applied in compliance with the general principles of Union law, in particular proportionality and non-discrimination. Any measures taken should thus not extend beyond what is strictly necessary to safeguard public health. 2.Any such restrictions should be lifted as soon as the epidemiological situation allows it. 3.There may be no discrimination between Member States, for example by applying more generous rules to travel to and from a neighbouring Member State as compared to travel to and from other Member States in the same epidemiological situation. 4.Restrictions cannot be based on the nationality of the person concerned, but should be based on the location(s) of the person during the 14 days prior to arrival. 5.Member States should always admit their own nationals and Union citizens and their family members resident in their territory, and should facilitate swift transit through their territories. 6.Member States should pay particular attention to the specificities of cross-border regions and the need to cooperate at local and regional level. 7.Member States should regularly exchange information on all matters covered by the scope of this recommendation. Common criteria 8.Member States should take the following criteria into account when considering to restrict free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: (a)the '14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate', that is, the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population in a given area in the last 14 days; (b)the 'test positivity rate', that is, the percentage of positive tests among all tests for COVID-19 infection carried out in given area during the last week; (c)the 'testing rate', that is, the number of tests for COVID-19 infection per 100 000 population carried out in a given area during the last week. Data on the common criteria 9.To ensure that comprehensive and comparable data is available, Member States should, on a weekly basis, provide the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control with data on the criteria mentioned in point 8. Member States should also provide this data at the regional level to ensure that any measures can be targeted to those regions where they are strictly necessary. Common thresholds when considering restrictions of free movement 10.Member States should not restrict the free movement of persons travelling to or from another Member State with (a)a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate of less than 50 new COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population; or (b)a test positivity rate of tests for COVID-19 infection of less than 3%; provided that the Member State concerned has a weekly testing rate of more than 250 COVID-19 tests for infection per 100 000 population. By way of exception, in Member States where the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate is more than 150 per 100 000 population, the criterion in letter (b) should not apply. 11.Member States should take into account the regional distribution of cases within other Member States. Wherever possible, restrictions to free movement should be circumscribed in the light of the situation of the affected regions of the Member State concerned. For this purpose, the thresholds mentioned in point 10 should be applied to the regional level, not limiting free movement to or from other regions of that Member State that meet the thresholds. Mapping of risk areas when considering restrictions of free movement 12.Based on the data provided by the Member States, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control should publish a map of EU\/EEA countries 20 , broken down by regions, in order to support Member States' decision-making. In this map, an area should be marked in the following colours: (a)green, if the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate is less than 25 and the test positivity rate of tests for COVID-19 infection is less than 3%; (b)orange, if the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate is less than 50 but the test positivity rate of tests for COVID-19 infection is 3% or more, or, if the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate ranges from 25 to 150 but the test positivity rate of tests for COVID-19 infection is less than 3%; (c)red, if the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate is 50 or more and the test positivity rate of tests for COVID-19 infection is 3% or more, or if the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 case notification rate is more than 150 per 100 000 population; (d)grey, if not sufficient information is available to assess the criteria in point 10 or if the testing rate is 250 or less COVID-19 tests for infection per 100 000 population. Different shades of grey should be used to distinguish between the two cases. 13.Each week, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control should publish an updated version of the map. Coordination among Member States and common timeline 14.Member States intending to apply restrictions to persons travelling to or from an area classified as 'red' or 'grey' pursuant to point 12(c) and (d), based on its own decision-making processes, should inform other Member States and the Commission of its intention on a Thursday. For this purpose, Member States should use the established network of the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR). The IPCR contact points should ensure that the information is passed on to their competent authorities without delay. Save for exceptional circumstances, the measures communicated by a Member State pursuant to this point should enter into force on the Monday of the following week. 15.When considering whether to apply restrictions, Member States should also take into account the epidemiological situation in their own territory, including testing policies, the number of tests performed and test positivity rates, and other epidemiological indicators. 16.Member States should not impose any restrictions on persons travelling to or from an area classified as 'red' pursuant to point 12(c) located in another Member State if they do not impose the same restrictions on an area classified as 'red' pursuant to point 12(c) located in their own territory. 17.Member States should immediately inform other Member States and the Commission of the lifting of any previously introduced restrictive measures, which should enter into force as soon as possible. Restrictions to free movement should be lifted when an area is again classified as 'orange' or 'green' pursuant to point 12, provided that at least 14 days have elapsed since their introduction. 18.At the latest 7 days after the adoption of this Recommendation, Member States should phase out restrictions applied on areas not classified as 'red' or 'grey' pursuant to point 12 before the adoption of this Recommendation. Common framework as regards possible measures for travellers coming from higher-risk areas 19.Member States should not refuse the entry of persons travelling from other Member States. Member States that introduce restrictions to free movement, based on their own decision-making processes, could require persons travelling from an area classified as 'red' or 'grey' pursuant to point 12(c) and (d) to (a)undergo quarantine; or (b)undergo a test for COVID-19 infection after arrival. Wherever possible, the possibility to undergo tests for COVID-19 infection instead of quarantine should be the preferred option. Travellers should be given the option to substitute the test mentioned in letter (b) by a test for COVID-19 infection carried out prior to departure. 20.Member States should mutually recognise the results of tests for COVID-19 infection carried out in other Member States by certified health bodies. 21.Travellers with an essential function or need should not be required to undergo quarantine, in particular: (a)Workers or self-employed persons exercising critical occupations, frontier and posted workers as well as seasonal workers as referred to in the Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during the COVID-19 outbreak 21 ; (b)transport workers or transport service providers, including drivers of freight vehicles carrying goods for use in the territory as well as those merely transiting; (c)pupils, students and trainees who travel abroad on a daily basis; (d)persons travelling for imperative family or business reasons; (e)diplomats, staff of international organisations and people invited by international organisations whose physical presence is required for the well-functioning of these organisations, military personnel and humanitarian aid workers and civil protection personnel in the exercise of their functions; (f)passengers in transit; (g)seafarers; (h)journalists, when performing their duties. 22.Member States could require persons arriving from an area classified as 'red', 'orange' or 'grey' pursuant to point 12(c), (b) and (d) to submit passenger locator forms, notably those arriving by airplane, in accordance with data protection requirements. Wherever possible, a digital option for passenger locator information should be used in order to simplify processing, while ensuring equal access to all citizens. 23.Where justified, Member States could consider recommending that persons travelling from an area classified as 'orange' pursuant to point 12(b) undergo at least a test for COVID-19 infection prior to departure or upon arrival. 24.Any measures applied to persons arriving from an area classified area as 'red', 'orange' or 'grey' pursuant to point 12(c), (b) and (d) may not be discriminatory, that is, should apply equally to returning nationals of the Member State concerned. 25.Member States should ensure that any formal requirements imposed on citizens and businesses provide a concrete benefit to the public health efforts to combat the pandemic and do not create an undue and unnecessary administrative burden. 26.If a person develops symptoms upon arrival at the destination, testing, diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing should take place in accordance with the local practice, and entry should not be refused. Information on cases detected on arrival should be immediately shared with the public health authorities of the countries the person concerned has resided in during the previous 14 days for contact tracing purposes, using the Early Warning and Response System. 27.Restrictions should not take the form of prohibitions on the operation of certain transport services. Communication and information to the public 28.Member States should provide relevant stakeholders and the general public with clear, comprehensive and timely information about any restrictions to free movement, any accompanying requirements (for example negative tests for COVID-19 infection or passenger locator forms), as well as the measures applied to travellers travelling from higher-risk areas. In particular, Member States should, as quickly as possible, inform the public of any newly introduced or lifted restrictions, communicated to other Member States and the Commission pursuant to points 14 and 17. This information should also be made available on the 'Re-open EU' web platform, which should contain a cross-reference to the map published regularly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control pursuant to points 12 and 13. The substance of the measures, their geographical scope and the categories of persons to whom they apply should be clearly described.

Following this international obligation, the EU together with its Member States has agreed to fix ambitious set of targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of 80 % to 95% by 2050 and of 40% by 2030. In November 2018, the Commission presented its strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy by 2050 - A Clean Planet for all 1 . In its Communication - following the invitations by the European Parliament and the European Council, the Commission outlined a number of measures, among which to explore how the assets of the European Coal and Steel Community in liquidation could support breakthrough technologies for near zero carbon steelmaking. In line with its long-term vision, the Commission published on December 2019 the European Green Deal Communication 2 . Among the measures to take, the Commission put the decarbonisation of the steel sector high in the political agenda and it is committed to explore whether part of the funding under the European Coal and Steel Community in liquidation can be used to support near zero carbon steel-making processes by 2030. Europe needs between 175 to 290 billion additional yearly investments in the next decades. In this context, within the Green Deal Investment Plan, the Commission suggests the revision of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel legal bases to incentivise private capital to flow to green projects. The Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) is an EU funding programme that finances research projects in coal and steel sectors. The RFCS has its own legal bases standing outside the Multiannual Financial Framework. After the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty in 2002 and under Protocol 37 annexed to the EU Treaties, the Member States established the new \"Research Fund for Coal and Steel\" (RFCS) as a continuation of the European Coal and Steel Community Coal and Steel Research and Technical Development Programmes. The RFCS Research Programme used to provide annually around EUR 40 million of research and innovation funding to sectors related to coal and steel (with a distribution of 27,2 % for coal and 72,8 % for steel) bringing together industrial partners, SMEs, leading research centres and universities across the European Union to develop knowledge and foster innovation. Its activities are funded by the revenue generated by the assets of the ECSC in liquidation, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 1 of Protocol 37. In order to reduce as far as possible, the fluctuations that movements in the financial markets could cause on the financing of research, a smoothing arrangement is applied. However, following declining revenues from assets management, the feeding of RFCS budget, from the net income and from the smoothing mechanism, dropped from EUR 42 million in 2017 to EUR 12 million in 2019. In 2017, the Commission proposed the use of de-commitments and recovery orders to top up the budget to EUR 40 million until 2020 3 . In April 2018, the European Parliament adopted a legislative resolution [P8_TA (2018)0061] 4 accompanying its consent to the Council Decision 2018\/599 5 , which aimed to authorise the use of all de-commitments and recovery orders made under the 'Research Fund for Coal and Steel' (RFCS) programme since 2003. In this resolution, the European Parliament called for making the management of the assets of the ECSC in liquidation more active, or even for using some of those funds to launch major projects to make European steel clean and competitive. As recognised 6 , annual funding of at least EUR 40 million is necessary to successfully implement the research programme of the RFCS. However, under the current interest rate, considering the exhaustion of the resources available to allow the smoothing mechanism and in view of the UK withdrawal, it will be difficult to generate appropriate annual returns on the invested assets in the short to medium-term. A recent review by the Court of Auditors on the European Coal and Steel Community 7 concluded that funding the RFCS on the sole basis of asset management revenue is not sustainable in the current interest rate environment. In particular, the Court of Auditors suggested that the revision of the financial guidelines was urgent and should have answered how the equity of the ECSC in liquidation could be made productive within the EU's framework research programmes. In June 2019, the Coal and Steel Advisory Groups (CAG and SAG) 8 urged for the revision of the legal bases to ensure the continuation of the program, whilst adapting the objectives to the current sector needs. At the same time, they endorsed the progressive use of a share of the assets, approximately equal to one third (corresponding to around EUR 50-70 million per year for the year 2021-2027) to fund research projects for the coal and steel sector, in synergy with the Just Transition Mechanism, the Coal Regions in Transition initiative 9 , Horizon Europe and the Innovation Fund. On 25 June 2019 the ad-hoc-joint CAG-SAG group endorsed the opening of the ECSC assets. Research and innovation allows in the intensive energy sectors the development and the demonstration of an installation on appropriate scale to test all the technical and economic data in order to proceed with the industrial or commercial exploitation of the technology at the minimum risk. The 2019 Green Deal Communication proposes to support clean steel breakthrough technologies leading to zero-carbon steel making process by 2030 and to explore whether part of the funding being liquidated under the European Coal and Steel Community can be used. The Research Fund for Coal and Steel will in particular develop a Clean Steel production as a potential game-changer dragging other intensive energy sectors, such as chemicals and cement, towards Climate neutrality by 2050. Consequently, a revision of RFCS legal bases have gained relevance, urgency and ambition. In light of the above, this proposal suggests changes to the current Decision. It aims at allowing selling a part of the assets 10 of the ECSC in liquidation for the period 2021-2027 in order to provide an annual RFCS allocation of EUR 111 million per year. This annual allocation will continue to support the collaborative research in the sectors related to coal and steel under the RFCS Research Programme, it will also support breakthrough technologies leading to near zero-carbon steel making by 2030 and research projects for the coal sector managing the just transition of formerly operating coal mines or coal mines in the process of closure, and related infrastructure in line with the Just Transition Mechanism and in compliance with Article 4(2). Specifically to the sector related to the steel industry, the Commission will aim to support research projects, via a dedicated Clean Steel co-programmed partnership 11 in synergy with other European Union's programmes especially with the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. A European public-private partnership is considered a valuable tool to support the development and implementation of research activities of strategic importance to enable the Union to address global challenges and maintain its competitiveness. Proposed changes to permit use of the assets of the fund where necessary to provide an annual allocation of eur 40 million and finance large research and innovation projects. It is proposed to modify Decision 2003\/76\/EC to provide until the year 2027 an annual allocation to the RFCS that will be used as follows: EUR 40 million per year will finance collaborative research in the coal sector and steel sector whereas the remaining EUR 71 million will finance breakthrough technologies leading to near zero-carbon steel making and research projects for managing the just transition of formerly operating coal mines or coal mines in the process of closure, and related infrastructure in line with the Just Transition Mechanism. These allocations and related payments should be generated by the net revenue on investments and, where necessary, by proceeds generated by sales of assets. This allocation should be explicitly enshrined in the Decision in order to allow a predictable flow of resource, at sufficient scale to enable continuation of desired support for collaborative research in the steel and coal sectors. To date, the assets of the ECSC in liquidation have been managed on the basis that the return on the assets invested would be the means whereby research projects would be financed. This is reflected in the language of section 1 ('use of funds') of the Annex to Council Decision 2003\/77\/EC and in recital 3 to the same Decision, which foresees that the \"entire capital of the Assets of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel should be preserved intact\". For the reasons explained above, such an approach is inconsistent with the needs of providing the required level of funding that is needed to make viable a meaningful research programme for the steel and coal sectors. A continued insistence on the assets of the fund remaining intact is therefore not a realistic stance and needs to be modulated. Furthermore, there are no more obligations to keep the reserves to provide assurances to the creditors of the ECSC as there are no more outstanding borrowings. To this end, it is necessary to amend the Decision to better reflect the needs of the underlying policy that is to be served by the ECSC in liquidation, and the challenges of generating returns on the level needed against the backdrop of current market conditions, while keeping enough assets of the ECSC to generate revenues after 2027. The abolition of the smoothing mechanism is proposed as it is considered an obsolete tool following the adoption of proposed changes. In addition, the Commission will use the opportunity of the revision of the Decision to write off claims where the foreseeable cost of recovery would exceed the amount to be recovered and the write off would not harm the image of the Union; where the claim cannot be recovered in view of the insolvency of the debtor, or of any other insolvency proceedings; where recovery is inconsistent with the principle of proportionality. Finally, paragraph 2 of Article 2, laying down the procedure for the adoption of the multiannual financial guidelines for management of the assets and paragraph 3 of Article 4, laying down the procedure for the adoption of multiannual technical guidelines for the programme should be deleted because they are now completely redundant with paragraph 2 of Article 2, of Protocol 37 12 . Those redundant provisions should be deleted for transparency reasons and because they cannot be relied on any longer. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The proposal is part of a legal package revising the RFCS research programme. In particular, it is linked to: A Commission's proposal to amend Council Decision 2008\/376\/EC on the adoption of the Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and on the multiannual technical guidelines for this programme. A Commission's proposal to amend Council Decision 2003\/77\/EC laying down the multiannual financial guidelines for managing the assets of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in liquidation and, on completion of the liquidation, the assets of the RFCS. The revision of Council Decision 2003\/77\/EC, under Directorate-General Budget's responsibility, is also consistent with the European Court of Auditors 2019 Review on the winding-up of the ECSC. Consistency with other Union policies The proposal is revised in line with the Paris Agreement, the European Green Deal' 13 Communication setting the framework to transform the EU into the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 and its follow up Commission Communication Green Deal Investment Plan Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, 14 presented on 14 January 2020. 2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY Legal basis The legal basis giving the EU the right to act is Article 2 of Protocol (N 37) annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The measures implementing the Protocol are established in a Council decision, the revision of which belongs to the Commission exclusive right of initiative for legislative proposals. Proportionality The proposal is necessary for establishing the measures necessary for the implementation of the Protocol, annexed to the EU Treaties, on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. Choice of the instrument The instrument amends a Council Decision and it needs therefore to be a Decision. 3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS Ex-post evaluations\/fitness checks of existing legislation The proposal is based on the results of the seven yearly report, which carry out a monitoring exercise of the RFCS Programme, including an assessment of the expected benefits, with the assistance of a panel of experts 15 . The most recent seven yearly report was published on 5 February 2020 16 . The experts analysed the functioning of the RFCS Programme, assessed the technological developments and expected benefits of the programme to the sector and society, and drew recommendations for the improvement of the programme, including a revision of the legal basis. Stakeholder consultations The RFCS stakeholders have been involved in several ad-hoc meetings, specific Advisory Group meetings (Coal Advisory Group CAG, Steel Advisory Group - SAG) and COSCO meetings (equivalent to the Programme Committee in Horizon 2020). As direct outcome of these meetings, on 25 June 2019 the opening of the ECSC assets was endorsed by the ad-hoc joint CAG-SAG group. Collection and use of expertise The preliminary results of the present RFCS Monitoring and Assessment report were illustrated in the seminar 'Steel and Coal: a New Perspective' hosted by the European Commission on 28 March 2019 where more than 100 stakeholders were present 17 . Impact assessment An impact assessment is not necessary for the proposed revision, as the expected economic, environmental or social impacts are not likely to be significant Regulatory fitness and simplification The proposal is based on the results of the seven yearly report, which foresees a regular review of the RFCS programme, including an assessment of the expected benefits. Fundamental rights The proposal is in line with the protection of fundamental rights. 4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The proposal does not create any new liabilities to be charged to the General Budget under the current MFF. 5.OTHER ELEMENTS Explanatory documents (for directives) Not applicable. Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal The revision is then limited to the following provisions: (1)Article 1, paragraph 1a This article introduces the \"de minimis\" clause and it is based on Article 101 of the Financial Regulation on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union. It allows the Commission to write off claims, even before exhausting all the possible remedies, in limited and specific cases where the foreseeable cost of recovery would exceed the amount to be recovered and the write off would not harm the image of the Union, or in case of the insolvency of the debtor or where the recovery is inconsistent with the principle of proportionality. The application of this clause will allow to ensure an orderly closure of the liquidation process. (2)Article 2, paragraph 1 The assets shall be managed by the Commission in such a manner as to keep an annual RFCS allocation of [EUR 111 Million], until the year 2027 to finance research in the sectors related to coal and steel industry and namely [EUR 40 Million] to finance collaborative research in the said sectors and [EUR 71 Million] to finance research for breakthrough technologies leading to near zero-carbon steel making and to finance research and innovation projects for managing the just transition of formerly operating coal mines or coal mines in the process of closing, and related infrastructure in line with the Just Transition Mechanism for the coal sector and in compliance with Article 4(2). After the year 2027, the assets shall be managed by the Commission in such a manner as to ensure a long-term return.

All assets and liabilities of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) were transferred to the Union on 24 July 2002. (2)In accordance with Protocol No 37, the net worth of the assets and liabilities, as they appear in the balance sheet of the ECSC of 23 July 2002, is to be considered as assets intended for research in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry, referred to as the 'ECSC in liquidation', and, on completion of the liquidation, as the 'assets of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel'. (3)Protocol No 37 also provides that the revenue from those assets, referred to as the 'Research Fund for Coal and Steel' (RFCS), is to be used exclusively for research, outside the research framework programme, in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry in accordance with the provisions of Protocol No 37 and of acts adopted on the basis thereof. (4)On 1 February 2003, the Council adopted Decision 2003\/76\/EC 19 2, which establishes the rules for implementing Protocol No 37. (5)Due to the low interest rate context the revenues assigned to the funding of research projects for coal and steel are rapidly decreasing. (6)This is leading to a situation where the critical minimum budget available for organising an annual call for proposal for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (the 'programme') might not be met. (7)A critical minimum budget for organising a call is necessary in order for the programme to provide meaningful support to worthwhile collaborative research projects having the critical mass and EU added value for improving the sustainability, i.e. health, safety, working conditions and reducing the environmental impact in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry. (8)Within the Communication on the European Green Deal COM(2019) 640 final, the Commission committed to support clean steel breakthrough technologies leading to near zero-carbon steelmaking by 2030. To enable this, the Commission committed to explore whether part of the funding under the ECSC in liquidation could be used. (9)To meet EU targets, the Green Deal Investment Plan and Just Transition Mechanism Communication COM(2020) 21 final - considered necessary a revision of the RFCS legal bases to enable using the assets of the ECSC in liquidation and, on completion of the liquidation, the assets of the RFCS. (10)The sale of a share of the assets of the ECSC in liquidation and, on completion of the liquidation, the assets of the RFCS to finance research projects in the coal and steel sectors should be allowed on the condition that reserves should be kept to guarantee the limited remaining obligations, resulting from any unforeseeable liability and that reasonable part of the assets, which are no longer needed for the above, should still be invested to generate revenues. (11)The sale of a share of the assets of the ECSC in liquidation and, on completion of the liquidation, the assets of the RFCS could be necessary to provide until the year 2027 an annual allocation of [EUR 111 million] to the RFCS that will be used as follows: [EUR 40 million] per year will finance collaborative research in the coal and steel sectors and whereas the remaining [EUR 71 million] will finance breakthrough technologies leading to near-zero carbon steel making and research projects for managing the just transition of formerly operating coal mines or coal mines in the process of closing, and related infrastructure in line with the Just Transition Mechanism and in compliance with Article 4(2). The possibility to sell a share of the assets of ECSC in liquidation and, on completion of the liquidation, the assets of the RFCS is limited to the funding of annual allocations for the financial years 2021- 2027. (12)The RFCS should therefore be financed not only by the net revenue from the investments but also, where needed, by the proceeds generated by selling part of the assets in the fund up to the amount envisaged for the period 2021-2027. (13)Paragraph 2 of Article 2, laying down the procedure for the adoption of the multiannual financial guidelines for management of the assets and paragraph 3 of Article 4, laying down the procedure for the adoption of multiannual technical guidelines for the programme, should be deleted because they are redundant with paragraph 2 of Article 2, of Protocol 37. (14)It is proposed the abolition of the smoothing mechanism as it is an obsolete tool. (15)A new paragraph should be added to Article 1, in order to allow the writing off of claims based on the principles established by Article 101(2), first subparagraph, of the Financial Regulation 20 . (16)Decision 2003\/76\/EC should therefore be amended accordingly, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Decision 2003\/76\/EC is amended as follows: (1)Article 1 is amended as follows: (a)The following paragraph 1a is inserted: '1a. The Commission shall write off claims, even before exhausting all the said remedies, in the following cases: (a)Where the foreseeable cost of recovery would exceed the amount to be recovered and the write off would not harm the image of the Union (b)Where the claim cannot be recovered in view of the insolvency of the debtor, or of any other insolvency proceedings (c)Where recovery is inconsistent with the principle of proportionality.' (2)Article 2 is amended as follows: (a)Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following: '1. The assets shall be managed by the Commission in such a manner as to keep an annual RFCS allocation of [EUR 111 Million] until the year 2027 to finance research in the sectors related to coal and steel industry and namely [EUR 40 Million] to finance collaborative research in the said sectors and [EUR 71 Million] to finance research for breakthrough technologies leading to near zero-carbon steel-making and research projects for managing the just transition of formerly operating coal mines or coal mines in the process of closure, and related infrastructure in line with the Just Transition Mechanism and in compliance with Article 4(2). After the year 2027, the assets shall be managed by the Commission in such a manner as to ensure a long-term return. The assets shall be invested with the objective of preserving, and where possible enhancing, the value of those assets.' (b)The following paragraph 1a is inserted: '1a. The annual allocation of [EUR 111 Million] shall be constituted of the net revenue from the investments, and, when these are insufficient, the sale of part of the assets of the ECSC in liquidation and, on completion of the liquidation, the assets of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel.'

The 20 key principles of the Pillar are structured in three categories: equal opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; and social protection and inclusion. The 20 principles of the Pillar should guide the actions under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). In order to contribute to the implementation of the Pillar, the ESF+ should support investments in people and systems in the policy areas of employment, education and social inclusion, thereby supporting economic, territorial and social cohesion in accordance with Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). (2) At Union level, the European Semester for economic policy coordination (the 'European Semester') is the framework to identify national reform priorities and monitor their implementation. Member States develop their own national multiannual investment strategies in support of those reform priorities. Those strategies should be presented alongside the yearly national reform programmes in order to outline and coordinate priority investment projects to be supported by Union or national funding. They should also help to use Union funding in a coherent manner and to maximise the added value of the financial support to be received, in particular from the programmes supported by the Union under, where relevant, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund the specific objectives and scope of support of which are set out in Regulation (EU) 2021\/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), the ESF+, the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) established by a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) established by Regulation (EU) No 1305\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and the InvestEU Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/523 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) (InvestEU Programme). (3) Revised guidelines for the employment policies of Member States were adopted by means of Council Decision (EU) 2020\/1512 (7). The text of those guidelines has been aligned with the principles of the Pillar, with a view to improving Europe's competitiveness and making it a better place to invest, create jobs and foster social cohesion. In order to ensure the full alignment of the ESF+ with the objectives of those guidelines, particularly as regards employment, education, training and the fight against social exclusion, poverty and discrimination, the ESF+ should support Member States by taking into account the relevant integrated guidelines and relevant country-specific recommendations adopted pursuant to Article 121(2) and Article 148(2) and (4) TFEU and, where appropriate, the national reform programmes underpinned by national strategies. The ESF+ should also contribute to relevant aspects of the implementation of key Union initiatives and activities, in particular the Commission communications of 10 June 2016 entitled 'A new Skills Agenda for Europe', of 30 September 2020 entitled 'European Education Area', and of 7 October 2020 entitled 'A Union of Equality: EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation' as well as the Council Recommendations of 15 February 2016 on the integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market, of 19 December 2016 on Upskilling Pathways, of 30 October 2020 on A Bridge to Jobs Reinforcing the Youth Guarantee and of 12 March 2021 on Roma equality, inclusion and participation. (4) On 20 June 2017, the Council adopted conclusions entitled 'A sustainable European future: the EU response to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development'. The Council underlined the importance of achieving sustainable development across the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental) in a balanced and integrated way. It is vital that sustainable development is mainstreamed into all Union internal and external policy areas and that the Union is ambitious in its policies that address global challenges. The Council welcomed the Commission communication of 22 November 2016 entitled 'Next steps for a sustainable European future' as a first step in mainstreaming the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and applying sustainable development as an essential guiding principle for all Union policies, including through its financing instruments. The ESF+ should contribute to the implementation of the SDGs by, inter alia, eradicating extreme forms of poverty (SDG 1); promoting quality and inclusive education (SDG 4); promoting gender equality (SDG 5); promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (SDG 8); and reducing inequality (SDG 10). (5) Recent and ongoing developments have aggravated the structural challenges arising from economic globalisation, social inequalities, the management of migration flows and the increased security threat, clean energy transition, technological change, demographic decline, unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, and an increasingly ageing workforce as well as challenges stemming from growing mismatches between demand and supply of skills and labour in some sectors and regions, experienced especially by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The green and digital transitions and the transformation of European industrial ecosystems are likely to entail many new opportunities, if accompanied by the right skill sets and employment and social policies and actions. Taking into account the changing realities of the world of work, the Union should be prepared for current and future challenges by investing in relevant skills, education, training and lifelong learning making growth more inclusive and by improving employment and social policies, while taking into account economic and industrial sustainability, labour mobility and aiming to establish a gender balanced labour market. (6) Regulation (EU) 2021\/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) establishes the framework for action by the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund, the Just Transition Fund (JTF) established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), the EMFAF, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), the Internal Security Fund (ISF) and the Instrument for Financial Support for Border Management and Visa Policy as a part of the Integrated Border Management Fund and lays down, in particular, the policy objectives and the rules concerning programming, monitoring and evaluation, management and control for Union funds implemented under shared management. It is therefore necessary to specify the general objectives of the ESF+ and to lay down specific provisions concerning the type of activities that may be financed by the ESF+. (7) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018\/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) (the 'Financial Regulation') lays down rules on the implementation of the general budget of the Union (Union budget), including the rules on grants, prizes, procurement, indirect management, financial instruments, budgetary guarantees, financial assistance and the reimbursement of external experts. Co-financing for grants may be provided from beneficiaries' own resources, income generated by the project or financial or in-kind contributions from third parties. In order to ensure consistency in the implementation of Union programmes, the Financial Regulation is to apply to the actions to be implemented under direct or indirect management under the ESF+. (8) The forms of Union funding and the methods of implementation under this Regulation should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden, and the expected risk of non-compliance. For grants, this should include consideration of the use of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, as well as financing not linked to costs as referred to in Article 125(1), point (a), of the Financial Regulation. To implement measures linked to the socio-economic integration of third-country nationals, and in accordance with Article 94 of the Regulation (EU) 2021\/1060, the Commission may reimburse Member States using simplified cost options including lump sums. (9) In order to streamline and simplify the funding landscape and create additional opportunities for synergies through integrated funding approaches, the actions which were supported by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived established by Regulation (EU) No 223\/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), and by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation established by Regulation (EU) No 1296\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) should be integrated into the ESF+. The ESF+ should comprise of two strands: the strand under shared management (the 'ESF+ strand under shared management'), to be implemented under shared management, and the Employment and Social Innovation strand (the 'EaSI strand'), to be implemented under direct and indirect management. This should contribute to reducing the administrative burden linked to the management of different funds, in particular for Member States and beneficiaries, while maintaining simpler rules for simpler operations such as the distribution of food and\/or basic material assistance. (10) In view of the wider scope of the ESF+, it is appropriate that the aims to enhance the effectiveness of labour markets, promote equal access to quality employment, improve equal access to and quality of education and training to aid reintegration into education systems, promote social inclusion, facilitate access to healthcare for vulnerable persons and contribute to eradicating poverty, are not only implemented under shared management under ESF+ strand under shared management, but also, for actions required at Union level, under direct and indirect management under the EaSI strand. (11) This Regulation lays down a financial envelope for the entire duration of the ESF+, which is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 18 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2020 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources (13), for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure. It should specify the allocation for the ESF+ strand under shared management and the allocation for actions to be implemented under the EaSI strand. (12) With a view to facilitating the implementation of the specific and operational objectives of the EaSI strand, the ESF+ should support activities related to technical and administrative assistance, such as preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities, while communication and dissemination activities should be part of the actions eligible under the EaSI strand. (13) The ESF+ should aim to promote employment by means of active interventions enabling integration and reintegration into the labour market, in particular for young people, especially through the implementation of the reinforced Youth Guarantee, for long-term unemployed people, for disadvantaged groups on the labour market and for inactive people, as well as by means of promoting selfemployment and the social economy. The ESF+ should aim to improve the functioning of labour markets by supporting the modernisation of labour market institutions such as the public employment services in order to improve their capacity to provide intensified targeted counselling and guidance during the job search and the transition to employment and to enhance the mobility of workers. The ESF+ should promote a gender-balanced participation in the labour market through measures that aim to ensure, inter alia, equal working conditions, improved work-life balance and access to childcare, including early childhood education and care. The ESF+ should also aim to provide a healthy and well-adapted working environment in order to respond to health risks related to changing forms of work, and the needs of the ageing workforce. (14) The ESF+ should provide support for the improvement of the quality, inclusiveness, effectiveness and labour market relevance of education and training systems, including by the promotion of digital learning, the validation of non-formal and informal learning and the professional development of teaching staff, in order to facilitate the acquisition of key competences in particular as regards basic skills, including health literacy, media literacy, entrepreneurial skills, language skills, digital skills and competencies for sustainable development, which all individuals need for personal fulfilment and development, employment, social inclusion and active citizenship. The ESF+ should help progression within education and training and transition to work, should support lifelong learning and employability with a view to facilitating full participation in society for all, and should contribute to competitiveness, including through graduate tracking, and to societal and economic innovation by supporting sustainable initiatives that are capable of being scaled up in those fields and adapted to different target groups such as persons with disabilities. Such help, support and contribution could be achieved, for example, by means of online learning, work-based training, traineeships, dual education and training systems, and apprenticeships as defined in the Council Recommendation of 15 March 2018 on a European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships, lifelong guidance, skills anticipation in close cooperation with industry, up-to-date training materials and delivery methods, forecasting and graduate tracking, training of educators, validation of learning outcomes and recognition of qualifications and industry-based certifications. (15) Support from the ESF+ should be used to promote equal access for all, in particular for disadvantaged groups, to quality, non-segregated and inclusive education and training from early childhood education and care, while paying special attention to children coming from a socio-economically disadvantaged background, by means of general and vocational education and training, in particular apprenticeships, to tertiary level, as well as by means of adult education and learning, including through sport and cultural activities. The ESF+ should provide targeted support to learners in need and reduce educational inequalities, including the digital divide, prevent and reduce early school leaving, foster permeability between the education and training sectors, reinforce links with non-formal and informal learning and facilitate learning mobility for all and accessibility for persons with disabilities. Synergies with Erasmus+ established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/817 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14), in particular to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged learners in learning mobility, should be supported in this context. (16) The ESF+ should promote flexible opportunities for upgrading of skills and acquiring new and different skills by all, in particular entrepreneurial and digital skills, skills for key enabling technologies and skills for the green economy as well as industrial ecosystems in line with the Commission communication of 10 March 2020 entitled 'A New Industrial Strategy for Europe'. In line with the Skills Agenda for Europe and the Council Recommendation on Upskilling Pathways (15), the ESF+ should support flexible pathways, including accessible, short, targeted, modular training leading to credentials, with a view to providing people with the skills that are adjusted to labour market and industrial ecosystems needs, the green and digital transitions, innovation and social and economic change, the facilitation of reskilling and upskilling and employability, career transitions, geographic and sectoral mobility and supporting in particular low-skilled persons, persons with disabilities and poorly qualified adults. The ESF+ should also facilitate the provision of support to individuals with regard to integrated skills, including employed, self-employed and unemployed persons, through instruments such as individual learning accounts. (17) Synergies with Horizon Europe the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) (Horizon Europe) should ensure that the ESF+ is able to mainstream and scale up innovative curricula supported by Horizon Europe in order to equip people with the skills and competences needed for the jobs of the future. (18) The ESF+ should support the efforts of Member States to contribute to the eradication of poverty with a view to breaking the cycle of disadvantage across generations and promote social inclusion by ensuring equal opportunities for all, reducing barriers, tackling discrimination and addressing health inequalities. Such support implies mobilising a range of policies targeting the most disadvantaged people regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, age, religion or belief, racial or ethnic origin, in particular marginalised communities such as Roma people, people with disabilities or chronic diseases, homeless people, children and elderly people. The ESF+ should promote the active inclusion of people far from the labour market with a view to ensuring their socio-economic integration. The ESF+ should also be used to enhance timely and equal access to affordable, sustainable and high-quality services that promote the access to housing and person-centred care such as healthcare and long-term care, in particular family and community-based care services. The ESF+ should contribute to the modernisation of social protection systems with a particular focus on children and disadvantaged groups and with a view, in particular, to promoting the accessibility of such systems, including for persons with disabilities. (19) The ESF+ should contribute to the eradication of poverty by supporting national schemes aiming to alleviate food and material deprivation and promote social integration of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion and the most deprived persons. With the overall aim that, at Union level, a minimum of 4 % of the resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management support the most deprived persons, Member States should allocate at least 3 % of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to address the forms of extreme poverty with the greatest social exclusion impact, such as homelessness, child poverty and food deprivation. The provision of food and\/or basic material assistance to the most deprived persons should not replace existing social benefits provided to them under national social systems or pursuant to national law. Due to the nature of the operations and the type of end recipients, it is necessary that simpler rules apply to support which addresses material deprivation of the most deprived persons. (20) In light of the persistent need to enhance efforts to address the management of migration flows in the Union as a whole and in order to ensure a coherent, strong and consistent support to solidarity and responsibility-sharing efforts, the ESF+ should provide support to promote the socio-economic integration of third-country nationals, including migrants, which may include initiatives at local level, complementary to the actions financed under the AMIF, the ERDF and other Union funds which can have a positive effect on the inclusion of third-country nationals. (21) Due to the importance of access to healthcare, the ESF+ should ensure synergies and complementarities with the EU4Health Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/522 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) and the scope of the ESF+ should include access to healthcare for people in vulnerable situations. (22) The ESF+ should support policy and system reforms in the fields of employment, social inclusion, access to healthcare for vulnerable persons, long-term care, education and training, contributing to poverty eradication. In order to strengthen alignment with the European Semester, Member States should allocate an appropriate amount of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to implement relevant country-specific recommendations relating to structural challenges which it is appropriate to address through multiannual investments falling within the scope of the ESF+, taking into account the Pillar, the Social Scoreboard of indicators, as revised following the adoption of the new targets set out in the Social Pillar Action Plan, and regional specificities. The Commission and Member States should ensure coherence, coordination and complementarity between the ESF+ strand under shared management and other Union funds, programmes and instruments such as the JTF, the ERDF, the EU4Health Programme, the Recovery and Resilience Facility established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/241 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/691 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19), the EMFAF, Erasmus+, the AMIF, Horizon Europe, the EAFRD, the Digital Europe Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/694 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20), InvestEU Programme, the Creative Europe Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/818 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), the European Solidarity Corps established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/888 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22), and the Technical Support Instrument established by Regulation (EU) 2021\/240 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23). In particular, the Commission and Member States should ensure, in all stages of the process, effective coordination in order to safeguard the consistency, coherence, complementarity and synergy among sources of funding, including technical assistance thereof. (23) By supporting the specific objectives set out in this Regulation, inter alia, by contributing to the policy objective 'a more social and inclusive Europe implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights' as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2021\/1060, the ESF+ will continue to contribute to territorial and local development strategies in order to implement the Pillar. It will support the tools set out in Article 28 of that Regulation and thereby also contribute to the delivery of the policy objective 'a Europe closer to citizens by fostering the sustainable and integrated development of all types of territories and local initiatives' as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2021\/1060, including through poverty reduction and social inclusion measures, taking into account the specificities of urban, rural and coastal regions in view of tackling the socio-economic inequalities in cities and regions. (24) In order to ensure that the social dimension of Europe, as set out in the Pillar, is duly put forward and that a minimum amount of resources is targeting those that are most in need, Member States should allocate at least 25 % of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to foster social inclusion. (25) In order to address the persistently high level of child poverty in the Union, and in line with principle 11 of the Pillar, which states that children have the right to protection from poverty and that children from disadvantaged backgrounds have the right to specific measures to enhance equal opportunities, Member States should programme an appropriate amount of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management for the implementation of the Child Guarantee for activities addressing child poverty in line with the specific objectives of the ESF+ that allow for programming resources towards actions directly supporting children's equal access to childcare, education, healthcare, decent housing and adequate nutrition. Member States that had an average rate above the Union average of children of less than 18 years old at risk of poverty or social exclusion for the period between 2017 and 2019, on the basis of Eurostat data, should allocate at least 5 % of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to those activities. Operations contributing to this thematic concentration requirement should count towards the 25 % of thematic concentration requirement for social inclusion when programmed under the relevant specific objectives. (26) In order to facilitate an inclusive economic recovery after a major crisis and to support youth employment in a changing world of work and in light of persistently high levels of youth unemployment and inactivity in a number of Member States and regions, it is necessary that Member States invest an appropriate amount of their ESF+ resources in measures to support youth employment and skills, including through the implementation of schemes under the Youth Guarantee. Building on the actions supported by the Youth Employment Initiative in the 2014 to 2020 programming period under Regulation (EU) No 1304\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24), which target individuals and on the lessons learnt, Member States should further promote quality employment and education reintegration pathways and invest in early prevention and effective outreach by prioritising, where relevant, long-term unemployed, inactive and disadvantaged young people including through youth work. Member States should also invest in measures aiming to facilitate the transition from school to work as well as adequate capacities of employment services to provide tailor-made and holistic support and better-targeted offers to young people. By fully integrating the Youth Employment Initiative into the ESF+, the delivery of targeted actions for youth employment will be more effective and efficient and the scope will be extended to structural measures and reforms, thus ensuring a better match between support from Union funding and the implementation of the reinforced Youth Guarantee. Upgrading of skills and acquiring new and different skills should help young people seize the opportunities of growing sectors and prepare them for the changing nature of work, while harnessing the opportunities arising from the digital and green transitions and the transformation of the Union industrial ecosystems. Therefore, Member States that had an average rate above the Union average of young people of 15 to 29 years of age who are not in employment, education or training for the period between 2017 and 2019, on the basis of Eurostat data, should allocate at least 12,5 % of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to those actions. (27) In accordance with Article 349 TFEU and Article 2 of Protocol No 6 on special provisions for Objective 6 in the framework of the Structural Funds in Finland, Norway and Sweden annexed to the 1994 Act of Accession (25), the outermost regions and the northern sparsely populated regions are entitled to specific measures under common policies and Union programmes. Due to the permanent constraints, such as depopulation, those regions require specific support. (28) Efficient and effective implementation of actions supported by the ESF+ depends on good governance and partnership between all actors at the relevant territorial levels and the socio-economic actors, in particular the social partners and civil society organisations. It is therefore essential that Member States allocate an appropriate amount of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to ensure meaningful participation of the social partners and civil society organisations in the implementation of the ESF+ strand under shared management. That participation should include relevant bodies representing civil society, such as environmental partners, non-governmental organisations, and bodies responsible for promoting social inclusion, fundamental rights, the rights of persons with disabilities, gender equality and non-discrimination. Member States with a country-specific recommendation on capacity building of the social partners or civil society organisations should allocate at least 0,25 % of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management for that purpose due to the specific needs they have in that area. (29) With a view to rendering policies more responsive to social change as well as to encouraging and supporting innovative solutions, support for social innovation is crucial. In particular, testing and evaluating innovative solutions before scaling them up is instrumental in improving the efficiency of the policies and thus specific support from the ESF+ is justified. Social economy enterprises could play a key role in delivering on social innovation and contributing to economic and social resilience. The definition of a social economy enterprise should be in line with the definitions provided in national law and the Council conclusions of 7 December 2015 on the promotion of the social economy as a key driver of economic and social development in Europe. Moreover, with a view to enhancing mutual learning and exchange of knowledge and practices, Member States should be encouraged to continue their transnational cooperation actions under shared management in the areas of employment, education and training, and social inclusion in line with the specific objectives of the ESF+. (30) Member States and the Commission should ensure that the ESF+ contributes to the promotion of equality between women and men in accordance with Article 8 TFEU to foster equality of treatment and opportunities between women and men in all areas, including participation in the labour market, terms and conditions of employment and career progression. They should also ensure that the ESF+ promotes equal opportunities for all, without discrimination in accordance with Article 10 TFEU, promotes the inclusion in society of persons with disabilities on equal basis with others and contributes to the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted on 13 December 2006 in New York. The ESF+ should contribute to the promotion of accessibility for persons with disabilities with a view to improving integration into employment, education and training, thereby enhancing their inclusion in all spheres of life. The promotion of such accessibility should be taken into account in all dimensions and in all stages of the preparation, monitoring, implementation and evaluation of programmes, in a timely and consistent manner while ensuring that specific actions are taken to promote gender equality and equal opportunities. The ESF+ should also promote the transition from residential or institutional care to family- and community-based care, in particular for those who face multiple discrimination. The ESF+ should not support any action that contributes to segregation or to social exclusion. Regulation (EU) 2021\/1060 provides that rules on eligibility of expenditure are to be established at national level, with certain exceptions for which it is necessary to lay down specific provisions with regard to the ESF+ strand under shared management. (31) All operations should be selected and implemented respecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the 'Charter'). The Commission should do its utmost to ensure that complaints are assessed in a timely manner, including complaints related to infringements of the Charter, and should inform the complainant of the result of the assessment in line with the Commission communication of 19 January 2017 entitled 'EU law: Better results through better application'. (32) In order to reduce the administrative burden for the collection of data, reporting requirements should be kept as simple as possible. Where data are available in registers or equivalent sources, Member States should be able to allow managing authorities to collect data from registers. (33) With regard to the processing of personal data within the framework of this Regulation, national data controllers should carry out their tasks for the purposes of this Regulation in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26). The dignity of and respect for the privacy of end recipients of operations under the specific objective 'addressing material deprivation through food and\/or basic material assistance to the most deprived persons, including children, and providing accompanying measures supporting their social inclusion' should be guaranteed. In order to avoid any stigmatisation, the persons receiving food and\/or basic material assistance should not be required to identify themselves when receiving the support and when taking part in surveys on the most deprived persons who have benefitted from the ESF+. (34) Social experimentation is a small-scale project testing which allows gathering of evidence on the feasibility of social innovations. It should be possible and encouraged for ideas to be tested at local level and for those ideas that are feasible to be pursued on a wider scale, where appropriate, or transferred to other contexts in different regions or Member States with financial support from the ESF+ or in combination with other sources. (35) The ESF+ lays down provisions intended to achieve freedom of movement for workers on a non-discriminatory basis by ensuring close cooperation of the public employment services of Member States, the Commission and the social partners. The European network of employment services should promote better functioning of the labour markets by facilitating the cross-border mobility of workers, in particular through cross-border partnerships, and a greater transparency of information on the labour markets. The scope of the ESF+ should include developing and supporting targeted mobility schemes with a view to filling vacancies where labour market shortcomings have been identified. (36) The lack of access to finance of microenterprises, social enterprises and social economy is one of the main obstacles to business creation, especially among people furthest from the labour market. Under the EaSI strand, this Regulation should lay down provisions in order to create a market ecosystem to increase the supply of and access to finance for social enterprises as well as to meet demand from those who need it most, and, in particular, the unemployed, women and vulnerable people who wish to start up or develop a microenterprise. That objective will also be addressed through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the social investment and skills policy window of the InvestEU Fund. Social economy enterprises, where they are defined under national law, should be regarded as social enterprises within the context of the EaSI strand, regardless of their legal status, insofar as those enterprises fall within the definition of a social enterprise provided for in this Regulation. (37) Social investment market players, including philanthropic actors, could play a key role in achieving several ESF+ objectives, as they offer financing as well as innovative and complementary approaches to combatting social exclusion and poverty, reducing unemployment and contributing to the SDGs. Therefore, philanthropic actors such as foundations and donors should be involved in ESF+ actions, as appropriate and provided that they do not have a political or social agenda that is in conflict with Union ideals, in particular in those actions that aim to develop the social investment market ecosystem. (38) Guidance under the EaSI strand is needed with regard to the development of social infrastructures and related services, in particular for social housing, childcare and education, healthcare and long-term care, including facilities to assist transitions from institutional- to family- and community-based care services and taking into account accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities. (39) Reflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, adopted under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (27), and the SDGs, this Regulation will contribute to mainstream climate actions and to the achievement of an overall target of 30 % of Union budget expenditure supporting climate objectives. Relevant actions will be identified during the preparation and implementation, and reassessed in the context of the mid-term evaluation. (40) Pursuant to Council Decision 2013\/755\/EU (28), persons and entities established in overseas countries and territories are to be eligible for funding subject to the rules and objectives of the EaSI strand and arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas countries and territories are linked. (41) Third countries which are members of the European Economic Area may participate in Union programmes in the framework of the cooperation established under the Agreement on the European Economic Area (29), which provides for the implementation of the programmes on the basis of a decision under that agreement. Third countries may also participate on the basis of other legal instruments. A specific provision should be introduced in this Regulation requiring third countries to grant the necessary rights and access required for the authorising officer responsible, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the Court of Auditors to comprehensively exercise their respective competences. (42) It is appropriate to lay down indicators for the purposes of reporting under the EaSI strand. Those indicators should be output-based, objective, easy to retrieve, and proportionate to the share of the EaSI strand within the entire ESF+. They should cover the operational objectives and funding activities under the EaSI strand, without requiring the setting of corresponding targets. (43) In accordance with the Financial Regulation, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30) and Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 2988\/95 (31), (Euratom, EC) No 2185\/96 (32) and (EU) 2017\/1939 (33), the financial interests of the Union are to be protected by means of proportionate measures, including measures relating to the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities, including fraud, to the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. In particular, in accordance with Regulations (Euratom, EC) No 2185\/96 and (EU, Euratom) No 883\/2013, OLAF has the power to carry out administrative investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) is empowered, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017\/1939, to investigate and prosecute criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union, as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017\/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council (34). In accordance with the Financial Regulation, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the financial interests of the Union, grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, in respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017\/1939, the EPPO and ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights. (44) Horizontal financial rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 322 TFEU apply to this Regulation. Those rules are laid down in the Financial Regulation and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the budget through grants, prizes, procurement, indirect management, and provide for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 TFEU also include a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget. (45) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely enhancing the effectiveness of labour markets, promoting equal access to quality employment, improving equal access to, and the quality of, education and training, promoting social inclusion and contributing to the eradication of poverty, as well as the objectives pursued under the EaSI strand cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (46) In order to amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending and supplementing the annexes on the indictors. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (35). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. (47) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. The implementing powers relating to the model for the structured survey of end recipients should be exercised in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 182\/2011 of European Parliament and of the Council (36) given the nature of this model. (48) In order to allow for a rapid response to exceptional or unusual circumstances, as referred to in the Stability and Growth Pact, that may arise during the programming period, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt temporary measures to facilitate the use of support from the ESF+ in response to such circumstances, with a maximum time limit of 18 months. The Commission should adopt the measures that are most appropriate in light of the exceptional or unusual circumstances that a Member State is facing while preserving the objectives of the ESF+, but this should not include amendments to the thematic concentration requirements. Furthermore, the implementing powers in relation to the temporary measures for the use of support from the ESF+ in response to exceptional or unusual circumstances should be conferred on the Commission without committee procedures, given that the scope of application of those measures is determined by the Stability and Growth Pact and is limited to the measures set out in this Regulation. The Commission should also monitor the implementation and assess the appropriateness of the temporary measures. Where the Commission deems it to be necessary to amend this Regulation due to the exceptional or unusual circumstances, the scope of the amendment should not include the thematic concentration requirements related to youth employment nor support for the most deprived persons due to the fact that young people and the most deprived persons are often most adversely affected by such crisis situations. Therefore it is necessary to ensure that those target groups continue to receive an adequate amount of support. (49) In the administration of the ESF+, the Commission should be assisted by a Committee as referred to in Article 163 TFEU (the 'ESF+ Committee'). In order to enable the ESF+ Committee to have all the necessary information at its disposal and obtain a wide range of views of relevant stakeholders, the ESF+ Committee should be able to invite representatives without a voting right provided that the agenda of the meeting requires their participation, including representatives of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund and relevant civil society organisations. (50) In order to ensure that the specificities of each ESF+ strand continue to be addressed, the ESF+ Committee should establish working groups for each ESF+ strand. Composition and tasks of those working groups are to be established by the ESF+ Committee. The working groups should have the possibility to invite civil society representatives as well as other stakeholders to their meetings. The tasks of the working groups may include ensuring coordination and cooperation between Member State authorities and the Commission on the implementation of the ESF+, including consultation on the work programme of the EaSI strand, monitoring the implementation of each ESF+ strand, exchanging experience and good practice within and across the ESF+ strands and fostering potential synergies with other Union programmes. (51) In order to ensure a greater transparency regarding the implementation of this Regulation, the Commission should establish the necessary links with relevant policy committees active in the social and employment field, such as the Employment Committee, the Social Protection Committee or the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work. (52) In accordance with Article 193(2) of the Financial Regulation, a grant may be awarded for an action which has already begun, provided that the applicant can demonstrate the need for starting the action prior to the signature of the grant agreement. However, the costs incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant application are not eligible, except in duly justified exceptional cases. In order to avoid any disruption in Union support which could be prejudicial to Union's interests, it should be possible to provide in the financing decision, during a limited period of time at the beginning of the multiannual financial framework 2021 to 2027, and only in duly justified cases, for eligibility of activities and costs from the beginning of the 2021 financial year, even if they were implemented and incurred before the grant application was submitted. (53) Regulation (EU) No 1296\/2013 should therefore be repealed. (54) In order to ensure continuity in providing support in the relevant policy area and to allow implementation as of the beginning of the multiannual financial framework 2021 to 2027, this Regulation should enter info force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and should apply, with retroactive effect with regard to the EaSI strand, from 1 January 2021, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: TABLE OF CONTENTS Part I General provisions Article 1 Subject matter Article 2 Definitions Article 3 General objectives of the ESF+ and methods of implementation Article 4 Specific objectives of the ESF+ Article 5 Budget Article 6 Gender equality, equal opportunities and non-discrimination Part II Implementation under shared management Chapter I Common provisions on programming Article 7 Consistency and thematic concentration Article 8 Respect for the Charter Article 9 Partnership Article 10 Support for the most deprived persons Article 11 Support for youth employment Article 12 Support for relevant country-specific recommendations Chapter II General support from the ESF+ strand under shared management Article 13 Scope Article 14 Social innovative actions Article 15 Transnational cooperation Article 16 Eligibility Article 17 Indicators and reporting Chapter III ESF+ support for addressing material deprivation Article 18 Scope Article 19 Principles Article 20 Content of the priority Article 21 Eligibility of operations Article 22 Eligibility of expenditure Article 23 Indicators and reporting Article 24 Audit Part III Implementation under direct and indirect management Chapter I Operational objectives Article 25 Operational objectives Chapter II Eligibility Article 26 Eligible actions Article 27 Eligible entities Article 28 Horizontal principles Article 29 Participation of third countries Chapter III General provisions Article 30 Forms of Union funding and methods of implementation Article 31 Work programme Article 32 Monitoring and reporting Article 33 Protection of the financial interests of the Union Article 34 Evaluation Article 35 Audits Article 36 Information, communication and publicity Part IV Final Provisions Article 37 Exercise of the delegation Article 38 Committee procedure for the ESF+ strand under shared management Article 39 Committee set up under Article 163 TFEU Article 40 Transitional provisions for the ESF+ strand under shared management Article 41 Transitional provisions for the EaSI strand Article 42 Entry into force ANNEX I Common indicators for general support from the ESF+ strand under shared management ANNEX II Common indicators for the ESF+ actions targeting social inclusion of the most deprived persons within the specific objective set out in Article 4(1), point (l), in line with Article 7(5), first subparagraph ANNEX III Common indicators for ESF+ support for addressing material deprivation ANNEX IV Indicators for the EaSI strand PART I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation establishes the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), which consists of two strands: the strand under shared management (the 'ESF+ strand under shared management') and the Employment and Social Innovation strand (the 'EaSI strand'). This Regulation lays down the objectives of the ESF+, its budget for the period 2021 to 2027, the methods of implementation, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.

The ESF+ aims to support Member States and regions to achieve high employment levels, fair social protection and a skilled and resilient workforce ready for the future world of work, as well as inclusive and cohesive societies aiming to eradicating poverty and delivering on the principles set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights. 2. The ESF+ shall support, complement and add value to the policies of Member States to ensure equal opportunities, equal access to the labour market, fair and quality working conditions, social protection and inclusion, in particular focussing on quality and inclusive education and training, lifelong learning, investment in children and young people and access to basic services. 3.

A reduction of the eligible costs referred to in paragraph 1, point (a) because the body responsible for the purchase of food and\/or basic material assistance did not comply with the applicable law, shall not lead to a reduction of the eligible costs set out in points (c) and (e) of that paragraph. 4. The following costs shall not be eligible: (a) interest on debt; (b) purchase of infrastructure; and (c) costs of second-hand goods. Article 23 Indicators and reporting 1.

This has affected manufacturers' ability to meet some of the deadlines imposed by Regulation (EU) No 168\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013. According to that Regulation, the pollutant emissions Euro 5 step will apply on 1 January 2021, which means that as of that date only vehicles meeting the Euro 5 requirements can be placed on the Union market. However, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, motorcycles sales have been highly impacted. Usually, up to 60% of sales take place between March and July. Because of Member States authorities' lockdowns, sales could not take place during the peak season. According to industry sources, it is estimated that around 553.700 Euro 4 vehicles were in stock in March 2020. During the lockdowns, sales went down by 98% and remained sluggish since then. It is therefore likely that not all Euro 4 vehicles currently in stock will be sold by the end of the year. If Regulation (EU) 168\/2013 provides for the possibility for manufacturers to sell so-called end-of series vehicles (i.e. 'old stock' vehicles that do not meet the latest requirements), this is limited in each Member State to maximum 10% of the average number of vehicles sold the two preceding years or 100 vehicles. The number of vehicles that can be registered as end-of-series is at the discretion of the Member States. In the light of this disruption and given the number of vehicles in stock and the almost complete stop of sales at the peak of the 2020 season, the existing provisions on end-of-series do not constitute an appropriate mechanism to address this situation. The end-of-series provisions should therefore be adapted to allow dealers to sell higher amounts of their stock of Euro 4 vehicles in 2021 only. This proposal will not increase pollutant emissions as the flexibility will be limited to already produced vehicles at the time of the lockdown. In addition, it also avoids the need to unnecessarily scrap vehicles that would have been otherwise placed on the market in absence of the crisis. This proposal will not postpone the entry into force of the Euro 5 step for all newly produced vehicles on 1 January 2021. 2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY Legal basis Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The subsidiarity principle applies since the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Union. As the proposal involves amendments to existing EU legislation, only the EU can effectively address the issues. Furthermore, the policy objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by actions of the Member States. In order to allow for an EU vehicle type approval system, the technical requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to safety and environmental elements must be harmonised at Union level. Action by Member States alone would undermine the whole vehicle type-approval system. European Union action is necessary because of the need to avoid the emergence of barriers to the single market. The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. Proportionality The proposal complies with the proportionality principle because it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market while at the same time providing for a high level of public safety and environmental protection. Choice of the instrument Regulation amending a Regulation 3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS This proposal is not accompanied by a separate impact assessment, as an impact assessment for Regulation (EU) No 168\/2013 has already been undertaken. This proposal does not alter that Regulation on substance and does not impose new obligations on the concerned parties. It primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, special end-of-series provisions applicable for the sole year 2021. 4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The proposal does not have a budgetary impact for the EU institutions. 2020\/0251 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulation (EU) No 168\/2013 as regards specific measures on L-category end-of-series vehicles in response to the COVID-19 outbreak (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, After consulting the European Economic and Social Committee 1 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, Whereas: (1)The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components for L-category vehicles and a sizeable drop in demand for those vehicles, which has led to important delays for manufacturers to clear their stock of Euro 4 vehicles that, according to Annex IV to Regulation (EU) No 168\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 , need to be registered before the application of the environmental Euro 5 step on 1 January 2021. (2)The end-of-series provisions set out in Regulation (EU) No 168\/2013 allow manufacturers to continue to make available on the market, register or enter into service a limited part of a stock of L-category vehicles which cannot be made available on the market or can no longer be made available on the market, owing to the entry into force of new technical requirements against which those vehicles have not been approved. (3)Considering the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it is apparent that the provisions on end-of-series in Regulation (EU) No 168\/2013 do not constitute an appropriate mechanism to address the amount of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that manufacturers will have in stock following the application of the environmental Euro 5 step. (4)Given the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and to avoid potential market disruption, it is necessary to amend the rules on end-of-series of Regulation (EU) No 168\/2013. (5)In order to ensure that the application of these measures is restricted to vehicles that were in stock at the moment of the national lockdowns, the amount of vehicles benefiting from these specific end-of-series measures should not exceed the number of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that were in stock on 15 March 2020. (6)In view of the urgency entailed by the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it was considered to be appropriate to provide for an exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the TEU, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. (7)Given that these measures are urgently needed, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. (8)Regulation (EU) No 168\/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 In Regulation (EU) No 168\/2013, the following Article 44a is inserted: 'Article 44a Specific measures on end-of-series vehicles in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 1. By way of derogation from Article 44, vehicles conforming to a type of vehicle the EU type-approval of which has become invalid on 1 January 2021 pursuant to Article 37(2), point (a), may be made available on the market, registered or entered into service as end-of-series vehicles until 31 December 2021, subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article. 2. The number of end-of-series vehicles referred to in paragraph 1 shall not exceed the number of vehicles with an EU type-approval that became invalid on 1 January 2021 pursuant to Article 37(2), point (a), and that were in stock on 15 March 2020. 3. A manufacturer who wishes to benefit from the derogation referred to in paragraph 1 shall submit a request to the national authority of each Member State where the vehicles in question are to be made available on the market, registered or entered into service, indicating the number of end-of-series vehicles for which the derogation referred to in paragraph 1 is requested. The national authority concerned shall decide, within a month of receiving the request, whether to permit the registration of those end-of-series vehicles within its territory and in what number. 4. The manufacturer shall make a special entry on the certificate of conformity of the vehicles put into service under paragraph 1, qualifying those vehicles as '2021 - end-of-series'. 5. Member States shall inform the Commission on the number of vehicles for which end-of-series status has been granted under this Article by no later than 1 July 2021.'. Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

The objective is to revise the EU ETS in respect of aviation emissions in a cost-effective and coherent way in line with the Union's increased climate target, while taking into account the need for a just transition and the need for all sectors to contribute to the EU climate efforts. The European Green Deal 1 , adopted by the Commission in December 2019, as well as the Climate Law 2 and the Climate Target Plan (CTP) 3 , aim at enhancing the Union's climate commitment under the Paris Agreement, consistent with its objective of reaching economy-wide climate neutrality in the EU by 2050. The EU is increasing its economy-wide decarbonisation commitment, from at least 40% to at least 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030 without using international credits. To reach the increased climate target, all sectors, including aviation, must adequately contribute to the required domestic emission reduction efforts. The European Green Deal aims to transform the EU into a fairer and more prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. The climate neutrality objective has been endorsed by the European Council and Parliament and is laid down in a legally binding manner in the politically agreed European Climate Law. The European Green Deal also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the EU's natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. At the same time, this transition must be just and inclusive. Beyond the increase in EU 2030 ambition to achieve EU-wide economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reductions domestically by at least 55% compared to 1990, the 2030 Climate Target Plan communication underlines that \"in accordance with its international commitment to economy-wide action under the Paris Agreement, the EU should continue to regulate at least intra-EU aviation emissions in the EU ETS\". In its conclusions of December 2020, the European Council \"invites the Commission to assess how all economic sectors can best contribute to the 2030 target and to make the necessary proposals, accompanied by an in-depth examination of the environmental, economic and social impact at Member State level\" 4 . Aviation emissions account for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions and have significantly increased since 1990 both at EU-level and globally. At EU-level, CO2 emissions from aviation made up 3.7% of the economy-wide total or 15.7% of CO2 transport emissions in 201849. In 2018, the EU was responsible for 15% of the global aviation CO2 emissions 5 . Moreover, non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation are estimated to be at least as important in total as those of CO2 alone 6 . Notwithstanding the recent reduction in traffic as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, aviation climate impacts are projected to grow further given the sector's historical growth of above the average of other economic sectors. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Eurocontrol had projected an annual increase in European aviation emissions by 53% by 2040 compared to 201753. Before the COVID-19 crisis, ICAO had estimated that, by 2040, international aviation emissions could rise by up to 150% compared to 202054. A key tool for addressing CO2 emissions from aviation in Europe is the EU ETS. In the public consultation on updated rules for aviation ETS, 91% of respondents agree that aviation should contribute more to climate actions. 88% of respondents believe that market-based measures can be effective to tackle aviation emissions in line with the climate objectives. Between 2013 and 2020, an estimated net saving of 193.4 Mt CO2 was achieved by aviation via the EU ETS primarily through funding of emissions reduction in other sectors39. This constitutes the aviation contribution to the 2020 EU climate objective, and the contribution is foreseen to continue for 2030. Considering current and projected emissions from the aviation sector, and in the context of an enhanced climate ambition of the EU for 2030, the climate contribution needs to be significantly strengthened, also with a view to allow for the necessary contribution to the EU climate neutrality by 2050. The 2019 European Aviation Environment Report has also highlighted this need. The Commission has prepared a number of impact assessments to support the envisaged revisions of key legislative instruments for the \"Fit for 55\" policy package. The impact assessment on the revision of EU ETS aviation rules analyses various options through which the revision could effectively and efficiently contribute to the delivery of the updated target as part of the wider package. Therefore, the revision of aviation rules must be addressed together with the revision of EU ETS for stationary installations and its extension to other sectors. ETS elements where the interlinkage of revisions is particularly prominent are the provisions concerning total quantity of aviation allowances and application of linear reduction factor thereto as well as provisions regarding market stability reserve. Choices regarding the scope of EU ETS and CORSIA implementation will impact the level of emission reductions of the ETS sector, and demand for EU allowances. Choices regarding the auctioning share of aviation allowances will impact the amount of auctioning revenues available for tackling climate change, as well as distributional elements. For aviation to contribute to the goals of the Paris Agreement, broader global action should also take place. EU has supported ICAO's CORSIA, and is working with others to encourage adequate participation and implementation. The review of the EU ETS for aviation should ensure that CORSIA is implemented as appropriate through the EU ETS and implementation of CORSIA needs to ensure equal treatment of airlines. At the same time, any amendment of the EU ETS Directive must be consistent with EU's ambition to become climate neutral by 2050, the Union's economy-wide greenhouse gas emission reduction commitment for 2030 and with the aim of preserving the environmental integrity and effectiveness of Union climate action. A large volume of allowances have been allocated to aviation sector for free since 2012. The Communication on a European Green Deal70 announced that there would be a proposal to reduce the free allowances allocated to airlines. This is re-stated in the Communication on Stepping up Europe's 2030 climate ambition. As free allocation is a derogation from the 'polluter pays' principle, the default method in EU ETS is auctioning. The underlying analysis also suggests a low risk of carbon leakage and a very limited impact on consumer prices when increasing auctioning in respect of aviation. The main legal amendments are: (1)to consolidate the total quantity of aviation allowances at current levels, and apply the linear reduction factor in accordance with Article 9 of the ETS Directive; (2)to increase auctioning of aviation allowances; (3)to continue intra-European application of the EU ETS while applying CORSIA as appropriate to extra-European flights; and (4)to ensure that airlines are treated equally on the same routes with regard to their obligations with economic impacts. In parallel to these amendments to the EU ETS Directive, a separate proposal is being made to implement Member State notification to EU-based airlines of zero CORSIA offsetting for the year 2021. The separate proposal relates to CORSIA-related aspects that should be in place by November 2022, for notification of zero additional offsetting to take place by that date. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The 'Fit for 55' package is a comprehensive step in overhauling Union legislation to align it with the EU's increased climate ambition. All initiatives in the package are closely interlinked, and each one depends on the design of the others. While the political mandate to reinforce the EU ETS for aviation is clear, this is being examined in conjunction with other related and relevant initiatives, such as the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive and the Renewable Energy Directive, as well as the ReFuelEU Initiative, which are being assessed separately, with due account of the ETS dimension and impacts. As indicated in the European Green Deal, reducing climate change impacts from aviation requires a mix of policy instruments, as there is no one single solution to decarbonise the sector. The revision of the EU ETS for aviation is therefore part of a so-called \"basket of measures\", which includes market-based measures like the EU ETS and CORSIA, the boosting of the production and uptake of sustainable aviation fuels (\"SAF\"), aircraft technology improvements and operational improvements through e.g. the Single European Sky initiative. Consistency with other Union policies All EU actions and policies must be consistent with the proposals of the 'Fit for 55' package and help the EU achieve the increased 2030 target and a successful and just transition towards the 2050 climate neutrality, as stated by the Commission in the European Green Deal Communication. As such, this initiative is linked to many other policy areas, including the Union's external policies, e.g. through the EU encouraging partner countries to also implement CORSIA, and support to help ensure that airlines operate on an equal footing. The Commission announced it will improve the way its Better Regulation guidelines and supporting tools address sustainability and innovation issues, with the objective that all EU initiatives live up to the green oath to 'do no harm'. This initiative is also consistent with the EU's policy for research and innovation and will enhance synergies between the EU's deployment programmes in particular the Innovation Fund and the EU Framework Programmes for research and innovation by incentivising the uptake and deployment of low-carbon innovative solutions. The impact assessment accompanying the 2030 Climate Target Plan assessed carefully the possibility of reinforcing and expanding emissions trading as one of the tools to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions at the EU level. Consistency with other Union policies is also ensured through the coherence of the impact assessments for the EU ETS with the assessments made for the remainder of the 2030 climate, energy and transport framework, and with other measures presented as part of the basket of measures to address greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. 2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY Legal basis The legal basis for the EU ETS Directive 2003\/87\/EC, as well as all subsequent legislation amending it and other legislation regulating GHG emissions, is Article 192 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This should remain the legal basis for any new legislation addressing climate impacts of aviation, as the principal objective of the measure is the protection of the environment through the reduction of GHG emissions. Subsidiarity The EU ETS Directive is an existing EU policy instrument. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, the objectives of the proposal amending this instrument can only be achieved through legislation at EU level. An EU legal act is required for Member States to apply CORSIA as appropriate for the flights covered by the geographical scope of application of Directive 2003\/87\/EC as set out in its Annex I, i.e. flights departing from airports in the EEA and arriving to other airports in EEA or to third countries and, incoming flights to airports in the EEA from third countries. Acting at EU level, and where possible at global level, is more efficient than acting at the Member State level, due to the transboundary effects of climate change and the largely transnational nature of aviation. Action at EU level will most effectively deliver the EU's domestic and international climate targets and ensure the harmonised and appropriate implementation of CORSIA in respect of the EU. Proportionality This proposal complies with the proportionality principle because it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of implementing the EU's target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2021 to 2030 in a cost-effective manner, while ensuring fairness, environmental integrity, proper functioning of the internal market, and implementation of CORSIA. The European Council has endorsed an overall economy-wide and domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030. This proposal covers a large part of these greenhouse gas emissions, and revises the Directive in order to achieve this objective. Choice of the instrument The objectives of the present proposal are best pursued through an amending Directive. This is the most appropriate legal instrument to make amendments to the existing EU ETS Directive, Directive 2003\/87\/EC. A Directive requires Member States to achieve the objectives and implement the measures into their national substantive and procedural law systems. Member States should ensure that national transposition provisions do not hamper innovation and are technologically neutral. 3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS Ex-post evaluations\/fitness checks of existing legislation Article 28b(2) of Directive 2003\/87\/EC requires the Commission to present a report to the Council and the European Parliament on CORSIA, examining its ambition and overall environmental integrity, including its general ambition in relation to targets under the Paris Agreement, the level of participation, its enforceability, transparency, the penalties for non-compliance, the processes for public input, the quality of offset credits, monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions, registries, accountability as well as rules on the use of biofuels. In the light of this, a proposal should be made to amend Union law to implement CORSIA as appropriate. In addition, Article 28b(2) of Directive 2003\/87\/EC provides that the report of the Commission should consider whether the provisions adopted under Article 28c(2) need to be revised. Article 28b(3) of the EU ETS Directive foresees the Commission accompanying the report with \"a proposal, where appropriate, to amend, delete, extend or replace\" the derogations provided for in Article 28a (which limit the scope of EU ETS to intra-EEA flights from 2017-23), that is \"consistent with the Union economy-wide greenhouse gas emission reduction commitment for 2030 with the aim of preserving the environmental integrity and effectiveness of Union climate action\". The report is included in the impact assessment accompanying this proposal, and draws on a study \"Assessment of ICAO's global market-based measure (CORSIA) pursuant to Article 28b and for studying cost pass-through pursuant to Article 3d of the EU ETS Directive\" 7 . Article 3d(2) of the EU ETS Directive requires the Commission to \"study the ability of the aviation sector to pass on the cost of CO2 to its customers in both the EU ETS and ICAO's market-based measure, comparing this to industries and to the power sector, and with the intention to propose to increase the percentage of auctioning pursuant to the review referred to in Article 28b(2). The study is included in the Impact assessment on Revision of the EU Emissions Trading System in respect of aviation, and draws on the report \"Assessment of ICAO's global market-based measure (CORSIA) pursuant to Article 28b and for studying cost pass-through pursuant to Article 3d of the EU ETS Directive\". Stakeholder consultations Stakeholders were consulted on the inception impact assessment between 3 July 2020 and 28 August 2020. In total, 54 entities submitted a feedback. Of respondents, EU MS supported a coexistence of the EU ETS and CORSIA; non-EU countries expressed concern with overlap between EU ETS and CORSIA, partial implementation of CORSIA, treatment of non-EU carriers and the exclusivity of CORSIA. Regarding CORSIA implementation options, the vast majority of NGOs favoured full scope EU ETS or options maintaining at minimum the current scope or hybrid options in between. They also supported immediate full auctioning. Most business associations and companies preferred the CORSIA only policy option. On auctioning, most business associations and companies favoured the status quo or the slow reduction, and the use of the revenues for the aviation industry. EU citizens who responded were in favour of more climate ambition from the sector. The open public stakeholder consultation took place between 1 October 2020 and 14 January 2021, and received a total of 81 responses. In the public consultation, 91% of respondents agree that the aviation sector should contribute more to climate actions. 88% of respondents believe that market-based measures can be effective to tackle aviation emissions in line with the climate objectives. 82% of respondents to the public consultation agreed that market-based measures be combined with other policies such as support for innovative aviation technologies, operational improvements, taxation, and the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels. For CORSIA implementation options, opinions differed between and within stakeholder groups. For business associations, the most preferable options were CORSIA ONLY and MIX option with 33% of responses for each option. The least preferable options were ETS full legal scope and MIX BIS with 33% of responses for each option. For public authorities, 30% found CORSIA ONLY the most preferable option, and 40% found CORSIA ONLY the least preferable option. For NGOs, EU ETS full legal scope was the most preferable option with 89% of responses, and CORSIA only the least preferable option with 44% of responses. For increasing the auctioning share of aviation allowances, most stakeholders preferred the immediate phase out, while they held maintaining the status quo as the least preferred option. Respondents' views were clearly split between or auctioning share increase options. 53% of business associations preferred the status quo and stated immediate phase-out as the least preferred option (74%). 56% of NGOs preferred immediate phase-out, and 63% stated status quo as their least preferred option. 60% of public authorities preferred slow phase-out of free allocation. Large majority of the stakeholders considered that increasing auctioning could increase the cost of flying, while the majority also agreed that this measure would contribute to climate change mitigation. Impact assessment The impact assessment has analysed the various options through which a revision of EU ETS in respect of aviation could effectively and efficiently contribute to the delivery of the updated target as part of such a wider \"Fit for 55\" policy package. The impact assessment analyses different options for CORSIA implementation through the EU ETS and for increase of auctioning share. The options for implementing CORSIA differ in the extent to which the existing EU ETS coverage is maintained, reduced or extended. Comparison of options shows that while ETS price incentives are orders of magnitude more meaningful than the price of CORSIA quality offsets, the overall environmental impact at global level across policy options is limited due to the limited geographical scope of the EU ETS. However, there are significant differences between the options as regards the contribution to the EU's emission reduction target. There are also considerable differences in terms of revenues stemming from the different policy option combinations, as CORSIA, by design, does not generate any public revenue from airlines. The preferred option is to maintain the current EU ETS coverage (intra-EEA flights, including departing flights to Switzerland and to the UK) and introduce appropriate CORSIA-related provisions for flights that are currently not covered by the EU ETS (flights to\/from third countries, and by EU-based airlines between two third countries). The options for increasing the auction share in allocating aviation allowances differ in the speed of increase. The comparison of the analysed options shows a strong case for moving to full auctioning from the date of entry into force of the revised legislation. While free allowances have been allocated notably to address potential adverse competitiveness impacts and carbon leakage, they constitute a derogation from the 'polluter pays' principle. The analysis suggests a low risk of carbon leakage when increasing the auctioning share. Switching to full auctioning implies stabilising the cap for aviation at current levels as auctioning is currently a fixed percentage of free allocations. This would maintain current level of environmental integrity for the aviation cap, and the cap would be subject to the linear reduction factor, as already required by the co-legislators and as is the case for all other operators in the EU ETS. The removal of free allocation in the EU ETS would reinforce its environmental integrity. The preferred option is increased auctioning from the entry into force of the amendment. Fundamental rights The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. 4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS Under the existing ETS, most of the auction revenues accrue to Member States, hence there are positive impacts on national budgets. Adjustments to the EU budgetary framework will be presented by the Commission as part of the upcoming Own Resources package including a proposal to amend the multiannual financial framework. For the existing coverage of the EU ETS, there are no additional administrative impacts on national administrations. The impacts of the implementation of CORSIA should be limited by using the same infrastructures. IT development and procurement choices will be subject to pre-approval by the European Commission Information Technology and Cybersecurity Board. 5.OTHER ELEMENTS Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal Article 3c, paragraphs 1 to 3 are amended to consolidate the total quantity of allowances for aviation at the level of allocation\/auctioning for intra-European flights and departing flights from EEA airports to Switzerland and the UK. The allocation for year 2024 will be based on the total allocation to active aircraft operators in 2023, reduced by the linear reduction factor as specified in the ETS Directive. The allocation shall be increased by the level of allocation that would have been made if routes between outermost regions, and other states than the Member State in which the outermost region is located, had been covered by the ETS in 2023. The temporary derogation from EU ETS obligations for these routes expires on 31 December 2023. The increased cap shall be reduced by the linear reduction factor as specified in the ETS Directive. A time-limited derogation from the EU ETS is proposed for emissions from flights between an aerodrome located in an outermost region of a Member State and an aerodrome located in the same Member State. Article 3d paragraph 1 is replaced to establish increased auctioning of allowances for aviation from year after the entry into force of the amendment. The amendment is for transition to full auctioning as from 2027. Article 3d paragraph 2 is deleted as obsolete. Article 3d, paragraph 3, first sentence is amended to reflect that delegated acts to be adopted to supplement this Directive concerning the detailed arrangements for the auctioning by Member States of aviation allowances should include the modalities for the transfer of a share of revenues to the Union budget. Article 3d, paragraph 4 is replaced to reflect a stronger recommendation that Member States use ETS auctioning revenues to tackle climate change and that a share of those revenues is attributed to the Union budget under Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020\/2053 on the system of own resources. Articles 3e and 3f are deleted as free allocation rules to aircraft operators are no longer needed after the transition to full auctioning. Article 11a, paragraphs 1 to 4 are replaced to provide for EU-based airlines to use appropriate international credits for compliance for flights to or from third countries that are applying CORSIA. To ensure that the EU's CORSIA implementation supports the Paris Agreement goals and gives incentives for broad participation to CORSIA, the following conditions must be met: compliance credits originate from states that are Parties to the Paris Agreement and that participate in CORSIA, and double counting of credits is avoided. A new paragraph 8 is added to Article 11a, empowering the Commission to adopt an implementing act specifying the credits which have been considered acceptable by the ICAO Council to use for compliance of CORSIA. A new paragraph 6 is added to Article 12, implementing CORSIA for EU companies for flights to, from and outside European Economic Area, Switzerland and UK. Airlines' surrender obligations for these flights are decreased from full amount of emissions to their share of collective aviation emissions as per CORSIA baseline. New paragraphs 3 to 9 are added to Article 25a. The Commission is empowered to adopt and maintain an implementing act listing states (other than EEA, Switzerland and UK) which are considered to be applying CORSIA for the purposes of Union law. CORSIA verification of compliance of non-EU based airlines is meant to belong solely to the home country of these airlines. Implementing CORSIA for extra-European flights therefore means exempting non-European airlines from the EU ETS obligations for the flights between Europe and third countries that are implementing CORSIA. To ensure equal treatment on routes, flights to and from countries that are not implementing CORSIA would be exempt from EU ETS or CORSIA obligations. Flights to and from most Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States not implementing CORSIA would be exempt from EU ETS or CORSIA obligations without end date for the exemption. The Commission should be empowered to adopt an implementing act exempting EU-based airlines from surrender requirements in respect of emissions from flights where a significant distortion of competition to the detriment of EU-based airlines occurs due to a less stringent implementation or enforcement of CORSIA in the third country. The distortion of competition could be caused by a less stringent approach to eligible offset credits or double counting provisions. 2021\/0207 (COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Directive 2003\/87\/EC as regards aviation's contribution to the Union's economy-wide emission reduction target and appropriately implementing a global market-based measure THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 8 , Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 9 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, Whereas: (1)Directive 2003\/87\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 established a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union, in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner. Aviation activities were included in the EU emissions trading system by Directive 2008\/101\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 11 . (2)The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) entered into force in November 2016 (\"the Paris Agreement\") 12 . The parties to the Paris Agreement have agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 C above pre-industrial levels. In order to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement, all sectors of the economy need to contribute to achieving emission reductions, including international aviation. (3)The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council adopted the First Edition of the International Standards and Recommended Practices on Environmental Protection - Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) (Annex 16, Volume IV to the Chicago Convention) at the tenth meeting of its 214th session on 27 June 2018. The Union and its Member States continue to support CORSIA and are committed to implement it from the start of the pilot phase 2021-2023 13 . (4)In line with Council Decision (EU) 2018\/2027 14 , Member States notified the ICAO Secretariat of differences between CORSIA and the EU ETS. The objective was to preserve the Union acquis and future policy space, as well as the Union level of climate ambition and the exclusive roles of the European Parliament and Council in deciding the contents of Union legislation. Following the adoption of this amendment to Directive 2003\/87\/EC, the notification of differences between CORSIA and the EU ETS to the ICAO Secretariat should be updated to reflect the revisions made to Union law. (5)Tackling climate and environmental-related challenges and reaching the objectives of the Paris Agreement are at the core of the Communication on \"The European Green Deal\", adopted by the Commission on 11 December 2019 15 . (6)The Union undertook to reduce its economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % below 1990 levels by 2030 in the updated nationally determined reduction commitment of the Union and its Member States submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat on 17 December 2020 16 . (7)The Union has enshrined into legislation the target of economy-wide climate neutrality by 2050 in Regulation (EU) 2021\/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 . That Regulation also establishes a binding Union domestic reduction commitment of net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030. (8)This amendment to Directive 2003\/87\/EC aims at the implementation for aviation of the Union's contributions under the Paris Agreement, and of the regulatory framework to achieve the binding Union 2030 climate target of a domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % compared to 1990 levels by 2030 set out in Regulation (EU) 2021\/ . (9)Aviation should contribute to the emission reduction efforts necessary for the Union's 2030 climate target. Therefore, the total quantity of allowances for aviation should be consolidated and subject to the linear reduction factor. (10) Achieving the increased climate ambition will require channelling as many resources as possible to the climate transition. As a result, all auction revenues that are not attributed to the Union budget should be used for climate-related purposes. (11)In accordance with Article 28b(3) of Directive 2003\/87\/EC, the Union is to assess the ICAO's CORSIA scheme and implement it as appropriate, and in a manner that is consistent with the Union's economy-wide emission reduction commitment for 2030. (12)The total quantity of allowances for aviation should be consolidated at the level of allocation for flights departing from an aerodrome located in the EEA and arriving at an aerodrome located in the EEA, in Switzerland or in the United Kingdom. The allocation for the year 2024 should be based on the total allocation to active aircraft operators in year 2023, reduced by the linear reduction factor as specified in Article 9 of Directive 2003\/87\/EC. The level of allocation should be increased to take into account the routes that were not covered by the EU ETS in the year 2023 but are covered by the EU ETS from year 2024 onwards. (13)Increased auctioning from the year after the entry into force of this amendment to Directive 2003\/87\/EC should be the rule for the aviation sector allocation of allowances, taking into account the sector's ability to pass on the increased cost of CO2. (14)Directive 2003\/87\/EC should also be amended with regard to acceptable compliance units, to take into account the Unit Eligibility Criteria adopted by the ICAO Council at its 216th session in March 2019 as an essential element of CORSIA. Airlines based in the Union should be able to use international credits for compliance for flights to or from third countries that are considered to be participating in CORSIA. To ensure that the Union's CORSIA implementation supports the Paris Agreement goals and gives incentives for broad participation to CORSIA, the credits should originate from states that are parties to the Paris Agreement and that participate in CORSIA, and double counting of credits should be avoided. (15)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the use of international credits in accordance with Article 11a of Directive 2003\/87\/EC, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt a list of the credits which have been considered acceptable by the ICAO Council to use for compliance of CORSIA, and that fulfil the eligibility conditions above. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182\/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 18 . (16)To ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place for authorisation by the participating parties, timely adjustments to the reporting of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks covered by the nationally determined contributions of the participating parties, and avoiding double counting and a net increase in global emissions, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down detailed requirements for such arrangements. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182\/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 19 . (17)For CORSIA implementation on flights other than flights departing from an aerodrome located in the EEA and arriving at an aerodrome located in the EEA, in Switzerland or in the United Kingdom, surrender obligations should be decreased for Union-based aircraft operators operating these flights. Aircraft operators' surrender obligations for these flights should be decreased to only their share of collective international aviation emissions above collective 2019 levels, in respect of emissions during 2021-23, and above collective 2019-20 levels for subsequent years of CORSIA application. (18)In order to ensure uniform conditions for listing countries which are considered to be applying CORSIA for the purposes of Directive 2003\/87\/EC pursuant to Article 25a(3) of that Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt and maintain the list of states other than EEA countries, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which are considered to be participating in CORSIA for the purposes of Union law. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182\/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. (19)As CORSIA implementation and enforcement for aircraft operators based outside the Union is meant to belong solely to the home country of these aircraft operators, implementing CORSIA for flights other than flights departing from an aerodrome located in the EEA and arriving at an aerodrome located in the EEA, in Switzerland or in the United Kingdom means exempting aircraft operators based outside the Union from the EU ETS obligations for these flights. (20)To ensure equal treatment on routes, flights to and from countries that are not implementing CORSIA should be exempt from EU ETS or CORSIA obligations. To incentivise full implementation of CORSIA starting in 2027, the exemption should only apply to emissions up to 31 December 2026. (21)Flights to and from Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, as defined by the United Nations, not implementing CORSIA, other than those states whose GDP per capita equals or exceeds the Union average, should be exempt from EU ETS or CORSIA obligations without an end date for the exemption. (22)In order to ensure uniform conditions for exempting aircraft operators from surrender requirements as laid down in Article 12(8) of Directive 2003\/87\/EC in respect of emissions from flights to and from countries applying CORSIA in a less stringent manner in its domestic law, or failing to enforce CORSIA provisions in a manner equal to all aircraft operators pursuant to Article 25a(7) of that Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to exempt airlines based in the Union from surrender requirements in respect of emissions from flights where a significant distortion of competition to the detriment of airlines based in the Union occurs due to a less stringent implementation or enforcement of CORSIA in the third country. The distortion of competition could be caused by a less stringent approach to eligible offset credits or double counting provisions. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182\/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. (23)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the establishment of a level playing field on routes between two different countries applying CORSIA where those countries allow aircraft operators to use other units than those on the list adopted pursuant to Article 11a(8) of Directive 2003\/87\/EC, pursuant to Article 25a(8) of that Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to allow aircraft operators based in a Member State to use unit types additional to the list adopted pursuant to Article 11a(8) or not to be bound by the conditions of Article 11a(2) and (3). Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182\/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. (24)In order to ensure a level playing field on routes between two third countries implementing CORSIA, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of accepting other credits on those routes. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 20 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. (25)Special consideration should be given to promoting accessibility for the outermost regions of the Union. Therefore, a derogation from the EU ETS should be provided for emissions from flights between an aerodrome located in an outermost region of a Member State and an aerodrome located in the same Member State. (26)A comprehensive approach to innovation is important to achieving the European Green Deal objectives and for the competitiveness of the European industry. This is of particular importance for hard to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and shipping where a combination of operational improvements, alternative climate-neutral fuels and technological solutions need to be deployed. Therefore, Member States should ensure that the national transposition provisions do not hamper innovations and are technologically neutral. At EU level, the necessary R&I efforts, are supported among others, through the Horizon Europe Framework Programme, which includes significant funding and new instruments for the sectors coming under the ETS. (27)Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (28)Directive 2003\/87\/EC should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Directive 2003\/87\/EC is amended as follows: (1)Article 3c is amended as follows: (a)paragraph 2 is deleted, (b)the following paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 are added: '5. The Commission shall determine the total quantity of allowances to be allocated in respect of aircraft operators for the year 2024 on the basis of the total allocation of allowances in respect of aircraft operators that were performing aviation activities falling within Annex I in the year 2023, reduced by the linear reduction factor specified in Article 9, and shall publish that quantity, as well as the quantity of free allocation which would have taken place in 2024 if the rules for free allocation were not updated. 6. In respect of flights departing from an aerodrome located in the EEA which arrive at an aerodrome located in the EEA, in Switzerland or in the United Kingdom, which were not covered by the EU ETS in 2023, the total quantity of allowances to be allocated to aircraft operators shall be increased by the levels of allocations, including free allocation and auctioning, which would have been made if they were covered by the EU ETS in that year, reduced by the linear reduction factor specified in Article 9. 7. By way of derogation from Articles 12(2a), 14(3) and Article 16, Member States shall consider the requirements set out in those provisions to be satisfied and shall take no action against aircraft operators in respect of emissions taking place until 2030 from flights between an aerodrome located in an outermost region of a Member State and an aerodrome located in the same Member State outside that outermost region.'; (2)Article 3d is amended as follows: (a)paragraph 1 is replaced by the following: '1.

Where the Commission determines that there is a significant distortion of competition which is detrimental to aircraft operators that hold an air operator certificate issued by a Member State or is registered in a Member State, including in the outermost regions, dependencies and territories of that Member State, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt implementing acts to exempt those aircraft operators from surrender requirements as laid down in Article 12(8) in respect of emissions from flights to and from such countries. The distortion of competition may be caused by a third country applying CORSIA in a less stringent manner in its domestic law, or failing to enforce CORSIA provisions in a manner equal to all aircraft operators. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 22a(2). 8. Where an aircraft operator that holds an air operator certificate issued by a Member State or is registered in a Member State, including in the outermost regions, dependencies and territories of that Member State, operates flights between two different countries listed in the implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 3, including flights that take place between Switzerland, the United Kingdom and countries listed in the implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 3, and those countries allow aircraft operators to use other units than those on the list adopted pursuant to Article 11a(8), the Commission shall be empowered to adopt implementing acts allowing those aircraft operators to use unit types additional to that list or not to be bound by the conditions of Article 11a(2) and (3) in respect of emissions from such flights.

The Fund was created to provide financial assistance to Member States following major disasters as a concrete sign of European solidarity in situations of distress. (2) In the event of major public health emergencies, the Union should show its solidarity with Member States and the population concerned by providing financial assistance to help the population affected, to contribute to a rapid return to normal living conditions in the affected regions and to contain the spreading of infectious diseases. (3) The Union should also show solidarity in the event of major public health emergencies with the countries negotiating their accession to the Union. (4) A major crisis situation may result from public health emergencies, in particular an officially declared virus pandemic. The Fund enables the Union to help in mobilising emergency services to meet people's immediate needs and to contribute to the short-term restoration of damaged key infrastructure so that economic activity can resume in the disaster-stricken regions. That Fund is currently limited, however, to natural disasters causing physical damage and does not include major disasters due to biological hazards. Provision should be made to allow the Union to intervene in the event of major public health emergencies. (5) The objective of the action to be taken is to complement the efforts of the States concerned in such cases where the effects of a crisis situation are of such gravity that those States cannot tackle the situation by their own means alone. Since that objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union ('TEU'). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (6) In line with the principle of subsidiarity, action under this Regulation should be confined to major public health emergencies. Those emergencies should be defined depending on the basis of the public expenditure necessary to address them. (7) Union assistance should be complementary to the efforts of the States concerned and be used to cover a share of the public expenditure committed to dealing with the most essential emergency operations resulting from the emergency situation. (8) In line with the principle of subsidiarity, Union assistance should only be awarded upon application by the affected State. The Commission should ensure equitable treatment of requests presented by the States. (9) The Commission should be able to take a rapid decision to commit specific financial resources and to mobilise them as quickly as possible. The existing provisions for making advance payments should therefore be strengthened by increasing their amounts. (10) This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. (11) In view of the COVID-19 outbreak and the urgency to address the associated public health crisis, it was considered to be appropriate to provide for an exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the TEU, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. (12) Regulation (EC) No 2012\/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EC) No 2012\/2002 is amended as follows: (1) Article 2 is replaced by the following: 'Article 2 1. At the request of a Member State or of a country involved in accession negotiations with the Union, hereinafter referred to as \"eligible State\", assistance from the Fund may be mobilised when serious repercussions on living conditions, human health, the natural environment or the economy occur in one or more regions of that eligible State as a consequence of: (a) a major or regional natural disaster having taken place on the territory of the same eligible State or of a neighbouring eligible State; or (b) a major public health emergency having taken place on the territory of the same eligible State. Direct damage caused as the direct consequence of a natural disaster shall be regarded as part of the damage caused by that natural disaster. 2. For the purposes of this Regulation, a \"major natural disaster\" means any natural disaster resulting, in an eligible State, in direct damage estimated either at over EUR 3 000 000 000 in 2011 prices, or more than 0,6 % of its GNI. 2a. For the purposes of this Regulation, a \"major public health emergency\" means any life-threatening or otherwise serious hazard to health of biological origin in an eligible State seriously affecting human health and requiring decisive action to contain further spreading, resulting in a public financial burden inflicted on the eligible State for emergency response measures estimated at over EUR 1 500 000 000 in 2011 prices, or more than 0,3 % of its GNI. 3. For the purposes of this Regulation, a \"regional natural disaster\" means any natural disaster resulting, in a region at NUTS level 2 of an eligible State, in direct damage in excess of 1,5 % of that region's gross domestic product (GDP). By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, where the region concerned, in which a natural disaster has occurred, is an outermost region within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \"regional natural disaster\" means any natural disaster resulting in direct damage in excess of 1 % of that region's GDP. Where the natural disaster concerns several regions at NUTS level 2, the threshold shall be applied to the average GDP of those regions weighted according to the share of total damage in each region. 4. Assistance from the Fund may also be mobilised for any natural disaster in an eligible State which is also a major natural disaster in a neighbouring eligible State. 5. For the purpose of this Article, harmonised statistical data provided by Eurostat shall be used.'; (2) in Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced by the following: '1. The assistance shall take the form of a financial contribution from the Fund. For each eligible disaster or emergency, a single financial contribution shall be awarded to an eligible State. 2. The aim of the Fund is to complement the efforts of the States concerned and to cover part of their public expenditure in order to help the eligible State to carry out, depending on the type of eligible disaster or emergency, the following essential emergency and recovery operations: (a) restoring the working order of infrastructure and plant in the fields of energy, water and waste water, telecommunications, transport, health and education; (b) providing temporary accommodation and funding rescue services to meet the needs of the population concerned; (c) securing preventive infrastructure and measures of protection of cultural heritage; (d) cleaning up disaster-stricken areas, including natural zones, in line with, where appropriate, eco-system based approaches, as well as immediate restoration of affected natural zones to avoid immediate effects from soil erosion; (e) measures aiming at rapidly providing assistance, including medical, to the population affected by a major public health emergency and to protect the population from the risk of being affected, including prevention, monitoring or control of the spread of diseases, combating severe risks to public health or mitigating their impact on public health. For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph, \"restoring the working order\" means restoring infrastructure and plant to their condition prior to the occurrence of the natural disaster. Where it is not legally possible or economically justified to restore the condition prior to the occurrence of the natural disaster, or where the beneficiary State decides to relocate or improve the functionality of the infrastructure or plant affected in order to improve its capacity to withstand future natural disasters, the Fund may contribute to the cost of restoration only up to the estimated cost of returning to its status quo ante. Costs in excess of the level of cost referred to in the second subparagraph shall be financed by the beneficiary State from its own or, where possible, from other Union funds. For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, \"temporary accommodation\" means accommodation that lasts until the population concerned is able to return to their original homes following their repair or reconstruction.'; (3) in Article 4a, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following: '2. The amount of the advance shall not exceed 25 % of the amount of the financial contribution anticipated and shall in no case exceed EUR 100 000 000. Once the definitive amount of the financial contribution has been determined, the Commission shall take into account the sum of the advance prior to the balance of the financial contribution being paid. The Commission shall recover unduly paid advances.'; (4) in Article 8, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following: '3. No later than six months after the expiry of the 18-month period referred to in paragraph 1, the beneficiary State shall present a report on the implementation of the financial contribution from the Fund with a statement justifying the expenditure, indicating any other source of funding received for the operations concerned, including insurance settlements and compensation from third parties. The implementation report shall set out, depending on the nature of the eligible disaster or emergency: (a) the preventive measures taken or proposed by the beneficiary State to limit future damage and to avoid, to the extent possible, a recurrence of similar natural disasters or public health emergencies, including the use of European Structural and Investment Funds for this purpose; (b) the state of implementation of relevant Union legislation on disaster risk prevention and management; (c) the experience gained from the disaster or emergency and the measures taken or proposed to ensure environmental protection and resilience in relation to climate change, natural disasters and public health emergencies; and (d) any other relevant information on prevention and mitigation measures taken related to the nature of the natural disaster or public health emergency. The implementation report shall be accompanied by an opinion of an independent audit body, drawn up in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards, establishing whether the statement justifying the expenditure gives a true and fair view and whether the financial contribution from the Fund is legal and regular, in line with Articles 59(5) and 60(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966\/2012. At the end of the procedure referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission shall carry out a closure of the assistance from the Fund.'. Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

However, Article 349 of the Treaty provides for the possibility of introducing specific measures for outermost regions because of permanent constraints affecting their economic and social situation. (2) Specific measures should be adopted, in particular to lay down the conditions for the application of the Treaties to those regions. Such specific measures are to take into account the special characteristics and constraints of those regions, without undermining the integrity and coherence of the Union legal order, including the internal market and common policies. The competitive disadvantages faced by the French outermost regions are referred to in Article 349 of the Treaty: remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, and economic dependence on a few products. Those permanent constraints result in the French outermost regions depending on imports for raw materials and energy, an obligation to build up larger stocks, and a small local market combined with a low level of export activity, etc. The combination of those competitive disadvantages increases production costs and, therefore, the cost price of goods produced locally, without specific measures, would be less competitive than equivalent goods produced elsewhere, even taking into account the cost of transporting such goods to the French outermost regions. This would make it harder to maintain local production. For this reason, specific measures need to be taken in order to strengthen local industry by making it more competitive. (3) With a view to restoring the competitiveness of goods produced locally, Council Decision No 940\/2014\/EU (2) authorises France to apply, until 30 June 2021, exemptions or reductions to dock dues in respect of certain products for which local production exists in the outermost regions of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte and Reunion, given that the significant importation of those products could jeopardise the continuation of local production and that additional costs could increase the cost price of local production in comparison with products produced elsewhere. The Annex to that Decision contains the list of products to which the tax exemptions or reductions may be applied. The difference between the taxation of locally produced products and that of other products may not exceed 10, 20 or 30 percentage points, depending on the product. (4) France has requested that a system similar to that contained in Decision No 940\/2014\/EU continue to apply after 1 July 2021. France explained that although the competitive disadvantages referred to above continue to exist, the tax arrangements established by Decision No 940\/2014\/EU has made it possible to maintain and, in certain cases, develop local production, and that those arrangements have not disrupted external trade and have not resulted in overcompensation for the additional costs borne by the enterprises. (5) For each of the five outermost regions concerned (Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte and Reunion), France sent the Commission a set of lists of products for which it intends to apply a tax differential of no more than 20 or 30 percentage points, depending on whether or not the products are produced locally. The French outermost region of Saint Martin is not covered by the request. (6) This Decision implements the provisions of Article 349 of the Treaty and authorises France to apply differentiated taxation to the products for which it has been proven, firstly, that local production exists, secondly, that the significant importation of those products (including from metropolitan France and other Member States) that could jeopardise the continuation of local production exists, and lastly, that additional costs exist which increase the cost price of local production in comparison with products produced elsewhere, compromising the competitiveness of products produced locally. The authorised tax differential should not exceed the proven additional costs. (7) In cases where local production has a market share of less than 5 % or where the share of imports is less than 10 %, additional evidence was requested as proof of all or some of the following circumstances: the existence of labour-intensive production; new or complementary production designed to diversify a company's product range; production that is strategic for local development (e.g. in sectors relating to the circular economy, harnessing biodiversity or environmental protection); innovative or high-added-value production; production for which the disruption of supply from elsewhere could jeopardise the local economy or population; production which can only exist with a dominant market position as a result of the small size of the markets in the outermost regions; and the production of medical products and personal protective equipment required to tackle public health crises. Applying those principles allows the provisions of Article 349 of the Treaty to be implemented without going beyond what is necessary and without creating an unjustified advantage for local production so as not to undermine the integrity and the coherence of the Union legal order, including safeguarding undistorted competition in the internal market and State aid policies. (8) With a view to simplifying and reducing the obligations of small enterprises and to supporting their growth, the tax exemptions or reductions should apply to operators with an annual turnover of at least EUR 550 000. Operators whose annual turnover is below that threshold should not be subject to dock dues but also should not be able to deduct the amount of those dock dues borne upstream. (9) Similarly, consistency with Union law means ruling out the application of a tax differential for food products benefiting from aid under Chapter III of Regulation (EU) No 228\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). That provision prevents the effect of the financial aid to agriculture granted under the specific supply arrangements from being cancelled out or reduced by the higher taxation of the subsidised products by means of dock dues. (10) The objectives of supporting the social and economic development of the French outermost regions, already provided for in Decision No 940\/2014\/EU, are confirmed by the requirements regarding the purpose of the dock dues. It is a legal obligation for the revenue from those dock dues to be incorporated into the tax resources of the French outermost regions and to be allocated to an economic and social development strategy involving the promotion of local activities. (11) It is necessary to amend Decision No 940\/2014\/EU in order to extend the period of application of the derogation authorised by it by six months, until 31 December 2021. That period should enable France to take implementing measures. (12) The duration of the scheme should be set at six years, until 31 December 2027. In order to enable the Commission to determine whether the grounds for the derogation still apply, France should submit an evaluation report to the Commission by 30 September 2025. (13) To avoid any legal uncertainty, this Decision should apply from 1 January 2022, while the extension of the period of application of the derogation authorised by Decision No 940\/2014\/EU should take effect on 1 July 2021. (14) This Decision is without prejudice to the possible application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 1. By way of derogation from Articles 28, 30 and 110 of the Treaty, France is authorised, until 31 December 2027, to apply exemptions or reductions to dock dues in respect of the products listed in Annex I which are produced locally in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte or Reunion, as outermost regions within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty. Those exemptions or reductions must be in keeping with the economic and social development strategy of the outermost regions concerned, taking account of the Union framework, and contribute to the promotion of local activities while not adversely affecting the conditions of trade to an extent contrary to the common interest. 2. With reference to the rate of taxation applied to similar products not originating in the outermost regions concerned, the application of the total exemptions or reductions referred to in paragraph 1 may not result in differences of more than: (a) 20 percentage points for the products listed in part A of Annex I; (b) 30 percentage points for the products listed in part B of Annex I. France shall undertake to ensure that the exemptions or reductions applied to the products listed in Annex I do not exceed either the proven additional costs or the percentage strictly necessary to maintain, promote and develop local economic activities. 3. France shall apply the tax exemptions or reductions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 to operators whose annual turnover is at least EUR 550 000. Operators whose annual turnover is below that threshold shall not be subject to dock dues. Article 2 The French authorities shall apply the same taxation arrangements as those applied to products produced locally to products that have benefited from the specific supply arrangements under Chapter III of Regulation (EU) No 228\/2013. Article 3 France shall submit an evaluation report to the Commission by 30 September 2025 to enable the Commission to determine whether the grounds for applying the tax arrangements referred to in Article 1 still apply. The evaluation report shall contain the information set out in Annex II. Article 4 In Article 1(1) of Decision No 940\/2014\/EU, the date '30 June 2021' is replaced by '31 December 2021'. Article 5 This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2022, with the exception of Article 4, which shall apply from 1 July 2021. Article 6 This Decision is addressed to the French Republic.

The current situation is unprecedented and requires exceptional measures adapted to the situation to be applied in these circumstances. The first \"Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative\" (CRII), a package of measures proposed by the Commission on 13 March 2020, introduced a number of important changes that allow for a more effective response in the current situation. This initiative was directed at promoting investments by mobilising available cash reserves in the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds), to fight the crisis immediately, followed by complementary measures as proposed under the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus. Nevertheless, additional measures are necessary, including in other policy areas, in particular in order to protect the most vulnerable. The coronavirus crisis also presents an unprecedented challenge for the operations and delivery to the most deprived supported by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). Most importantly, the crisis presents specific risks to the most deprived, among the most vulnerable in our societies. Therefore, specific measures, need to be taken urgently in order to protect them from falling victim to this disease and to ensure that the FEAD assistance still reaches them, such as by providing the necessary protective equipment against the disease. The distribution of food and basic material assistance, as well as social inclusion support, is facing increasingly logistical and human resource constraints, notably due to the confinement and urgent need to instate social distancing measures to contain the spread of the virus. Many of the volunteers, who are the backbone of the Fund, can no longer be mobilised, as they often belong to groups at a higher risk of severe illness caused by COVID-19. There is, nonetheless, the need to ensure that the support is still reaching the most deprived, e.g. through new methods of delivery which ensure the safety of all those people involved in the implementation of the FEAD and of the most deprived. The FEAD Regulation needs therefore to enable Managing Authorities, partner organisations and other actors involved in the implementation of the Fund to react quickly to the emerging additional needs of the target groups who are exposed to further hardship stemming from this crisis. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to amend the FEAD Regulation in order to respond to the challenges faced by public authorities and partner organisations in the implementation of the FEAD during the COVID-19 outbreak. In line with the amendments proposed for the ESI Funds, it is proposed to introduce specific provisions which allow Member States to quickly put in place the necessary measures for addressing this emergency situation. Similar to what was proposed for the ESI Funds, it is proposed that the expenditure for those FEAD operations that are fostering crisis response capacities to the COVID-19 outbreak should be eligible as of 1 February 2020. Likewise, it is proposed that the amendment of certain elements of the operational programme aimed at addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, does not require approval by Commission decision. Furthermore, the proposal introduces the possibility for authorities to deliver food aid\/basic material assistance through electronic vouchers as it reduces the risk of contamination during the delivery of food\/basic material assistance. In addition to these changes, it is also proposed to introduce flexibility regarding the respect of certain legal requirements during this unprecedented period. Exceptionally for this year, it is proposed that the deadline for submitting the Annual Implementation Report is extended and it is clarified that Member States may adjust control and audit procedures during the outbreak. It is also proposed to introduce specific provisions regarding the eligibility of costs incurred by beneficiaries in case the delivery of food\/basic material assistance or social assistance is delayed as well as for suspended and not fully implemented operations. Finally, in order to ensure that all support from the Fund can be mobilised to minimise the effects of the public health crisis on the most deprived, as a temporary and exceptional measure, without prejudice to the rules that should apply under regular circumstances, it is necessary to allow for the temporary possibility of 100% co-financing from the EU budget. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area This proposal is consistent with existing policy provisions in the policy area, in particular with provisions proposed by the Commission for the ESI Funds in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as part of the CRII and CRII plus. Consistency with other Union policies The proposal is consistent with other proposals and initiatives adopted by the European Commission, in particular with the proposals adopted by the Commission for the ESI Funds in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. It is also part of a second legislative package adopted by the Commission, which includes proposals to amend the Common Provisions Regulation. 2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY Legal basis The proposal is based on Article 175(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It provides for a temporary possibility for a co-financing rate of 100%, as well as clarity on the eligibility of expenditure affected by the measures put in place as a response to the health crisis. It finally alleviates some requirements for Member States where these create administrative burdens that could delay implementation of measures to respond to the crisis. These exceptional changes are without prejudice to the rules that apply under regular circumstances. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The proposal complies with the subsidiarity principle. Proportionality The proposal is proportionate and does not include provisions which are not necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty. It is limited to the amendments considered necessary for addressing the problems faced by Member States during the COVID-19 crisis in the context of the implementation of the FEAD. Choice of the instrument Proposed instrument: amendment of the current regulation. The Commission has explored the scope for manoeuvre provided by the legal framework and considers it necessary to propose amendments to Regulation (EU) No 223\/2014. 3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS Ex-post evaluations\/fitness checks of existing legislation Given the specific circumstances of this proposal, there was no ex-post evaluation\/or fitness checks of the existing legislation. Stakeholder consultations Given the specific circumstances of this proposal, there was no consultation of external stakeholders. Collection and use of expertise Use of external expertise has not been necessary. Impact assessment Not applicable. Regulatory fitness and simplification There is not an initiative within the Regulatory Fitness Programme (REFIT) Fundamental rights The proposal has no consequences for the protection of fundamental rights. 4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Regulation (EU) No 223\/2014. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived remains unchanged. The proposal will facilitate an acceleration of programme implementation and result in a frontloading of payment appropriations. The Commission will carefully monitor the impact of the proposed modification on payment appropriations in 2020 taking into account both the implementation of the budget and revised Member States forecasts. 5.OTHER ELEMENTS Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements The implementation of the measures will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting mechanisms established in Regulation (EU) No 223\/2014. Explanatory documents (for directives) N\/A 2020\/0058 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulation (EU) No 223\/2014 as regards the introduction of specific measures for addressing the COVID-19 crisis THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 175(3) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 , Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 2 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, Whereas: (1)Regulation (EU) No 223\/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 3 lays down rules applicable to the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived. (2)Member States have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in an unprecedented manner. The crisis entails higher risks for the most vulnerable, such as the most deprived, notably it risks disrupting the support provided by the FEAD. (3)In order to provide for an immediate response to the impact of the crisis on the most deprived, expenditure for operations for fostering crisis response capacities to the COVID-19 outbreak should be eligible as of 1 February 2020. (4)With a view to alleviating the burden on public budgets responding to the crisis situation, Member States should be given the exceptional possibility to request for a co-financing rate of 100% to be applied for the accounting year 2020-2021, in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. Based on an assessment of the application of this exceptional co-financing rate, the Commission may propose an extension of this measure. (5)In order to ensure that the most deprived can continue to receive assistance by the Fund in a safe environment, it is necessary to provide for sufficient flexibility for Member States to adjust the schemes of support to the current context, including by allowing alternative schemes of delivery through electronic vouchers and by allowing Member States to amend certain elements of the operational programme without requiring an adoption by Commission decision. In order not to disrupt the traditional delivery schemes, it should also be possible to provide the necessary protective materials and equipment to partner organisations outside the technical assistance budget. (6)It is appropriate to establish specific rules for determining the eligible costs borne by beneficiaries in the case where certain operations are delayed, suspended or not fully implemented due to the COVID-19 outbreak. (7)In order to enable Member States to concentrate on introducing measures to respond to the crisis and avoid the disruption of the delivery of support to the most deprived due to risks of contamination, it is appropriate to provide for specific measures that reduce administrative burden for authorities and provide flexibility for compliance with certain legislative requirements, in particular on monitoring and on control and audit. (8)As it is urgent to introduce these measures for ensuring the effective implementation of the FEAD during the COVID-19 crisis, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. (9)In view of the COVID-19 outbreak and the urgency to address the associated public health crisis, it was considered appropriate to provide for an exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. (10)Regulation (EU) No 223\/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EU) No 223\/2014 is amended as follows: (1)In Article 9 paragraph 4 is replaced by the following: 4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply for the purposes of modifying elements of an operational programme falling under sub-sections 3.5 and 3.6 and section 4, respectively, of the operational programme templates set out in Annex I or the elements set out in point (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) of Article 7(2) in case they are modified due to the crisis response to the COVID-19 outbreak. A Member State shall notify the Commission of any decision to modify the elements referred to in the first subparagraph within one month of the date of that decision. The decision shall specify the date of its entry into force, which shall not be earlier than the date of its adoption.\" (2)In Article 13(1) the following subparagraph is added: \"By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the deadline for the submission of the annual implementation report for the year 2019 shall be 30 September 2020.\" (3)In Article 20 the following paragraph is inserted: \"1a By way of derogation from paragraph 1, at the request of the Member State, a co-financing rate of 100% may be applied to the public expenditure declared in payment applications during the accounting year starting on 1 July 2020 and ending on 30 June 2021. Requests for modification of the co-financing rate shall be made through the procedure for amendment of operational programmes set out in Article 9 and shall be accompanied by the revised programme. The 100% co-financing rate shall only apply if the corresponding programme amendment is approved by the Commission at the latest before the submission of the final application for an interim payment in accordance with Article 45(2). Before submitting the first payment application for the accounting year starting on 1 July 2021, Member States shall notify the table referred to in section 5.1 of the operational programme templates set out in Annex I, confirming the co-financing rate which was applicable during the accounting year ending on 30 June 2020.\" (4)In Article 22(4) the following subparagraph is inserted: \"By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, expenditure for operations for fostering crisis response capacity to the COVID-19 outbreak shall be eligible from 1 February 2020.\" (5)In Article 23 the following paragraph is inserted: \"4a. The food and\/or basic material assistance may be provided directly to the most deprived persons or indirectly through electronic vouchers or cards, provided that they can only be redeemed against food and\/or basic material assistance as set out in Article 2(1).\" (6)In Article 26 paragraph 2 is amended as follows: (1)Point (a) is replaced by the following: \"(a) the cost of purchasing food and\/or basic material assistance and the cost of purchasing personal protective materials and equipment for partner organisations,\" (2)Point (c) is replaced by the following: \"(c) the administrative, preparation, transport and storage costs borne by the partner organisations at a flat-rate of 5 % of the costs referred to in point (a); or 5 % of the value of the food products disposed of in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1308\/2013;\" (7)The following Articles 26a, 26b and 26c are inserted: \"Article 26a Eligibility of expenditure for operations supported under OP I during their suspension due to the COVID-19 outbreak Delays in the delivery of food\/basic material assistance due to the COVID-19 outbreak do not lead to a reduction of the eligible costs borne by the purchasing body or partner organisations in accordance with Article 26(2). These costs may be declared to the Commission in accordance with Article 26(2) before the food\/basic material assistance is delivered to the most deprived provided that the delivery is resumed after the COVID-19 crisis is over. Where food is spoiled due to suspension of delivery as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, the costs set out in point (a) of paragraph 2 of Article 26 are not reduced. Article 26b Eligibility of expenditure for operations supported under OP II or technical assistance during their suspension due to the COVID-19 outbreak 1.

If a Member State reimburses the beneficiary on the basis of both options, it shall ensure that the same expenditure is only reimbursed once.\" (8)In Article 30 the following paragraph is inserted: \"1a. Based on an analysis of potential risks, Member States may establish lighter control and audit trail requirements regarding the distribution of food\/material assistance to the most deprived during the period of COVID-19 outbreak.\" Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

The Union's legal regime on port State control is based on the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (the 'Paris MOU'), which was signed in Paris on 26 January 1982. (2) As regards the Union Member States, Directive 2009\/16\/EC effectively brings the procedures, tools and activities of the Paris MOU within the scope of Union law. By virtue of that Directive, certain decisions taken by the Port State Control Committee established under Section 7 of the Paris MOU ('PSCC') become binding on the Union Member States. (3) The PSCC meets annually. During its deliberations it decides on certain issues which have legal effects. (4) Pursuant to Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that body is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, is to be adopted by Council decision, on a proposal from the Commission. (5) The internal rules of the Paris MOU make it difficult to establish a position to be adopted on the Union's behalf in accordance with Article 218(9) TFEU in a timely manner for each annual meeting of the PSCC. It is therefore efficient to establish such a position on a multiannual basis, consisting of guiding principles and orientations, together with a framework for its year-to-year specifications. Moreover, most of the topics discussed at the annual meetings of the PSCC concern port State control matters that are covered generally by a single Union legal act, namely Directive 2009\/16\/EC. In the particular circumstances that apply to the Paris MOU, it is therefore possible to establish a general position to be adopted on the Union's behalf for several meetings of the PSCC. (6) The Union is not a contracting party to the Paris MOU. It is therefore necessary for the Council to authorise the Member States to act in accordance with the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf and express their consent to be bound by the decisions taken by the PSCC. (7) Technical discussions and cooperation with third country members of the Paris MOU within the PSCC are of great importance in ensuring the effectiveness and the good functioning of the Paris MOU. (8) This Decision should cover the period from 2020 to 2024, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 The position to be adopted on the Union's behalf within the annual meetings of the Port State Control Committee ('PSCC') of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control (the 'Paris MOU'), during the period 20202024, when the PSCC is called upon to adopt decisions having legal effects, shall be in accordance with the guiding principles and orientations on the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf within the PSCC (2). Article 2 The year-to-year specifications of the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf within the annual meetings of the PSCC of the Paris MOU, during the period 20202024, shall be established in accordance with the procedural rules governing the year-to-year specifications of the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf within the PSCC (3). Article 3 The Member States which are bound by the Paris MOU shall act in accordance with the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf as referred to in Articles 1 and 2, acting jointly in the interests of the Union. Article 4 This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption. It shall expire on 31 December 2024. Done at Brussels, 19 May 2020. For the Council The President G.

In particular, Commission Regulations (EU) No 1407\/2013 (2) and (EU) No 651\/2014 (3) will expire on 31 December 2020. (2) To provide predictability and legal certainty, while preparing for a possible future update of the State aid rules adopted as part of the State Aid Modernisation initiative, the Commission should take action in two phases. (3) First, the Commission should extend the period of application of State aid rules which would otherwise expire by end 2020. Second, in line with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines (4), the Commission should evaluate those rules together with the other State aid rules, which were adopted as part of the State Aid Modernisation initiative. The Commission launched the evaluation of those rules on 7 January 2019 in the form of a 'fitness check'. In the context of the European Green Deal (5) and the European Digital Agenda, the Commission has already announced its intention to revise a series of guidelines by the end of 2021. On that basis, the Commission will decide whether to further prolong or update the rules. (4) Considering the broad scope of the fitness check and the fact that the results of the evaluations will not be available before late 2020, a policy decision on the design of the State aid rules post 2020 cannot be taken in time to ensure legal certainty and stability for the stakeholders as regards the applicable rules post 2020. A prolongation is therefore necessary to allow a proper assessment of the State aid rules and ensure predictability and stability of those rules for the Member States. (5) Therefore, the period of application of Regulations (EU) No 1407\/2013 and (EU) No 651\/2014 should be extended by three years until 31 December 2023. (6) Regulations (EU) No 1407\/2013 and (EU) No 651\/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly. (7) As a consequence of the extension of the period of application of Regulation (EU) No 651\/2014, some Member States may wish to extend the validity of aid measures exempted under that Regulation and about which summary information has been provided in accordance with point (a) of Article 11 of that Regulation. In order to provide transparency, Member States should communicate to the Commission the updated summary information regarding the extension of those measures. (8) Schemes set up under Sections 1 (with the exception of Article 15), 2, 3, 4, 7 (with the exception of Article 44) and 10 of Chapter III of Regulation (EU) No 651\/2014, having an average annual State aid budget exceeding EUR 150 million, which have been exempted for longer than six months pursuant to a decision by the Commission and which the respective Member State wishes to extend for the period after 31 December 2020, should continue to be exempted until 31 December 2023, provided Member States have provided the Commission with the updated summary information and have submitted a final evaluation report in line with the evaluation plan approved by the Commission. (9) In view of the economic and financial consequences that the COVID-19 outbreak has on undertakings and in order to ensure consistency with the general policy response adopted by the Commission, especially in the period 2020-2021, Regulation (EU) No 651\/2014 should be amended accordingly. In particular, undertakings which became undertakings in difficulty as a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak should remain eligible under Regulation (EU) No 651\/2014 for a limited period of time. Likewise, undertakings, which have to temporarily or permanently lay off staff due to the COVID-19 outbreak, should not be deemed to have breached relocation commitments given before 31 December 2019 at the time of receiving regional aid. Those exceptional provisions should apply for a limited period from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021. (10) Regulations (EU) No 1407\/2013 and (EU) No 651\/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 In Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1407\/2013, the second paragraph is replaced by the following: 'It shall apply until 31 December 2023'. Article 2 Regulation (EU) No 651\/2014 is amended as follows: (1) Article 1 is amended as follows: (1) in paragraph 2, point (a) is replaced by the following: '(a) schemes under Sections 1 (with the exception of Article 15), 2, 3, 4, 7 (with the exception of Article 44), and 10 of Chapter III of this Regulation, if the average annual State aid budget exceeds EUR 150 million, from six months after their entry into force. The Commission may decide that this Regulation shall continue to apply for a longer period to any of those aid schemes after having assessed the relevant evaluation plan notified by the Member State to the Commission, within 20 working days from the scheme's entry into force. Where the Commission has already extended the application of this Regulation beyond the initial six months as regards such schemes, Member States may decide to extend those schemes until the end of the period of application of this Regulation, provided that the Member State concerned has submitted an evaluation report in line with the evaluation plan approved by the Commission. However, regional aid granted under this Regulation may be extended, by derogation, until the end of the period of validity of the relevant regional aid maps;'; (2) in paragraph 4, point (c) is replaced by the following: '(c) aid to undertakings in difficulty, with the exception of aid schemes to make good the damage caused by certain natural disasters, start-up aid schemes and regional operating aid schemes, provided those schemes do not treat undertakings in difficulty more favourably than other undertakings.

The outbreak represents a severe public health emergency for citizens, societies and economies. Economic activities are disrupted causing liquidity constraints and a severe deterioration in the financial situation of economic actors (enterprises, and in particular SMEs). Member States are also facing increased demands on state resources to finance the public health systems and maintain public services. To help Member States meet all these challenges and respond to the impact of the outbreak, the Commission proposed a wide range of measures in the Covid-19 Response Investment Initiative 1 , including the deployment of European Structural and Investment Funds 2 . A reinforcement of the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism\/rescEU was proposed, to coordinate joint procurement and increase the stock of medicines, personal protective equipment and medical products, to repatriate European citizens stranded outside the EU 3 . A reinforcement of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) was also proposed. In order to provide an adequate response to the needs resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, the Commission now proposes to activate, with a budget of EUR 2,7 billion, the Emergency Support Instrument, created in 2016 on the peak of the refugee crisis, to provide assistance with the Covid-19 outbreak 4 to the Member States. In view of the rapid development of the crisis, the Commission also proposes to further reinforce the Union Civil Protection Mechanism\/rescEU with an additional budget of EUR 300 million so as to facilitate wider stock-piling and coordination of essential resource distribution across Europe 5 . This requires the mobilisation of special instruments as there are no available margins or scope for redeployment in heading 3 of the multiannual financial framework (MFF). The availability of special instruments for 2020 is presented in the technical adjustment of the MFF for 2020 6 . Based on the current definition and scope of the special instruments in the MFF Regulation, only the Flexibility Instrument and the Contingency Margin can be used for this purpose, given that the use of the Global Margin for Commitments is restricted to youth and employment as well as migration and security. The current combined availabilities under the Flexibility Instrument and the Contingency Margin are not sufficient to cover the financing needs of the Emergency Support Instrument and of the significant reinforcement of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism\/rescEU. Given that this is the last year of the 2014-2020 MFF and the European Union is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis, the Commission proposes to amend the MFF Regulation in order to remove the limitations in the scope of the Global Margin for Commitments (Article 14) so as to allow the full financing of the EUR 3,0 billion for the Covid-19 outbreak response proposed in draft amending budget No 2\/2020 presented separately. The Commission proposes to delete the references to \"youth and employment\", and \"for migration and security measures\" from the wording of the relevant Articles. Article 135(2) of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community 7 provides that amendments to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311\/2013 that are adopted on or after the date of entry into force of that Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom insofar as those amendments have an impact on the United Kingdom's financial obligations. Amendments provided in this Regulation are limited to the change of the purpose of the use of the Global margin for commitments and do not increase financial obligations. Therefore, Article 135(2) of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community does not apply to this amendment. 2.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The present proposal has no immediate budgetary implications. The Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised and appropriations entered in the annual budget subject to the procedures laid down in the MFF Regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management. 2020\/0055 (APP) Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311\/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 312 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the consent of the European Parliament 8 , Acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure, Whereas: (1)The COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health crisis, which require extraordinary measures to be taken, has put great pressure on the available financial resources within and outside the MFF ceilings. (2)In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis under the Emergency Support Instrument 9 , it is proposed to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under Global margin for commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and for migration and security measures. (3)It is proposed to mobilise the Global Margin for Commitments as soon as possible, in order allow for its rapid use in 2020, as proposed in Draft Amending Budget No 2\/2020 10 . This amendment of Regulation No 1311\/2013 should enter into force at the latest on the same day as the adoption of this Draft Amending Budget. (4)Article 135(2) of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community 11 provides that amendments to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311\/2013 that are adopted on or after the date of entry into force of that Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom insofar as those amendments have an impact on the United Kingdom's financial obligations. Amendments provided in this Regulation are limited to the change of the purpose of the use of the Global margin for commitments and do not increase financial obligations. Therefore, it is appropriate to clarify that Article 135(2) of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community does not apply to this amendment. (5)Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311\/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311\/2013 is amended as follows: (1) In Article 3(2), the second sentence is replaced by the following: 'The commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget over and above the ceilings of the relevant headings laid down in the MFF where it is necessary to use the resources from the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the global margin for commitments in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2012\/2002 (*), Regulation (EU) No 1309\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (**), and the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management (***). _____________________________ (*)Council Regulation (EC) No 2012\/2002 of 11 November 2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund ( OJ L 311, 14.11.2002, p. 3 ).

Support under SURE serves for the financing, primarily, of short-time work schemes or similar measures aimed at protecting employees and the selfemployed and thus reducing the incidence of unemployment and loss of income, as well as for the financing, as an ancillary, of some health-related measures, in particular in the workplace. On 7 August 2020, Latvia requested Union financial assistance under the SURE Regulation. In accordance with Article 6(2) of the SURE Regulation, the Commission has consulted the Latvian authorities to verify the sudden and severe increase in actual and planned expenditure directly related to a scheme for the compensation of idle workers, and its related expenditure - the downtime allowance and the workers' bonus for children-, a scheme for wage subsidies for the export industry, wage support payments for medical professionals and workers in the cultural industry, as well as health related expenditure on protective personal equipment and COVID-19 related sickness benefits caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it concerns: (1)a scheme for the compensation of idle workers. The scheme pays wages to employees of private sector companies who have been furloughed. It covers between 50% and 75% of employees' salaries, depending on the size of the business, with a cap of EUR 700 per employee per month. Attached to the scheme for the compensation of idle workers are the related downtime allowance scheme and workers' bonus for children. The downtime allowance scheme provides a minimum benefit to furloughed employees or self-employed persons who either do not qualify for support under the scheme for the compensation of idle workers due to reasons unrelated to the employee, or receive less than EUR 180 from it. The benefit ensures a minimum level of support is provided, ensuring that all employees or self-employed persons receive a benefit of no less than EUR 180 per month. The bonus for children scheme provides additional support to furloughed employees who have dependent children. (2)a scheme for wage subsidies for the tourism and export industries, which is a continuation of the idle workers scheme aimed specifically at tourism and exporting industries. The measure is dependent on the recipient proving that the resources will be used to cover salary costs. (3)two wage support payments targeted at medical professionals and workers in the cultural industry. The wage support payments provide grants to the medical and cultural industries in order to support the payment of wages whilst workers are furloughed. Both schemes are conditional on the grants being used to cover salary costs. (4)health related expenditure on personal protective equipment and other medical supplies to ensure the health and safety of public sector employees, in particular, healthcare workers. (5)COVID-19 related sickness benefits, whereby the government paid the sick leave support to people who had to miss work due to a requirement to self-isolate or self-quarantine. Normally, part of the sickness benefit would have to be paid by the employer, whereas under this scheme the state paid the entire cost. Latvia provided the Commission with the relevant information. Taking into account the available evidence, the Commission proposes to the Council to adopt an Implementing Decision to grant financial assistance to Latvia under the SURE Regulation in support of the above measures. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The present proposal is fully consistent with Council Regulation 2020\/672, under which the proposal is made. The present proposal comes in addition to another Union law instrument to provide support to Member States in case of emergencies, namely Council Regulation (EC) No 2012\/2002 of 11 November 2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) (\"Regulation (EC) No 2012\/2002\"). Regulation (EU) 2020\/461 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which amends that instrument to extend its scope to cover major public health emergencies and to define specific operations eligible for financing, was adopted on 30 March. Consistency with other Union policies The proposal is part of a range of measures developed in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic such as the \"Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative\", and it complements other instruments that support employment such as the European Social Fund and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI)\/InvestEU. By making use of borrowing and lending in this particular case of the COVID-19 outbreak for supporting Member States, this proposal acts as a second line of defence to finance short-time work schemes and similar measures, helping protect jobs and thus employees and self-employed against the risk of unemployment. 2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY Legal basis The legal basis for this instrument is Council Regulation 2020\/672. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The proposal follows a Member State request and shows European solidarity by providing Union financial assistance in the form of temporary loans to a Member State affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. As a second line of defence, such financial assistance supports the government's increased public expenditure on a temporary basis in respect of short-time work schemes and similar measures to help them protect jobs and thus employees and self-employed against the risk of unemployment and loss of income. Such support will help the population affected and helps to mitigate the direct societal and economic impact caused by the present COVID-19 crisis. Proportionality The proposal respects the proportionality principle. It does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives sought by the instrument. 3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS Stakeholder consultations Due to the urgency to prepare the proposal so that it can be adopted in a timely manner by the Council, a stakeholder consultation could not be carried out. Impact assessment Due to the urgent nature of the proposal, no impact assessment was carried out. 4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The Commission should be able to contract borrowings on the financial markets with the purpose of on-lending them to the Member State requesting financial assistance under the SURE instrument. In addition to the provision of Member State guarantees, other safeguards are built into the framework in order to ensure the financial solidity of the scheme: A rigorous and conservative approach to financial management; A construction of the portfolio of loans that limits concentration risk, annual exposure and excessive exposure to individual Member States whilst ensuring sufficient resources could be granted to Member States most in need; and Possibilities to roll over debt. 2020\/0221 (NLE) Proposal for a COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION granting temporary support under Council Regulation (EU) 2020\/672 to Latvia to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency situation following the COVID-19 outbreak THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Council Regulation (EU) 2020\/672 of 19 May 2020 on the establishment of a European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) following the COVID-19 outbreak 1 , and in particular Article 6(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, Whereas: (1)On 7 August 2020, Latvia requested financial assistance from the Union with a view to complementing its national efforts to address the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and its socio-economic consequences for workers. (2)The COVID-19 outbreak and the extraordinary measures implemented by Latvia to contain the outbreak and its socio-economic and health-related impact are expected to have a dramatic impact on public finances. According to the Commission's 2020 Spring forecast, Latvia was expected to have a general government deficit and debt of 7.3% and 43.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) respectively by the end of 2020. According to the Commission's 2020 Summer interim forecast, Latvia's GDP is projected to decrease by 7% in 2020. (3)The COVID-19 outbreak has immobilised a substantial part of the labour force in Latvia. This has led to a sudden and severe increase in public expenditure by Latvia in respect of the scheme for the compensation of idle workers and the related support schemes - the downtime allowance and the workers' bonus for children, a scheme for wage subsidies for the export industry, wage support payments for medical professionals and workers in the cultural industry, as well as health related expenditure on protective personal equipment and COVID-19 related sickness benefits, as set out in recitals 4 to 7. (4)\"Regulation No. 179 (Adopted 31 March 2020) Regulations Regarding the Allowance for Idle Time for the Self-employed Persons Affected by the Spread of COVID-19\" and \"Regulation No. 165 (Adopted 26 March 2020) Regulations Regarding the Employers Affected by the Crisis Caused by COVID-19 which are Eligible for the Allowance for Idle Time and Division of the Payment for Late Tax Payments in Instalments or Deferral Thereof for up to Three Years\", as they are referred to in Latvia's request of 7 August 2020, introduced a scheme for the compensation of idle workers. The scheme pays wages to employees of private sector companies who have been furloughed. It covers between 50% and 75% of employees' salaries, depending on the size of the business, with a cap of EUR 700 per employee per month. Attached to the scheme for the compensation of idle workers are the related downtime allowance scheme and workers' bonus for children. On the basis of \"Cabinet of Ministers No. 236 \"On the Allocation of Financial Resources from the State Budget Program \"Funds for national emergencies\"\", as it is referred to in Latvia's request of 7 August 2020, the downtime allowance scheme provides a minimum benefit to furloughed employees or self-employed persons who either do not qualify for support under the scheme for the compensation of idle workers due to reasons unrelated to the employee, or receive less than EUR 180 from it. The benefit ensures a minimum level of support is provided, ensuring that all employees or self-employed persons receive a benefit of no less than EUR 180 per month. The bonus for children scheme provides additional support to furloughed employees who have dependent children. The measure can be considered as a similar measure to short-time work schemes, as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020\/672, as it provides income support to employees and the self-employed, which will help to cover the costs of childcare during school closures and therefore help parents to continue working, preventing putting the employment relation at risk (5)The \"Information report on measures to overcome the Covid-19 crisis and economic recovery\" has established a scheme for wage subsidies for the tourism and export industries, which is a continuation of the idle workers scheme aimed specifically at tourism and exporting industries. The measure is dependent on the recipient proving that the resources will be used to cover salary costs. (6)The authorities have introduced two wage support payments targeted at medical professionals and workers in the cultural industry. On the basis of the \"Law On Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Threat to the State and Its Consequences Due to the Spread of COVID-19 and Law on the Suppression of Consequences of the Spread of COVID-19 Infection\" and \"Cabinet of Ministers order No. 303 \"On the Allocation of Financial Resources from the State Budget Program \"Contingency Funds\"\" respectively, as they are referred to in Latvia's request of 7 August 2020, the wage support payments provide grants to the medical and cultural industries in order to support the payment of wages whilst workers are furloughed. Both schemes are conditional on the grants being used to cover salary costs. (7)Finally, Latvia has introduced two health-related measures. On the basis of \"Cabinet of Ministers order No. 79, 118 and 220 \"On Allocation of Financial Resources from the State Budget Program \"funds for emergencies\"\"\", as it is referred to in Latvia's request of 7 August 2020, the authorities have increased health related expenditure on personal protective equipment and other medical supplies to ensure the health and safety of public sector employees, in particular, healthcare workers. Additionally, on the basis of \"09.06.2020. Cabinet Regulation No. 380 \"regulations on the resources for ensuring epidemiological safety necessary for institutions included in the list of priority institutions and needs\"\", as it is referred to in Latvia's request of 7 August 2020, the authorities have paid COVID-19 related sickness benefits, whereby the government paid the sick leave support to people who had to miss work due to a requirement to self-isolate or self-quarantine. Normally, part of the sickness benefit would have to be paid by the employer, whereas under this scheme the state paid the entire cost. (8)Latvia fulfils the conditions for requesting financial assistance set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2020\/672. Latvia has provided the Commission with appropriate evidence that the actual and planned public expenditure has increased by EUR 212 808 280 as of 1 February 2020 due to the increased amount directly related to the scheme for compensation of idle workers and related support schemes, the scheme for wage subsidies for the export industry, medical professionals and the cultural industry. This constitutes a sudden and severe increase because the new measures cover a significant proportion of undertakings and of the labour force in Latvia. Latvia intends to finance EUR 20 108 280 of the increased amount of expenditure through its own financing. (9)The Commission has consulted Latvia and verified the sudden and severe increase in the actual and planned public expenditure directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures, as well as the recourse to relevant health-related measures related to the COVID-19 outbreak referred to in the request of 7 August 2020, in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2020\/672. (10)Financial assistance should therefore be provided with a view to helping Latvia to address the socio-economic effects of the severe economic disturbance caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. (11)This decision should be without prejudice to the outcome of any procedures relating to distortions of the operation of the internal market that may be undertaken, in particular under Articles 107 and 108 TFEU. It does not override the requirement for Member States to notify instances of potential State aid to the Commission under Article 108 TFEU.

The European Pillar of Social Rights sets out the right to fair working conditions, states that equality of treatment and opportunities between women and men must be ensured in all areas and sets out the right to access to social protection and training. It also states that probation periods should be of reasonable duration and that the abuse of atypical contracts is to be prohibited. Principle 4 ('Active support to employment') states that 'young people have the right to continued education, apprenticeship, traineeship or a job offer of good standing within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving education'. (2) The guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, adopted by the Council in its Decision (EU) 2019\/1181 (1), and in particular guideline 6, call upon the Member States to continue to address youth unemployment and the issue of young people not in employment, education or training ('NEETs') through prevention of early school leaving and structural improvement in the school-to-work transition, including through the full implementation of the Youth Guarantee. (3) The Council Recommendation of 20 December 2012 on the validation of non-formal and informal learning (2) sets out elements and principles for the validation of non-formal and informal learning which enable individuals to have knowledge, skills and competences which have been acquired through non-formal and informal learning validated and to obtain a full qualification, or, where applicable, part qualification. (4) The Council Recommendation of 19 December 2016 on Upskilling Pathways: New Opportunities for Adults (3) recommends that adults with a low level of skills, knowledge and competences be offered the opportunity, according to their individual needs, to acquire a minimum level of literacy, numeracy and digital competence, or to acquire a wider set of skills, knowledge and competences. (5) The Council Recommendation of 22 May 2018 on key competences for lifelong learning (4) calls upon the Member States to support the development of basic digital skills and to increase and improve the level of digital competences across all segments of the population. (6) The Council Recommendation of 10 March 2014 on a Quality Framework for Traineeships (5) offers guidance on the provision of quality traineeships and includes quality elements that relate in particular to learning content, working conditions, and transparency regarding financial conditions and hiring practices. (7) The Council Recommendation of 15 March 2018 on a European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships (6) identifies 14 key criteria that Member States and stakeholders should use to develop quality and effective apprenticeships to ensure both the development of job-related skills and the personal development of apprentices. (8) Regulation (EU) 2019\/1700 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) provides a common framework for seven previously independent data collections, including the EU Labour Force Survey. That common framework, namely the Integrated European Social Statistics (IESS), yields more granular cross-EU comparative data, which will enable a better understanding of young people's transition from education to work, capturing more accurately their learning and working experience, but also their individual background characteristics. (9) In its conclusions of 15 December 2016, the European Council calls for the continuation of the Youth Guarantee. In its conclusions of 15 June 2017, the Council reaffirms that tackling youth unemployment and inactivity remains a policy priority, considers that the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative have provided a strong impetus for structural reforms and policy innovation and underlines that reaching out to NEETs requires strong and persistent efforts by national authorities as well as cross-sectoral cooperation. (10) In its resolution of 18 January 2018 on the implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative in the Member States, the European Parliament calls on the Member States to establish appropriate and tailored outreach strategies to reach all NEETs and to take an integrated approach towards making more individualised assistance and services available to support young people facing multiple barriers. The European Parliament emphasises the need to improve the quality of offers under the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative and calls for a future discussion about the eligible age bracket. (11) The European Green Deal is the Union's new growth strategy. It aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resourceefficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. (12) To help repair the economic and social damage caused by the COVID19 pandemic, kickstart the European recovery from that damage, and protect and create jobs, the Commission has proposed a major recovery plan for Europe based on harnessing the full potential of the Union budget and has proposed the recovery instrument 'Next Generation EU'. That instrument will be crucial to support, among other areas, shortterm measures to support employment, including youth employment, as well as investments in longerterm policy reforms related to the labour market and social, education and training systems. (13) In 2013, during the previous economic recession, the youth unemployment rate (1524 year olds) was 24,4 % in the Union (up from 16 % in 2008) and over 50 % in some Member States, and there were 6,5 million NEETs aged 1524. In response, the Council Recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee was adopted in April 2013 (8). It constitutes a major coordinated response, at Union level, to the challenges faced by youth and is based on educational and active labour market policy interventions in the Member States. (14) The COVID-19 pandemic has spiralled the Union into an unprecedented economic recession, which is likely to bring back dramatically high youth unemployment and NEET rates. The Union's economy is expected to shrink significantly in 2020, entering the deepest recession in its history. Young people who were already in a precarious situation in the labour market or who faced barriers to accessing work prior to the onset of the pandemic will suffer most, while those entering the workforce at this time will find it harder to secure their first job. It is therefore necessary to reinforce the Youth Guarantee in the light of the present crisis. (15) Young people may face multiple challenges in the labour market, also because of the transitionary life periods they are going through, their limited or lack of professional experience and other barriers to entering the world of work. As past recessions show, young people are hit harder than older, more experienced workers. (16) Young women are more likely than young men to become inactive due to caring responsibilities, such as looking after children or dependent adults, or other personal or family responsibilities. Caring responsibilities as a reason for inactivity is more than five times more prevalent among young women than among young men. That can lead to an increase in the gender employment gap with lasting consequences throughout women's lives. (17) Youth unemployment and inactivity as well as limited access to inclusive highquality education and training and social services can have a scarring effect, such as an increased risk of future unemployment, reduced levels of future earnings, loss of human capital and intergenerational transmission of poverty. Those elements translate into individual hardship and generate direct and indirect costs for society at large. They also add to regional inequalities, for example with young people unable to secure sustainable labour market integration in rural or remote areas and therefore seeking opportunities elsewhere. (18) Ongoing developments such as automation and digitalisation of production and services continue to reshape the world of work. Young people are overrepresented in nonstandard jobs such as platform or 'gig' work, in which they may lack access to adequate social protection. Young people are among those groups exposed to losing their jobs due to automation, as entry-level jobs tend to have a greater proportion of automatable tasks. At the same time, digital technologies create new jobs and increase the demand for skills needed for digital transformation in many sectors of the economy. (19) Investing now in the human capital of young Europeans will help to future-proof Europe's social market economies, catering for demographic shifts while fully embracing the digital age and the growth of jobs in the green economy. Such investments go hand in hand with labour market reforms, which may address some of the structural problems for young people and provide them with a better starting position. The Union will be able to reap the full benefits of an active, innovative and skilled workforce while avoiding the very high economic and social costs of having young people neither in employment, education or training. (20) A reinforced Youth Guarantee can contribute to creating youth employment opportunities, promoting youth entrepreneurship and help to harness the opportunities arising from the digital and green transitions. It can help to reduce persistent labour market scars from the severe slowdown by encouraging firms to hire unemployed youth, including those who were unemployed prior to the pandemic, and by providing training that facilitates the matching of unemployed and inactive youth to vacancies. (21) A reinforced Youth Guarantee should ensure that all young people receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. To achieve that ambition, it should provide young people with a path towards a stable labour market integration, and reach out and motivate greater numbers of young people regardless of the barriers they may face, making sure that none of them are left behind. A reinforced Youth Guarantee should strive to support young people in gaining valuable work experience and developing the right skills for a changing world of work, in particular those skills relevant to growth sectors and the green and digital transitions. The quality of apprenticeships plays an important role in this respect. There is a need to boost the supply of apprenticeships especially during the recovery phase and to promote the participation of companies in order to facilitate a smoother transition into employment. Apprenticeships prepare young people for jobs that are in high demand and thereby offer them a path towards sustainable labour market integration, including at a local level. (22) In the 2013 Council Recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee, Member States committed to ensuring that all young people under the age of 25 receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. Widening the age bracket to include young people aged 2529 acknowledges that school-to-work transitions and sustainable labour market integration are taking longer because of the changing nature of work, extended periods spent in education and the skills in demand. It is important to recognise that the economic downturn resulting from the COVID19 pandemic will lead to a larger proportion of 2529 year olds falling into unemployment and requiring support. It also aligns with Member States' youth-related measures and programmes, which are generally available to young people between the ages of 15 and 29. (23) NEETs are a heterogeneous group. For some young people, being a NEET can be a symptom of multiple and engrained disadvantages and may indicate a longerterm disengagement from society and therefore require longer interventions. Some young people are especially vulnerable, for example early leavers from education and training or those with inadequate education or training, who often have limited social protection coverage, restricted access to financial resources, precarious work conditions or may face discrimination. For others, such as highlyskilled young people or those who already have significant and still-relevant work experience, being a NEET is likely to be a temporary status since they face low barriers to labour market entry and have no inherent vulnerabilities. A reinforced Youth Guarantee should recognise that NEETs require an individualised approach: for some NEETs a lighter approach may be sufficient, whereas other, more vulnerable, NEETs may need more intensive, lengthy and comprehensive interventions. Interventions should be based on a gender-sensitive approach, taking into account differences between national, regional and local circumstances. (24) More than one in five young people across the Union fail to reach a basic level of digital skills, with lowqualified young people more than three times more likely to underachieve in digital skills than their high-qualified counterparts. With the COVID19 pandemic accelerating the digital transition, the digital skills gap becomes a key determinant in the employability of young people and their ability to seize the opportunities stemming from this transition. Targeted upskilling helps young people respond to the growing demand for digital skills and addresses the digital divide. (25) Preparatory training before taking up an offer, carried out according to individual needs and related to specific skill domains such as digital, green, language, entrepreneurial and career management skills, should be part of a reinforced Youth Guarantee, when deemed appropriate. This hands-on training can be a stepping stone towards a full vocational training course, a taster of the world of work, or supplement existing education or work experience before the start of the Youth Guarantee offer. The short-term, informal nature of such preparatory training, which should not prolong the duration of the four-month preparatory phase, distinguishes it from the offer itself. (26) Effective coordination and partnerships across policy fields, including employment, education, youth, gender equality and social affairs, are crucial in terms of boosting quality employment as well as education and training opportunities, apprenticeships and traineeships. Integrated services (such as one-stop shops or other models) offer easier access to services and benefits, and can more easily provide tailor-made, flexible and more responsive solutions for young people with multidimensional barriers to the labour market. Integrated services require a change in working culture, putting young people at the centre of the interventions and fostering the exchange of best practice ideas across all levels of government and building networks between all relevant actors. In addition, data protection issues need to be addressed to allow for an effective and smooth cooperation between different public administrations and services. (27) The reinforced Youth Guarantee should be implemented by a scheme consisting of supportive measures, and should be geared to national, regional and local circumstances. Such schemes should take into account the diversity of the Member States as regards the levels of youth unemployment and inactivity, the institutional set-up and the capacity of the various labour market players. They should also take into account different situations as regards public budgets and financial constraints in terms of allocation of resources, and be continuously monitored and improved. (28) Supportive measures can be financed by Union funds. The Youth Employment Initiative 20142020 ('YEI') (to which the Union contributes almost EUR 9 billion), together with additional European Social Fund ('ESF') investment, has been a key Union financial resource to support the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. As part of the Recovery Plan for Europe and the instrument 'Next Generation EU', the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe ('REACTEU') will provide additional Union funding for youth employment measures. Those efforts will be complemented in the 202127 financing period by the European Social Fund Plus ('ESF+') which will support the full range of employment, education and training measures of the reinforced Youth Guarantee, HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT MEMBER STATES: (1) ensure that all young people under 30 years of age receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education, in line with Principle 4 of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The starting point for delivering the Youth Guarantee offer to a young person should be the registration of that young person with a Youth Guarantee provider. Youth Guarantee schemes should be based on the following guidelines, which are structured around four phases (respectively, mapping, outreach, preparation and offer), and should be organised in accordance with national, regional and local circumstances, paying attention to the gender and diversity of the young people who are being targeted: Mapping Identifying the target group, available services and skills needs (2) reinforce the mapping of the target group to enable a better understanding of the diversity of NEETs and the tailored support they are likely to require, including NEETs negatively affected by the economic recession; (3) map the services available for different support needs, use national skills forecasts together with available local skills forecasts (informed by, for example, big data labour market intelligence) to identify skills in demand on the labour market, with particular attention to regional labour market specificities and the barriers faced by young people living in rural, remote or disadvantaged urban areas; Enabling prevention through tracking and early warning systems (4) strengthen early warning systems and tracking capabilities to identify those at risk of becoming a NEET, while contributing to preventing early leaving from education and training (through, for example, career guidance in schools, more flexible learning pathways and more work-based learning), in cooperation with the education sector, parents or legal guardians, and local communities, and with the involvement of youth, social, health and employment services; Outreach Raising awareness and targeting communication (5) adopt modern, youth-friendly and local information channels and outreach schemes for awareness-raising activities, using digital and non-digital opportunities, while ensuring the involvement of young people, youth workers and local youth organisations, families and parental associations; (6) use a recognisable visual style for all communication, based, where relevant, on guidelines made available by the Commission, while ensuring accessible and easily understandable information on all types of support available, for instance through a single web portal in the language(s) of the country. The communication should avoid all stereotypes; Stepping up the outreach to vulnerable groups (7) strengthen the focus on NEETs (in particular those belonging to vulnerable groups, including those with disabilities and with multidimensional problems), using specifically-trained service providers and complementary strategies such as youth work, young 'ambassadors' and cooperation with partners that are in contact with specific groups of young people. Explore, for the hardest-to-reach NEETs, coordination with the provision of benefits, as well as the use of mobile units; Preparation Using profiling tools to tailor individualised action plans (8) improve profiling and screening tools and practices to match needs and responses, by adopting a multivariate, gender-sensitive approach to profiling and screening that takes into account the preferences and motivation, skills and previous work experience, barriers and disadvantages of the young person concerned, including the reasons for being unemployed or inactive or those related to their residence in rural, remote and disadvantaged urban areas; (9) ensure that the counselling process at Public Employment Services is strengthened and that Youth Guarantee providers have adequate staff capacity, including specifically-trained staff to operate and improve profiling and screening tools and to develop individualised action plans that take into account person-centred needs and responses; Performing counselling, guidance and mentoring (10) step up the preparatory phase with person-centred counselling, guidance and mentoring by trained advisors in response to the needs of the individual concerned and with due attention to gender bias and other forms of discrimination. Prepare NEETs for the changing nature of work and requirements of lifelong learning, be it through career advice or entrepreneurship support, while adopting one-to-one support, motivational work, advocacy or peer support for NEETs; (11) allow for a more holistic approach to counselling, guidance and mentoring by referring young people to partners (such as education and training institutions, social partners and youth organisations, as well as youth work, health and social services), who can help to motivate and support those young people in overcoming other barriers to employment; Enhancing digital skills with preparatory training (12) assess the digital skills of all NEETs who register in the Youth Guarantee, for example by using the European Digital Competence Framework (DigComp) and the available assessment and self-assessment tools, ensuring that, on the basis of gaps identified, all young people in need of dedicated preparatory training are offered such training to enhance their digital skills; (13) safeguard the validation and recognition of non-formal and informal learning outcomes from the preparatory training by using validation arrangements embedded in education and training systems, using existing tools such as Europass, enabling a more modular approach to accumulating qualifications, enhancing learning outcomes and improving recognition; Assessing, improving and validating other important skills (14) ensure that the preparatory phase facilitates upskilling and re-skilling where deemed appropriate, geared mainly towards digital, green, language, entrepreneurial and career management skills, using existing competence frameworks, assessment and self-assessment tools and validation tools to help young people seize the opportunities in growing sectors, and preparing them for the needs of the changing labour market; Offer Making employment and start-up incentives work (15) use targeted and well-designed employment incentives, such as wage subsidies, recruitment incentives ('bonuses'), reduction of social security contributions, tax credits or disability benefits, and start-up incentives in order to create good quality opportunities for the sustainable integration of young people into the labour market; where appropriate offers that promote self-employment for young people should be linked to in-depth training and comprehensive entrepreneurial counselling; Aligning the offer to existing standards to ensure quality and equity (16) align employment offers to the relevant principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, ensuring equality of treatment and opportunities between women and men in all areas and the right to fair working conditions, access to social protection and training, reasonable duration of probation periods and prohibiting abuse of atypical contracts; (17) ease young people's way back into education and training by diversifying the continued education offer (for example through flexible learning pathways, work-based learning, bridging programmes and second-chance programmes), ensuring, where appropriate, the validation of non-formal and informal learning; (18) intensify support to quality apprenticeships and make sure offers adhere to the minimum standards laid out in the European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships; (19) ensure that traineeship offers adhere to the minimum standards laid out in the Quality Framework for Traineeships; Providing post-placement support and implementing feedback (20) expand continued post-placement support for young people to help them cope in new situations and adjust individualised action plans where needed, using the opportunity of post-placement feedback to ensure a quality offer was provided and prevent young people falling back into NEET status; Crosscutting enablers Mobilising partnerships (21) strengthen partnerships, across all levels of government, between Youth Guarantee providers and relevant stakeholders, such as employers, education and training institutions, social partners, youth work services, providers of solidarity and civic activities, youth organisations and other civil society organisations; promote protocols for cooperation between Youth Guarantee providers and other social services, such as childcare, healthcare, rehabilitation, social housing and accessibility services; (22) promote the further development of integrated service models, such as one-stop shops, joint case management or multidisciplinary teams, which strengthen partnerships and enable a single point of contact for young people; Improving the data collection and monitoring of schemes (23) step up efforts to enrich follow-up data by strengthening systems that allow young people to be tracked after taking up an offer, in order to monitor long-term, sustainable labour market integration; (24) encourage, while respecting data protection rules, the wider sharing of tracking, profiling and follow-up data between Youth Guarantee partners to improve support, which is of particular importance for the success of interventions targeting vulnerable NEETs; Making full and optimal use of funds (25) dedicate adequate national resources to the implementation of the policy measures put forward by the reinforced Youth Guarantee, ensuring that they are well targeted to the individual needs of any young person and especially of the most vulnerable groups; (26) make full and optimal use of the current Union instruments under the cohesion policy, in particular the YEI, the ESF and the European Regional Development Fund ('ERDF') (2014-2020) and mobilise a significant share of the additional funds provided under REACT-EU, as well as the ESF+ and the ERDF (2021-2027), to support youth employment, education and training, prevent unemployment and inactivity among young people and implement relevant policy reforms; (27) exploit the potential of complementing national funding efforts with other Union funding sources that could contribute to implementing the reinforced Youth Guarantee, in particular the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ('EAFRD'), the InvestEU Programme, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund ('AMIF'), the Erasmus+ programme and the Technical Support Instrument; HEREBY WELCOMES THE COMMISSION'S INTENTION TO: Improving the data collection and monitoring of schemes (28) continue to support the quantitative monitoring of Youth Guarantee schemes based on the commonlyagreed Indicator Framework, proposing adjustments where appropriate in light of this Recommendation; (29) improve, from 2022 onwards, the granularity with which the NEET target group is assessed, benefitting from the improvements to the EU Labour Force Survey yielded by Regulation (EU) 2019\/1700; Monitoring implementation (30) monitor the implementation of Youth Guarantee schemes pursuant to this Recommendation through the multilateral surveillance of the Employment Committee ('EMCO') within the framework of the European Semester; (31) regularly engage with Member States in the context of the European Semester to ensure monitoring of a continuous national investment in youth employment policies and programmes; address, where appropriate, country-specific recommendations to Member States on the basis of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States; (32) report regularly to the EMCO on developments concerning the implementation and results of Youth Guarantee schemes; Raising awareness and targeting communication (33) strengthen support to Member States' awareness-raising and communication efforts and reinforce the dissemination of results and good practice examples among Member States, including through the European Network of Public Employment Services.

Air services between the EU and Tunisia operate at present on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Tunisia. It is part of the EU's external aviation policy to negotiate comprehensive air services agreements with neighbouring countries, where the added value and economic benefits of such agreements have been demonstrated. The Agreement aims in particular at: - gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; - ensuring regulatory convergence and effective compliance by Tunisia with EU aviation related legislation; and - non-discrimination and level playing field for economic operators. General context The negotiating directives set out the general objective of negotiating a comprehensive air transport agreement with the aim of gradually and reciprocally opening market access and ensuring regulatory convergence and effective implementation of EU requirements and standards. In accordance with the negotiating directives, a draft Agreement with Tunisia was initialled by the two sides on 11 December 2017. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The conclusion of a Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement with Tunisia is an important element in the development of the EU external aviation policy and a crucial component of the EU neighbourhood policy and the creation of a wider European Common Aviation Area, as described in the Commission Communication on external aviation relations COM (2005) 79 and in the Commission Communication COM (2012) 556 final on the \"EU's External Aviation Policy - Addressing Future Challenges\". Consistency with existing provisions in the area of the proposal The provisions of the Agreement shall prevail over the relevant provisions of the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of Tunisia. However, existing traffic rights which originate from these bilateral agreements and which are not covered under this Agreement can continue to be exercised, provided that there is no discrimination between the Member States and their nationals. 2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY Legal basis Art. 100(2) and 218(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The provisions of the Agreement will prevail over the relevant provisions of the existing arrangements made by individual Member States. The Agreement creates simultaneously for all Union air carriers' equal and uniform conditions for market access, and establishes new arrangements for regulatory co-operation and convergence between the European Union and Tunisia in fields essential for the safe, secure, and efficient operation of air services. These arrangements can only be achieved at Union level because they involve a number of areas of exclusive Union competence. Union action will better achieve the objectives of the proposal for the following reasons. The Agreement allows for the simultaneous extension of its terms to the 27 Member States, applying the same rules without discrimination and benefiting all Union air carriers regardless of their nationality. These carriers will be able to operate freely from any point in the European Union to any point in Tunisia which is currently not the case. The gradual removal of market access restrictions between the EU and Tunisia will not only attract new entrants to the market and create opportunities to operate to underserved airports, but will also facilitate consolidation between EU air carriers. The Agreement secures for all EU air carriers access to commercial opportunities, such as the ones relating to ground-handling, code-sharing, inter-modality and the possibility to freely establish prices. Proportionality A Joint Committee will be established to discuss matters related to the implementation of the Agreement. The Joint Committee will foster expert-level exchanges on new legislative or regulatory initiatives or developments and consider potential areas for further development of the Agreement. The Joint Committee will be composed of representatives of the Commission and the Member States. Furthermore, Member States will continue to carry out the traditional administrative tasks they execute in the context of international air transport, but under common rules applied uniformly. Choice of the instrument External aviation relations can only be given effect through international agreements. 3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS Ex-post evaluations\/fitness checks of existing legislation Not applicable Stakeholder consultations In line with Article 218(4) TFEU, the Commission has conducted the negotiations in consultation with a special committee (Consultative Forum). Industry has equally been consulted during the negotiations. Comments made in this process have been taken into account. The Member States concerned verified the accuracy of the references to the bilateral air services agreements. Industry underlined the importance of a sound legal basis for their commercial operations. Collection and use of expertise Not applicable. Impact assessment Not applicable. Regulatory fitness and simplification Not applicable. Fundamental rights Not applicable. 4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The proposal has no implication for the budget of the Union. 5.OTHER ELEMENTS Summary of the proposed agreement The Agreement consists of the main body including the core principles and three annexes: Annex I on transitional provisions, Annex Ia on transitional provisions relating to Tunis-Carthage International Airport and Annex II on the EU rules applicable to civil aviation. Since 1 January 2021 Union law no longer applies to the United Kingdom. Therefore, in agreement with Tunisia, all references to the United Kingdom in the initialled text have been removed and a standard territorial clause has been included. 2021\/0080 (NLE) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Tunisia, of the other part THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in particular Article 100(2), in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, Whereas: (1)On 9 December 2008, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Republic of Tunisia on a Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States of the one part and the Republic of Tunisia of the other part.

The provisions of Article 21(1) of this Agreement shall not apply to this type of decision. ARTICLE 6 Compliance with laws and regulations 1. While entering, within, or leaving the territory of one of the contracting parties, the laws and regulations applicable within that territory relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air transport or to the operation and navigation of aircraft shall be complied with by the other contracting party's air carriers. 2. While entering, within, or leaving the territory of one contracting party, the laws and regulations applicable within that territory relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew, or cargo on aircraft (including regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs and quarantine or, in the case of mail, postal regulations) shall be complied with by, or on behalf of, such passengers or crew, or, with regard to cargo, by the sender of the other contracting party. 3. Each of the contracting parties authorises, on its territory, air carriers of the other contracting party to take measures to ensure that only persons holding the required travel documents for entry into their territory or for transit via their territory are transported. ARTICLE 7 Fair competition 1. The contracting parties recognise that the common objective is to create an environment of fair competition with fair and equal opportunities for air carriers of both contracting parties to compete in the operation of their authorised services on specified routes. Consequently, the contracting parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that this objective is fully respected. 2. The contracting parties affirm that free, fair and undistorted competition is important to promote the objectives of this Agreement, and note that the existence of comprehensive competition law and an independent competition authority, as well as the healthy and effective application of their national competition law, are important for the effective provision of air transport services. The competition law of each contracting party dealing with issues covered by this Article, as amended periodically, shall apply to the activities of air carriers on the territory of each of the contracting parties. The contracting parties share the objectives of ensuring the compatibility and convergence of their respective competition laws and their effective application. They shall cooperate where this is necessary and justified for the effective application of competition law, in particular by authorising their air carrier(s) or other nationals to communicate, in accordance with their respective rules and case law, relevant information on cases relating to competition law brought by the competition authorities of the other contracting party. 3. No provision of this Agreement shall affect or restrict the authority and powers of the competition authorities or the courts of either contracting party (and of the European Commission) or detract therefrom, and any questions relating to the application of competition law shall continue to fall within the exclusive competence of those authorities and courts. Any measure taken by a contracting party under this Article shall therefore be undertaken without prejudice to any possible measure which may be taken by those authorities and courts. 4. Any measure taken by virtue of this Article shall be the sole responsibility of the contracting parties and relate exclusively to the other contracting party and\/or air carrier(s) of the other contracting party providing air transport services to\/from the contracting parties. Such a measure may not be the subject of a dispute settlement procedure within the meaning of Article 22 (Dispute resolution and arbitration) of this Agreement. Unfair competition 5. Each contracting party shall eliminate all forms of discrimination or unfair practices which would prejudice the ability of air carriers from the other contracting party to compete under fair and equitable conditions to provide air transport services. Subsidies and State aid 6. Neither contracting party shall grant or authorise subsidies or State aid to its air carriers where these are liable to unfairly distort fair and equitable competition in the provision of air transport services for air carriers of the other contracting party. Such subsidies or aid may include, in particular, cross-subsidies, compensation for operating losses, provision of capital, non-reimbursable aid, sureties, loans or insurance under preferential conditions, bankruptcy protection, the waiving of amounts due, the waiving of the right to normal payment for public resources, tax relief or exemptions, compensation for charges made by the public authorities and access on a discriminatory or non-commercial basis to air transport or airport installations and services, fuel, ground handling, security, computerised booking systems, the allocation of time slots and access to other associated installations and services necessary for the operation of air transport services. 7. Where a contracting party grants subsidies or State aid to an air carrier, it shall ensure the transparency of these measures by appropriate means, which may include requiring that the air carrier report separately on these subsidies or this aid in its accounts. 8. Each contracting party shall, at the request of the other party, provide the latter, within a reasonable period of time, with financial reports concerning entities under the jurisdiction of the first contracting party and any other information which could reasonably be requested by the other party to ensure that the provisions of this Article are complied with. This may include detailed information on subsidies and aid within the meaning of paragraph 6 above. This information shall be treated confidentially by the contracting party requesting access to it. 9. Without prejudice to any measure taken by the competent authority responsible for competition and\/or the court responsible for enforcing the rules referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6: (a) if one of the contracting parties takes the view that an air carrier has been discriminated against or is the victim of unfair practices, within the meaning of paragraphs 5 and 6 above, and this can be demonstrated, it may submit written observations to the other contracting party. Having informed the other contracting party, a party may also turn to the competent authorities of the other party, in particular national, regional or local authorities, to discuss issues relating to this Article. In addition, one of the contracting parties may request consultations on the matter with the other contracting party in order to solve the problem. Such consultations shall take place within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request. In the meantime, the parties shall exchange sufficient information to allow a full examination of the concern expressed. (b) if the contracting parties do not manage to resolve the issue by means of the consultations within thirty (30) days of the start of the consultations, or if the consultations do not start within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request concerning an alleged infringement of paragraphs 5 and 6 above, the contracting party which has requested the consultations shall be entitled to suspend the exercise of the rights granted by this Agreement by the air carrier(s) of the other contracting party, by refusing, withdrawing, revoking or suspending any operating authorisation, imposing the conditions it considers necessary for the exercise of these rights, imposing charges or taking other measures. Any measure taken under this paragraph shall be appropriate, proportional and limited to what is strictly necessary in terms of its scope and duration. Antitrust strategy 10. Each contracting party shall effectively apply antitrust legislation in line with paragraph 2 and prohibit air carriers from: (a) in cooperation with any other air carrier(s), concluding agreements, taking decisions or engaging in concerted practices liable to affect air transport services to\/from the contracting party and which have as their objective or effect to prevent, restrict or distort competition. This prohibition may be declared inapplicable where such agreements, decisions or practices contribute to improving the production or distribution of services or promoting technical or economic progress, while reserving a fair proportion of the profit for the consumer and without: (i) imposing on the undertakings concerned any restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of these objectives; (ii) giving these air carriers the possibility, for a substantial part of the services in question, to eliminate competition, and (b) abusing a dominant position which could affect air transport services from\/to that party. 11. Each contracting party shall entrust the application of the antitrust legislation referred to in paragraph 10 above exclusively to its independent competent competition authority and\/or its courts. 12. Without prejudice to any measure taken by the competent competition authority and\/or the court responsible for enforcing the rules referred to in paragraph 10, if one of the contracting parties takes the view that an air carrier has been the victim of an alleged infringement of paragraph 10 and this can be demonstrated, it may make written submissions to the other contracting party. Having informed the other contracting party, a party may also turn to the competent authorities of the other party, in particular national, regional or local authorities, to discuss issues relating to this Article. In addition, one of the contracting parties may request consultations on the matter with the other contracting party, in order to solve the problem. Such consultations shall take place within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request. In the meantime, the parties shall exchange sufficient information to allow a full examination of the concern expressed. 13. If the contracting parties do not manage to resolve the issue by means of the consultations within thirty (30) days of the start of the consultations, or if the consultations do not start within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request concerning an alleged infringement of paragraph 10, and on condition that the competition authority or court has established an infringement of the rules on cartels, the contracting party which has requested the consultations shall be entitled to suspend the exercise of the rights granted by this Agreement for the air carrier(s) of the other contracting party, by refusing, withdrawing, revoking or suspending any operating authorisation, imposing the conditions it considers necessary for the exercise of these rights, imposing charges or taking other measures. Any measure taken under this paragraph shall be appropriate, proportional and limited to what is strictly necessary in terms of its scope and duration. ARTICLE 8 Commercial activities Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements set out in Annex I to this Agreement, the contracting parties shall ensure that their applicable laws, rules and procedures ensure, as a minimum, the implementation and application of the regulations and standards in the area of air transport set out in part A of Annex II. Doing business 1. The contracting parties agree that any obstacles to doing business experienced by commercial operators would compromise the benefits to be obtained through this Agreement. They therefore agree to engage in an effective and reciprocal process of removing obstacles to doing business for commercial operators of both contracting parties where such obstacles may hamper commercial operations, create distortions to competition or hamper the creation of a level playing field. 2. The Joint Committee set up in accordance with Article 21 of this Agreement shall develop a process of cooperation in relation to doing business and commercial opportunities; it shall monitor progress in effectively addressing obstacles to doing business for commercial operators and shall regularly review developments, in particular those relating to legislative and regulatory changes. In accordance with Article 21 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement, a contracting party may request a meeting of the Joint Committee to seek to resolve any question relating to the application of this Article. Air carrier representatives 3. The air carriers of each contracting party shall be entitled to establish the necessary offices and installations for the provision of services under this Agreement on the territory of the other contracting party. 4. The air carriers of each party shall be entitled, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other party relating to entry, residence, and employment, to bring in and maintain in the territory of the other party any commercial, managerial, sales, technical, operational, and other specialist staff who are required to support the provision of aviation services. Both parties shall facilitate and expedite the granting of employment authorisations, where required, for personnel employed under this paragraph, in particular those performing certain temporary duties not exceeding ninety (90) days, subject to the relevant laws and regulations in force. Air carriers of the two contracting parties shall not be obliged to have local partners. Groundhandling 5. (a) Without prejudice to point (b) below, each air carrier of a contracting party shall have the following rights in the territory of the other contracting party: (i) the right to perform its own groundhandling (\"self-handling\"); or (ii) the right to select among competing suppliers which provide groundhandling services in whole or in part where such suppliers are allowed market access on the basis of the laws and regulations of each contracting party, and where such suppliers are present on the market. (b) The rights established under point (a)(i) and (ii) above shall only be subject to specific constraints in terms of space or capacity resulting from the need to operate the airport safely and securely. Where such constraints hamper, prevent or restrict self-handling, and in the absence of effective competition between groundhandling service providers, the contracting party in question shall ensure that all these services are made available to all air carriers under appropriate and equitable conditions. The costs of such services shall be determined in line with relevant, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. 6. Each provider of groundhandling services, whether an air carrier or not, shall be entitled, on the territory of the other contracting party, to provide groundhandling services to air carriers operating out of the same airport, with authorisation and in compliance with the laws and regulations in force. Allocation of time slots at airports 7. Each contracting party shall ensure that its procedures, guidelines and regulations to manage slots applicable at airports in its territory are applied in an independent, transparent, effective and non-discriminatory manner and do not constitute a barrier to market access. Operating plans, programmes and schedules 8. A contacting party may require, for information purposes only, that the operating plans, programmes and schedules of air transport services operated under this Agreement be communicated to it. If a contracting party requires such communication, it shall reduce to a minimum the administrative burden associated with such communication and the procedures for air transport intermediaries and for air carriers of the other contracting party. Sales, local expenses and transfer of funds 9. Any air carrier of each contracting party may engage in the sale of air transport services and associated services in the territory of the other contracting party, on its own behalf or on behalf of another air carrier, directly and\/or through its sales agents, other intermediaries appointed by the air carrier or through the internet or any other available channel, at the air carrier's discretion. Each air carrier shall have the right to sell such services, and any person shall be free to purchase them, in the currency of that territory or in freely convertible currencies in accordance with local currency legislation. 10. The air carriers of each contracting party are authorised to pay for expenditure incurred on the territory of the other contracting party, in particular but not exclusively for the purchase of fuel, in local currency or in freely convertible currency, in accordance with the national rules on currency exchange and foreign trade. 11. Any air carrier shall be entitled, if it so requests, to convert all excess revenue from its local expenditure into a freely convertible currency and to transfer it to the country of its choice in the manner and at the time of its choosing, without restriction or charge, at the rate of exchange applicable at the moment of the transfer. The administrative procedures associated with the conversion and transfer of excess revenue shall apply in accordance with the rules on foreign exchange operated by each party. The conversion and transfer shall not be subject to any fees apart from those normally charged by the banks for such services. Commercial cooperation agreements 12. In operating or providing services under this Agreement, any air carrier of a party may enter into commercial cooperation agreements such as blocked-space agreements or code-sharing arrangements, with: (a) one or more air carriers of the contracting parties; and (b) one or more air carriers of a third country; and (c) one or more land or sea transport operators from any country; provided that: (i) the operating carrier holds the appropriate traffic rights and (ii) the carriers selling the service hold the appropriate route authorisations and (iii) the arrangements meet the requirements relating to safety and competition normally applied to such arrangements. 13. In respect of passenger transport on a flight sold involving commercial cooperation agreements, the purchaser shall be informed at the point of sale, at check-in, or in all events before boarding in the case of connecting flights without check-in, about which transportation providers will operate each sector of the service. Intermodal services 14. In relation to the transport of passengers, surface transport providers shall not be subject to laws and regulations governing air transport on the sole basis that such surface transport is provided by an air carrier under its own name. 15. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, air carriers and indirect providers of cargo transport of the contracting parties shall be permitted, without restriction, to employ in connection with international air transport any surface transport for cargo to or from any points in the territory of the contracting parties or in third countries, including transport to and from all internationally recognised airports with customs facilities, and including, where applicable, the right to transport cargo under customs seal under the applicable laws and regulations. Such cargo, whether moving by surface or by air, shall have access to airport customs processing and facilities. Air carriers may elect to perform their own surface transport or to provide it through arrangements with other surface carriers, including surface transport operated by other air carriers or indirect providers of air freight transport. Such intermodal cargo services may be offered at a single, through price for the air and surface transport combined, provided that shippers are not misled as to the facts concerning such transport. Franchising and branding 16. The air carriers of each contracting party shall be entitled to enter into franchising or branding arrangements with companies, including air carriers, of either contracting party or third countries, provided that the air carriers hold the appropriate authority and meet the conditions prescribed under the laws and regulations applied by the contracting parties to such arrangements, particularly those requiring the disclosure of the identity of the air carrier operating the service. Rental 17. Air carriers of either contracting party may conclude contracts for the provision of aircraft with or without crew for the operation of international air transport services with: (a) any air carrier or carriers of the parties; and (b) one or more air carriers of a third country; provided that all participants in such arrangements hold the appropriate authorisations and meet the conditions prescribed under the laws and regulations applied by the parties to such arrangements. Neither party shall require an air carrier providing aircraft to hold traffic rights under this Agreement for the routes on which the aircraft will be operated. The contracting parties may require that these agreements be approved by their competent authorities. When a contracting party requires such an approval, on a non-discriminatory basis, it shall minimise the associated administrative burden for approval applications for air carriers. ARTICLE 9 Customs duties and charges 1. On arriving in the territory of one contracting party, aircraft operated in international air transport by the air carriers of the other contracting party, their regular equipment, fuel, lubricants, consumable technical supplies, ground equipment, spare parts (including engines), aircraft stores (including but not limited to such items as food, beverages and liquor, tobacco and other products destined for sale to or use by passengers in limited quantities during flight), and other items intended for or used solely in connection with the operation or servicing of aircraft engaged in international air transport shall be exempt, on the basis of reciprocity, from all import restrictions, property taxes and capital levies, customs duties, excise taxes, and similar fees and charges which are (a) imposed by the national or local authorities or the European Union, and (b) are not calculated on the basis of the cost of services on offer, provided that such equipment and supplies remain on board the aircraft. 2. The following shall also be exempt, on the basis of reciprocity, from the taxes, levies, duties, fees and charges referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, with the exception of charges calculated on the basis of the cost of the service provided: (a) aircraft stores introduced into or supplied in the territory of a party and taken on board, within reasonable limits, for use on outbound aircraft of an air carrier of the other party engaged in international air transport, even when these stores are to be used on the part of the journey performed over the said territory; (b) ground equipment and spare parts (in particular engines) introduced into the territory of a contracting party for the servicing, maintenance, or repair of aircraft of an air carrier of the other contracting party used in international air transport; (c) fuel, lubricants and consumable technical supplies introduced into or supplied in the territory of a contracting party for use in an aircraft of an air carrier of the other contracting party engaged in international air transport, even when these supplies are to be used on the part of the journey performed over the said territory; (d) printed matter, as provided for by the customs legislation of each contracting party, introduced into or supplied in the territory of one contracting party and taken on board for use on outbound aircraft of an air carrier of the other contracting party engaged in international air transport, even when these stores are to be used on the part of the journey performed over the said territory; and (e) safety and security equipment for use at airports or cargo terminals. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a contracting party from imposing taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on fuel supplied in its territory on a non-discriminatory basis for use in an aircraft of an air carrier that operates between two points on its territory. 4. The regular equipment of aircraft, as well as the material, supplies and spare parts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article normally retained on board aircraft operated by an air carrier of one contracting party may be unloaded in the territory of the other contracting party only with the advance approval of the customs authorities of that contracting party and may be required to be kept under the supervision or control of the said authorities until such time as they are re-exported or otherwise ceded in accordance with the customs regulations of the two parties. 5. The exemptions provided by this Article shall also apply where the air carriers of one party have contracted with another air carrier, which similarly enjoys such exemptions from the other party, for the loan or transfer in the territory of the other party of the items specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. 6. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either party from imposing taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on goods sold other than for consumption on board to passengers during a part of an air service between two points within its territory at which embarkation or disembarkation is permitted. 7. Baggage and cargo in direct transit across the territory of a contracting party shall be exempt from taxes, customs duties, fees and other similar charges which are not based on the cost of the service provided. 8. Equipment and supplies referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article may be required to be kept under the supervision or control of the competent authorities. 9. The stipulations of the present Agreement shall not affect the field of VAT, with the exception of such tax on imports. 10. The provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the respective agreements in force between a Member State and Tunisia for the avoidance of double taxation on income and on capital. ARTICLE 10 User charges 1. Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements set out in Annex I to this Agreement, the contracting parties shall ensure that their applicable laws, rules and procedures ensure, as a minimum, the implementation and application of the regulations and standards in the area of air transport set out in part A of Annex II. 2. Each contracting party shall ensure that any user charges which may be imposed by its competent charging authorities or bodies on the air carriers of the other contracting party for the use of air navigation and air traffic control services are cost-related and non-discriminatory. In any event, any such user charges shall be imposed on the air carriers of the other contracting party on terms No less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier. 3. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that user charges which may be imposed by its competent charging authorities or bodies on the air carriers of the other contracting party for the use of airport, aviation security and related facilities and services, with the exception of charges incurred for the services described in Article 8(5) (Commercial activities), are fair, reasonable, not unjustly discriminatory, do not discriminate on the grounds of nationality and are equitably apportioned among categories of users. Without prejudice to Article 15(1) (Air traffic management), these charges may reflect, but shall not exceed, the full cost to the competent charging authorities or bodies of providing the appropriate airport and aviation security facilities and services at that airport or within that airport's system. The charges may include a reasonable return on assets, after depreciation. Facilities and services for which user charges are imposed shall be provided on an efficient and economic basis. In any event, these charges shall be imposed on the air carriers of the other party on terms No less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier at the time the charges are assessed. 4. Each contracting party shall require consultations between the competent charging authorities or bodies in its territory and the air carriers using the services and facilities and an exchange of information in order to determine in detail the reasonableness of user charges, in accordance with the principles of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article. Each party shall ensure that the competent charging authorities or bodies provide users with reasonable notice of any proposal for changes in user charges in order to enable users to express their views and submit their observations. ARTICLE 11 Passenger and freight tariffs 1. The contracting parties shall permit prices to be freely set by the air carriers for passengers and freight, on the basis of free and fair competition. 2. Each party may require, on a non-discriminatory basis, that the air carriers of both contracting parties communicate to their competent authorities, in a simplified form and for information purposes only, the fares offered for services departing from their territories. This notification may be requested from air carriers No earlier than the initial offer of a fare for passengers or freight. 3. Discussions may take place between the competent authorities, in particular on issues such as the requirements and procedures for the communication of passenger and freight fares and any unfair, unreasonable, discriminatory or subsidised fares. ARTICLE 12 Statistics 1. Each contracting party shall provide the other, on a non-discriminatory basis, with the statistics available concerning the air transport services provided under this Agreement, as required under the legislation and regulations of the two contracting parties, where these may reasonably be requested. 2. The contracting parties shall cooperate, in particular in the framework of the Joint Committee under Article 21 of this Agreement, to facilitate the exchange of statistical information between them for the purpose of monitoring the development of air transport services under this Agreement. TITLE II: REGULATORY COOPERATION ARTICLE 13 Aviation safety 1. Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements set out in Annex I to this Agreement, the contracting parties shall ensure that their applicable laws, rules and procedures ensure, as a minimum, the implementation and application of the regulations and standards in the area of air transport set out in part B of Annex II. 2. The competent authorities of the contracting parties shall recognise as valid, for the purposes of operating the air transport services provided for in this Agreement, certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency, and licenses issued or validated by the other party and still in force, provided that the requirements for the issue or validation of such certificates or licenses are at least equal to the minimum standards which may be established pursuant to the Convention. The competent authorities may, however, refuse to recognise as valid for purposes of flight above their own territory, certificates of competency and licenses granted to or validated for their own nationals by the authorities of the other party. 3. Either party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained by the other party. 4. The contracting parties shall ensure that aircraft registered in one contracting party suspected of non-compliance with international aviation safety standards established pursuant to the Convention landing at airports open to international air traffic in the territory of the other contracting party shall be subject to ramp inspections by the competent authorities of that other contracting party, on board and around the aircraft to check both the validity of the aircraft documents and those of its crew and the apparent condition of the aircraft and its equipment. 5. The competent authorities of either contracting party may take all appropriate and immediate measures whenever they have reason to believe that: (a) an aircraft, product or operation of an aircraft fails to satisfy the minimum standards established pursuant to either the Convention or the legislation specified in Part B of Annex II to this Agreement, whichever is applicable, (b) there are serious concerns that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft fails to satisfy the minimum standards established pursuant to either the Convention or the legislation specified in Part B of Annex II to this Agreement, whichever is applicable, or (c) there are serious concerns that the minimum standards established pursuant to either the Convention or the legislation specified in Part B of Annex II to this Agreement, whichever is applicable, may not be maintained or correctly applied. 6. Where the competent authorities of one Contracting Party take action under paragraph 5, they shall promptly inform the competent authorities of the other Contracting Party of taking such action, providing reasons for its action. 7. Any measure taken by one of the contracting parties under paragraph 5 of this Article shall be withdrawn as soon as the issue justifying it has been remedied. 8. If measures taken in application of paragraph 5 are not withdrawn even though the basis for taking them has ceased to exist, either party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee. ARTICLE 14 Aviation security 1. Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements set out in Annex I to this Agreement, the contracting parties shall ensure that their applicable laws, rules and procedures ensure, as a minimum, the implementation and application of the regulations and standards in the area of air transport set out in part C of Annex II. 2. The contracting parties may accept one or more of their airports being inspected by the other contracting party with regard to the security measures in force there, whilst taking fully into consideration and respecting their sovereignty. The parties shall establish the necessary mechanisms for the exchange of information on the results of such security inspections. 3. The contracting parties reaffirm their obligations to each other to provide for the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, and in particular their obligations under the Chicago Convention, the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, and the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for Purpose of Detection signed at Montreal on 1 March 1991, insofar as both contracting parties are parties to these conventions, as well as all other conventions and protocols relating to civil aviation security to which both contracting parties are subject. 4. The contracting parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation. 5. The contracting parties shall, in their dealings with each other, act in conformity with the aviation security standards and, so far as they apply to them, the recommended practices established by the ICAO and designated as Annexes to the Chicago Convention, to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the contracting parties. They shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory, act in conformity with such aviation security provisions. 6. Each contracting party shall ensure that measures are applied within its territory to protect civil aviation against acts of illicit intervention, including but not restricted to the screening of passengers and their cabin baggage, the screening of hold baggage, the screening of and security checks on persons other than passengers, including crew and the objects they transport, the inspection of and checks on the safety of freight, mail, in-flight supplies intended for the airports and checking access to airside and restricted access security areas. These measures shall be adapted to any worsening of the threat to aviation security. Each contracting party agrees that their air carriers may be required to respect the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article and other security provisions required by the other contracting party, for entrance into, departure from, or stay within the territory of the other contracting party. 7. Whilst taking fully into account and respecting the sovereignty of the other contracting party, a contracting party may adopt security measures concerning entry into its territory and emergency measures to deal with a specific security threat. These shall be communicated without delay to the other contracting party. Each contracting party shall examine favourably any request from the other party that special security measures be taken to deal with a specific threat, and the first contracting party shall take into account security measures already applied by the other party, and the latter's position on the matter. However, both parties recognise that No provision of this Article restricts the a contracting party's entitlement to refuse access to its territory to any flight which it considers to be a security threat. Except where not reasonably possible in case of emergency, each party shall inform the other party in advance of any special security measures it intends to introduce which could have a significant financial or operational impact on the air transport services provided under this Agreement. Either party may request a meeting of the Joint Committee to discuss such security measures, as provided for in Article 21 of this Agreement. 8. In the event of an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities, the contracting parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely any such incident or threat. 9. Each contracting party shall take any measures it deems practicable to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which is on the ground in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultation. 10. When a contracting party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other contracting party has departed from the aviation security provisions of this Article, that contracting party may request immediate consultations with the other contracting party. 11. Without prejudice to Article 4 (Refusal, revocation, suspension or limitation of authorisations) of this Agreement, failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request shall constitute grounds for withholding, revoking, restricting or imposing conditions on the operating authorisation of one or more air carriers of the other contracting party. 12. When required by an immediate and extraordinary threat, a contracting party may take provisional measures prior to the expiry of the fifteen (15)-day period referred to in paragraph 11 of this Article. 13. Any action taken in accordance with the paragraph 11 of this Article shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other party with the full provisions of this Article. ARTICLE 15 Air traffic management 1. Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements set out in Annex I to this Agreement, the contracting parties shall ensure that their applicable laws, rules and procedures ensure, as a minimum, the implementation and application of the regulations and standards in the area of air transport set out in part D of Annex II to this Agreement and, in areas not covered by the EU's regulatory framework, the procedures of the ICAO for air transport services, under the conditions below. 2. The contracting parties commit themselves to the highest degree of cooperation in the field of air traffic management with a view to extending the Single European Sky to Tunisia in order to enhance current safety standards and the overall efficiency of general air traffic in Europe, optimise capacities and minimise delays. To this end, Tunisia shall be involved in the Single European Sky Committee as an observer. The Joint Committee shall be responsible for monitoring and facilitating cooperation in the field of air traffic management. 3. With a view to achieving the objectives of the Single European Sky on their territories: (a) Tunisia shall take the necessary measures to bring its air navigation services and institutional and air traffic management structures into line with the Single European Sky, in particular with regard to aviation safety; (b) Tunisia, in particular, shall establish a relevant national control authority at least functionally independent from the provider(s) of air transport services; (c) the European Union shall include Tunisia in the relevant operational initiatives in the areas of air transport services, air space and interoperability which result from the Single European Sky, specifically by means of: I).cooperation with or the association of Tunisia in the functional airspace block; II).its participation in the Single European Sky network's operations, in particular the exchange of data on traffic flows; III).its alignment with the SESAR deployment plans; IV).strengthening interoperability; and (d) the contracting parties shall cooperate in the area of the EU's pattern of performance with the aim of optimising the overall effectiveness of flights, cutting costs and improving the safety, security and capacity of existing systems. This cooperation shall focus on tools to measure performance indicators and the use of tools for the management and design of air space. ARTICLE 16 Environmental protection 1. Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements set out in Annex I to this Agreement, the contracting parties shall make sure that their applicable laws, rules and procedures ensure, as a minimum, the implementation and application of the regulations and standards in the area of air transport set out in part E of Annex II. 2. The contracting parties emphasise the need to protect the environment by supporting the sustainable development of aviation. The contracting parties shall work together to identify issues associated with the impact of aviation on the environment. 3. The contracting parties recognise the importance of collaboration with a view to studying and reducing as far as possible the impact of aviation on the environment, in line with the objectives of this Agreement. 4. The contracting parties recognise the importance of combating climate change and thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions linked to aviation, at both national and international levels. The contracting parties agree to strengthen cooperation on these issues by means of, among other things, relevant multilateral agreements, notably the implementation of global market-based measures, as agreed at the 39th Assembly of the ICAO, and the use of the sustainable development mechanism created by Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for the development of international market-based measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector and any other aspect provided for in this Article 6 which is of particular relevance to international aviation-related emissions. 5. The contracting parties undertake to exchange information and maintain a regular dialogue between experts in order to strengthen their cooperation with a view to limiting the impact of aviation on the environment, including: (a) research into and the development of environmentally friendly aeronautical technologies; (b) innovation in air traffic management with a view to limiting the impact of aviation on the environment; (c) research into and the development of new sustainable aviation fuels; (d) the exchange of views concerning issues associated with the impact of aviation on the environment and reducing emissions from the aviation sector; and (e) mitigating and monitoring noise, so as to reduce the impact of aviation on the environment. 6. The contracting parties also undertake, while respecting their rights and obligations under multinational environmental agreements, to step up their financial and technological cooperation with regard to measures intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation. 7. The contracting parties recognise the need to take appropriate measures to reduce or manage the impact of aviation on the environment, where these measures are fully compatible with their rights and obligations under international law. ARTICLE 17 Air carrier liability The contracting parties confirm their obligations under international agreements ratified by the two contracting parties. ARTICLE 18 Consumer protection Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements set out in Annex I to this Agreement, the contracting parties shall make sure that their applicable laws, rules and procedures ensure, as a minimum, the implementation and application of the regulations and standards in the area of air transport set out in part F of Annex II. ARTICLE 19 Social aspects 1. Without prejudice to the transitional arrangements set out in Annex I to this Agreement, the contracting parties shall make sure that their applicable laws, rules and procedures ensure, as a minimum, the implementation and application of the regulations and standards in the area of air transport set out in part G of Annex II. 2. The contracting parties recognise the importance of examining the impact of this Agreement on labour, employment and working conditions. The contracting parties undertake to cooperate on employment issues relevant to this Agreement, in particular with regard to its impact on employment, fundamental labour rights, working conditions, social protection and social dialogue. 3. The contracting parties shall, by means of their laws, regulations and practices, promote high levels of social and employment protection in civil aviation. 4.

It foresaw that the Centre would be managing the funds for cybersecurity under the next Multi-annual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, and implement funding from both the Digital Europe Programme and the Horizon Europe Programme, as well as contributions from Member States. The proposal aimed for the Centre and the Network to help the Union and Member States take a proactive, longer-term and strategic perspective to cybersecurity industrial policy, going beyond research and development. This approach should help not only to come up with breakthrough solutions to the cybersecurity challenges that the private and public sectors are facing, but also to support effective deployment of these solutions. The Network and the Centre together were foreseen enhance our technological sovereignty through large-scale cybersecurity projects. Furthermore, the proposal aimed to allow relevant research and industrial communities and public authorities to gain access to key capacities such as testing and experimentation facilities, which are often beyond the reach of individual Member States due to insufficient financial and human resources. 3.Comments on the position of the Council The Council's position reflects the agreement reached in the trilogues. The most important changes to the Commission's proposal include: Seat: the seat of the Centre is Bucharest, as stated in a recital. Objectives and tasks: the objectives and tasks of the Centre are laid down in separate articles. A distinction is made between strategic and implementation tasks. Civilian-military synergies and dual use: no explicit reference is made to the European Defence Fund. National Coordination Centres (NCCs): a positive Commission assessment of the entities nominated by Member States is no longer a requirement for becoming an NCC. However, in order for an NCC to be eligible for direct Union financial support, a positive Commission assessment remains necessary. Strategic \"Agenda\": the Centre is adopt an \"Agenda\", i.e. \"a comprehensive and sustainable cybersecurity industrial, technology and research strategy which sets out strategic recommendations for the () sector and strategic priorities for the Competence Centre's activities ()\" Voting: all Member States have one vote in the Governing Board. The Commission has a blocking minority for all decisions directly affecting the allocation of EU funds and administration, with the exception of the Agenda. In the case of the Agenda a safeguard was added stating that the Agenda is not binding with respect to decisions to be taken on the annual work programmes. For decisions not directly affecting the allocation of EU funds and administration, the Commission has one vote. The only exception to the rule that all Member States have one vote in the Governing Board concerns the Governing Board task of adopting decisions regarding the description of Joint Actions. For such decisions, Member States and the Union hold voting rights in proportion to their relevant contribution to the joint action in question. Co-financing: the Member States' contribution to the Centre's activities is not quantified in the Regulation, and it has been given a voluntary nature. Accordingly, the text provides that as far as Horizon Europe is concerned, the Union will only contribute as much as Member States commit to contributing on an annual basis. The Commission issued the following statement on this subject: 'The Commission takes note of the agreement of the European Parliament and the Council on the co-financing by Member States. While the Commission can accept that Member States' contributions are not specified as part of the Regulation, the Commission regrets the inclusion in the political agreement of the notion of \"voluntary\" contributions from Member States to the extent that this does not demonstrate the long-term commitment of all involved parties. The success of the Centre lies in the effective contribution by Member States, without which its mission would not be accomplishable. The Commission clarifies that the Union will contribute with funding from the Horizon Europe programme only as much as Member States are ready to commit on an annual basis. Furthermore, the Commission wishes to stress that once one or more Member States commit, such a commitment will be binding.'
