  "background_info_description": "As part of the \u20ac4 billion fund to mitigate the effects of the Corona crisis, which the Austrian national government and the social partners presented on 14 March 2020, they also presented two hardship funds: one for self-employed in one person companies; and the other for family-run businesses. This was complementary to other measures (see case AT-2020-12-/229), as those two target groups would not be able to profit from the short-time working schemes.\r\r",
  "content_of_measure_description": "The support is a one-off payment and does not have to be paid back. In addition, affected owners of one person companies may also obtain funds from the 'emergency fund' (Notfallfonds). The payments cannot be accumulated though. The hardship fund for self-employed is divided in two phases:\r\r* **Phase 1**: Applications are possible until 17 April 2020. Eligible are those who can prove that they are no longer able to cover the running costs or are affected by an officially ordered ban on entry due to COVID-19 or have a drop in sales of at least 50% compared to the same month of the previous year. The amount of the funding is \u20ac500 if the net income p.a. was below \u20ac6,000 and \u20ac1,000 if it was above \u20ac6,000. The upper income threshold (above which no grant is paid) is \u20ac33,812 net in the last year for which a tax assessment is available. It essentially applies to one person enterprises (including agricultural and forestry and private accommodation rents) and freelance workers.\r* **Phase 2**: Applications start on 20 April 2020. The grant depends on the income loss and lies at maximum at \u20ac2,000 per month for up to three months. No upper income threshold applies, and small companies with less than ten employees and liberal professions are eligible in addition to the group eligible in phase 1. Negotiations with NGOs are currently ongoing.\rAll applicants (regardless of whether an application has already been submitted in phase 1) will have the same maximum total amount of funding of up to \u20ac6,000. \r\rIn general, applications for the Hardship Fund can be submitted until 31 January 2021. ",
  "use_of_measure_description": "Information from 1 April 2020: Around 100,000 applications for phase 1 were counted so far. The total funds for the hardship fund were increased from \u20ac1 to 2 billion.\r\rInformation from 20 April 2020: The first phase has been completed with 144,000 applications made. A total of \u20ac121 million. was paid out in the first phase. \r\rAs of mid-September 2020, a total of almost 195,000 people have been supported in phases one and two and around \u20ac528.7 million have been paid out. In the most recent period under review (mid-July to mid-August), an average of around \u20ac1,200 was paid out in each case.\r\rAs of mid-October 2020, around 203,000 people have applied for assistance from the Corona hardship fund since the beginning and \u20ac700 million have been spent. On average, \u20ac1,200 were paid per individual in the period between 16 September and 15 October 2020. \rAccording to a survey conducted in July and August 2020 by KMU Research Austria, 57 percent of one-person enterprises have taken advantage of government support measures in connection with the COVID-19 crisis. Of these, almost all entrepreneurs have applied for the hardship fund. Significantly fewer have also applied for tax and duty deferrals (36%), installment payments or deferrals of social security contributions (35%) and fixed cost subsidies (29%). \r\rData from March 2021 show that so far, \u20ac1.22 billion (of the total budget of \u20ac2 billion) have been paid or committed. On average, just below \u20ac1,200 were paid per person and month.",
