If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it\u2019s taught us the value of research, and just how important the work of our scientists is.  We have seen how quickly science can move, and how powerful it is.  Our aim with this challenge is to harness that energy, put our scientists and the women and men of our Defence Forces together and accelerate technologies that have potential for use across our Defence Forces.  We have almost 2,000 aircraft, land vehicles and vessels in our fleet \u2013 imagine the impact we could have by reducing their effects on the environment.\u201d</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence Simon Coveney TD, commenting on the initiative, said: \u201cIt is really encouraging to be able to launch this new innovation challenge that will support our Defence Forces. This initiative will result in new technologies that will support missions and capabilities aligned with national defence policy.  We have seen how challenge-based research can support different sectors of society and I am excited to see how it can support our Defence Forces. A key element of our recently launched Department of Defence and Defence Forces Strategy and the Defence Organisation RTI Unit is to increase our focus on Research, Innovation and Technology in support of Defence Forces capabilities and I see this as an important move towards that.\u201d </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>Professor Mark Ferguson, Director General SFI and Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government of Ireland, said: \u201cAt SFI, we consider challenge\u2010based research funding to be of high strategic importance to Ireland, enabling talented teams to address significant national and global challenges. Fostering collaboration between Government Departments and agencies such as the Defence Forces, companies, researchers and entrepreneurs is of crucial importance if we are to ensure science plays its role in the development of our society and economy.  We are delighted to launch this new collaborative challenge to enhance the Defence Forces effectiveness and reduce its carbon footprint through research.

Genio does this by helping to bring stakeholders together to navigate the pathway through the challenges of system reform. Genio are particularly interested in the scaling of citizen-centred, community-based, cost-effective innovations. They work with the public sector in Ireland and the EU, philanthropy, service providers and end-beneficiaries. Key to Genio\u2019s approach is that the intended beneficiaries are at the heart of the design to ensure reform is grounded in the real world of people\u2019s lives. Evidence resulting from studies in Ireland illustrates the benefits of person-centred approaches in terms of both quality of life, cost savings and cost avoidance. Genio applies an action research approach to informing the rollout of complex change efforts where there are strong, differing views across stakeholders about the nature of the problem and the ways in which it should be addressed. Action research uses a cyclical method to promote shared problem-solving and focuses on resolving implementation challenges in \u2018real-time\u2019 as they emerge.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>In Ireland, Genio is currently working in the areas of disability, mental health, homelessness and addiction.
