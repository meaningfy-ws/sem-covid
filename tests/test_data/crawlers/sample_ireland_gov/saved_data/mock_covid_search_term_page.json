If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it\u2019s taught us the value of research, and just how important the work of our scientists is.  We have seen how quickly science can move, and how powerful it is.  Our aim with this challenge is to harness that energy, put our scientists and the women and men of our Defence Forces together and accelerate technologies that have potential for use across our Defence Forces.

Genio does this by helping to bring stakeholders together to navigate the pathway through the challenges of system reform. Genio are particularly interested in the scaling of citizen-centred, community-based, cost-effective innovations. They work with the public sector in Ireland and the EU, philanthropy, service providers and end-beneficiaries. Key to Genio\u2019s approach is that the intended beneficiaries are at the heart of the design to ensure reform is grounded in the real world of people\u2019s lives. Evidence resulting from studies in Ireland illustrates the benefits of person-centred approaches in terms of both quality of life, cost savings and cost avoidance. Genio applies an action research approach to informing the rollout of complex change efforts where there are strong, differing views across stakeholders about the nature of the problem and the ways in which it should be addressed. Action research uses a cyclical method to promote shared problem-solving and focuses on resolving implementation challenges in \u2018real-time\u2019 as they emerge.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>In Ireland, Genio is currently working in the areas of disability, mental health, homelessness and addiction.

We look forward to hearing from our stakeholders with their views on the programme\u2019s objectives and priorities.\"</p>\n        </blockquote>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p><strong reboot-markdown-bold>ENDS</strong>\n</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-xlg\" reboot-markdown-heading>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        \n            <a name=\"notes-to-the-editor\"></a>\n        \n        <h2>\n            Notes to the Editor\n        </h2>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p><strong reboot-markdown-bold>Public Consultation on the draft Circular Economy Strategy</strong>\n</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>The public consultation on the draft Circular Economy Strategy is open until 17:30, 11 June 2021.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>Delivering a circular economy will have positive environmental, economic and social impacts and a well-designed circular policy framework can identify co-benefits, so that environmental improvements also provide economic and social opportunities, and vice versa. Across Europe, countries are adopting towards circular economy practices, and the European Union is pursuing its \u2018European Green Deal\u2019 strategy which has the circular economy at its heart. In March 2020, the EU launched its Second Circular Economy Action Plan. At the national level, Ireland is preparing its first Whole-of-Government Circular Economy Strategy in order to ensure policy coherence across the public sector and to outline Government\u2019s overall approach to the circular economy for stakeholders and the public.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>Achieving all of these objectives will be a long-term project and, once adopted, the Strategy will be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that the objectives are met.

Remanufacturing is well-established practice in several industries, including the automotive and aviation sectors.

In a short space of time, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced governments throughout the world to change the way they organise their activities to meet the needs of the public. Ireland\u2019s Public Service has responded admirably in this transformed environment, quickly developing new channels to deliver services to citizens, whilst simultaneously taking measures to mitigate the pervasive impact of the virus on our economy and society. As we plan our recovery from this unprecedented economic shock, it is imperative that we identify ways to sustain the enhanced culture of innovation that has featured prominently across our Public Service since the onset of this pandemic.\u201d</p>\n        </blockquote>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>The Public Service Innovation Strategy has identified four key priority areas to be addressed.

This will involve engaging with the citizens to understand their needs and design interventions that reflect the user\u2019s perspective, using digital solutions that are informed by the right data.</li>\n<li>Culture of Innovation \u2013 organisations in the Public Service will develop a permanent culture where staff are continuously empowered and equipped to innovate. This will involve building skillsets at all levels and developing the right supports and structures that make innovation the norm in our Public Service.</li>\n<li>Scale-Up Innovation \u2013 the Public Service will share successful innovations so that new ways of working are adopted (or adapted) through better collaboration. The Irish Public Service will look elsewhere \u2013 to other Governments abroad as well as to industry and Ireland\u2019s own vibrant start-up ecosystem \u2013 in order to foster mutually beneficial partnerships.</li>\n<li>Transformative Innovation \u2013 public servants have learnt some valuable lessons in recent months about the need to anticipate change and secure long-lasting transformation. In order to operate effectively in a fast, dynamic environment, policy-makers need to include different voices in the governance of innovation in public services, and increase experimentation with new technologies and emerging policy approaches.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>Coordination of the delivery of this Strategy will be managed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform\u2019s Reform and Innovation Division.

In conjunction with this and in view of the increasingly challenging economic climate, the Council also agreed to revise and strengthen its Corporate Objectives to better reflect the changing needs of the organisation and the wider community. Ten new corporate objectives which prioritised meeting the economic, social and environmental needs of the people of County Wexford were adopted by the Council in March 2017. Results have shown continuing improvement in the collection levels in the major revenue areas of commercial rates, rents and annuities, and housing loans as these were some of the areas prioritised. The resulting success year on year, coupled with the significant reduction in the Council\u2019s operational deficit and an increase in the Local Property Tax each year since 2017, has helped to fund and support the Council\u2019s Economic and Community Development Programme.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-xlg\" reboot-markdown-heading>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        \n            <a name=\"my-open-library-best-practice-in-accessible-services-at-offaly-libraries\"></a>\n        \n        <h3>\n            My Open Library \u2013 Best Practice in Accessible Services at Offaly Libraries\n        </h3>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>My Open Library services offer extended opening hours to library members on a self-service basis outside normal opening hours, from 8am to 10pm, seven days a week, 365 days a year.

The main objective of Government and the Public Service as a whole is to provide vital services to people when they need them most and innovation within the public service must be focussed on providing better outcomes for our citizens. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced governments around the world to pivot rapidly and change the way they organise their activities to meet the needs of the public.

More widespread events connected to health, climate change, geopolitical situations and other quickly developing issues are likely to emerge and it is crucial that we integrate strategic foresight and innovation into our planning.

The benefits of doing so will be felt by every citizen in Ireland and in the coming generations.  For example, the recently published Programme for Government is heavily dependent on having a dynamic construction industry operating at optimum levels.  In addition, the construction industry will be front and centre in driving economic recovery in the near term, the housing required to solve the ongoing crisis, and the infrastructure required to reshape Ireland up to 2040.  This requires coordination, coherence and commitment across the industry and the multiple Government agencies involved in the delivery of construction output in Ireland.

It has a fantastic positive effect on the user's quality of life and comfort when performing tasks at ground level. The Enabl-Aid has a novel rough ground/terrain stabilisation system developed by our team, and it lowers the user to the ground with a moving kneeling pad controlled by the user through easy to use controls on the handles. This project was inspired by a team member's grandmother who suffered from parkinson's but was an avid gardener.

The products are high in protein and a source of vitamin B12 which are important nutrients for all individuals especially for those following vegan diets. The company was developed based on customer problems relating to the limited range of convenient vegan food products available in supermarkets and any products which were available had a poor taste, appearance and nutritional quality.

It provides best-practice architectural advice and beautifully illustrated case studies to support and inspire homeowners in reimagining these buildings. The adaptation of derelict or vacated buildings offer distinct and unique opportunities but can be daunting, where their original qualities are masked by poor condition or previous alterations. Conserving or adapting an existing building is a complex process that requires architectural advice from the outset.
