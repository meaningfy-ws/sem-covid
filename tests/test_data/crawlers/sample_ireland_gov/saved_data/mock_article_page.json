The PorterShed\u2019s expansion with these two new GCID buildings is highly anticipated by the tech community in Galway. Innovation hubs offer much more than desk space. They provide a supportive environment, mentoring, and programmes to start and scale innovative tech businesses. The start-up journey comes with all the usual challenges of starting a business, as well as the uncertainty of launching something totally new. The PorterShed community also gives start-ups access to other founders who have been on this journey and can lend their support. I congratulate GCID and Enterprise Ireland on this achievement and look forward to my return visit when the hub opens its doors.\"</p>\n        </blockquote>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-sm\" reboot-markdown-paragraph>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <p>Mark Christal, Divisional Manager, Regions and Entrepreneurship, Enterprise Ireland said:</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 margin-bottom-xlg\" reboot-markdown-quote>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <blockquote>\n            <p>\"Supporting innovative regional start-ups is a huge focus for Enterprise Ireland and the Regional Enterprise Development Fund is an effective mechanism of supporting regional development.
