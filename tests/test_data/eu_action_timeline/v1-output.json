    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>The Commission has today extended until end of June the transparency and authorisation mechanism for COVID-19 vaccine exports. This follows persistent delays in some of the deliveries of vaccines to the EU.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice-President and Commissioner for Trade Valdis <strong>Dombrovskis</strong> said: \u201c<em>The first weeks of the application of this instrument have shown that the trade disruption feared by many did not take place. Since the measure was introduced, shipments were authorised to more than 30 countries. This confirms that even during a very critical health situation, the EU has made a considerable effort to be a reliable and responsible trading partner.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong> said: \u201c<em>We expect companies with which we have signed a contract to fulfil their obligations towards EU citizens. The EU exports very significant volumes of COVID-19 vaccines, true to our commitment to global solidarity. Yet, not all companies are honouring their agreements with the EU despite having received a down payment to enable sufficient production. We will insist that compliance is ensured and we will continue to work with companies to ramp up production in Europe as quickly as possible.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>EU number one supplier of COVID-19 vaccines to the world</strong></p>\n<p>The EU continues to be the leading provider of vaccines around the world. Six weeks into the existence of this mechanism, 249 export requests to 31 different countries* have been granted for a total of 34,090,267 doses, as they did not threaten the contractual engagements between the EU and the vaccine producers. Only one export request was not granted. The main export destinations include the United Kingdom (with approximately 9.1 million doses), Canada (3.9 million), Mexico (3.1 million), Japan (2.7 million), Saudi Arabia (1.4 million), Hong Kong (1.3 million), Singapore (1 million), United States (1 million), Chile (0.9 million) and Malaysia (0.8 million).</p>\n<p><strong>The export authorisation mechanism</strong></p>\n<p>This export authorisation mechanism only applies to exports from companies with which the EU has concluded Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs). These APAs commit the vaccine producers to deliver to EU Member States a pre-agreed number of vaccines. The mechanism provides for authorisations of exports of COVID-19 vaccines outside the EU.</p>\n<p>Initially put in place on 30 January 2021, and with a timeframe lasting until the 12 of March 2021, the new regulation extends the duration of this mechanism until the end of June 2021. The new regulation also simplifies the procedure by allowing the grouping of exports to different final recipients in the same country in one single request. It also provides clarity by identifying the customs codes for the active substances covered by the measure.</p>\n<p>This measure is targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary. It is fully consistent with the EU's international commitments under the World Trade Organization and the G20, and is in line with what the EU has proposed in the context of the WTO Trade and Health Initiative. Committed to international solidarity, the EU excluded from this mechanism vaccine supplies for humanitarian aid or those supplies destined to countries under the COVAX Facility, as well as shipments to our neighbourhood.**</p>\n<p><strong>About the EU's vaccine strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1597339415327&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0245\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs). Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that are actually purchased by Member States. The APA is therefore a de-risk investment upfront against a binding commitment from the company to pre-produce, even before it gets marketing authorisation. This should allow for a quick and steady delivery as soon as the authorisation has been granted.</p>\n<p>The Commission has so far signed APAs with six companies (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1524\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">AstraZeneca</span></a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1680\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Sanofi-GSK</span></a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1829\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Janssen Pharmaceutica NV</span></a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2081\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">BioNtech-Pfize</span></a>r, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2136\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">CureVac</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2200\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Moderna</span></a>), securing access to up to 2.6 billion doses.

Less than a year since the virus appeared for the first time in Europe, vaccination has started across all Member States. This is a remarkable achievement of European and global advanced research and vaccine development, condensing what usually takes 5-10 years in just over 10 months.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there are challenges to scale-up industrial vaccine production to keep pace. In order to boost production capacity in Europe, a much closer, more integrated and more strategic <strong>public-private cooperation</strong> with industry is needed. In this spirit, the Commission has set-up a Task Force for Industrial Scale-up of COVID-19 vaccines to detect and help respond to issues in real-time.</p>\n<p>Europe now also needs to stay ahead of the curve as new and emerging threats continue to appear in the present or on the horizon. The most immediate of these are emerging and multiplying variants already spreading and developing in Europe and across the world. Presently, authorised vaccines are considered effective against the variants we are aware of.

I'm happy to announce today an agreement with BioNTech-Pfizer, who will offer to Member States to make available a total of four million doses of vaccines before the end of March which will be supplied in addition to the planned dose deliveries. This will help Member States in their efforts to keep the spread of new variants under control. Through their targeted use where they are most needed, in particular in border regions, these doses will also help ensure or restore free movement of goods and people. These are key for the functioning of health systems and the Single Market.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The Commission is following closely the evolution of the epidemiological situation in Member States. Despite the current reduction in the number of deaths across the EU, due to vaccination of the elderly and most vulnerable people, the Commission is concerned by the development of a series of COVID-19 hotspots across the EU. This is caused, in particular, by the spread of new variants, which are more contagious. The BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine has proven highly effective against all currently known variants of the COVID-19 virus. Regions like Tyrol in Austria, Nice and Moselle in France, Bolzano in Italy and some parts of Bavaria and Saxony in Germany but also in many other Member States have seen numbers of infections and hospitalisations rise steeply over the past weeks, leading Member States to adopt stringent measures and even in certain cases to impose new border controls.</p>\n<p>In order to support Member States in their efforts to respond to these developments, the Commission has negotiated with BioNTech-Pfizer the possibility for Member States to order supplementary vaccines doses. The increase of dose deliveries in March is a result of the successful expansion of manufacturing capacities in Europe which was completed by mid-February.</p>\n<p>Four million doses in total will be made available for purchase to Member States, pro-rata to their population. All of these doses will be delivered before the end of March. These doses come on top of the schedule of deliveries currently agreed between Member States and BioNTech-Pfizer.</p></div>",

This is subject\u00a0to the adoption of the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) by the Council and the European Parliament. The EIB loan to be guaranteed by EFSD+ is subject to the approval of the EIB's Board of Directors.\u00a0These funds will complement a previous\u00a0\u20ac100 million grant and\u00a0\u20ac400 million in guarantees from the EU budget.</p>\n<p>To date, a total of 191 countries participate in the COVAX Facility, 92 of them low and middle-income economies eligible to get access to COVID-19 vaccines through Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). Most of these are in Africa. Through these contributions, the Commission and its partners will secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for all the participants in the Facility.</p>\n<p>Vaccines will be procured and delivered to countries by the UNICEF Supply Division and the PAHO's Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines. The fast arrival of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has shown that multilateralism and multi-actor partnerships work to solve the most pressing problems of our time.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-IE\">COVAX is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-IE\">The COVAX Facility aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021, including at least 1.3 billion doses for low and middle-income country. It will help to develop a diversified portfolio of vaccines, negotiated with different suppliers, and covering different scientific technologies, delivery times and prices. The COVAX Facility is a risk-sharing mechanism: it reduces the risk for manufacturers who invest without being sure about future demand, and it reduces the risk that countries would fail to secure access to a viable vaccine.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-IE\">The European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world, and to promote global health. This is why together with partners it has helped raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the\u00a0</span><span lang=\"EN-IE\"><a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coronavirus Global Response</a></span><span lang=\"EN-IE\">, the global action in support of universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0Team Europe's contribution was as follows: EU Member States (\u20ac3.1 billion), European Commission (over \u20ac1.4 billion) and EIB (almost \u20ac2 billion pledged in May and \u20ac4.9 billion pledged in June).</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-IE\">The EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need.

This brings us closer to our major objective: ensure that all Europeans have access to safe and effective vaccines as quickly as possible.

It marks another step towards our objective of providing swift access to safe and effective vaccinations to citizens in Europe and beyond over the course of this year. The contract is important not only for the short term needs of the EU, but also for our future work to limit the rapid spread of new variants.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The Moderna vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in\u00a0biology, transferring instructions from DNA to the cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions produce harmless fragments of the virus, which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce a spike protein, a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences \u2014 antibodies and T cells \u2014 against it.</p>\n<p>The Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the companies' experience in vaccine development and their production capacity to supply the whole of the EU, as well as their capacity to potentially develop a vaccine against coronavirus variants.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of <strong>Advance Purchase Agreements</strong>. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.</p>\n<p>Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.</p>\n<p>Once vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe.

As part of today's operations, Belgium has received \u20ac2 billion, Cyprus \u20ac229 million, Hungary \u20ac304 million, Latvia \u20ac72 million, Poland \u20ac4.28 billion, Slovenia \u20ac913 million, Spain \u20ac1.03 billion, Greece \u20ac728 million and Italy \u20ac4.45 billion. All nine Member States had already received financial support under SURE in 2020, under one of the first three issuances and disbursement operations that took place in 2020.</p>\n<p>These loans will assist Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help Member States cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures that they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, including for the self-employed. Today's disbursements follow the issuance of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_209\">fourth social bond <span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">under the EU SURE instrument</span></a>, which attracted a considerable interest by investors. The notable oversubscription was translated into <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/about_the_european_commission/eu_budget/sure_4th_dual_tranche_press_release_final.pdf\">favourable pricing terms</a>, which the Commission is directly passing on to the benefitting Member States.</p>\n<p>Following today's disbursements, 15 Member States have received a total of \u20ac53.5 billion under the SURE instrument. Once all SURE disbursements have been completed, Belgium will have received \u20ac7.8 billion, Cyprus \u20ac479 million, Hungary \u20ac504 million, Latvia \u20ac192 million, Poland \u20ac11.2 billion, Slovenia \u20ac1.1 billion, Spain \u20ac21.3 billion, Greece \u20ac2.7 billion and Italy \u20ac27.4 billion.</p>\n<p>An overview of the amounts disbursed so far and the different maturities of the bonds are available online <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower/investor-relations_en#eu-sure-disbursements\">here</a>. A breakdown of the \u20ac90.3 billion that have been authorised for 18 Member States so far is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/sure_en\">here</a>. Member States can still submit requests to receive financial support under SURE which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion.</p>\n<p><strong>Members of the College said: </strong></p>\n<p>President Ursula<strong> von der Leyen </strong>said: <em>\u201cUnder the SURE programme, the EU has mobilised up to \u20ac100 billion in loans for EU Member States to save jobs and keep people in work. The funds are regularly making their way to our Member States, helping them financially to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner <strong>Johannes Hahn, </strong>in charge of Budget and Administration, said: <em>\u201dFollowing the fourth successful bond issuance under SURE, we have now disbursed more than half of the funds foreseen under this instrument. The 15 Member States benefitting from the initial four disbursements are now better equipped to alleviate the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic. We will proceed with a speedy implementation of the rest of the programme in order to provide all authorised funds for the 18 Member States that have so far requested financial support under this instrument</em>\u201d.</p>\n<p>Paolo\u00a0<strong>Gentiloni</strong>,\u00a0Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201c<em>Today, the European Commission pays out a further \u20ac14 billion to support workers in nine hard-hit EU countries. The pandemic continues to weigh on our economies and while we know there is light at the end of this tunnel, we don't yet know how much longer until we reach it. That's why SURE and the European solidarity it represents are so important.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>On 26 January, the European Commission issued the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_209\">fourth social bond</a> under the EU SURE instrument and the first one for 2021, for a total value of \u20ac14 billion. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac10 billion due for repayment in June 2028 and \u20ac4 billion due for repayment in November 2050.</p>\n<p>There was high demand among investors \u2013 the bonds were over 8 and 12 times oversubscribed, respectively, which once again enabled the Commission to obtain very good pricing conditions. More concretely, the 7-year bond was priced at a negative yield of -0.497%. This means that for every \u20ac105 that Member States get, they pay back \u20ac100 when the bond matures. The 30-year bond was priced on the slightly positive territory, at 0.134%, which is an excellent result for this maturity. These are being passed on directly to the EU Member States.</p>\n<p>The bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_209\">Press release on the fourth bond issuance</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32020R0672\">SURE Regulation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/economy-finance/sure_factsheet.pdf\">Factsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_572\">Questions and answers: Commission proposes SURE</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Coronavirus response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower/eu-borrowing-activities/eu-sure-social-bond-framework_en\">Social Bond Framework</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/sure_en\">SURE website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower_en\">EU as a borrower website</a></p></div>",

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, the European Commission has granted a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for the COVID\u201119 vaccine developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the fourth COVID-19 vaccine authorised in the EU.</p>\n<p>This authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States.</p>\n<p>The President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, said: \"<em>The Janssen vaccine is the fourth authorised vaccine of the EU's portfolio and will help us enhance the vaccination campaign in the second quarter of 2021. It only requires a single dose, which takes us another step closer to achieving our collective goal of vaccinating 70% of the adult population by the end of summer.\"</em></p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said<em>: \"Our portfolio now contains four safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines that we are working tirelessly to deliver to citizens in Europe and beyond as soon as possible. A single dose vaccine can make a difference in the speed of rollout. The entry on the market of the Janssen vaccine ensures that we have access to a total of up to 1.8 billion doses of approved vaccines from different technology platforms \u2013 this is key to ensuring access to vaccinations for Europe and our international partners. We will continue to work tirelessly to support vaccine producers and ensure they deliver doses, as agreed in our contracts.\"</em></p>\n<p>The Janssen vaccine will be given in one dose to adults aged 18 years and older<span style=\"background: white;\"> for preventing COVID-19</span>. The vaccine is based on an adenovirus, a harmless virus which delivers the \u2018instructions' from the virus that causes COVID-19. This allows the body's own cells to make the protein unique to the COVID-19 virus. The person's immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by COVID-19. The adenovirus in the vaccine cannot reproduce and does not cause disease.</p>\n<p>On the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional marketing authorisation.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"background: white;\">The Commission </span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1829\"><span style=\"background: white;\">approved the contract</span></a><span style=\"background: white;\"> with Janssen on 8 October 2020. With the conditional market authorisation, Janssen will be able to deliver 200 million of their single dose COVID-19 vaccine to the EU starting in the second quarter of 2021. The contract allows Member States to purchase an additional 200 million doses. This will add to the total amount of 600 of the vaccine by BioNTech/Pfizer and the </span>460 million doses of the vaccine by Moderna, as well as the 400 million by AstraZeneca<span style=\"background: white;\">. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>A conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However, it also ensures that this COVID-19 vaccine meets the EU standards, as for all other vaccines and medicines.</p>\n<p>Once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. CMAs are foreseen in the EU legislation specifically for public health emergencies and is considered the most appropriate regulatory mechanism in this pandemic for granting access to all EU citizens and for underpinning mass vaccination campaigns.</p>\n<p>Janssen submitted an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA on 16 February 2021. Such a short time for evaluation is only possible because EMA has already reviewed some data during a <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-janssens-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2s\">rolling review</a>. During this phase, EMA assessed quality data and data from laboratory studies which looked at how well the vaccine triggers the production of antibodies and immune cells that target SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). The Agency also looked at clinical safety data on the viral vector used in the vaccine. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.</p>\n<p>The European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional marketing authorisation.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en\">Safe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1597339415327&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0245\">EU Vaccines Strategy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2390\">Questions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en\">Safe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">EU Coronavirus Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/human-use_en\">EU's legislation on medicinal products</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en\">EMA and COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2363\">Factsheet: How vaccines work</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2364\">Factsheet: Health benefits of vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2245\">Factsheet: Authorisation process</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2365\">Factsheet: Long-term safety</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2244\">EU's current portfolio</a></p></div>",

Vaccination will determine how we will live and work in 2021. In the lead up to the festive period, we are asking citizens to continue their efforts to control the pandemic. Everyone must play their part in keeping further resurgences at bay while we wait for a vaccine.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Novavax is a biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases. Their vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine which are already in phase 3 clinical trial stage.</p>\n<p>The Commission, with the support of EU Member States, has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply all EU Member States.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of <strong>Advance Purchase Agreements</strong>. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.</p>\n<p>Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.</p>\n<p>Once vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1903\">key steps</a> that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies and has adopted <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1986\">further actions </a> to reinforce preparedness and response measures across the EU and a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2254\">strategy</a> on <strong>staying safe from COVID-19 during winter </strong>offering further support to Member States in the deployment of vaccines.</p>\n<p>The Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the <a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\">Coronavirus Global Response</a>, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees to support COVAX and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response.

With this decision, all the conditions have now been fulfilled for the next multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 to be in place as of 1 January 2021. As a result, \u20ac1.074 trillion [in 2018 prices] will become available for beneficiaries of EU funding during the next seven years.</p>\n<p>President Ursula<strong> von der Leyen</strong> said: <em>\u201cWith NextGenerationEU and the new long term budget, we will be able to provide European people, businesses, regions and cities with the support they urgently need to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Today is a day of hope for Europe! We will build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe, ready for today's and tomorrow's challenges\u201d.</em></p>\n<p>European Commissioner Johannes <strong>Hahn</strong> in charge of the budget, who worked to facilitate the deal since the beginning of the mandate, said: <em>\u201cWith the final step taken today for the adoption of the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027, we can start the implementation process. The EU-Commission will spare no effort to lead Europe\u00b4s recovery from 1 January onwards. For the first time we will also have a mechanism in place which will help us to protect even better the EU taxpayers money. Now quick delivery is key! It is therefore crucial to complete the remaining steps for the launch of NextGenerationEU. The unprecedented financial firepower of MFF/NGEU with a volume of </em>\u20ac<em>1.8 trillion will provide the necessary means for a sustainable recovery and Europe's green and digital transition.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>At the same time, work towards finalising NextGenerationEU, the temporary recovery instrument created to fuel Europe's recovery from the coronavirus crisis, continues. Once adopted, the package of a total of \u20ac1.8 trillion [in 2018 prices] will be the largest package ever financed through the EU budget.</p>\n<p>With the combined firepower of the long-term budget and NextGenerationEU, the EU will support citizens, companies and regions most affected by the coronavirus crisis. The package will also help rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe, which will be greener, more digital, more resilient and better fit for the current and forthcoming challenges.</p>\n<p>The European Commission will be able to start committing the funds under the next multiannual financial framework as of 1 January 2021, following the adoption of the relevant sector-specific legislation as well as of the annual budget for 2021 by the European Parliament and the Council.</p>\n<p>For the Commission to start borrowing under NextGenerationEU, thus making the instrument operational, the ratification of the new Own Resources Decision by all Member States in line with their constitutional requirements is still needed.</p>\n<p>The Commission relies on the commitment of Member States to proceed as quickly as possible, in the interest of their citizens.</p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>The Commission put forward <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/future-europe/eu-budget-future_en\">its proposal for the EU's next long-term budget on 2 May 2018</a>. The framework proposal was immediately followed by legislative proposals for the 37 sectoral programmes (e.g. cohesion, agriculture, Erasmus, Horizon Europe, etc).

Once all SURE disbursements have been completed, Belgium will have received \u20ac7.8 billion, Hungary \u20ac504 million, Portugal \u20ac5.9 billion, Romania \u20ac4.1 billion and Slovakia \u20ac631 million.</p>\n<p>An overview of the amounts disbursed so far and the different maturities of the bonds is available online <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower/investor-relations_en#eu-sure-disbursements\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Today's disbursement follows the third issuance of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2196\">social bonds</a> <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_20_2089https:/ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_20_2089\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">under the EU SURE instrument</span></a>, which was over 13 times oversubscribed. This was translated into <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/about_the_european_commission/eu_budget/sure_3_15year_press_release_final.pdf\">favourable pricing terms</a>, meaning that Member States will receive more in loans than they will have to repay.</p>\n<p>The SURE instrument can provide up to \u20ac100 billion in financial support to all Member States. The Commission has so far proposed to make \u20ac90.3 billion in financial support available to 18 Member States. The next disbursements will take place over the course of the months ahead, following the respective bond issuances.</p>\n<p><strong>Members of the College said: </strong></p>\n<p>President Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong> said: <em>\u201cOur priority is to save people's lives, and also their livelihoods. The EU is mobilising \u20ac100 billion in loans for EU countries to finance short-time work schemes. This will provide support to our companies and help keep people employed. Today, another five Member States are receiving funding via SURE, and 15 have benefitted so far. More countries will be able to benefit soon.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>European Commissioner Johannes<strong> Hahn, </strong>in charge of Budget and Administration, said: <em>\u201cWith the third successful SURE issuance this year, we have provided 15 Member States with around \u20ac40 billion to support them with alleviating the social impact of the current COVID pandemic. This support will help businesses to keep their staff employed. The SURE programme is evidence of the EU's commitment to provide Member States quickly with the urgently needed financial means to overcome this crisis. The labelling as social bonds is a guarantee for investors that the money will be invested in social and sustainable projects, thus blending financial transactions with our political priorities\u201d.</em></p>\n<p>Paolo\u00a0<strong>Gentiloni</strong>, Commissioner for Economy, said: <em>\u201cAfter the third hugely successful issuance of SURE social bonds last week, today we distribute another \u20ac8.5 billion to help workers and companies in five Member States. The social impact of the COVID crisis would have been so much worse without European countries' strong safety nets, especially short-time work schemes. I'm proud that through SURE, the European Commission is actively supporting these schemes and similar measures for the self employed \u2013 helping millions of our citizens to navigate these hard times.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>On 24 November, the European Commission issued the third social bond under the EU SURE instrument, for a total value of \u20ac8.5 billion. The issuing consisted of one single tranche due for repayment in July 2035.</p>\n<p>The issuance has received an overwhelming response in the capital markets. It has attracted the largest-ever order book for any single tranche benchmark issuance and is the largest 15-year deal size by a supranational issuer to date. The favourable pricing terms that resulted from the high investors' interest are directly being passed on to the Member States receiving the loans.</p>\n<p>The bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label. This provides investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32020R0672\">SURE Regulation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/economy-finance/sure_factsheet.pdf\">Factsheet: SURE - Supporting Member States to help protect people in work and jobs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_572\">Questions and answers: Commission proposes SURE</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Coronavirus response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower/eu-borrowing-activities/eu-sure-social-bond-framework_en\">Social Bond Framework</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/sure_en\">SURE website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower_en\">EU as a borrower website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower/investor-relations_en#eu-sure-disbursements\">Investor relations</a></p></div>",

We continue to act in this spirit also in the case of vaccines, by taking steps to enable a quick start of vaccination campaigns to critical staff and most vulnerable groups in the region early on. Swift vaccination will be decisive in ending the pandemic and launching the socio-economic recovery of the Western Balkans.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The package will be disbursed in the form of grants that will help cover the cost of the vaccines for priority groups in the region, as well as necessary vaccination equipment. It will enable the Western Balkans to purchase a number of vaccines from the EU Advance Purchase Agreements with six manufacturers, with individual EU Member States sharing a part of their pre-allocated doses.</p>\n<p>While the EU continues to support the COVAX initiative, the world's facility to ensure fair and universal access to COVID-19 vaccines, and all Western Balkans partners have signed up to it, the delivery of vaccines under that scheme is expected to start later than the vaccination campaigns in the EU. Access to a number of doses from the EU purchase agreements will therefore enable the region to start vaccinations in parallel with EU Member States.</p>\n<p>The Commission and the European Centre for Disease Control are also assisting the region in finalising vaccination strategies in line with Commission recommendations to ensure appropriate preparation of the campaigns and seamless administration of the vaccines. The EU is also funding a project with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to help manage logistics and the delivery of the vaccines.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world. This is why it immediately responded to the WHO's call for action and has helped raise almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the\u00a0<a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\">Coronavirus Global Response</a>, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.</p>\n<p>The COVAX Facility is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. Over \u20ac870 million have been so far announced by the EU and the EU Member States for COVAX. COVAX aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021, including over 1.3 billion for development countries. It will help to develop a diversified portfolio of vaccines, negotiated with different suppliers, and covering different scientific technologies, delivery times and prices.</p>\n<p>The EU's participation in COVAX is complementary with the ongoing EU negotiations with vaccine companies launched under the EU Vaccines Strategy. The EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need. Through its Advanced Purchase Agreements, it requires manufacturers to make their production capacity available to supply all countries and calls for the free flow of vaccines and materials with no export restrictions.</p>\n<p>The Commission is also coordinating the donation of some of the doses procured by the EU Member States to various partner countries in order to guarantee their early access to COVD-19 vaccines for health care workers and vulnerable populations until vaccines through COVAX are more widely available.</p></div>",

It will make \u20ac672.5 billion in loans and grants available to support reforms and investments undertaken by Member States. It will play a crucial role in mitigating the economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic and making European economies and societies more sustainable, resilient and better prepared for the green and digital transitions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Main elements of agreement</strong></p>\n<p>The agreement, which requires final approval by the European Parliament and the Council, provides that the scope of the RRF will be structured around six pillars: green transition; digital transformation; smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and jobs; social and territorial cohesion; health and resilience; and policies for the next generation, children and youth, including education and skills.</p>\n<p>The European Union has committed to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and the European Council last week backed the Commission's proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Member States should therefore prioritise reforms and investments that support the climate transition. The agreement provides that a minimum of 37% of expenditure on investments and reforms contained in each national recovery and resilience plan should support climate objectives. In addition, all investments and reforms must respect the \u201cdo no significant harm\u201d principle, ensuring that they do not significantly harm the environment.</p>\n<p>Member States should also ensure a high level of ambition when defining reforms and investments enabling the digital transition as part of their recovery and resilience plans. A minimum of 20% of expenditure on investments and reforms contained in each national plan should support the digital transition.</p>\n<p>The recovery and resilience plans are also expected to contribute to effectively address the challenges identified in relevant country-specific recommendations under the European Semester, the framework for coordinating economic and social policies across the Union.</p>\n<p>The agreement envisages a strong role for the European Parliament in the governance of the RRF. A regular \u201crecovery and resilience dialogue\u201d will enable the Parliament to invite the Commission to discuss different items related to the Facility.</p>\n<p>A scoreboard will be established and made publicly available to provide information on progress in the implementation of the RRF and national plans.</p>\n<p>Member States will need to put in place strong measures to protect the financial interests of the Union, especially to prevent fraud, corruption and conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>It was also agreed that 13% of the total amount allocated to Member States will be made available in pre-financing upon the approval of recovery and resilience plans, to ensure that the money starts flowing as soon as possible to support the nascent economic recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Members of the College said:</strong></p>\n<p>European Commission President Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong> said: <em>\u201cWe have an unprecedented financial package - the EU Budget and our recovery plan NextGenerationEU - to power our economies. The Recovery and Resilience Facility will be right at the heart of NextGenerationEU. I welcome today's agreement as an important step towards financing the investments and reforms we need to support the economic recovery and laying the foundations for a stronger, more resilient Europe.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Valdis <strong>Dombrovskis</strong>, Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People, said: <em>\u201cThe EU's three main institutions have now reached political agreement on the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which paves the way for \u20ac672.5 billion in loans and grants. This Facility will support national reforms and investments that will support the recovery and help overhaul of EU economies, making them greener and more digital in an inclusive and socially-fair way. Member States now have the certainty they need to finalise their national plans, so they can access this unprecedented funding. We will support them every step along the way to make the most of this opportunity. Our focus now is to get funds flowing to those who need them most and get the EU's collective recovery fully underway.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Paolo <strong>Gentiloni</strong>, Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201c<em>The Recovery and Resilience Facility opens the way for Europe not only to rebuild its economy after the pandemic but to transform it. I want to thank the German Presidency and the European Parliament's negotiators for helping to bring about this robust agreement. We now have a unique chance to deliver on our environmental commitments, to accelerate the digital transition, to boost skills and address inequality. To make a success of this opportunity, the Commission and national authorities must work hand in hand to approve swiftly and then implement effectively a set of ambitious, credible national plans. As this grim year draws to a close, let's look ahead to 2021 with both optimism and determination</em>.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Next steps</h3>\n<p>The text of the Regulation will now have to be finalised at technical level. The European Parliament and the Council must then formally approve the text so that the Regulation can enter into force as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Once the Regulation is in force, Member States will be able submit their recovery and resilience plans, setting out a coherent package of reforms and investment projects.</p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>On 10 November 2020, a political agreement was reached between the European Parliament, EU Member States in the Council as well as the Commission on the next long-term EU budget and NextGenerationEU. As a next step, the legal adoption of the MFF package along with the ratification of the Own Resources Decision is now urgently needed.</p>\n<p>Once adopted, the EU's long-term budget, coupled with the NextGenerationEU initiative, which is a temporary instrument designed to drive the recovery of Europe, will be the largest stimulus package ever financed through the EU budget.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, the European Commission has granted a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for the COVID\u201119 vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, making it the first COVID-19 vaccine authorised in the EU. This authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States.</p>\n<p>The President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, said:<em> \u201cToday we add an important chapter to a European success story. We approved the first safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19. More vaccines will come soon. Doses of the vaccine approved today will be available for all EU countries, at the same time, on the same conditions. The upcoming European vaccination days will also be a great moment of unity. This is a good way to end this difficult year, and to start turning the page on this pandemic. We are all in this together.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: <em>\u201c</em><em>This is a big day for Europe. It is a day of true European solidarity in action. After\u00a0\u00a0months of \u00a0work, we are seeing our EU Vaccines Strategy bear fruit \u2013 access to safe, effective and affordable vaccines at the same time for all Member States. Today we witness what can be achieved collectively when we work together in a strong European Health Union. A Europe that cares and that supports. A Europe that leaves no stone unturned.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>BioNTech and Pfizer made a formal application for a conditional marketing authorisation on 1 December. This followed the analysis of their data in a \u2018rolling review' by EMA as from 6 October. Thanks to this rolling review, EMA managed to assess the conditional marketing authorisation application very rapidly. This procedure, specifically designed for emergency situations, ensures as swift an assessment as possible while ensuring that all requirements in terms of safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine are fully and thoroughly evaluated.</p>\n<p>On the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional market authorisation.</p>\n<p>The BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. This allows cells to manufacture harmless fragments of viral proteins that the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight subsequent, natural infection. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce fragments of the \u2018spike protein', a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells, to replicate, and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences \u2014 antibodies and T cells \u2014 against it.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"background: white;\">The Commission, the Member States and the company are now working towards the delivery of the first doses on 26 December, so that the EU vaccination days can start on 27 \u2013 28 \u2013 29 December.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background: white;\">Deliveries will continue in December and on a steady weekly basis during the following months. Distribution of the full 200 million doses is scheduled to be completed by September 2021. The Commission and the Member States are working to activate the additional 100 million doses.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>A conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However, once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks.</p>\n<p>On 1 December 2020, EMA received an application for a CMA for the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. However, and since 6 October, EMA has already been assessing data on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality and results from laboratory studies and clinical trials in the context of a <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-second-rolling-review-covid-19-vaccine\">rolling review</a>. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.</p>\n<p>The European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, informational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional market authorisation.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_2510\">Statement by President von der Leyen</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1597339415327&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0245\">EU Vaccines Strategy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2467\">Questions and Answers: COVID-19 vaccination in the EU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2390\">Questions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en\">Safe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">EU Coronavirus Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/human-use_en\">EU's legislation on medicinal products</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en\">EMA and COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2363\">Factsheet: How vaccines work</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2364\">Factsheet: Health benefits of vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2245\">Factsheet: Authorisation process</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2365\">Factsheet: Long-term safety</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2244\">EU's current portfolio</a></p></div>",

The recommendation builds on the Council <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1604080584943&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0499\">Recommendation</a> of 13 October on a coordinated approach to free movement in response to the COVID19-pandemic and several other guidance documents adopted by the Commission in the past months, in particular the Green Lanes Communication. While it is important to take swift temporary precautionary action to limit the further spread of the new strain of the virus and all non-essential travel to and from the UK should be discouraged, essential travel and transit of passengers should be facilitated. Flight and train bans should be discontinued given the need to ensure essential travel and avoid supply chain disruptions.</p>\n<p>Commissioner for Justice, Didier\u00a0<strong>Reynders</strong>, said:\u00a0<em>\u201cGiven the current uncertainties and in light of the precautionary principle, Member States should take coordinated action to discourage non-essential travel between the UK and the EU. At the same time,</em> <em>blanket travel bans should not prevent thousands of EU and UK citizens from returning to their homes. While precautions are needed to contain the spread of the new coronavirus variant, with today's Recommendation, we therefore ensure that the restrictions are coordinated and provide for the necessary exemptions for citizens and residents returning home and other essential travellers.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva <strong>Johansson</strong>, said<em>: \u201c<span style=\"background: white;\">Since March, the Commission has developed solid recommendations on internal and external border control for Member States to follow. This track record allows us to\u00a0address\u00a0the evolving situation and the new challenges that the pandemic poses. To be effective, our actions must be coordinated and today we are facilitating swift action to address the new coronavirus variant while ensuring that essential journeys can still take place.\u201d</span></em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Transport, Adina <strong>V\u0103lean</strong>, said: <em>\u201cWith today's recommendation we offer clarity to the Member States on how to keep the connectivity and ensure transport services following the discovery of the new strain of the COVID virus. Within the EU, it is crucial that transport workers are exempted from any restrictive measures, as quarantine and testing. We have to continue to maintain the supply chains intact, in line with our Green Lanes Communication.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Until the end of December, free movement rules still apply to the UK. This means that Member States should not in principle refuse the entry of persons travelling from the UK. After the end of the transition period, the UK will be subject to Council <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32020H0912\">Recommendation</a> on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction.</p>\n<p>The Commission recommends to Member States that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They should implement the principles of the October Council Recommendation on coordinating free movement restrictions. In the light of the precautionary principle, all non-essential travel to and from the UK should be discouraged until further notice.</li>\n<li>However, Union citizens and UK citizens travelling to their Member State or country of residence as well as third-country nationals that enjoy EU free movement rights should be exempted from further temporary restrictions provided that they undergo a test or quarantine.</li>\n<li>Travellers with an essential function, for instance medical staff, should be required to undergo a test (RT-PCR test or a rapid antigen test within 72 hours prior to departure), but should not be required to undergo quarantine while exercising this essential function.</li>\n<li>Transport staff, within the EU, should be exempted from any travel ban across any border and from testing and quarantine requirements when they are travelling across a border to and from a vessel, vehicle, or aircraft. Where a Member State, in the specific context of the situation between the EU and the UK and in the coming days, requires rapid antigen tests for transport workers, this should not lead to transport disruptions.</li>\n<li>Transit of passengers, especially for essential travel, should be facilitated without quarantine. A test can be required, but authorities need to inform about such requirement in advance or offer testing during the journey.</li>\n<li>Given the need to ensure essential travel and transit home as described in the recommendation, any prohibition of transport services, such as flight or train bans, should be discontinued.</li>\n<li>Cargo flows need to continue uninterrupted, in accordance with the Green Lanes and the Air Cargo Communication, not least to ensure the timely distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, for example.</li>\n<li>The public health authorities of the Member States should increase sequencing efforts and analyse virus isolates in a timely manner to swiftly identify cases of the new variant. They should also immediately identify cases involving persons who travelled to or from the UK in the past 14 days or who are close contacts of confirmed cases in order to ensure the appropriate follow up (eg. RT-PCR testing, isolation, enhanced contact tracing).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>In line with Article 126 of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, the transition period agreed by the parties will expire on 31 December 2020.</p>\n<p>As of 1 January 2021, the United Kingdom will become a third country and Member States shall start applying the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32020H0912\">Recommendation on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU</a> to persons travelling from the UK, in view of the end of the transition period. Accordingly, in principle only <strong>essential travel</strong> may take place from the United Kingdom. In order to benefit from an exemption from this general travel restriction, the <strong>Council would need to decide</strong> to add the United Kingdom to the list of third countries whose residents should not be affected by temporary external borders restriction on non-essential travel to the EU. The <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/10/22/travel-restrictions-council-reviews-the-list-of-third-countries-for-which-restrictions-should-be-lifted/\">list</a> is reviewed regularly by Member States in the Council.</p>\n<p>However, this limitation to essential travel shall not apply to Union citizens resident in the UK and UK nationals who are long-term residents in an EU Member States under the Long-term Residence Directive, independent of the purpose of travel.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>This year the Commission has played an important role in ensuring both the free movement of people and the free movement of goods within the European Union.</p>\n<p>The Commission adopted a number of guidance documents on Green Lanes, including its <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1605193628149&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0685\">Communication</a> in October upgrading the concept of Green Lanes to cover not only road but also rail, waterborne freight and air cargo, to ensure that essential supply chains continue to function and to avoid any disruption of freight and logistics in the EU in the second wave of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>On 30 June, the Council adopted a <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32020H0912\">Recommendation</a> on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction. In that Recommendation, the Council adopted a common approach with regard to the temporary restriction of non-essential travel as agreed by the Heads of State or Government of the EU on 17 March 2020 and the gradual lifting of such restriction.</p>\n<p>In September, the Commission made a <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32020H1475\">proposal</a> for a Council Recommendation on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which was adopted on 13 October.</p>\n<p>A well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on the freedom of movement of people and goods is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, safeguard the health of citizens as well as maintain free movement within the Union, under safe conditions. This is important for the millions of citizens who rely on frictionless cross-border travel every day, and crucial for our efforts to start safely re-building the economy.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/commission-recommendation-coordinated-approach-travel-and-transport-response-sars-cov-2-variant-observed-united-kingdom_en\">Recommendation on a coordinated approach to travel and transport in response to the SARS-COV-2 variant observed in the United Kingdom</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32020H1475\">Recommendation on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32020H0912\">Recommendation on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_104\">Frequently asked questions</a> on the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union</p></div>",

On 28 April, the Commission had already proposed <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_740\">a Banking Package</a> to facilitate bank lending to households and businesses throughout the EU. Today's measures aim to make it easier for capital markets to support European businesses to recover from the crisis. \u00a0The package proposes targeted changes to capital market rules, which will encourage greater investments in the economy, allow for the rapid re-capitalisation of companies and increase banks' capacity to finance the recovery.</p>\n<p>Valdis <strong>Dombrovskis</strong>, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that works for the people said: \u201c<em>We are continuing with our efforts to help EU citizens and businesses during the coronavirus crisis and the subsequent recovery. One way of doing so is to help businesses raise capital on public markets. Today's targeted amendments will make it easier for our businesses to get the funding they need and to invest in our economy. Capital markets are vital to the recovery, because public financing alone will not be enough to get our economies back on track. We will present a wider Capital Markets Union Action Plan in September</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The package contains targeted adjustments to the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/financial-markets/securities-markets/securities-prospectus_en#prospectus-regulation\">Prospectus Regulation</a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/financial-markets/securities-markets/investment-services-and-regulated-markets-markets-financial-instruments-directive-mifid_en#mifid-2-and-mifir\">MiFID II</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/financial-markets/securities-markets/securitisation_en#new-rules-for-simple-and-transparent-securitisation\">securitisation rules</a>. All of the amendments are at the heart of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/growth-and-investment/capital-markets-union_en\">Capital Markets Union</a> project aimed at better integrating national capital markets and ensuring equal access to investments and funding opportunities across the EU.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted amendments to the prospectus regime - EU Recovery Prospectus: Easy to produce \u2013 Easy to read \u2013 Easy to scrutinise</strong></p>\n<p>A prospectus is a document that companies need to disclose to their investors when they issue shares and bonds. The Commission is today proposing to create an \u201cEU Recovery Prospectus\u201d \u2013 a type of short-form prospectus \u2013 for companies that have a track record in the public market. This temporary prospectus would be easy to produce for companies, easy to read for investors, and easy to scrutinise for national competent authorities. It would cut down the length of prospectuses from hundreds of pages to just 30 pages. This will help companies to raise capital \u2013 such as shares - instead of going deeper into debt. A second set of targeted amendments to the Prospectus Regulation aims at facilitating fundraising by banks that play an essential role in financing the recovery of the real economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted amendments to the MiFID II requirements for European firms</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission is today proposing to make some targeted amendments to MiFID II requirements, in order to reduce some of the administrative burdens that experienced investors face in their business-to-business relationships. Lesser-experienced investors (such as households investing their savings for retirement) will remain just as protected as before. These amendments refer to a number of requirements that were already identified (during the MiFID/MiFIR public consultation) as being overly burdensome or hindering the development of European markets. The current crisis makes it even more important to alleviate unnecessary burdens and provide opportunities to nascent markets. The Commission therefore proposes to recalibrate requirements to ensure that there is a high level of transparency towards the client, while also ensuring the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for European firms.\u00a0In parallel, the Commission has today opened a public consultation on amendments to the MiFID II delegated directive to increase the research coverage regime for small and mid-cap issuers and for bonds. In particular, SMEs need a good level of investment research to give them enough visibility to attract new investors. \u00a0We are today also proposing to amend the MiFID rules affecting energy derivatives markets. This is intended to help the development of euro-denominated energy markets \u2013 important <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/euro-area/international-role-euro_en\">for the international role of the euro</a> \u2013 as well as allow European companies to cover their risks, while safeguarding the integrity of commodity markets, especially for agricultural products.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted amendments to securitisation rules</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission is today proposing a package of measures amending the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/securitisation-regulation-2017-2402_en\">Securitisation Regulation</a> and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/financial-supervision-and-risk-management/managing-risks-banks-and-financial-institutions/prudential-requirements_en#:~:text=EU%20rules%20on%20prudential%20requirements%20mainly%20concern%20the%20amount%20of,finance%20economic%20activity%20and%20growth.\">Capital Requirements Regulation</a>. Securitisation is a tool through which banks can bundle loans, turn them into securities, and sell them onto capital markets. The aim of these changes is to facilitate the use of securitisation in Europe's recovery by enabling banks to expand their lending and to free their balance sheets of non-performing exposures. It is helpful to let banks transfer some of the risk of SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) loans to the markets so that they can keep lending to SMEs. In particular, the Commission proposes creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised on-balance-sheet securitisation that would benefit from a prudential treatment reflecting the actual riskiness of these instruments. In addition, the Commission proposes to remove existing regulatory obstacles to the securitisation of non-performing exposures. This can help banks offload non-performing exposures that can be expected to grow because of the coronavirus crisis. Today's changes are based on extensive work and analysis carried out by the European Banking Authority in 2019 and 2020.</p>\n<h3>For more information</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/200722-proposal-capital-markets-recovery_en\">Link to today's package</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_1377\">Questions and Answers</a></p></div>",

Belonging to the European Union matters.\u201d</em> The Withdrawal Agreement provides for a transition period until at least 31 December 2020, during which the UK remains a member of the Single Market and Customs Union. For more information on the Withdrawal Agreement, see <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_104\">here</a>.

Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice, said: \"<em>It is not acceptable that European consumers are not being properly informed of their rights relating to online deliveries in 2 out of 3 web shops.

Today's report also provides an overview of recent tax reforms at EU and Member State level. It shows that there is evidence that multinational enterprises continue to engage in aggressive tax planning in order to decrease their tax burden. Each year, billions of euros in tax revenue are also lost in the EU because of international tax evasion by individuals. The report finds that taxation is more than just about raising revenue but also plays a central role in shaping a fairer society. While the EU is faring relatively well compared to other parts of the world, there is significant income and wealth inequality in our societies. The overall structure of the tax system plays a role in addressing this, as well as boosting employment. The right tax policies can also play a role in supporting the green transition. For example, in 2019, in all but two Member States, the nominal marginal tax rates on diesel for private road usage are lower than those for unleaded petrol, even though diesel has a higher carbon content and greater negative impact on ambient air quality. New elements of this year's edition include discussions on tax competition, the sustainability of tax systems in a changing world, and the design and distribution of the overall tax mix. The report also presents the main indicators used by the European Commission to analyse tax policies in the context of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/european-semester/framework/european-semester-why-and-how_en\">European Semester</a> and substantiates the tax policy priorities of the Commission's <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/european-semester/european-semester-timeline/setting-priorities_en\">Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy</a> in this field.Download the report <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/company-tax/tax-good-governance/european-semester/tax-policies-european-union-survey_en\">here</a>. <em>(For more information: Daniel Ferrie \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 86500)</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a id=\"7\"></a>Concentrations\u00a0: la Commission autorise l'acquisition du contr\u00f4le conjoint d'une entreprise commune nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9e par CMA CGM et CIMC Neocontainer</strong></p>\n<p>La Commission europ\u00e9enne a approuv\u00e9, en vertu du r\u00e8glement europ\u00e9en sur les concentrations, l'acquisition du contr\u00f4le en commun d'une entreprise commune nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9e par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s CMA CGM S.A., bas\u00e9e en France, et China International Marine Containers Neocontainer Logistics Limited (\u00ab\u00a0CIMC Neocontainer\u00a0\u00bb), bas\u00e9e en Chine.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Good afternoon to all of you,</p>\n<p>First of all, I want to express my full sympathy for those who are suffering from the Coronavirus. And I want to thank the medical staff who is treating them and doing an outstanding job not only in Europe but all over the world.</p>\n<p>As you know, the Coronavirus has brought governments and health systems throughout Europe to work at all different levels to contain this virus. And so does the Commission, with the support from our agency, the ECDC, and in very close cooperation with the WHO.</p>\n<p>You have witnessed that from the very beginning of the outbreak of the Coronavirus, the European Union has acted. We have for example activated our alert system immediately. We have an ongoing risk assessment that is being carried out in close coordination with all the Member States.</p>\n<p>I think very important is our European Health Security Committee that is coordinating all these different national measures, so that we have a very comprehensive approach to contain the virus.</p>\n<p>We have informed you on a regular basis over the last weeks about the support that the Commission provides to the national authorities, in very close cooperation with the agencies.</p>\n<p>ECDC has announced today that the risk level has risen to moderate to high for people in the European Union. In other words, the virus continues to spread.</p>\n<p>We all know that there are many, many different actions that are needed to address the Coronavirus. They are very multifaceted, they are very manifold. And since eight weeks, we are working intensively on these different work strands. The Commission has been addressing all these work strands.</p>\n<p>We have a situation that is very complex and it requires on the one side, very swift action and on the other side, a strong coordination at all the levels and all the different sectors \u2013 not only on the European level but of course on the national level. And then, a very comprehensive and coherent approach towards the topic from all 27 Member States and the European Union.</p>\n<p>This is why today we are launching the corona response team. This corona response team brings together all the different strands of action that have been in place since many, many weeks \u2013 you have witnessed their outstanding work \u2013, but also brings in place in the corona response team the new work streams, the emerging work streams.</p>\n<p>The corona response team has basically three main pillars. The first pillar is the medical field. It includes topics from prevention and procurement. There are relief measures, information and foresight. It is always in close cooperation with ECDC and our European Medicines Agency. The second big and important column is the pillar that covers mobility, from transport to travel advice and also to the Schengen-related questions. The third pillar covers the economy. It is looking in-depth at various business sectors \u2013 such as tourism or transport, trade, but of course, it is also looking at the value chains and at the broader macro-economic picture we have.</p>\n<p>To bundle this, we also have in parallel launched today a website on the corona response team where all the information we have gathered over all the weeks \u2013 and that comes on a daily basis \u2013 is collected and bundled so that there is a direct access to the very complex, wide-reaching work the corona response team is doing. There are other topics that are presented on the website and worked on in the corona response team, as for example news, press releases, calendars, social media, statistics, which are important on a daily basis from all the different questions that occur in this scenario, [as well as] the general information, like access to studies or links to others, the role and responsibilities, again, if you have different questions that have to be addressed.</p>\n<p>Allow me now to introduce the five Commissioners, who will be working together on all these different topics. It is Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, who is in charge of crisis management. It is Stella Kyriakides, who is charge of all the health issues. It is Ylva Johansson, who in charge of border-related issues. It is Adina V\u0103lean, who is in charge of mobility. And Paolo Gentiloni, who is dealing with the macroeconomic aspects.</p>\n<p>And I would like to invite the different Commissioners now to present their aspects for the day, because this is a situation, where on a daily basis we have actual topics and news we want to work on.</p></div>",

This brings the number of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/new-research-actions-coronavirus_en\">supported projects</a> up to 18 from the 17 originally announced, with a total budget of \u20ac48,5 million from Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation programme. These projects enable 140 research teams from across Europe working together to address the coronavirus pandemic. The newly selected project, called HG nCoV19 test and coordinated by an Irish company, will develop and validate a rapid molecular diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus. Mariya <strong>Gabriel</strong>, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: <em>\u201cFront-line health workers need to diagnose coronavirus more quickly and more accurately. This reduces the risk of further spread of the virus. I am happy that we can add another project to the EU-funded effort to develop rapid diagnostics.\u201d</em> The 18 selected projects are swiftly starting to work on developing rapid diagnostics, treatments and vaccines as well as understanding the behaviour of the epidemic through epidemiology and modelling. Over the past weeks, the EU has also <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_20_379\">mobilised public and private funding</a> of up to \u20ac90 million through the <a href=\"https://www.imi.europa.eu/\">Innovative Medicines Initiative</a>, and has <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_474\">offered up to \u20ac80 million</a> of financial support to the innovative company CureVac to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the coronavirus.

These values are common to all of us. We must uphold and defend them, even in these challenging times. Over the past weeks, several EU governments took emergency measures to address the health crisis caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus. [\u2026] It is of utmost importance that emergency measures are not at the expense of our fundamental principles and values as set out in the Treaties. Democracy cannot work without free and independent media. [\u2026] Now, it is more important than ever that journalists are able to do their job freely and precisely, so as to counter disinformation and to ensure that our citizens have access to crucial information.</em><em> Any emergency measures must be limited to what is necessary and strictly proportionate. They must not last indefinitely. [\u2026] The European Commission will closely monitor, in a spirit of cooperation, the application of emergency measures in all Member States. We all need to work together to master this crisis.\u201d </em>The full statement of the President is available <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_567\">online</a>.<em> (For more information: Eric Mamer \u2013 Tel.: +32 2 299 4073; Dana Spinant \u2013 Tel.: +32 2 299 0150; Christian Wigand \u2013 Tel.: +32 2 296 22 53)</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a id=\"3\"></a>Libya: EU launches EUNAVFOR MED Operation IRINI</strong></p>\n<p>Today, the EU has launched the Common Security and Defence Policy operation EUNAVFOR MED IRINI. Named after the Greek Goddess of Peace, Operation IRINI is the result of the commitment that EU leaders took at the Berlin Conference to ensure urgent and concrete actions to contribute to peace and stability in Libya. For Libya to return to stability, the European Union needs to do its share to help the Libyans to create the conditions for a lasting ceasefire. To do this, Operation IRINI will deploy aerial, naval and satellite assets to ensure an active implementation of the UN arms embargo off the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean, together with some other tasks. To mark the launch of the Operation, the High Representative/Vice-President <strong>Borrell</strong> delivered a <a href=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/ebs/both/20200331\">press statement</a> today. High Representative Josep <strong>Borrell</strong> said: \u201c<em>Diplomacy cannot succeed unless it is backed by action. The UN arms embargo on Libya needs to be effectively enforced. This is essential for a permanent ceasefire. And with this operation the EU will play its part.

The Commission recommends using the set up <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_510\">green lanes</a> and replacing paper procedures for waste shipments by electronic exchange to avoid contact as much as possible and speed up the border crossing. Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus\u00a0<strong>Sinkevi\u010dius</strong>, said: <em>\u201cIn these difficult times, our companies dealing with waste continue providing an essential service to our society. The Commission works with the Member States on keeping the green lanes for waste open so that waste can be shipped without delay to become the resource for another industry or to get its most appropriate treatment in the EU. This is good for health and environment protection, and for the circular economy as well.\u201d</em> Based on identified best practices, and in line with the legal framework in place, the document provides guidance to the competent authorities in the Member States, economic operators and all relevant stakeholders with a view to prevent and reduce possible obstacles to cross-border movements of waste within the EU. Reducing obstacles to waste shipments is important for maintaining a high level of protection of public health and the environment. Intra-EU shipments of waste are a key link in the whole supply chain from the collection to the final treatment of waste and its use as a resource. The Commission is committed to advancing towards the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_420\">circular economy</a> and continues working for it also during the difficult times of the coronavirus outbreak.

In addition to strengthening Europe's knowledge base, the new research projects are expected to lead to the creation of some 1,800 new jobs for post-doctoral fellows, PhD students and other research staff. Mariya\u00a0<strong>Gabriel</strong>, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \u201c<em>Europe's future depends on science and research. The crisis we face today reminds us how important it is to listen to scientific advice, and to allow the research community to help us prepare for the challenges of the future. By supporting frontier research, the EU enables our brightest scientists to push the frontiers of knowledge for the long-term benefit of all. We don't know from where the next scientific breakthroughs may come, how they could be inspired, and what challenges lie ahead of us. That is why we have the European Research Council as a vital component of the EU's Horizon 2020 programme. Congratulations to all the winners of this latest call for Advanced Grants. We are counting on you!</em>\u201d The new grantees will work on various challenging areas spanning all domains of research in life sciences (e.g., viruses, immunity, cancer research, crop plan protection), physical sciences and engineering (e.g., quantum computing, photonics, climate science), and social sciences and humanities (e.g., violence against women, historical epidemics). They will carry out their projects at universities and research centres across 20 EU Member States and associated countries.

Therefore, the Commission is launching today an online public consultation on the increase of the EU's 2030 climate target and on the actions and policies necessary to achieve deeper greenhouse gas emission cuts. As part of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">European Green Deal</a>, which is Europe's growth strategy, the Commission will put forward a comprehensive and impact assessed plan to increase the EU's 2030 climate target to at least -50% and towards -55%, compared to 1990 emission levels. Once agreed, the Commission will then propose to include the new target in the recently tabled <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/eu-climate-action/law_en\">European Climate Law</a>. The new 2030 target will also shape the Commission's assessment of all relevant sectorial legislation by summer 2021, including legislation on energy efficiency, renewable energy, effort sharing and the EU emission trading system. Revising the current 2030 target upwards will put the EU on a more gradual pathway to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2050_en\">climate-neutrality by 2050</a>.

The scheme was approved under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/what_is_new/sa_covid19_temporary-framework.pdf\">State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak</a>\u00a0adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020. The support, in the form of repayable advances, will be accessible to companies that experience or expect to experience a decline in turnover of at least 15% compared to their revenue before the coronavirus outbreak in Ireland. The scheme applies to undertakings in Ireland employing 10 or more full time employees in certain manufacturing sectors and/or internationally traded sectors, with a turnover of less than \u20ac500 million per year. The estimated budget of the scheme amounts to \u20ac200 million. The Commission concluded that the Irish measure will contribute to managing the economic impact of the coronavirus in Ireland.

It will also be available to the sub-suppliers of these companies if they are SMEs themselves. The guarantees will support lending to those SMEs, but will not take the form of export aid contingent on export activities.

During the last school year (2018/2019), this EU scheme ensured that more than 20 million children across the EU received milk, fruit and vegetables at school, complemented by educational measures about agriculture and a balanced diet.Agriculture Commissioner, Janusz <strong>Wojciechowski</strong>, said: \u201d<em>In the current context, it is even more important for children across the European Union to know and understand where our food comes from. We can be proud of the nutritious, safe and high quality food that our farmers produce. Thanks to the EU school scheme, children can learn about nutrition and agriculture, while also adopting healthy eating habits. We have taken measures to make sure that this year's scheme takes into account that schools had to close across Europe because of the coronavirus pandemic. But it is important that we continue to look ahead, prepare the future and send a strong sign that life will carry on once we have collectively turned this page.\u201d </em>This year's implementation of the current school scheme (for school year 2019/2020) is affected by the closure of schools across the EU due to the current coronavirus pandemic. The European Commission has clarified that the ongoing crisis can be recognised as a \u201cforce majeure\u201d reason. This allows Member States who recognise it as a case of \u201cforce majeure\u201d to reimburse suppliers for perishable goods (fruit, vegetables and dairy products) that were meant to be distributed to schools participating in the scheme. Products may also be donated to hospitals, charity organisations and food banks or similar, to reach those in need.

The aid takes the form of a \u20ac6 million direct grant to the logistic company Treeden Group Sp.z o.o. The aid will contribute to the costs of construction of a transhipment terminal equipped with facilities in the Wola Baranowska station, in Poland, along the broad gauge line No. 65 to Ukraine and to the regional intergovernmental organization \u201cCommonwealth of Independent States\u201d (CIS). This terminal will allow a shift between different modes of transport and storage of bulk materials and containers. The Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules. The Commission took into consideration the suboptimal situation of the Podkarpackie Province with regard to intermodal transport and the unique character in Europe of the broad gauge track 65 as an important cargo handling line connecting the Polish with the Ukrainian border. The Commission found that the aid measure promotes the shift of freight transport from road to rail. The measure is also beneficial for the environment and for mobility as it supports rail transport, which is less polluting than road transport, while also decreasing road congestion. In particular, the Commission found that the support measure is necessary, as otherwise market operators would not have sufficient incentives to carry out investments into such infrastructure. On this basis, the Commission concluded that the individual aid measure is\u00a0 compatible with EU State aid rules, in particular <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E093\">Article 93</a> of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union regarding transport coordination.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>COVID-19 is a severe public health emergency for our citizens, societies and economies with infections in all Member States. It is also a major economic shock to the EU. The Commission therefore presents today an immediate response to mitigate the socio-economic impact of \u00a0the COVID-19 outbreak, centred on a European coordinated response.</p>\n<p>The Commission will use all the instruments at its disposal to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic, in particular:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure the necessary supplies to our health systems by preserving the integrity of the Single Market and of production and distribution of value chains;</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To support people so that income and jobs are not affected disproportionally and to avoid permanent effect of this crisis;</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To support firms and ensure that the liquidity of our financial sector can continue to support the economy</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And to allow Member States to act decisively in a coordinated way, through using the full flexibility of our State Aid and Stability and Growth Pact Frameworks.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, said: \u201c<em>The Coronavirus pandemic is testing us all. This is not only an unprecedented challenge for our healthcare systems, but also a major shock for our economies. The important economic package announced today deal with the situation of today. We stand ready to do more as the situation evolves. We will do whatever is necessary to support the Europeans and the European economy.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>State aid Framework Flexibility</strong></p>\n<p>The main fiscal response to the Coronavirus will come from Member States' national budgets. EU State aid rules enable Member States to take swift and effective action to support citizens and companies, in particular SMEs, facing economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>\n<p>Member States can design ample support measures in line with existing EU rules. First, they can decide to take measures, such as wage subsidies, suspension of payments of corporate and value added taxes or social contributions. In addition, Member States can grant financial support directly to consumers, for example for cancelled services or tickets that are not reimbursed by the operators concerned. Also, EU State aid rules enable Member States to help companies cope with liquidity shortages and needing urgent rescue aid. Article 107(2)(b) TFEU enables Member States to compensate companies for the damage directly caused by exceptional occurrences, including measures in sectors such as aviation and tourism.</p>\n<p>Currently, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy is of a nature and scale that allows the use of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU. This enables the Commission to approve additional national support measures to remedy a serious disturbance to the economy of a Member State.</p>\n<p>The Commission's assessment for the use of Article 107(3)b for other Member States will take a similar approach. The Commission is preparing a special legal framework under Article 107(3)(b) TFEU to adopt in case of need.</p>\n<p>The Commission stands ready to work with all Member States to ensure that possible national support measures to tackle the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus can be put in place in a timely manner.</p>\n<p><strong>European Fiscal Framework Flexibility</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission will propose to the Council to apply the full flexibility provided for in the EU fiscal framework so that they can implement the measures needed to contain the coronavirus outbreak and mitigate its negative socio-economic effects.</p>\n<p>First, the Commission considers that the COVID-19 pandemic qualifies as an \u201cunusual events outside the control of government\u201d. This allows accommodating exceptional spending to contain the COVID-19 outbreak such as health care expenditure and targeted relief measures for firms and workers.</p>\n<p>Second, the Commission will recommend adjusting the fiscal efforts required from Member States in case of negative growth or large drops in activity.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Commission stands ready to propose to the Council to activate the general escape clause to accommodate a more general fiscal policy support. This clause would \u2013 in cooperation with the Council \u2013 suspend the fiscal adjustment recommended by the Council in case of a severe economic downturn in the euro area or the EU as a whole.</p>\n<p><strong>Ensuring solidarity in the Single Market</strong></p>\n<p>Only with solidarity and Europe-wide coordinated solution, we will be able to effectively manage this public health emergency. Solidarity is key in this crisis, in particular to ensure that essential goods, necessary to mitigate the health risks of the outbreak, can reach all those in need. It is essential to act together to secure production, stocking, availability and rational use of medical protective equipment and medicines in the EU, openly and transparently, rather than taking unilateral measures that restrict the free movement of essential healthcare goods.</p>\n<p>The Commission is therefore taking all necessary steps to that end including by providing guidance for Member States on how to put in place adequate control mechanisms to ensure security of supply, and by launching an accelerated joint procurement procedure for these goods and issuing a recommendation on non CE-marked protective equipment.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 outbreak is having a major impact on our transport systems, given the close interlink of European supply chains, supported by an extensive network of freight services on land, at sea, and airborne. The Commission is working with Member States to ensure the flow of essential goods across land borders. The international and European aviation industry has been particularly hit. As announced by President von der Leyen on 10 March, to help ease the economic and ecological impact of the outbreak, the Commission is proposing today targeted legislation to temporarily alleviate airlines from the \u201cuse-it-or-lose-it\u201d rule \u2013 whereby air carriers must use at least 80% of their airports slots within a given period in order to keep them within the corresponding period of the next year.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Commission is liaising with Member States, international authorities and key EU professional associations to monitor the impact of the crisis on the tourism sector and coordinate support measures.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobilising the EU budget</strong></p>\n<p>To bring immediate relief to hard-hit SMEs, the EU budget will deploy its existing instruments to support these companies with liquidity, complementing measures taken at national level. In the coming weeks, EUR1 billion will be redirected from the EU budget as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund to incentivise banks to provide liquidity to SMEs and midcaps. This will help at least 100,000 European SMEs and small mid-caps with about EUR 8 billion of financing. We will also provide credit holidays to the existing debtors that are negatively affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Alleviating the impact on employment</strong></p>\n<p>We need to protect workers from unemployment and loss of income to avoid permanent effect. The Commission stands ready to support Member States in this, promoting, in particular short-time work schemes, upskilling and reskilling programmes that have proven effective in the past.</p>\n<p>The Commission will furthermore accelerate the preparation of the legislative proposal for a European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme aiming at supporting Member State policies that preserve jobs and skills.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative will facilitate the deployment of the European Social Fund \u2013 a fund geared towards supporting workers and healthcare.</p>\n<p>The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund could also be mobilised to support dismissed workers and those self-employed under the conditions of the current and future Regulation. Up to EUR 179 million is available in 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative</strong></p>\n<p>Under this new initiative, the Commission proposes to direct EUR 37 billion under Cohesion policy to the fight against the Coronavirus crisis. To this effect, the Commission proposes to relinquish this year its obligation to request Member States to refund unspent pre-financing for the structural funds. This amounts to about EUR 8 billion from the EU budget, which Member States will be able to use to supplement EUR 29 billion of structural funding across the EU. This will effectively increase the amount of investment in 2020 and help to front-load the use of the as yet unallocated EUR 28\u00a0billion of cohesion policy funding within the 2014-2020 cohesion policy programmes. The Commission calls upon the European Parliament and the Council to swiftly approve this proposal, so that it can be adopted within the next two weeks.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Commission is proposing to extend the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund by also including a public health crisis within its scope, in view of mobilising it if needed for the hardest hit Member States. Up to EUR 800 million is available in 2020.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_458\">MEMO: European Coordinated Response on Coronavirus \u2013 Questions and Answers</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-coronavirus-response_en\">Factsheet: EU Coronavirus Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-economic-aspects-covid-19-crisis_en\">Communication on the economic aspects of the COVID-19 crisis</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/annexes-communication-economic-aspects-covid-19-crisis_en\">Annex to the Communication on the economic aspects of the COVID-19 crisis</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/proposal-regulation-covid-19-response-investment-initiative_en\">Proposal for a Regulation on COVID-19 Response Investment Initiative</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/proposal-regulation-airport-slots_en\">Proposal for a Regulation on airport slots</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/regulation-coronavirus-financial-assistance-accession-countries-march-2020_en.pdf\">Proposal for a Regulation to provide financial assistance to Member States and countries negotiating their accession to the Union seriously affected by a major public health emergency</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Coronavirus website</a></p>\n<p>*Updated 13-03-2020,\u00a017:22</p></div>",

It is therefore essential that we act decisively and collectively,</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> <strong>to contain the spread of the virus and help patients, and to counter the economic fallout</strong>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After the videoconference, the President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, said: </span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u201c<em>Let me be very clear: The Commission is working flat out on both fronts.</em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The European Commission will, in a <strong>daily phone conference</strong> with the Health Ministers and the Ministers of Internal Affairs, coordinate the necessary measures. </span></em></li>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Secondly, the Commission will assemble a <strong>team of epidemiologists and virologists</strong> from different Member States to give us guidelines on the European level. </span></em></li>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The European Commission is now taking stock of the available <strong>protective equipment</strong> and <strong>respiratory devices</strong> as well as their production and distribution capacity. Those are crucial for the entire health sector.</span></em></li>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">On <strong>research and development</strong>, we will reinforce the European initiative to fund targeted research on the Coronavirus.</span></em></li>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We have mobilised <strong>\u20ac140 million</strong> of public and private funding for promising research on vaccines, diagnosis and treatment.</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">On the <strong>economic front</strong>:</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">First and foremost, we must act at the macro-economic level. We will use all the tools at our disposal to make sure the European economy weathers this storm. This requires coordination between Member States, the Commission and the ECB. I am comforted that leaders have called for such a coordinated strategy.</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Commission will play its full part with no delay. I am working on the following measures to support Member States in their efforts:</span></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We will make sure that <strong>state aid</strong> can flow to companies that need it;</span></em></li>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Secondly, we will make full use of the <strong>flexibility</strong> which exists in the Stability and Growth Pact;</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I will come with concrete ideas before the Eurogroup on Monday. So on both these fronts, we will clarify the rules of the game for Member States very quickly.</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Finally, I will bring forward a \u201c<strong>Corona Response Investment Initiative</strong>\u201d directed at</span></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">the health care systems,</span></em></li>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">SMEs,</span></em></li>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">labour markets</span></em></li>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">and other vulnerable parts of our economies. </span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The investment will be sizable and reach <strong>\u20ac25 billion</strong> quickly.

Its vaccine technology is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that stimulate the immune system. Preliminary studies have shown that the technology holds a promise for rapid response to COVID-19. If proven, millions of vaccine doses could potentially be produced at low costs in existing CureVac production facilities. CureVac has already started its COVID-19 vaccine development program and estimates to launch clinical testing by June 2020.</p>\n<p>The Commission recognised CureVac's potential to bring life-saving vaccines to people across the planet in safe and affordable ways already in 2014 when CureVac <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_14_229\">received the first ever EU innovation inducement prize</a> of \u20ac2 million, funded by the EU's research and innovation programme, FP7.

Together with many other support measures that can be used by Member States under the existing State aid rules, the Temporary Framework enables Member States to ensure that sufficient liquidity remains available to businesses of all types and to preserve the continuity of economic activity during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President Margrethe<strong> Vestager</strong>, in charge of competition policy, said: \u201c<em>The economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is severe. We need to act fast to manage the impact as much as we can. And we need to act in a coordinated manner.</em> <em>This new Temporary Framework enables Member States </em><em>to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy at this difficult time</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, based on Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, recognises that the entire EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. To remedy that, the Temporary Framework provides for five types of aid:</p>\n<p>(i)\u00a0 <strong>Direct grants, selective tax advantages and advance payments</strong>: Member States will be able to set up schemes to grant up to \u20ac800,000 to a company to address its urgent liquidity needs.</p>\n<p>(ii)\u00a0 <strong>State guarantees for loans taken by companies from banks</strong>: Member States will be able to provide State guarantees to ensure banks keep providing loans to the customers who need them.</p>\n<p>(iii) <strong>Subsidised public loans to companies</strong>: Member States will be able to grant loans with favourable interest rates to companies. These loans can help businesses cover immediate working capital and investment needs.</p>\n<p>(iv)<strong> Safeguards for banks that channel State aid to the real economy</strong>: Some Member States plan to build on banks' existing lending capacities, and use them as a channel for support to businesses \u2013 in particular to small and medium-sized companies. The Framework makes clear that such aid is considered as direct aid to the banks' customers, not to the banks themselves, and gives guidance on how to ensure minimal distortion of competition between banks.</p>\n<p>(v) <strong>Short-term export credit insurance</strong>: The Framework introduces additional flexibility on how to demonstrate that certain countries are not-marketable risks, thereby enabling short-term export credit insurance to be provided by the State where needed.</p>\n<p>Given the limited size of the EU budget, the main response will come from Member States' national budgets. The Temporary Framework will help target support to the economy, while limiting negative consequences to the level playing field in the Single Market.</p>\n<p>The Temporary Framework therefore includes a number of safeguards. For example, It links the subsidised loans or guarantees to businesses to the scale of their economic activity, by reference to their wage bill, turnover, or liquidity needs, and to the use of the public support for working or investment capital. The aid should therefore help businesses to weather the downturn and to prepare a sustainable recovery.</p>\n<p>The Temporary Framework complements the many other possibilities already available to Member States to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, in line with EU State aid rules. On 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_459\">Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak</a> setting out these possibilities. For example, Member States can make generally applicable changes in favour of businesses (e.g. deferring taxes, or subsidising short-time work across all sectors), which fall outside State Aid rules. They can also grant compensation to companies for damage suffered due to and directly caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. This can be useful to support particularly impacted sectors, such as transport, tourism, hospitality and retail.</p>\n<p>The Framework will be in place until the end of December 2020. With a view to ensuring legal certainty, the Commission will assess before that date if it needs to be extended.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>State aid rules enable Member States to take swift and effective action to support citizens and companies, in particular SMEs, facing economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>\n<p>The Temporary Framework adopted today complements the ample possibilities for Member States to design measures in line with existing EU State aid rules, as set out in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_459\">Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak</a> of 13 March 2020. In particular, they can adopt measures that fall outside the scope of State aid control, such as national funds granted to health services or other public services to tackle the Covid-19. Member States can also immediately act through public support measures that are available to all companies such as wage subsidies, suspension of payments of corporate and value added taxes or social contributions. In addition, Member States can grant financial support directly to consumers, for example for cancelled services or tickets that are not reimbursed by the operators concerned.</p>\n<p>In addition, EU State aid rules enable Member States to help companies cope with liquidity shortages and needing urgent rescue aid. Article 107(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enables Member States to compensate companies for the damage directly caused by exceptional occurrences, such as those caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, including measures in sectors such as aviation and tourism.</p>\n<p>The Commission had adopted a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/temp_framework_en.pdf\">Temporary Framework in 2008</a>, in response to the global financial crisis.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/what_is_new/sa_covid19_temporary-framework.pdf\">Communication from the Commission - Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>#coronavirus</p></div>",

The aim is to protect citizens' health, ensure the right treatment of people who do have to travel, and make sure essential goods and services remain available. Commissioners Kyriakides and Johansson have presented the guidelines to EU ministers of Health and of Home Affairs at their first joint video meeting starting at 11am this morning. \u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">President <strong>von der Leyen</strong> said: <em>\u201cOur measures to contain the\u00a0Coronavirus outbreak will be effective only if we coordinate on the European level. We have to take exceptional measures to protect the health of our citizens. But let's make sure goods and essential services continue to flow in our internal market. This is the only way to prevent shortages of medical equipment or food. It's not only an economic issue: our single market is a key instrument of European solidarity. I am in discussion with all Member States so that we confront this challenge together, as a Union.\u201d</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">The\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/20200316_covid-19-guidelines-for-border-management.pdf\">guidelines</a> set out principles for an integrated approach to an effective border management to protect health while preserving the integrity of the internal market.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Sous-titre1\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Protecting people's health</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\">People identified as at risk of spreading\u00a0COVID-19 should have access to <strong>appropriate health care,</strong> either in the country of arrival or in the country of departure, and this should be coordinated between the two.</p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\">It is possible to submit everyone entering the national territory to health checks without formal introduction of <strong>internal border controls</strong>. The difference between normal health checks and border controls is the possibility to deny entry to individual persons. People who are sick should not be denied entry but given access to healthcare.</p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\">Member States may reintroduce internal border controls for reasons of public policy, which, in extremely critical situations, may include public health. Such border controls should be organised to prevent the emergence of large gatherings (e.g. queues), which risk increasing the spread of the virus. Member States should coordinate to carry out health screening on one side of the border only.</p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\">All border controls should be applied in a proportionate manner and with due regard to people's health. <span lang=\"EN-IE\">Member States must always admit their own citizens and residents, and should facilitate transit of other EU citizens and residents that are returning home. However, they can take measures such as requiring a period of self-isolation, if they impose the same requirements on their own nationals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\">Member States should facilitate the crossing of frontier workers, in particular but not only those working in the health care and food sector, and other essential services (e.g. child care, elderly care, critical staff for utilities).</p>\n<p class=\"Sous-titre1\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Ensuring the flow of essential goods and services</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\">Free circulation of goods is crucial to maintain availability of goods. This is particularly crucial for <strong>essential goods</strong> such as food supplies including livestock, vital medical and protective equipment and supplies. More generally, control measures should not cause serious disruption of supply chains, essential services of general interest and of national economies and the EU economy as a whole. Member States should designate priority lanes for freight transport (e.g. via \u2018green lanes').</p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\">In the same vein, <strong>safe movement for transport workers</strong>, including truck and train drivers, pilots and aircrew is a key factor to ensure adequate movement of goods and essential staff.</p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><strong>No additional certifications</strong> should be imposed on goods legally circulating within the EU single market. According to the European Food Safety Authority, there is no evidence that food is a source or a transmission source of COVID-19.</p>\n<p class=\"Sous-titre1\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">For More Information </span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/20200316_covid-19-guidelines-for-border-management.pdf\">Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>#coronavirus</p>\n</div></div>",

Our guidance document is intended to protect the EU's supply chains in these difficult circumstances, and to make sure both goods and transport workers are able to travel to wherever they are needed \u2013 without delay. A collective and coordinated approach to cross-border transport is more important today than ever before. The green lanes are also specifically designed to protect transport workers at the frontline of this crisis.

Checks and screening should be carried out without drivers having to leave their vehicles, and drivers themselves should undergo only minimal checks. Drivers of freight vehicles should not be asked to produce any document other than their identification and driving license and if necessary a letter from the employer. The electronic submission/display of documents should be accepted. </span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">No freight vehicle or driver should face discrimination, irrespective of origin and destination, the driver's nationality or the vehicle's country of registration. </span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In light of the current situation, Member States are also urged to temporarily suspend all road access restrictions currently in place in their territory, such as weekend, night and sectoral bans. </span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Commission encourages Member States to set up safe passage transit corridors to allow private drivers and their passengers, such as health and transport workers, as well as EU citizens being repatriated, regardless of their nationality, to directly pass with priority through the country in each necessary direction along the TEN-T Network. This should be done while staying strictly on the designated route and to take the necessary minimum rest breaks. Member States should ensure that they have at least one airport functional for repatriation and international relief flights.</span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><strong>Enhanced cooperation among EU Member States and beyond</strong></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Following the video-conference between EU Transport Ministers on 18 March, the Commission set up a network of national contact points and a </span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transport/coronavirus-response_en\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">platform</span></a><span lang=\"EN-US\"> to provide information </span><span class=\"Hyperlink1\">on national transport measures taken by Member States in response to the coronavirus. The national contact points should support the effective functioning of the green lane border crossing points. Neighbouring non-EU countries are invited to work closely with this network to ensure the flow of goods in all directions. </span></p>\n<p class=\"Sous-titre1\"><strong>Application of rules for transport workers</strong></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">To keep transport moving, the Commission recommends that Member States take action to ensure the free movement of all workers involved in international transport, whatever the transport mode. In particular, rules such as travel restrictions, and mandatory quarantine of transport workers not displaying symptoms, should be waived. </span><span class=\"Hyperlink1\">For example, Member States should not require that transport workers carry a doctor's certificate to prove their good health. To ensure the safety of transport workers, enhanced hygiene and operational measures are also needed in airports, ports, railway stations and other land transport hubs. Today's note from the Commission includes a full list of recommendations to protect drivers from the coronavirus (Annex 2).\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span class=\"Hyperlink1\">Internationally recognised certificates of professional competence should be considered sufficient to prove that a worker is active in international transport. In the absence of such certificates (not all international drivers have one), a letter signed by the employer (Annex 3) should be accepted. </span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span class=\"Hyperlink1\">All of these principles should also apply to third country nationals if they are essential to ensuring that cargo moves freely within and into the EU.</span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sous-titre1\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The coronavirus pandemic is having a major disruptive impact on European transport and mobility. The European supply chain is maintained through an extensive network of freight transport services, including all modes of transport. Continued and uninterrupted land, waterborne and air cargo services are of crucial importance for the functioning of the EU's internal market and its effective response to the current public health crisis.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"Sous-titre1\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">More Information </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/legislation/2020-03-23-communication-green-lanes_en.pdf\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">European Commission Communication on the implementation of the Green Lanes of the Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_468\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">European Commission's response to the Coronavirus</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transport/coronavirus-response_en\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Overview of national measures by country</span></a></p></div>",

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>In the context of the Coronavirus crisis, the Commission is working with industry and Member States to maximise the availability of masks, gloves, gowns and other medical supplies. Efforts include increasing production by existing manufacturers, facilitating imports and activating alternative ways of producing equipment.</p>\n<p>Upon the urgent request of the Commission, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), in collaboration with all their members, have agreed to immediately make available a number of European standards for certain medical devices and personal protective equipment. This action will help both EU and third-country companies willing to manufacture these items to swiftly start production and place products on the internal market more easily while ensuring a high degree of safety.</p>\n<p>Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry <strong>Breton </strong>said: <em>\u201cWe need to act collectively with urgency, solidarity, and audacity. I am encouraging manufacturers to increase and diversify production, building on positive examples such as textile and shoe manufacturers starting to produce masks and gowns. I will do everything possible to support their efforts. I am pleased to announce that following contacts with the Commission, CEN/CENELEC has agreed to make freely available the standards needed for such companies to be able to produce masks and other protective equipment.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Today's agreement has immediate effect. The 11 standards developed by CEN and potentially 3 additional ones developed jointly with ISO that are made available cover common filtering masks, medical gloves and protective clothing.</p>\n<p>This initiative complements the Commission\u00a0<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1584654491688&amp;uri=CELEX:32020H0403\">Recommendation</a> on the conformity assessment and market surveillance procedures, which provides guidance to national bodies on allowing non CE-marked personal protection equipment\u00a0that comply with the necessary health and safety standards to enter the EU market within the context of the Coronavirus.</p>\n<p><strong>How the free access to these standards helps increasing production</strong></p>\n<p>Providing free access to the national adoptions of these European standards helps both EU and third-country companies which are reconverting their production lines to manufacture quickly these critical items for preventing the coronavirus pandemic. The use of the standards will enable companies that use them to access the market for such fundamental medical and protection equipment quicker and to provide those in need with such medical equipment.</p>\n<p>Normally, standards must be purchased and used in line with the intellectual property right rules, as the copyright of the standards lies with the organisations, which have developed the standards. The derogation from this business model is a strong European response, based on a sense of social responsibility and solidarity, to address the shortage problem of protective equipment deriving from the Covid-19 epidemics.</p>\n<p>The standards are available for free download from the <a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=CENWEB:5:::NO:::\">websites of CEN national members.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>European standards are an essential pillar of a fully functioning internal market. They reduce costs, promote innovation, ensure interoperability between different devices and services, and help companies to access markets.</p>\n<p>To support EU product legislation, the Commission can request the development of European harmonised standards to facilitate compliance by manufacturers of the relevant requirements. Once agreed and referenced in the Official Journal of the European Union, these harmonised standards become part of EU law and allow companies an easy and direct access to the internal market for their products, while ensuring a high degree of safety for consumer.</p>\n<p>European legislation for medical devices and personal protection equipment does also rely on harmonised standards. In our common effort to face the corona virus outbreak, the Commission and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) have agreed to make a number of harmonised standards for important protective equipment like face masks and single-use gloves freely available to those companies that are willing to start producing these items.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information </strong></p>\n<p>List of available standards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT:32928&amp;cs=1B0AB06FEB70E43960D46D1198C37CC09\">EN 149:2009 Respiratory protective devices \u2013 Filtering half masks to protect against particles - Requirements, testing, marking (commonly referred to as \u2018FFP masks'</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT:69675&amp;cs=1956C06A1BAF887FF462DD56057D34F29\">EN 14683:2019 EN Medical face masks - Requirements and test method</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:2080,6068&amp;cs=17AA55E632AC1CD384E0EC575FCAD517C\">EN 166:2001 Personal eye-protection \u2013 Specifications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:6634,6143&amp;cs=1762F21421CCAB5CDFA53171933C67440\">EN 14126:2003 Protective clothing - Performance requirements and tests methods for protective clothing against infective agents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:32983,6143&amp;cs=1868F123B185CBECCA30C484231EB9233\">EN 14605:2009 Protective clothing against liquid chemicals - performance requirements for clothing with liquid-tight (Type 3) or spray-tight (Type 4) connections, including items providing protection to parts of the body only</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:37931,6186&amp;cs=140BACFC46E210464C9285A588FB51335\">EN 13795-1:2019 Surgical clothing and drapes - Requirements and test methods - Part 1: Surgical drapes and gowns</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:37932,6186&amp;cs=1B81482196B6350C2216C75AD9ADE1125\">EN 13795-2:2019 Surgical drapes, gowns and clean air suits, used as medical devices for patients, clinical staff and equipment - Part 2: Test methods</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:9434,6186&amp;cs=1055F7903C46D8F71F0E79395BE7740D8\">EN 455-1:2000 Medical gloves for single use - Part 1: Requirements and testing for freedom from holes (MDD)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:35266,6186&amp;cs=12E9FE3435C94205908EA5CCA48D43953\">EN 455-2:2015 Medical gloves for single use - Part 2: Requirements and testing for physical properties (MMD)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:37147,6186&amp;cs=1E4761E51ADEE40870128D1F51B28EC61\">EN 455-3:2015 Medical gloves for single use - Part 3: Requirements and testing for biological evaluation (MDD)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:26420,6186&amp;cs=1BA98FB4EB88B7DB06C5D281EB3BABC64\">EN 455-4:2009 EN Medical gloves for single use - Part 4: Requirements and testing for shelf life determination (MDD)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, possibly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:40946,6143&amp;cs=104F37C9F2C895BD53319E6F24A0CD261\">EN ISO 374-5:2017 Protective gloves against dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms - Part 5: Terminology and performance requirements for micro-organisms risks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:31126,6143&amp;cs=1330185F3C56516F288C2B1A330A1A1C1\">EN ISO 13688:2013 Protective clothing - General requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_ORG_ID:27092,6187&amp;cs=18C664CF8D89F01255897FFC3DC744216\">EN ISO 10993-1:2009 Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/european-standards_en\">European Standards</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cen.eu/Pages/default.aspx\">European Committee for Standardisation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cenelec.eu/\">European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation</a></p></div>",

We are setting up a rescEU stockpile to rapidly get the supplies needed to fight the coronavirus. It will be used to support Member States facing shortages of equipment needed to treat infected patients, protect health care workers and help slow the spread of the virus. Our plan is to move ahead without delay.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>How the rescEU stockpile works</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The stockpile will be hosted by one or several Member States. The hosting State will be responsible for procuring the equipment.</li>\n<li>The Commission will finance 90% of the stockpile. The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en\">Emergency Response Coordination Centre</a> will manage the distribution of the equipment to ensure it goes where it is needed most.</li>\n<li>The initial EU budget of the stockpile is \u20ac50 million, of which \u20ac40 million is subject to the approval of the budgetary authorities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/preparedness_response/joint_procurement_en\">Joint Procurement Agreemen</a>t, Member States are in the process of purchasing personal protective equipment, respiratory ventilators and items necessary for coronavirus testing. This coordinated approach gives Member States a strong position when negotiating with the industry on availability and price of medical products.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p>Once the measure enters into law on Friday 20 March, the Member State wishing to host rescEU stockpiles can apply for a direct grant from the European Commission. The direct grant covers 90 % of the costs of the stockpile while the remaining 10 % are borne by the Member State.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>rescEU is part of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en\">EU Civil Protection Mechanism</a> which strengthens cooperation between Participating States in the field of civil protection, with a view to improving prevention, preparedness and response to disasters. The proposal upgrades the EU Civil Protection Mechanism's rescEU reserve of assets that already includes firefighting planes and helicopters. Through the Mechanism, the European Commission plays a key role in coordinating the response to disasters in Europe and beyond.</p>\n<p>When the scale of an emergency overwhelms the response capabilities of a country, it can request assistance via the Mechanism.</p>\n<p>To date, all EU Member States participate in the Mechanism, as well as Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey. Since its inception in 2001, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has responded to over 330 requests for assistance inside and outside the EU.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p>Factsheet: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en\">EU Civil Protection Mechanism</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>#coronavirus</p></div>",

The aim is to preserve EU companies and critical assets, notably in areas such as health, medical research, biotechnology and infrastructures that are essential for our security and public order, without undermining the EU's general openness to foreign investment.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong> said: <em>\u201cIf we want Europe to emerge from this crisis as strong as we entered it, then we must take precautionary measures now. As in any crisis, when our industrial and corporate assets can be under stress, we need to protect our security and economic sovereignty. We have the tools to deal with this situation under European and national law and I want to urge Member States to make full use of them. The EU is and will remain an open market for foreign direct investment. But this openness is not unconditional.\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Trade Phil <strong>Hogan</strong> said: \u201c<em>We are facing an unprecedented public health crisis with deep consequences for the European economy. In the EU, we are and wish to remain open to foreign investment. In the current circumstances, we need to temper this openness with appropriate controls. We need to know who invests and for what purpose. The EU and its Member States have the right legal tools for that. Today's guidelines call upon Member States to use these tools to the fullest extent and will bring additional clarity on how to use our investment screening framework to prevent a sell-off of strategic EU assets in the current crisis</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Under existing EU rules, Member States are empowered to screen foreign direct investments (FDI) from non-EU countries on grounds of security or public order. Protection of public health is recognised as an overriding reason in the general interest. As a result, Member States can impose mitigating measures (such as supply commitments to meet national and EU vital needs) or prevent a foreign investor from acquiring or taking control over a company. National FDI screening mechanisms are currently in place in 14 Member States. With the EU foreign investment screening regulation in force since last year, the EU is well equipped to coordinate control of foreign acquisitions done at the Member States' level.</p>\n<p>Issuing its guidelines, the Commission calls upon Member States that already have an existing screening mechanism in place to make full use of tools available to them under EU and national law to prevent capital flows from non-EU countries that could undermine Europe's security or public order.</p>\n<p>The Commission also calls on the remaining Member States to set up a fully-fledged screening mechanism and in the meantime to consider all options, in compliance with EU law and international obligations, to address potential cases where the acquisition or control by a foreign investor of a particular business, infrastructure or technology would create a risk to security or public order in the EU.</p>\n<p>The Commission also encourages cooperation between Member States, as it comes to FDI screening cases where foreign investment could have an effect on the EU single market.\u00a0 Foreign acquisitions taking place now already fall under the EU FDI screening regulation, and could be reviewed under the cooperation mechanism established by the regulation, which will be fully operational as from October 2020.</p>\n<p>On capital movements, the guidelines also recall under which specific circumstances free movement of capital, notably from third countries, linked to acquisitions of stakes may be restricted.</p>\n<p>The Commission will also continue to follow closely developments on the ground and stands ready to discuss and ensure coordination on any foreign investment case with a larger European impact. Protection of the EU strategic assets will also be the subject of discussions between President\u00a0<strong>von der</strong> <strong>Leyen</strong> and EU leaders in tomorrow's European Council videoconference.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The EU FDI Screening Regulation was adopted in March 2019. It puts in place for the first time an EU-level mechanism to coordinate the screening of foreign investments likely to affect the security and public order of the Union and its Member States. This mechanism is based on an obligation to exchange information between Member States and the Commission, as well as on the possibility for the Commission and Member States to issue opinions and comments on specific transactions. The application of this mechanism will start on 11 October 2020. The Commission and Member States are already cooperating with a view to adapt national screening mechanisms and ensure a full and swift implementation of the Regulation at EU and national levels.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2020/march/tradoc_158676.pdf\">Guidelines on FDI screening</a></p>\n<p>FDI screening framework: <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/452/oj\">Regulation</a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_2088\">Press release</a>, <a href=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2019/february/tradoc_157683.pdf\">Factsheet</a></p></div>",

I welcome that almost all EU Member States are now implementing the restriction on travel into the EU. We are now providing additional guidance to make sure these are implemented all in the same way. The more uniform national actions are, the easier they will be for third-country nationals to understand and respect.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva <strong>Johansson</strong> said: <em>\u201c<em>With the guidance adopted today, we want to ensure that all border guards at the EU's external\u00a0borders facilitate the return home of EU citizens stranded abroad and that persons with essential functions or needs are not stopped, while taking appropriate and proportionate measures ensuring public health and security</em>.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>This guidance, which will assist border guards and visa authorities, provides advice on the implementation of the <strong>temporary restriction at the border</strong>, on facilitating transit arrangements for the <strong>repatriation of EU citizens</strong>, and on <strong>visa</strong> issues. It addresses issues that Member States raised in the bi-weekly videoconferences of Home Affairs Ministers and in technical meetings with Member States.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation of the temporary travel restriction at the borders</strong></p>\n<p>Detailed practical guidance is provided for border authorities on key issues, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criteria for refusing entry: </strong>The restriction on non-essential travel to the EU applies to non-resident, non-EU nationals that present relevant symptoms or have been particularly exposed to risk of infection and are considered a threat to public health. Any decision on refusal of entry must be proportionate and non-discriminatory. To determine whether a traveller poses such a risk, border guards are invited to consult the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control guidance available <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-public-health-management-contact-novel-coronavirus-cases-EU.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exemptions: </strong>Nationals of all EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries, and their family members, and non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in the EU are exempt from the temporary travel restriction for the purpose of returning home. Nationals of San Marino, Andorra, Monaco and Vatican/Holy See should be considered nationals of Member States to allow them to return home. Certain workers from outside the EU are also exempt, for example healthcare professionals, frontier workers, and seasonal agricultural workers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security:</strong> For travellers who are permitted entry, border authorities should strictly enforce the Schengen Borders Code. They should verify the authenticity of travel documents and national authorities must enforce systematic checks against the Schengen Information System to protect against potential terrorist threats or cross border criminality. Passports of non-EU nationals should be stamped.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exit checks:</strong> Border authorities should provide information on the travel restriction and cases of concern should be referred immediately to the relevant health services. In case national border control resources are exhausted, Member States may give priority to entry checks over exit checks, to the extent possible without affecting national sanitary measures.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transit and repatriation </strong></p>\n<p>Member States must <strong>facilitate onward transit</strong> of nationals of all EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries, and their family members, irrespective of their nationality, as well as third country nationals holding a residence permit and their dependants who are returning to their Member State of nationality or residence.</p>\n<p>Nationals of <strong>Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey</strong> should be treated in the same way when repatriated under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism since they are Participating States to the Mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Visa applications and overstay</strong></p>\n<p>Member States' consulates should remain open and ensure <strong>minimum service for processing visa applications</strong> by travellers exempted from the temporary travel restrictions.</p>\n<p>Non-EU travellers who have to stay in the EU longer than they are authorised to because of travel restrictions should not be penalised. For travellers currently present in the Schengen area on a short-stay visa who are compelled to stay longer than their visa allows them to, Member States may extend the visa up to a maximum stay of 90 days in any 180 days. In addition, Member States should <strong>issue a long-stay visa or a temporary residence permit</strong> to short-stay visa holders and those travelling visa-free who are compelled to stay beyond 90 days in any 180 days.</p>\n<p>Member States are also encouraged to <strong>waive sanctions</strong> on non-EU travellers who would be unable to leave in time because of travel restrictions.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, the Commission has issued new practical advice to ensure that mobile workers within the EU, in particular those in critical occupations to fight the coronavirus pandemic, can reach their workplace. This includes but is not limited to those working in the health care and food sectors, and other essential services like childcare, elderly care, and critical staff for utilities. Together with the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/20200330_c-2020-2050-report_en.pdf\">Guidance</a> on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU also issued today, this responds to requests made by EU leaders\u00a0on 26 March and seeks to address practical concerns of citizens and companies affected by the measures taken to limit the spread of the coronavirus, as well as of national authorities implementing the measures.</p>\n<p>While it is understandable that Member States have introduced internal border controls to limit the spread of the coronavirus, it is imperative that critical workers are able to reach their destination without delay.</p>\n<p>Nicolas <strong>Schmit</strong>, the Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: <em>\u201cThousands of women and men working hard to keep us safe, healthy and with food on the table need to cross EU borders to go to work. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that they are not hindered in their movement, while taking every precaution to avoid further spread of the pandemic.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=22473&amp;langId=en\">guidelines</a> published today identify a range of workers that exercise critical occupations, and for which continued free movement in the EU is deemed essential. The list provided in these guidelines is not exhaustive. Examples include health associate professionals, child and elderly care workers, scientists in health-related industries, those needed to install critical medical devices, firefighters and police officers, transport workers, as well as persons working in the food sector. The Commission urges Member States to establish specific burden free and fast procedures to ensure a smooth passage for such frontier workers, including proportionate health screening.</p>\n<p>Beyond these specific categories of workers, the guidelines also clarify that Member States should allow frontier workers in general to continue crossing borders if work in the sector concerned is still allowed in the host Member State.Member States should treat cross border workers and national workers in the same manner.</p>\n<p>As regards seasonal workers, particularly in the agricultural sector, Member States are asked to exchange information on their different needs at technical level and to establish specific procedures to ensure a smooth passage for such workers, in order to respond to labour shortages as a result of the crisis. Seasonal workers in agriculture perform in certain circumstances critical harvesting, planting and tending functions. In such a situation, Member States should treat those persons as critical workers and communicate to the employers the necessity to provide for adequate health and safety protection.</p>\n<p>These guidelines complement the recently adopted <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_468\">Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/20200330_c-2020-2050-report_en.pdf\">Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU</a> which were also presented today.</p>\n<p>The Commission will continue to identify the best practices with Member States which can be extended to all Member States for allowing workers to exercise their crucial occupations without undue hindrance.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has led to the introduction of unprecedented measures across EU Member States, including reintroduced checks at the internal borders.</p>\n<p>Frontier workers, posted workers as well as seasonal workers live in one EU country but work in another. Many of them are crucial for their host Member States, for instance for the health care system, the provision of other essential services including the setting up and maintenance of medical equipment and infrastructure, or ensuring the supply of necessity goods. A coordinated approach at EU level is therefore key.</p>\n<p>On 26 March, the Heads of State or government stated: \u201cWe will urgently address, with the assistance of the Commission, the remaining problems concerning EU citizens blocked at internal EU borders and prevented from returning to their home countries and cross-border and seasonal workers who have to be able to continue essential activities while avoiding further spread of the virus.\u201d These guidelines presented today are the Commission's immediate response to this call, alongside the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/20200327_c-2020-2050-report.pdf\">Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU</a> which include the repatriation of EU citizens.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=22473&amp;langId=en\">Communication of 27 March presenting \u201cGuidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers\u201d</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Coronavirus website</a></p></div>",

Mariya <strong>Gabriel</strong>, Commissioner for Research and Innovation, responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: \u201c<em>This is EU science in action when it is needed and where it is needed, </em><em>to support the EU's response to the current crisis</em><em>. The JRC quickly identified a potential gap in the management of the coronavirus outbreak and immediately set to work to fill that gap. The new control material has the potential to improve </em><em>the EU's</em><em> capacity to respond to the virus outbreak and avoid valuable resources being wasted by inefficient tests</em>.\u201d Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201c<em>Quick and reliable laboratory testing is fundamental to our strategy against coronavirus. The work of EU scientists to develop test control material will enable the verification of up to 60 million laboratory tests throughout the EU. This is a major achievement by our researchers, which will be crucial for our exit strategy when the time comes to start lifting social distancing measures.\u201d </em>A recent <a href=\"https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000082\">EU survey</a> identified the lack of positive control materials as one of the top three challenges faced by laboratories for the reliable implementation of coronavirus tests. A positive control material guarantees that laboratory tests are working correctly. It helps to avoid that a test could give a negative result if the person is positive. The JRC-designed control material is a synthetic, non-infectious part of the virus. Today, 3,000 samples of the control material are ready to be dispatched to testing laboratories across the EU. The samples are highly concentrated and only a very small quantity of the material is required to check one test. This means that one sample tube is enough for one laboratory to check up to 20,000 tests. Thus the 3,000 samples that are now ready make it possible to check up to 60 million tests throughout the EU.

As a result, European consumers will be able to save on their household bills, help reach EU-wide energy saving goals and reduce emissions. External power supplies are power adaptors used to convert electricity from household power mains into lower voltages, and are very common in European homes, with an average of ten per household and more than 2 billion in total in the EU. The new EU rules will make these external power supplies more energy efficient, aligning them to the highest standards worldwide. It is expected that electricity savings of over 4 TWh/year by 2030 will be generated, enough to power the whole of Latvia for a month. This will result in avoiding greenhouse gas emission of more than 1.4 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year from 2030 onwards. External power supplies are used, for example, in consumer electronics (smartphones, loudspeakers, sound systems, televisions), ICT products (modems, routers, laptops, tablets, electronic displays), small kitchen appliances (blenders, juicers), and personal convenience products (shavers, electric toothbrushes). The ecodesign regulation for external power supplies is part of a broader package of measures adopted last year, consisting of 10 ecodesign and 6 energy labelling regulations. The full package is expected to deliver a total of 167 TWh of final energy savings per year by 2030. This is equivalent to the annual energy consumption of Denmark. The cumulative savings correspond to a reduction of over 46 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year from 2030 onwards.

EU legislation already provides public buyers in Member States with flexible solutions for rapidly satisfying urgent needs such as purchasing personal protective equipment, medicines and ventilators, to be supplied to those who need them as quickly as possible. Commissioner <strong>Breton</strong>, in charge of the Internal Market, said: <em>\u201cPublic buyers are under immense pressure in the current emergency situation to ensure the availability of personal protective equipment such as face masks and protective gloves, of lifesaving ventilators and other medical supplies for all of those working relentlessly in the face of this crisis. I want to help them by</em><em> fully explaining all the flexibilities and solutions provided by the EU public procurement framework to buy such material fast. The current coronavirus crisis presents an extreme and unforeseeable urgency \u2013 precisely for such a situation our European rules enable public buyers to buy within a matter of days, even hours, if necessary. I urge all public buyers to fully exploit these flexibilities and to not hesitate and ask for further guidance from the Commission if needed.\u201d </em>The guidance outlines the options and flexibilities provided by the EU legislation. It provides an overview of the choice of tendering procedures available to public buyers and applicable deadlines. The guidance points out possibilities, which range from considerable shortening of the generally applicable deadlines to procuring without prior publication of tender notices in exceptional circumstances, such as the extreme urgency linked to the fight against the coronavirus. It also provides clarification for example on how in this situation of scarcity of key supplies public buyers could find alternative solutions and ways of engaging with the market.

Observers of the Operational Board include Members of the European Parliament, representatives from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the World Bank, and the Syria Recovery Trust Fund. With this newly adopted package, the Trust Fund has committed over \u20ac2 billion in concrete actions in the region since 2015, helping refugees and host countries alike, doubling the target originally set.</p>\n<p>This approved assistance package is part of already ongoing efforts to support Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries, pledged and provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis since 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Since its establishment in December 2014, a significant share of the EU's support to help Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries has been provided through the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfund-syria-region/content/home_en\" target=\"_blank\">EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis</a>. The Trust Fund reinforces an integrated EU aid response to the crisis and primarily addresses longer-term resilience and needs to enhance the self-reliance of Syrian refugees and, at the same time, contributes to ease the pressure on host communities and the administrations in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The Fund has also underpinned the EU Compacts agreed with Jordan and Lebanon to better assist them in coping with the protracted refugee crisis. With the newly adopted package, the Fund has mobilised over \u20ac900 million for Lebanon, over \u20ac500 million for both Jordan and Turkey and more than \u20ac160 million for Iraq. Overall, more than \u20ac2 billion has been mobilised from the EU budget and contributions from 21 EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.</p>\n<p>The Trust Fund's programmes support basic education and child protection services for refugees, training and higher education, better access to healthcare, improved access to water and wastewater infrastructure, support to resilience, women empowerment and fighting gender based violence, as well as economic opportunities and social stability. The Fund can also support internally displaced persons in Iraq and actions in the Western Balkans.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfund-syria-region/content/home_en\" target=\"_blank\">EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfund-syria-region/sites/tfsr/files/eutf-syria-factsheet-eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Factsheet: EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

To support and encourage cross-border healthcare cooperation between national, regional and local authorities, the Commission has today issued\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/guidelines_on_eu_emergency_assistance_in_cross-bordercooperationin_heathcare_related_to_the_covid-19_crisis.pdf\">practical guidance</a> to Member States. Cooperation across borders can help ease the pressure on overburdened hospitals by transferring patients suffering from coronavirus for treatment in Member States where hospital places are available. The Commission will also support Member States or non-governmental organisations to send qualified teams of medical personnel to offer assistance across borders.</p>\n<p>Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis <strong>Schinas,</strong> said: <em>\u201cEU unity and solidarity are vital in the fight against Coronavirus. Cooperating across borders can make the difference in saving lives by alleviating overstretched health care capacities in Member States. Faced with the greatest crisis in generations, we will leave no stone unturned in our collective response.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner Stella <strong>Kyriakides,</strong> responsible for Health and Food Safety said:<em> \u201cWe can only overcome the coronavirus crisis together. Life-saving cooperation between Member States is key. EU solidarity has been tangible over the past weeks with Member States treating patients from their neighbours, even when stretched themselves. This is the EU at its best, and with our guidance today, we want to encourage more cross-border treatment of patients, more deployment of healthcare staff from EU countries with extra capacity, to where it is needed most. Solidarity saves lives.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Today's guidelines set out a more coordinated approach to cross-border cooperation on emergency healthcare. The guidelines also outline additional support and assistance to be provided by the Commission to Member States health authorities, in particular by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coordinating requests for cross-border healthcare assistance through the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/preparedness_response/risk_management/hsc_en\">Health Security Committee</a>, chaired by the Commission, and the EU Early Warning and Response System. Such requests could cover for instance intensive care places, treatment and transfer of patients or qualified teams of medical personnel. The Commission will closely monitor these requests and the assistance available in the Member States.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n<li>Supporting health authorities requesting assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The Mechanism allows the Commission to coordinate and co-fund the emergency cross border transport of patients and qualified teams of medical personnel.</li>\n<li>Setting out arrangements for patient mobility across borders and clarifying the steps to be taken for the reimbursement of healthcare costs of cross-border treatment in compliance with the Social Security Coordination Regulations.</li>\n<li>Encouraging the deployment of qualified teams of medical personnel across borders. The Commission also encourages local, regional and national health authorities to use existing bi-lateral and regional agreements and clarify the mutual recognition of professional medical qualifications.</li>\n<li>Operating a Clinical Management Support System to support healthcare professionals to share knowledge and expertise. The system provides a Web conferencing platform that allow clinicians to exchange knowledge, discuss, and share clinical cases across the EU.*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, regarding financial assistance for cross-border healthcare cooperation, the Commission has also extended the Solidarity Fund to cover public health emergencies. Moreover, health expenditure is eligible under the Structural Funds and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_574\">further flexibility</a> to shift funds was already provided as part of the co-ordinated economic response to the coronavirus outbreak.

This will allow the EIF to issue special guarantees to incentivise banks and other lenders to provide liquidity to at least 100,000 European SMEs and small mid-cap companies hit by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, for an estimated available financing of \u20ac8 billion. Today's announcement fulfils the commitment in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_459\">Commission Communication</a> of 13 March to bring immediate relief to hard-hit SMEs, with money able to flow already in April. It is part of the package of measures announced by the EIB Group on 16 March designed to rapidly mobilise support for Europe's SMEs and mid-caps.</p>\n<p>One of the immediate economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic is the sudden lack of liquidity affecting small and medium-sized businesses. These companies are typically the most affected in a crisis, and it is essential to support them with adequate liquidity so they can survive the crisis. However, in a situation of liquidity crunch banks are not incentivised to lend SMEs money due to the sudden increase in perceived risk. That is why EU guarantees supporting these loans are necessary. As of today, the EIF is offering to the market dedicated EFSI-backed guarantees to contain the impact of the pandemic on small and medium sized enterprises and small mid-cap companies.</p>\n<p>European Commission Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People, Valdis<strong> Dombrovskis</strong>, said: \u201c<em>Across Europe, our businesses are struggling. The EU is responding quickly to help cushion the blow and to help small and medium-sized companies, which are especially vulnerable. Today, the Commission and the European Investment Fund are making available \u20ac8 billion in financing, bringing immediate cash relief to SMEs in Europe affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Money will be flowing already this month via local banks and lenders to help those most hard-hit by the crisis.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>EIF Chief Executive, Alain<strong> Godard</strong> said: \u201c<em>In times of unprecedented crisis it is essential that SMEs receive the support they need. The EIF is working intensively to ensure a swift and adequate response to the COVID-19 virus outbreak and we are pleased to be launching this new \u20ac8 billion initiative with the Commission today. While this is an important first step, </em><em>the EIB Group </em><em>will continue to work on finding additional solutions to quickly meet the financing needs of entrepreneurs across Europe</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The \u20ac1 billion unlocked from the EFSI under the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility and the InnovFin SME Guarantee under Horizon 2020 allows the EIF to provide guarantees worth \u20ac2.2 billion to financial intermediaries, unlocking \u20ac8 billion in available financing. The guarantees will be offered through the EIF to the market, via a call for expressions of interest\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.eif.org/what_we_do/guarantees/single_eu_debt_instrument/innovfin-guarantee-facility/call/covid-cosme-innovfin-support-measures.pdf\">issued today</a> to several hundred financial intermediaries, comprising banks and alternative lenders. Key features of these guarantees will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simplified and quicker access to the EIF guarantee</li>\n<li>A higher risk cover \u2013 up to 80% of potential losses on individual loans (as opposed to the standard 50%);</li>\n<li>Focus on working capital loans across the EU;</li>\n<li>Allowing for more flexible terms, including postponement, rescheduling or payment holidays</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new features will be accessible to new as well as existing financial intermediaries already working with EIF, who will extend special conditions to more than a hundred thousand companies benefitting from guarantees under the COSME LGF and the InnovFin SMEG programmes.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p>Following today's call for expression of interest, financial intermediaries with existing EIF agreements under these COSME and InnovFin programmes will be able to access the new guarantees immediately upon their request. Other financial intermediaries can access the guarantees following a swift application process. In that way new money can already start flowing to hard-hit businesses in April. SMEs will be able to apply directly to their local banks and lenders participating in the scheme, which will be listed on <a href=\"http://www.access2finance.eu\">www.access2finance.eu</a>.</p>\n<p>The Commission and the EIB Group will continue to work on additional measures and will use all the tools at their disposal to help contain the coronavirus pandemic and address its economic consequences.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>To unlock the \u20ac1 billion from the EU budget, the Commission and the EIB Group have made a series of amendments to their specific agreements.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.eif.org/\"><strong>European Investment Fund</strong></a> (EIF) is part of the European Investment Bank group. Its central mission is to support Europe's micro, small and medium-sized businesses by helping them to access finance. EIF designs and develops both venture and growth capital, guarantees and microfinance instruments which specifically target this market segment. In this role, EIF fosters EU objectives in support of innovation, research and development, entrepreneurship, growth and employment.</p>\n<p><strong>COSME</strong>\u00a0is the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) running from 2014 to 2020 with a total budget of \u20ac2.3 billion. At least 60% of the programme is devoted to improving access to finance for SMEs in Europe, with two financial instruments. The <a href=\"https://www.eif.org/what_we_do/guarantees/single_eu_debt_instrument/cosme-loan-facility-growth/index.htm\">COSME Loan Guarantee Facility</a> supports guarantees and counter-guarantees to financial institutions to help them provide more loans and lease finance to SMEs. COSME Equity Facility for Growth helps provide risk capital to SMEs mainly in the expansion and growth stages.</p>\n<p><strong>Horizon 2020 </strong>\u00a0is the EU programme for Research and Innovation running from 2014 to 2020 with a total budget of \u20ac77 billion. Under Horizon 2020, InnovFin \u2013 the EU Finance for Innovators \u2013 financial instruments aim to facilitate and accelerate access to finance for innovative businesses across Europe. In particular, the <a href=\"http://www.eif.org/what_we_do/guarantees/single_eu_debt_instrument/innovfin-guarantee-facility/index.htm\">InnovFin SME Guarantee (SMEG) Facility</a> provides guarantees and counter-guarantees on debt financing of between \u20ac25,000 and \u20ac7.5 million to improve access to finance for innovative SMEs and Midcaps. Under InnovFin SMEG, a facility managed by the EIF, financial intermediaries \u2013 banks and other financial institutions \u2013 are guaranteed against a proportion of their losses incurred on the debt financing covered under the facility.</p>\n<p>The <strong>European Fund for Strategic Investments</strong> (EFSI) is the financing pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe, which was launched in November 2014 to reverse the downward trend in investment levels and put Europe on the path to economic recovery. Its innovative approach based on the use of an EU budget guarantee provided to the EIB Group enables substantial public and private sector funds to be mobilised for investment into strategic sectors of the European economy. The Investment Plan for Europe has already generated more than \u20ac460\u00a0billion of investment and supported 1.1 million start-ups and SMEs across Europe.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p><strong>Saving lives and supporting livelihoods in these times of acute crisis is paramount. The Commission is further increasing its response by proposing to set up a \u20ac100 billion solidarity instrument to help workers keep their incomes and help businesses stay afloat, called SURE. It is also proposing to redirect all available structural funds to the response to the coronavirus. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Farmers and fishermen will also receive support, as will the most deprived. All of these measures are based on the current EU budget and will squeeze out every available euro. They show the need for a strong and flexible long-term EU budget. The Commission will work to ensure that the EU can count on such a strong budget to get back on its feet and progress on the path to recovery.</strong></p>\n<p>The coronavirus outbreak is testing Europe in ways that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago. The depth and the breadth of this crisis requires a response unprecedented in scale, speed and solidarity.</p>\n<p>In the past weeks, the Commission has acted to provide Member States with all the flexibility they need to support financially their health care systems, their businesses and workers. It has acted to coordinate, speed up and reinforce the procurement efforts of medical equipment and has directed research funding to the development of a vaccine. It has worked tirelessly to ensure that goods and cross-border workers can continue to move across the EU, to keep hospitals functioning, factories running and shop shelves stocked. It has and continues to support the repatriation of EU citizens, their families and long-term residents to Europe from across the world.</p>\n<p>In doing this, the Commission is acting on its conviction that the only effective solution to the crisis in Europe is one based on cooperation, flexibility and, above all, solidarity.</p>\n<p>Today's proposals take the response to a new level.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the proposals adopted today, President <strong>von der Leyen</strong> said: \u201c<em>In this coronavirus crisis, only the strongest of responses will do. We must use every means at our disposal. Every available euro in the EU budget will be redirected to address it, every rule will be eased to enable the funding to flow rapidly and effectively. With a new solidarity instrument, we will mobilise \u20ac100 billion to keep people in jobs and businesses running. With this, we are joining forces with Member States to save lives and protect livelihoods. This is European solidarity.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>\u20ac100 billion to keep people in jobs and businesses running: the SURE initiative</strong></p>\n<p>We need to cushion the economic blow in order for the EU economy to be ready to restart when the conditions are right. To achieve this, we must keep people in employment and businesses running. All Member States have or will soon have short-time work schemes to help achieve this.</p>\n<p>SURE is the Commission's answer to this: a new instrument that will provide up to \u20ac100 billion in loans to countries that need it to ensure that workers receive an income and businesses keep their staff. This allows people to continue to pay their rent, bills and food shopping and helps provide much needed stability to the economy.</p>\n<p>The loans will be based on guarantees provided by Member States and will be directed to where they are most urgently needed. All Member States will be able to make use of this but it will be of particular importance to the hardest-hit.</p>\n<p>SURE will support short-time work schemes and similar measures to help Member States protect jobs, employees and self-employed against the risk of dismissal and loss of income. Firms will be able to temporarily reduce the hours of employees or suspend work altogether, with income support provided by the State for the hours not worked. The self-employed will receive income replacement for the current emergency.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Delivering for the most deprived \u2013 the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As most of Europe practices social distancing to slow the spread of the virus, it is all the more important that those who rely on others for the most basic of needs are not cut off from help. The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived will evolve to meet the challenge: in particular, the use of electronic vouchers to reduce the risk of contamination will be introduced, as well as the possibility of buying protective equipment for those delivering the aid.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Supporting fishermen and farmers</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Europe's farming and fisheries have an essential role in providing us with the food we eat. They are hard hit by the crisis, in turn hitting our food supply chains and the local economies that the sector sustains.</p>\n<p>As with the structural funds, the use of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be made more flexible. Member States will be able to provide support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to fishermen for the temporary cessation of fishing activities;</li>\n<li>to aquaculture farmers for the temporary suspension or reduction of production and provide support;</li>\n<li>and to producer organisations for the temporary storage of fishery and aquaculture products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Commission will also shortly propose a range of measures to ensure that farmers and other beneficiaries can get the support they need from the Common Agricultural Policy, for example by granting more time to introduce applications for support and more time to allow administrations to process them, increasing advances for direct payments and rural development payments, and offering additional flexibility for on-the-spot checks to minimise the need for physical contact and reduce administrative burden.</p>\n<p><strong>Protecting our economy and people with all available means</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Redirecting all Cohesion Policy funds to fight the emergency</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All uncommitted money from the three Cohesion Policy funds \u2013 the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund - will be mobilised to address the effects of the public health crisis.</p>\n<p>To make sure that funds can be re-directed to where they are most urgently needed, transfers between funds as well as between categories of regions and between policy objectives will be made possible. Moreover, co-financing requirements will be abandoned, as Member States are already using all their means to fight the crisis. Administration will be simplified.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Emergency Support Instrument</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The European Union has not faced a health crisis in its history on this scale or spreading at this speed. In response, the first priority is to save lives and to meet the needs of our health care systems and professionals who are working miracles every day right across our Union.</p>\n<p>The Commission is working hard to ensure the supply of protective gear and respiratory equipment. Despite the strong production efforts of industry, Member States still face severe shortages of protective gear and respiratory equipment in some areas. They also lack sufficient treatment facilities and would benefit from being able to move patients to areas with more resources and dispatch medical staff to hardest-hit places. Support will also be needed for mass testing, for medical research, deploying new treatments, and for producing, purchasing and distributing vaccines across the EU.</p>\n<p>The EU is today proposing to use all available remaining funds from this year's EU budget to help to respond to the needs of European health systems.</p>\n<p>\u20ac3 billion will be put into the Emergency Support Instrument, of which \u20ac300 million will be allocated to RescEU to support the common stockpile of equipment. The first priority would be managing the public health crisis and securing vital equipment and supplies, from ventilators to personal protective gear, from mobile medical teams to medical assistance for the most vulnerable, including those in refugee camps. The second area of focus would be on enabling the scaling up of testing efforts.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>The Commission is today calling on Member States to ensure that Europeans have access to essential medicines during the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic has highlighted significant challenges in ensuring the supply of the critical medicines needed and the impact such an outbreak can have on the supply chain of medicines in the EU. The Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/guidelines-optimisation-supply-medicines-during-covid-19-outbreak_en\">guidelines</a> focus on the rational supply, allocation and use of vital medicines to treat coronavirus patients as well as medicines which may be at risk of shortage due to the pandemic. The proposed actions should allow for a more coordinated approach across the EU, preserving the integrity of the Single Market whilst protecting public health.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Stella<strong> Kyriakides</strong>, in charge of Health and Food Safety<em>, </em>said<em>: \u201cThis unprecedented health crisis is putting our health care systems under enormous strain \u2013 with stocks of essential medicines in many European hospitals at risk of running low. We cannot afford to have shortages of life-saving medicines at such a critical moment. Today, we are presenting concrete actions to Member States to proactively prevent shortages and ensure that our hospitals have the essential medicines needed to save lives. I call on the solidarity and responsibility of the EU pharmaceutical industry to increase the production of medicines needed to treat seriously ill coronavirus patients.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The Commission guidelines on the optimal and rational use of medicines stress the need for national authorities to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Show solidarity</strong> through the lifting of export bans and restrictions, ensuring that essential medicines are available in hospitals and pharmacies and that national stockpiling is avoided. National authorities should also fight misinformation that could lead to unnecessary stockpiling due to panic buying.</li>\n<li><strong>Ensure supply</strong> by increasing and reorganising production through the monitoring of stocks and production capacities, the coordination of joint efforts by industry and implementing demand support and procurement initiatives to encourage supply. Where Member States need to support industry increasing their manufacturing capacity through fiscal incentives and state aid and implement regulatory flexibility, the Commission stands ready to provide guidance and legal certainty.</li>\n<li><strong>Promote the optimal use of medicines </strong>in hospitals, in particular by adapting existing hospital protocols or establishing new validated protocols to prevent the overuse of medicines, as well as providing the possibility to extend the expiry dates of medicines.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise sales in community pharmacies to avoid hoarding </strong>through the introduction of restrictions on sales for medicines at risk of shortages and temporarily considering the limitation of online sales of essential medicines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the past weeks, the Commission, with the support of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has been gathering data on current challenges with a view to monitor, assess and identify medicines at risk of shortages. This includes monitoring overall demand from Member States, as well as the impact of third country export bans.</p>\n<p>The risk of shortages is due primarily to the increase in demand for medicines to treat coronavirus patients in hospitals. Stockpiling by citizens, an increased demand for experimental medicines for coronavirus, the introduction of protectionist measures within and outside the EU such as export bans and national stockpiling, as well as transportation barriers between countries, also play a role.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Executive Vice-President Margrethe <strong>Vestager</strong> in charge of competition policy, is putting forward a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/framework-communication-addressing-antitrust-issues-related-cooperation-between-competitors-covid-19-related-urgency-situations_en\">temporary framework</a> explaining when and how firms can obtain guidance or written comfort that cooperation to avoid shortages of essential scarce products and services is in line with competition rules.</p>\n<p class=\"Sous-titre1\"><strong>Useful links</strong></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Dedicated Commission webpage on the EU's response to the COVID-19 outbreak</a></p></div>",

The experience of Member States and other countries exposed to the pandemic shows the measures applied to fight the spread of the virus require more than 30 days to be effective. The Commission calls for a coordinated approach to the prolongation, as action at the external borders can only be effective if implemented by all EU and Schengen States at all borders, with the same end date and in a uniform manner.</p>\n<p>The travel restriction, as well as the invitation to extend it, applies to the \u2018EU+ area', which includes all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) \u2013 30 countries in total.</p>\n<p>Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis <strong>Schinas</strong>, said: \u201c<em>All Member States have successfully implemented social distancing measures to limit social interaction and slow down the spread of the virus. The restriction on non-essential travel from third counties to the EU complements these measures at the EU's external borders. While we can see encouraging first results, prolonging the travel restriction is necessary to continue reducing the risks of the disease spreading further. We should not yet let the door open whilst we are securing our house.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva<strong> Johansson</strong>, added: \u201c<em>The current situation compels us to</em> <em>call for a prolongation of the restriction on non-essential travel to the EU. While coordinated action is key at the external borders, we also need to work together at the internal borders to make sure our internal market continues to function properly, and that vital products such as food, medicines and protective equipment can reach their destination without delay. We will continue assisting Member States in all these strands of work.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The Commission's assessment of the current situation points to a continued rise in the number of new cases and deaths across the EU, as well as to the progression of the pandemic outside of the EU, including in countries from where millions of people usually travel to the EU every year. In this context, prolonging the travel restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of the disease spreading further.</p>\n<p>The risk of increasing community transmission is assessed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to be moderate if mitigation measures are in place and very high if insufficient mitigation measures are in place, while the risk that the capacity of health and social care systems will be exceeded in the coming weeks is assessed as high, even with mitigation measures in place.</p>\n<p>Since the implementation of the travel restriction in the second half of March, air passenger traffic has been almost reduced to zero, with the remaining flights being mainly limited to cargo transport and repatriation. A similar trend of passenger traffic can be seen in other modes of transport, such as in ferry, coach and rail transport.</p>\n<p>The Commission will continue to assist Member States in implementing the restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, including through regular discussions in videoconference meetings with Home Affairs Ministers.</p>\n<p>Any further prolongation of the travel restriction beyond 15 May would need to be assessed again, based on the evolution of the epidemiological situation.</p>\n<p>Parallel and coordinated action at external borders will be an essential aspect of a concerted EU exit strategy and the gradual lifting of the containment measures in Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>The Commission <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:115:FIN\">invited</a> Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days. Leaders endorsed this call on 17 March; and all EU Member States (except Ireland) and non-EU Schengen countries have since then taken national decisions to implement this travel restriction.</p>\n<p>The travel restriction does not apply to EU citizens, citizens of non-EU Schengen countries and their family members, and non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in the EU for the purpose of returning home. In addition, to limit to the minimum the impact of the restriction on the functioning of our societies, Member States should not apply the restrictions to specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need. Essential staff, such as doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, researchers and experts helping to cope with the coronavirus, as well as persons carrying goods, frontier workers and seasonal agricultural workers, should also continue to be allowed to enter the EU.</p>\n<p>To assist Member States, the Commission presented on 30 March 2020 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_543\">guidance</a> on how to implement the temporary travel restriction, facilitate repatriations from across the world, and deal with those compelled to stay in the EU longer than they are authorised to as a result of travel restrictions.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-assessment-state-play-communication-non-essential-travel_en\">Communication on the assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU</a>, 8 April 2020</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/questions-answers-people-travelling-and-eu-during-pandemic_en\">Q&amp;A for people travelling to and from the EU during the pandemic</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:115:FIN\">Communication on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU</a>, 16 March 2020</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_543\">Coronavirus: Commission presents practical guidance on implementing the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU</a>, 30 March 2020</p></div>",

Digital tools can play an important role in the gradual lifting of containment measure, when the time will be ripe for that, if they are compliant with EU rules and well coordinated. The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/recommendation-apps-contact-tracing_en\">Recommendation</a> sets out a process towards the adoption with the Member States of a toolbox, focusing on two dimensions: </span></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">a pan-European coordinated approach for the use of mobile applications for </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">empowering citizens to take effective and more targeted social distancing measures and for</span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> warning, preventing and contact tracing; and</span></li>\n<li class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">a </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">common approach for modelling and predicting the evolution of the virus through anonymised and aggregated mobile location data. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The Recommendation sets out key principles for the use of these apps and data as regards data security and the respect of EU fundamental rights such as privacy and data protection.</span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\">Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry <strong>Breton</strong> said: \u201c<em>Digital technologies, mobile applications and mobility data have enormous potential to help understand how the virus spreads and to respond effectively. With this Recommendation, we put in motion a European coordinated approach for the use of such apps and data, without compromising on our EU privacy and data protection rules, and avoiding the fragmentation of the internal market. Europe is stronger when it acts united.\u201d</em></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Commissioner for Justice, Didier <strong>Reynders</strong>, added: \u201c<em>We all must work together now to get through this unprecedented crisis. The Commission is supporting the Member States in their efforts to fight the virus and we will continue to do so when it comes to an exit strategy and to recovery. In all this, we will continue to ensure full respect of Europeans' fundamental rights. Europe's data protection rules are the strongest in the world and they are fit also for this crisis, providing for exceptions and flexibility. We work closely with data protection authorities and will come forward with guidance on the privacy implications soon.</em>\u201d</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"prdnormal\">A common coordinated approach for the use of tracing apps</span></strong></p>\n<p>Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Commission has strongly supported Member States in their efforts to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. Commission services have been looking into the effectiveness of apps solutions to address the crisis as well as their impact on data protection. Centrepiece of today's Recommendation is the proposal for a joint toolbox towards a common coordinated approach for the use of smartphone apps that fully respect EU data protection standards.It will consist of:</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>specifications </strong>to ensure the <strong>effectiveness of mobile information</strong>, warning and tracing applications from a medical and technical point of view;</li>\n<li>measures to <strong>avoid proliferation of incompatible applications</strong>, support requirements for interoperability and promotion of common solutions;</li>\n<li><strong>governance mechanisms to be applied by public health authorities </strong>and in cooperation with the European Centre for Disease Control;</li>\n<li>the <strong>identification of good practices and mechanisms</strong> for exchange of information on the functioning of the applications; and</li>\n<li><strong>sharing data with relevant epidemiological public bodies,</strong> including aggregated data to ECDC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To support Member States, the Commission will provide guidance including on data protection and privacy implications. The Commission is in close contact with the European Data Protection Board for an overview of the processing of personal data at national level in the context of the coronavirus crisis.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"prdnormal\">A common approach for predicting and modelling the spread</span></strong></p>\n<p>The toolbox will also focus on developing a common approach for modelling and predicting the evolution of the virus through <strong>anonymous and aggregated mobile location data</strong>. The aim is to analyse mobility patterns including the impact of confinement measures on the intensity of contacts, and hence the risks of contamination. This will be an important and proportionate input for tools modelling the spread of the virus, and provide insights for the development of strategies for opening up societies again.</p>\n<p>The Commission already started the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_20_521\">discussion with mobile phone operators</a> on 23 March 2020 with the aim to cover all Member States. The data will be fully anonymised and transmitted to the Joint Research Centre (JRC) for processing and modelling.

The guidance aims to support Member States in effectively using testing tools in the context of their national strategies and during the different stages of the pandemic, including when phasing out confinement measures. The Commission also aims to ensure that high-quality tools are available to assess the performance of the tests.</p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: <em>\u201cThe capacity to perform large-scale testing is key to detecting and slowing down the coronavirus pandemic and is a crucial pre-condition for a gradual return to our normal way of life. The main priority for us all is to fight the virus and protect our citizens from further exposure and infection, and to do so, we need to know where the virus is. In the absence of a vaccine, safe and reliable testing is our best bet to protect our health care workers, the most vulnerable of our citizens and our societies at large. This is a cornerstone of our roadmap towards lifting coronavirus containment measures.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Mariya <strong>Gabriel</strong>, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: \u201c<em>We have been working hard to analyse the information on the quality assurance of the coronavirus tests and devices that are currently being used. The results show that there is a mismatch between the existing quality and what could be expected to ensure good performance of the tests. The European Commission has therefore developed test performance criteria which aim to improve the overall performance of these tests. This will benefit all European citizens and is a key part for of the exit strategy from the current crises</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The availability of reliable data over time is key to lifting containment measures. In order to achieve this, there needs to be sufficient monitoring of the progression of the coronavirus pandemic, including through large-scale testing.</p>\n<p>In its guidelines, the Commission calls on manufacturers to produce \u201cstate of the art\u201d testing kits. Although the science relating to testing is still evolving rapidly, this obligation is important as the information provided by these test kits is used for crucial public health decisions.</p>\n<p>Given the importance of tests in the current situation and the rapid development of the pandemic, the Commission is also insisting on pooling resources for the validation of coronavirus tests at EU-level. It is important to centralise the validation and to share the results at EU and international level.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure the highest possible testing quality, make sure that tests are correctly used and further align the evaluation and validation of test device performance, the Commission is proposing to launch the following actions in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an assessment of common approaches in national strategies;</li>\n<li>the sharing of information on the performance of tests;</li>\n<li>the establishment of a network of coronavirus reference laboratories across the EU to facilitate the exchange of information, and the management and distribution of control samples;</li>\n<li>the drafting of further guidance on performance evaluation and conformity assessment following additional dialogue with the industry and national competent authorities;</li>\n<li>making available tools for assessment of performance, such as reference materials and common methods for the comparison of devices;</li>\n<li>the fight against counterfeit devices through international cooperation and cooperation between Member States' authorities;</li>\n<li>the coordination of supply and demand by EU instruments such as the Clearing House, rescEU and joint procurement;</li>\n<li>solidarity between Member States by ensuring a fair distribution of available stocks and laboratory equipment focussing on where they are most needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31998L0079\">EU legislation</a> lays down a number of requirements for tests. The manufacturer of a test must prepare a technical file, which demonstrates that the test is safe and performs as intended.</p>\n<p>There are currently two categories of tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tests detecting the virus;</li>\n<li>tests detecting antibodies; these tests detect whether the patient has already been exposed to the virus and therefore produced antibodies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assessing the performance level of a test can be very challenging as the biological materials necessary for this assessment are not always available. Moreover, unified ways to compare tests do not always exist.</p>\n<p class=\"Sous-titre1\"><strong>More information</strong></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Dedicated Commission webpage on the EU's response to the Coronavirus outbreak</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

Today, the Council gave its fast approval, so that the \u20ac2.7 billion instrumentcan immediately begin providing direct support where most needed. The instrument will be used together with other EU tools, for example the rescEU medical stockpile, which is in parallel being increased by \u20ac300 million in addition to the initially proposed allocation of \u20ac80 million. Commissioner Johannes <strong>Hahn</strong>, in charge of the budget, said: \u201c<em>The EU budget has always been the EU's main solidarity tool to address crisis situations and swiftly assist those in need in Europe and beyond. Today, we are mobilising it again to the full support of those at the frontline\u2013 doctors, nurses, the sick and their families. This contribution will also be instrumental in tracking the disease in solidarity, making more testing available and supporting relevant medical research.\u201d</em>\u00a0At a first stage, the Emergency Support Instrument for the healthcare sector will help fund urgent medical supply needs, such as masks and respirators, the transportation of medical equipment and patients in cross-border regions, the recruitment of additional healthcare workforce that can be deployed to hotspots across the Union, as well as the construction of mobile field hospitals. The Emergency Support Instrument enables the Commission to directly procure on behalf of Member States and focus the help where it is needed most; prioritisation and mobilisation will be done in close co-ordination with Member States. An internal Task Force has been set up to manage this initiative. In the medium- to long-term, ESI will enable the EU to support Member State mass testing efforts and any relevant medical research. In this way, the Commission will be providing a coordinated EU response throughout the crisis, from the current stage until the moment of exit and recovery.\u00a0For all the budgetary means to be available, the Commission would also need the green light of the European Parliament. <em>(For more information: Balazs Ujvari - Tel.: +32 2 295 4578; Claire Joawn - Tel.: +32 2 295 6859)</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a id=\"2\"></a>Coronavirus: Commission presents guidelines on waste management in the coronavirus crisis </strong></p>\n<p>Today, the Commission published guidelines to support Member States in their waste management in these difficult times of coronavirus.

Aid will be granted in the form of direct grants to enhance and accelerate research and the production of products directly relevant to coronavirus. These include medicinal products including vaccines, hospital and medical equipment including ventilators, protective clothing and equipment as well as diagnostic tools. In particular (i) the R&amp;D part of the scheme covers fundamental research, industrial research and experimental development projects; (ii) the investment part of the scheme will cover 80% of the eligible costs that companies have to bear to create production capacities to manufacture coronavirus relevant products. The Commission found that the Luxembourg scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. To support quick action, companies may also benefit from a bonus when their investment is concluded within two months after the granting of the aid. The Commission therefore concluded that the aid scheme will contribute to the achievement of a common objective of crucial importance, is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to fight the health crisis in line with Article 107(3)(c) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework.

The Temporary Framework was first <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_570\">amended on 3 April 2020</a>, which increased possibilities for public support to research, testing and production of products relevant to fight the coronavirus outbreak, to protect jobs and to further support the economy. In total, the Commission has adopted 43 decisions approving 53 national measures in relation to the coronavirus outbreak. The Commission is now proposing to extend further the scope of the Temporary Framework by enabling Member States to provide recapitalisations to companies in need. The Commission is consulting Member States on the possibility of providing public support in the form of equity or hybrid capital instruments to these severely affected companies, provided that it is the most appropriate means of support and subject to clear conditions. The proposed broadening of the scope of the Temporary Framework to aid in the form of recapitalisations complements the possibility of Member States to purchase existing shares of companies at market price or <em>pari passu</em> with private shareholders, which in principle falls outside the scope of EU State aid control. This can in particular be important for interventions by Member States to prevent hostile takeovers of strategic companies by foreign purchasers. It therefore complements the tools available to Member States as set out in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_528\">Commission's guidelines</a> to ensure a strong EU-wide approach to foreign investment screening in a time of public health crisis and related economic vulnerability. Executive Vice-President Margrethe <strong>Vestager</strong>, in charge of competition policy, said: <em>\u201cOur shared priority faced with the coronavirus crisis is protecting the health of all European citizens. At the same time, the emergency measures are putting a strain on many companies that face a reduction in equity, with negative consequences on their ability to finance their activities. Following the amendment of last week, we will further extend the State aid Temporary Framework to enable Member States to recapitalise companies when necessary and appropriate. We will make sure that taxpayers are sufficiently remunerated for their investment, and companies that receive capital support are subject to controls and governance provisions that limit possible distortions to competition in the Single Market. We continue working with Member States to make sure that the European economy can weather this storm, and bounce back even stronger.\u201d </em>The full Statement is available <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_20_610\">online</a>. <em>(For more information: Arianna Podesta\u00a0\u2013 Tel. +32 229 87024; Giulia Astuti <em>\u2013</em> Tel.: +32 229 55344; Maria Tsoni \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 90526)</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a id=\"19\"></a>State aid: Commission approves \u20ac15 billion Austrian liquidity scheme to support the economy in the coronavirus outbreak</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission has approved a \u20ac15 billion Austrian liquidity scheme to support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak.

At the beginning of the outbreak, around 600,000 EU citizens declared themselves stranded outside the EU. Most of them in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas. Intense efforts by the EU in terms of consular cooperation, EU funded repatriation flights and coordination have managed to bring home as of today already more than 500,000 of them. This concerns EU short-term travellers outside the EU. In March, the European Council tasked the High Representative/Vice-President Josep <strong>Borrell\u00a0</strong>to coordinate the repatriation operations of the EU citizens and a dedicated Consular Task Force was set up by the European External Action Service. This Task Force works in close cooperation with the Member States and the European Commission. In an unprecedented effort, the Commission's Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) has co-financed and co-organised almost 200 flights that have brought back home around 45,000 EU citizens. This massive and historically unique consular cooperation of the EU Member States and EU institutions has also benefitted citizens from other partner countries, such as Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK, with 5,000 of their citizens being repatriated with EU flights. Currently, there are still around 98,900 EU citizens stranded abroad and efforts are ongoing to bring them home in the coming days.

The development of such apps and their take up by citizens can have a significant impact on the treatment of the virus and can play an important role in the strategy to lift containment measures, complementing other measures like increased testing capacities.\u00a0It is therefore important to ensure that EU citizens can fully trust such innovative digital solutions and can embrace them without fear. Especially when it comes to tracing apps, the largest possible participation is necessary to exploit their full potential to trace infection chains and rapidly stop the virus from spreading further.\u00a0EU rules, notably the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules/eu-data-protection-rules_en\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/online-privacy\">ePrivacy Directive</a>, provide the strongest safeguards of trustworthiness (i.e. voluntary approach, data minimisation, time limitation) for such apps to operate widely and accurately.\u00a0The\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/guidance-apps-supporting-fight-against-covid-19-pandemic_en\">guidance</a>\u00a0aims to offer the necessary framework to guarantee that citizens have sufficient protection of their personal data and limitation of intrusiveness while using such apps.

They have slowed down the spread of the virus and saved thousands of lives. However, these measures and the corresponding uncertainty come at a dramatic cost to people, society and the economy, and cannot last indefinitely.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission Ursula <strong>von der Leyen </strong>said: <em>\u201cSaving lives and protecting Europeans from the coronavirus is our number one priority. At the same time, it is time to look ahead and to focus on protecting livelihoods. Even though conditions in the Member States still vary widely, all Europeans rightly ask themselves when and in what order the confinement measures can be lifted. Responsible planning on the ground, wisely balancing the interests of protection of public health with those of the functioning of our societies, needs a solid foundation. That's why the Commission has drawn up a catalogue of guidelines, criteria and measures that provide a basis for thoughtful action. The strength of Europe lies in its social and economic balance. Together we learn from each other and help our European Union out of this crisis.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Health and Food safety Stella <strong>Kyriakides </strong>said:<em> \u201cReturning to normality after the corona lockdowns will require a carefully coordinated and European approach between Member States, based on science and in the spirit of solidarity. It is crucial that our healthcare systems have the capacity to treat increases in new cases, that essential medicines and equipment are available and that we have large-scale testing and tracing capacity in place. We know that this road will be long and gradual and that the consequences of this unprecedented health crisis will be long lasting. Until effective treatments and a vaccine are found, we will have to learn to live with this virus. But Europe will be back on its feet, together and united. This is the only way.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>While recognising the specificities of each country, the European roadmap establishes the following <strong>key principles</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Timing is essential</strong>. Deciding that the time has cometo begin to relax confinement should be based on these criteria:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Epidemiological criteria</strong> showing that the spread of the disease has significantly decreased and stabilised for a sustained period.</p>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Sufficient health system capacity</strong>, for example taking into account the occupation rate for intensive care units, the availability of health care workers and medical material.</p>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Appropriate monitoring capacity,</strong> including large-scale testing capacity to quickly detect and isolate infected individuals, as well as tracking and tracing capacity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We need a European approach. </strong>While timing and modalities for lifting containment measures differ between Member States, we need a common framework that is based on:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Science with public health at its centre</strong>, while acknowledging that ending restrictive measures involves balancing public health benefits with social and economic impacts.</p>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Coordination between Member States, </strong>to avoid negative effects. This is a matter of common European interest.</p>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Respect and solidarity. </strong>This is essentialfor both health and socio-economic aspects. At a minimum, Member States should notify each other and the Commission in due time before they lift measures and take into account their views.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Phasing-out confinement requires accompanying measures</strong>, including<strong>: </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Gathering harmonised data and developing a robust system of reporting and contact tracing</strong>, including with digital tools that fully respect data privacy;</p>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Expanding testing capacity and harmonising testing methodologies</strong>. The Commission \u2013 in consultation with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control \u2013 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/testing-kits-communication_en\">has adopted Guidelines</a> today on different coronavirus tests and their performance;</p>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Increasing the capacity and resilience of national health care systems</strong>, in particular to address the predicted rise in infections after lifting restrictive measures;</p>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Continuing to reinforce medical and personal protective equipment capacities</strong>.</p>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Developing safe and effective treatments and medicines</strong>, as well as developing and fast-tracking the introduction of a vaccine to put an end to the coronavirus.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEPS</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission's roadmap lists <strong>concrete recommendations </strong>Member States should consider when planning to lift containment measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action</strong><strong>should be gradual</strong>: measures should be lifted in different steps, with sufficient time left between them to measure the impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>General measures should progressively be replaced by targeted ones</strong>. For example, protecting the most vulnerable groups for longer; facilitating the gradual return of necessary economic activities; intensifying regular cleaning and disinfection of transport hubs, shops and workplaces; replacing general states of emergencies with targeted government interventions to ensure transparency and democratic accountability.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Internal border controls should be lifted in a coordinated manner</strong>. Travel restrictions and border controls should be removed once the border regions' epidemiological situation converges sufficiently. External border should be reopened in a second stage and take account of the spread of the virus outside the EU.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The re-start of economic activity should be phased-in</strong>: there are several models that can be implemented, e.g. jobs suitable for teleworking, economic importance, shifts of workers, etc. The entire population should not return to the workplace at the same time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gatherings of people</strong> should be progressively permitted, taking into account the specificities of different categories of activity, such as:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Schools and universities;</li>\n<li>Commercial activity (retail) with possible gradation;</li>\n<li>Social activity measures (restaurants, cafes) with possible gradation;</li>\n<li>Mass gatherings</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Efforts to prevent the spread of the virus should be sustained</strong>, with awareness campaigns to encourage the population to keep up the strong hygiene practices and social distancing.</li>\n<li><strong>Action should be continuously monitored</strong> and preparedness developed for returning to stricter containment measures as necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While confinement measures are gradually lifted, there is a need to <strong>strategically plan the </strong><strong>recovery</strong>, revitalising the economy and getting back on a path of sustainable growth. This includes enabling the twin transition towards a greener and digital society, and drawing all lessons from the current crisis for the EU's preparedness and resilience. <strong>The Commission will develop a Recovery plan, based on a revamped proposal for the next long-term EU budget (Multiannual Financial Framework) and the updated Commission Work Programme for 2020.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission, in cooperation with the President of the European Council, has developed the present roadmap responding to the call of the <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/43076/26-vc-euco-statement-en.pdf\">European Council of 26 March</a>for a coordinated exit strategy. It takes into account the expertise of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/public-health_en#a-european-team-of-coronavirus-experts\">panel of scientific experts</a> advising the Commission on the coronavirus. Evidently, any such reflection is based on the scientific knowledge available today, and should be revised as further evidence appears and measuring methods are harmonised.</p>\n<p>In parallel, the Commission continues to mobilise <strong>funding to foster research</strong> on the development of vaccine, treatments and medicines. The Commission is also working with the European Medicines Agency to <strong>streamline regulatory steps</strong>, from clinical trials to marketing authorisations. It will also foster <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_604\"><strong>international cooperation </strong></a>as a priority.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, to help Member States acquire the necessary equipment as rapidly as possible, including tests, the Commission has set up a \u2018<strong>Clearing house for medical equipment'</strong>, launched <strong>joint procurement actions and emergency stockpiling via </strong><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_476\"><strong>RescEU</strong></a> and proposed to support national health systems with the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_577\">Emergency Support Instrument.</a></p>\n<p><strong>MORE INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/european-roadmap-lifting-coronavirus-containment-measures_en\">Link to the Joint Roadmap</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/european-roadmap-lifting-coronavirus-containment-measures_en\">Factsheet: A Joint European Roadmap towards lifting coronavirus containment measures</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Website on the Commission's coronavirus response</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

Still, some markets have been hit hard by the consequences of this public health crisis.</p>\n<p>Today's package includes measures for <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/market-measures/market-measures-explained_en#storageofproducts\">private storage aid</a> (PSA) in the dairy and meat sectors, the authorisation of self-organisation market measures by operators in hard hit sectors and flexibility in fruits and vegetables, wine and some other <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/market-measures/market-measures-explained_en#sectorspecificaidschemes\">market support programmes</a>.</p>\n<p>Agriculture Commissioner Janusz <strong>Wojciechowski</strong> said: \u201d<em>The consequences of the coronavirus crisis are increasingly being felt in the agri-food sector and this is why we have decided to take swift action, in addition to the measures already taken since the outbreak of the crisis. The measures proposed are, in the present state of market developments, intended to send a signal aimed at stabilising markets and are considered to be the most appropriate for providing stability to future prices and production and thus stable food supplies and food security. Today we are announcing a new and exceptional package of measures to support the most affected agri-food sectors by addressing already observed disturbances as well as future risks. I am confident that these measures will relieve markets, and show concrete results rapidly.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Exceptional measures announced as a further response to the Coronavirus crisis include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Private storage aid</strong>: the Commission proposes to grant <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/market-measures/market-measures-explained_en#storageofproducts\">private storage aid</a> for dairy (skimmed milk powder, butter, cheese) and meat (beef, sheep and goat meat) products. This scheme will allow the temporary withdrawal of products from the market for a minimum of 2 to 3 months, and a maximum period of 5 to 6 months. This measure will lead to a decrease of available supply on the market and rebalance the market on the long-term.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility for market support programmes</strong>: the Commission will introduce flexibility in the implementation of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/market-measures/market-measures-explained_en#sectorspecificaidschemes\">market support programmes</a> for wine, fruits and vegetables, olive oil, apiculture and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/market-measures/school-fruit-vegetables-and-milk-scheme\">EU's school scheme</a> (milk, fruits and vegetables). This will allow the reorientation of funding priorities towards crisis management measures for all the sectors.</li>\n<li><strong>Exceptional</strong> <strong>derogation from EU competition rules</strong>: applicable to the milk, flowers and potatoes sectors, the Commission will authorise the derogation from certain competition rules under Article 222 of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32013R1308\">Common Markets Organisation Regulation</a>, that allows operators to adopt self-organisation market measures. Concretely, these sectors will be allowed to collectively take measures to stabilise the market. For example, the milk sector will be allowed to collectively plan milk production and the flower and potatoes sector will be allowed to withdraw products from the market. Storage by private operators will also be allowed. Such agreements and decisions would only be valid for a period of maximum six months. Consumer price movements will be monitored closely to avoid adverse effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Commission aims to have these measures adopted by the end of April. Beforehand Member States will need to be consulted, and vote on these measures. They are therefore subject to change. The full detail of these proposals will be unveiled at the time of their final adoption.</p>\n<p>The package announced today follows a comprehensive package of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/coronavirus-commission-announces-further-measures-support-agri-food-sector-2020-apr-02_en\">other measures</a> adopted early on by the Commission to support the agri-food sector in the current crisis, such as increased amounts for state aid, higher advanced payments, and extended deadlines to submit payment requests. The increased flexibility regarding Common Agricultural Policy rules aims to alleviate the administrative burden on farmers and national administrations.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/coronavirus-response_en\">Supporting the agriculture and food sectors amid coronavirus</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">EU response amid coronavirus</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/market-measures_en\">Common Agricultural Policy's market measures</a></p></div>",

On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe <strong>Vestager</strong>, in charge of competition policy, said: <em>\u201cThe \u20ac2 billion scheme will enable Finland to grant loans at favourable terms and to provide public guarantees on loans to companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

The proposal comes on top of the \u2018<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_604\">Team Europe</a>' strategy, the EU's robust and targeted response to support partner countries' efforts in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. It represents an important demonstration of the EU's solidarity with these countries at a time of unprecedented crisis.</p>\n<p>The proposal, following a preliminary assessment of financing needs, provides for the MFA funds to be distributed as follows: the Republic of Albania (\u20ac180 million), Bosnia and Herzegovina (\u20ac250 million), Georgia (\u20ac150 million), the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (\u20ac200 million), Kosovo (\u20ac100 million), the Republic of Moldova (\u20ac100 million), Montenegro (\u20ac60 million), the Republic of North Macedonia (\u20ac160 million), the Republic of Tunisia (\u20ac600 million) and Ukraine (\u20ac1.2 billion).</p>\n<p>Valdis\u00a0<strong>Dombrovskis</strong>, Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People said: \u201c<em>Supporting our neighbours is essential during this time of crisis to keep the entire region stable.

Because in this global crisis, we stand or fall together. Today the European Commission is taking a decisive step to help ten of our neighbours in their fight against the Coronavirus. I call on the European Parliament and the Council to swiftly agree this important package</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The MFA funds will be made available for 12 months in the form of loans on highly favourable terms to help these countries cover their immediate, urgent financing needs. Together with the International Monetary Fund's support, the funds can contribute to enhancing macroeconomic stability and creating space to allow resources to be allocated towards protecting citizens and mitigating the coronavirus pandemic's negative socio-economic consequences. This instrument also remains available for other eligible countries experiencing balance-of-payments difficulties.</p>\n<p>The Commission's proposal is subject to adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Given the urgent need for this support, the Commission counts on the cooperation of the co-legislators to ensure swift adoption of the proposal.</p>\n<p>Following the adoption of the proposal, the Commission stands ready to disburse the first instalment as swiftly as possible after the adoption of the MFA decision and upon the agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding with each partner country. The second instalment could be disbursed in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in the first half of 2021, provided that the policy measures attached to it have been implemented in a timely manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Team Europe</strong></p>\n<p>The EU's response follows a \u2018<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/urpilainen/announcements/commissioner-urpilainen-team-europe-our-partners-against-covid-19_en\">Team Europe</a>' approach, aimed at saving lives by providing quick and targeted support to our partners to face this pandemic. It combines resources from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to support partner countries and address their short-term financing needs, as well as the longer-term structural impacts on societies and the economy. The overall figure of the \u2018Team Europe' package reaches more than \u20ac20 billion. The first Team Europe packages are already being implemented in the EU's immediate neighbourhood: the Western Balkans, in the East and to the South.</p>\n<p>The EU, as global actor and major contributor to the international development system, promotes a coordinated multilateral response, in partnership with the United Nations, International Financial Institutions, as well as the G7 and the G20.</p>\n<p><strong>Macro-Financial Assistance</strong></p>\n<p>MFA is part of the EU's wider engagement with neighbouring and enlargement countries and is intended as an exceptional EU crisis response instrument. It is available to enlargement and EU neighbourhood countries experiencing severe balance-of-payments problems with policy conditionality. To benefit from an MFA, countries should meet certain political pre-conditions in terms of respect of democratic principles, human rights and rule of law. They should also benefit from an IMF financial assistance programme. In the implementation of the assistance, the Commission will ensure consistency with recent and ongoing MFA operations.</p>\n<p>In addition to MFA, the EU supports the Neighbourhood and Western Balkans through several other instruments, including humanitarian aid, budget support, thematic programmes, technical assistance, blending facilities and guarantees from the European Fund for Sustainable Development to support investment in sectors most affected by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/proposal-decision-macro-financial-assistance-enlargement-neighbourhood-partners-covid19-crisis_en\">Commission proposal for \u20ac3 billion macro-financial assistance package</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_604\">Coronavirus: EU global response to fight the pandemic</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/macro-financial-assistance-mfa-non-eu-partner-countries_en\">Macro-Financial Assistance</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu/neighbourhood-countries/ukraine_en\">EU macro-financial assistance operations to Ukraine</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu/neighbourhood-countries/moldova_en\">EU macro-financial assistance operations to Moldova</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu/neighbourhood-countries/georgia_en\">EU macro-financial assistance operations to Georgia</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu/neighbourhood-countries/tunisia_en\">EU macro-financial assistance operations to Tunisia</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu/neighbourhood-countries/jordan_en\">EU macro-financial assistance operations to Jordan</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>The Commission has today adopted a banking package to help facilitate bank lending to households and businesses throughout the European Union. The aim of this package is to ensure that banks can continue to lend money to support the economy and help mitigate the significant economic impact of the Coronavirus. It includes an Interpretative Communication on the EU's accounting and prudential frameworks, as well as targeted \u201cquick fix\u201d amendments to EU banking rules.</p>\n<p>The rules put in place following the financial crisis have ensured that banks in the EU are now more resilient and better prepared to deal with shocks to the economy. Today's Communication recalls that EU rules allow banks and their supervisors to act in a flexible, but responsible, manner during economic crises to support citizens and firms, particularly small and medium-sized companies. Today's Regulation also implements some targeted changes to maximise the capacity of credit institutions to lend and to absorb losses related to the Coronavirus pandemic, while still ensuring their continued resilience.</p>\n<p>Valdis<strong> Dombrovskis</strong>, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People said: <em>\u201cWe are supporting households and businesses as much as we can to deal with the economic fallout of the Coronavirus. The banking sector can do a lot to help here. We are using the full flexibility of the EU's banking rules and proposing targeted legislative changes to enable banks to keep the liquidity taps turned on, so that households and companies can get the financing they need. I will soon also be launching roundtable discussions bringing together consumer and business groups with the financial sector so that we can address the most urgent needs of our citizens and companies.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The Commission will engage with the European financial sector to explore how it can develop best practices that could further support citizens and businesses. The EU's response to this crisis must be coordinated in order to avoid national fragmentation and to ensure a level playing field.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted amendments to banking rules</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission proposed today a few targeted \u201cquick fix\u201d amendments to the EU's banking prudential rules (the Capital Requirements Regulation) in order to maximise the ability of banks to lend and absorb losses related to Coronavirus. The Commission proposes exceptional temporary measures to alleviate the immediate impact of Coronavirus-related developments, by adapting the timeline of the application of international accounting standards on banks' capital, by treating more favourably public guarantees granted during this crisis, by postponing the date of application of the leverage ratio buffer and by modifying the way of excluding certain exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio. The Commission also proposes to advance the date of application of several agreed measures that incentivise banks to finance employees, SMEs and infrastructure projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Interpretative Communication</strong></p>\n<p>Today's Communication confirms the recent statements on using flexibility within accounting and prudential rules, such as those made by the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank, amongst others. The Commission encourages banks and supervisory authorities to make use of the flexibility in the EU's accounting and prudential frameworks. For example, the Communication confirms \u2013 and welcomes \u2013 the flexibility available in EU rules when it comes to public and private moratoria on loan repayments (EBA guidelines of 2 April). The Communication also highlights areas where banks are invited to act responsibly, for example by refraining from making dividend distributions to shareholders or adopting a conservative approach to the payment of variable remuneration. Today's Communication also recalls how banks can help businesses and citizens through digital services, including contactless and digital payments.<strong> <br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/200428-banking-package-communication_en\" target=\"_blank\">Commission Interpretative Communication on the application of the accounting and prudential frameworks to facilitate EU bank lending (Supporting businesses and households amid COVID-19)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/200428-banking-package-communication_en\" target=\"_blank\">Proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No\u00a0575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2013/575/oj\" target=\"_blank\">Regulation (EU) No\u00a0575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No\u00a0648/2012 Text with EEA relevance</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_757\" target=\"_blank\">Questions and Answers: Coronavirus response: Banking Package to facilitate bank lending- Supporting households and businesses in the EU</a></p></div>",

We are determined to have our medical industries pouring all their energy into what we need them to be doing: helping fight the pandemic. The European Union will do whatever it takes to support our health systems in their hour of need</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: <em>\u201cYesterday's adoption will allow us all, in this time of crisis, to maintain our focus on the most critical issues and to ensure the continued availability of vitally important medical devices. This is clear proof of our ongoing determination to tackle the pandemic through all possible means, while always maintaining the safety of patients as our utmost objective. </em><em>I thank the Parliament and Council for the record time approval, cooperation and efficient handling of this urgent proposal.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The coronavirus crisis increases demand for certain vital medical devices. It is therefore important to avoid any further difficulties or risks of potential shortages or delays in the availability of such devices that could be caused by the limited capacity of authorities or conformity assessment bodies related to the implementation of the Medical Devices Regulation.</p>\n<p>The adopted amendment therefore postpones the application of the Medical Devices Regulation by one year - until 26 May 2021. The currently applicable rules will continue to guarantee patient health and safety.</p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic and the public health crisis resulting from it is putting Member States, together with national authorities, health institutions and economic operators, under extreme pressure. These circumstances demand substantial additional resources, and the need for an increased availability of vitally important medical devices has considerably increased. At the time of adoption of the Medical Devices Regulation none of the above could have been foreseen.</p>\n<p>The present situation strongly impacts upon the different areas covered by the Medical Devices Regulation. It is therefore highly probable that it would not have been possible for Member States, health institutions, economic operators and other relevant parties to implement and apply the Regulation from its foreseen date of application on 26 May 2020.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure an effective regulatory framework for medical devices, the present amendment also postpones the date of repeal of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex:31990L0385\">Directive</a> on active implantable medical devices and the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1993L0042:20071011:EN:PDF\">Directive</a> on medical devices by one year.</p>\n<p>The present adoption will not have impact on the date of application of the In Vitro Diagnostics Medical Devices Regulation, which becomes applicable from 26 May 2022.</p>\n<p>The amendment of the Medical Devices Regulation complements other important measures in the area of medical devices, which the Commission continues to adopt in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>The Commission adopted the proposal on 3 April, and this was followed by the support of the European Parliament on 17 April.

The EU's collective action will focus on addressing the immediate health crisis and resulting humanitarian needs, strengthening partner countries' health, water and sanitation systems and their research and preparedness capacities to deal with the pandemic, as well as mitigating the socioeconomic impact. To underpin these actions, the EU will secure financial support to partner countries amounting to more than \u20ac15.6 billion from existing external action resources. Together with our partners, we are making sure that the substantial EU funding already allocated to them is targeted to help them deal with the impact of coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen, </strong>commented: <em>\u201c</em><em>The virus knows no borders. This global challenge needs strong international cooperation. The European Union is working tirelessly to fight the pandemic. We all know that only together we can stop the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. To that end, the EU will soon convene a virtual pledging event to help mobilise the necessary funding and support the World Health Organisation to assist the most vulnerable countries.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>High Representative/Vice-President Josep <strong>Borrell</strong>, added: \u201c<em>The coronavirus pandemic requires united, global action in response. The European Union and its Member States are playing their part in tackling this health crisis and its severe consequences \u2013 at home and abroad. While we are doing everything we can to provide support of our citizens, we also need to assist our partners in our direct neighbourhood and beyond to address the impact it will have on their livelihoods, stability and security, as their problems are our problems. This is a global fight that we will either win or lose together. Cooperation and joint efforts at the international level and multilateral solutions are the way forward, for a true global agenda for the future.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta <strong>Urpilainen</strong>, explained: \u201d<em>As long as the coronavirus threatens lives somewhere, we are not safe. This is the core of international cooperation and partnerships. We need to work together in order to tackle our shared challenges. Today the European Commission steps up and leads with this significant global response package of more than </em><em>\u20ac15.6</em><em>billion the joint work with our partners, <em>particularly in Africa,</em> for a safer future for us all</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neighbourhood and Enlargement Commissioner, Oliv\u00e9r <strong>V\u00e1rhelyi,</strong> said: \u201c<em>As part of our global response to the coronavirus pandemic we are redirecting over \u20ac3.8 billion of foreseen funds for the Western Balkans and our immediate neighbours to the East and to the South, to where their real needs are today: for urgent response to the health crisis, to strengthen the health systems and to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the pandemic. We share a continent and we can only succeed together.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Janez <strong>Lenar\u010di\u010d<strong>,</strong></strong> Commissioner for Crisis Management, warned: <em>\u201cWe are facing what could become the biggest humanitarian crisis in decades. The impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the most fragile countries, migrants and the most vulnerable people is likely to be dramatic. This is particularly the case in the confined and often insalubrious setting of refugee and internally displaced people camps. That is why we need to respond vigorously to the public health emergency, make sure humanitarian actors continue to have access to carry out their life-saving assistance and support transport and logistic for key humanitarian operations.</em><em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>Team Europe package</strong></p>\n<p>The EU's response follows a \u2018<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/urpilainen/announcements/commissioner-urpilainen-team-europe-our-partners-against-covid-19_en\" target=\"_blank\">Team Europe</a>' approach, aimed at saving lives by providing quick and targeted support to our partners to face this pandemic. It combines resources from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to support partner countries and address their short-term needs, as well as the longer-term structural impacts on societies and the economy. The first Team Europe packages are already being implemented in the immediate neighbourhood: the Western Balkans, in the East and to the South.</p>\n<p>The EU, as global actor and major contributor to the international aid system, will promote a coordinated multilateral response, in partnership with the United Nations, International Financial Institutions, as well as the G7 and the G20.</p>\n<p>The European Union will continue to adapt its response to the evolving situation and focus on the most affected countries in need of health support, such as countries in Africa, the Neighbourhood, the Western Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, the European Commission is announcing over \u20ac3.3 billion of EU financial support mobilised jointly with the European Investment Bank to the benefit of the Western Balkans' citizens. This package aims to address the immediate health and resulting humanitarian needs of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as help with the social and economic recovery.</p>\n<p>In addition to the reinforced support, the Commission is in its contribution ahead of the EU-Western Balkans' leaders meeting of 6 May 2020 also outlining the broad parameters of longer-term support to be presented later this year in the form of an Economic and Investment Plan for the region.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission, Ursula<strong> von der Leyen</strong>, said: <em>\u201cWe have a special responsibility to assist in this pandemic our partners in the Western Balkans, as their future clearly lies in European Union. The EU is mobilising a substantial financial package, confirming the strong solidarity. Together we will overcome this crisis and recover. And beyond that, we will continue to support the region, including with the reforms needed on their EU path, as the recovery will only work effectively if the countries keep delivering on their commitments.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliv\u00e9r<strong> V\u00e1rhelyi</strong>, commented: <em>\u201cThe European Union acted quickly and comprehensively to support the Western Balkans in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, with unparalleled financial assistance as well as access to many of the EU's initiatives. And our work will continue as we prepare an Economic and Investment Plan for the region, to tackle the hard socio-economic impact of the crisis, to modernise the economies in the region, support the reforms and start closing the development gap, thus bringing concrete benefits to the people faster.\u201d </em></p>\n<p><strong>EU support to the Western Balkans in tackling the coronavirus </strong></p>\n<p>The EU financial support package of more than <strong>\u20ac3.3 billion</strong> includes reallocations from the <strong>Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance </strong><strong>of \u20ac38 million of immediate support for the health sector</strong>, in particular through delivering essential supplies to save lives, such as personal protective equipment, masks and ventilators; <strong>\u20ac389 million</strong> to address <strong>social and economic recovery needs</strong> and a <strong>\u20ac455</strong> <strong>million</strong> <strong>economic reactivation package</strong>, in close cooperation with the International Financial Institutions. It also includes a proposal for <strong>\u20ac750 million </strong>of <strong>Macro-Financial Assistance</strong> and a <strong>\u20ac1.7 billion package</strong> of assistance from the <strong>European Investment Bank</strong>.</p>\n<p>The EU is also providing <strong>immediate humanitarian assistance to vulnerable refugees and migrants amounting to \u20ac4.5 million</strong> and <strong>\u20ac8 million</strong> to address pressing needs in migrant camps across the region.</p>\n<p>As a result of the coronavirus outbreak, the Western Balkans have also <strong>activated the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) </strong>and have already started to receive assistance through delivery of equipment and repatriation of citizens from the UCPM Member States and Participating States. Furthermore, given their European perspective, the EU is treating the Western Balkans as privileged partners by granting them access to many initiatives and instruments reserved for EU Member States. This includes for instance <strong>joint procurement of medical equipment</strong>, exempting the region from the EU's export authorisation scheme for personal protective equipment, ensuring the fast flow of essential goods across land borders through \u201c<strong>green lanes</strong>\u201d, and the EU supply of testing material to ensure the correct functioning of coronavirus tests in the Western Balkans. The region is also associated to the work of relevant health bodies.</p>\n<p><strong>Looking ahead - an economic and investment plan for recovery </strong></p>\n<p>The Western Balkans will require continued support to address the impact of the pandemic once the immediate crisis is over. The European Commission will later in the year come forward with an <strong>Economic and Investment Plan for the region, </strong>to spur the long-term recovery, boost economic growth and support reforms required to move forward on the EU path.</p>\n<p>It will also include a <strong>substantial investment package for the region</strong>. For the 2021-2027 period, the Commission has proposed a total envelope for the Pre-Accession Instrument III of <strong>\u20ac14.5 billion</strong>, of which the lion's share is destined for the Western Balkans. The Commission foresees a <strong>doubling in the provision of grants</strong> through the Western Balkans Investment Framework and substantially increasing the <strong>financial guarantees</strong> to support public and private investment in the region through a dedicated Guarantee Instrument under the Western Balkans Investment Framework.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Green transition and the Digital transformation</strong> will play a central role in relaunching and modernising the economies of the Western Balkans. Investing in clean and digital technologies and capacities, together with a circular economy, will help create jobs and growth. Support will also be provided to improve the <strong>competitiveness</strong> of the economies of the Western Balkans, to <strong>better connect them within the region and with the EU</strong>, and to help make the Western Balkans <strong>fit for the digital age</strong>. A strong focus will be put on the transport and energy links, which are crucial for the economic development of the region and the EU alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Tackling fundamental reforms </strong></p>\n<p>The recovery from the current crisis will only work if the <strong>partners keep delivering on their reform commitments </strong>and produce tangible results in their implementation. This is also key to realising their European perspective. In addition to continued economic reforms, this requires a <strong>stronger focus on the rule of law, the functioning of democratic institutions and public administration</strong>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>\n<p>EU heads of State and Government and those of the Western Balkans will gather on 6 May 2020 for an EU-Western Balkans' leaders meeting to tackle common challenges. Initially foreseen as a summit in Zagreb, the meeting will due to the COVID-19 pandemic now take place via videoconference. Today proposals are the Commission's contribution ahead of this meeting.</p>\n<p>The EU's global response to the coronavirus pandemic follows a \u2018Team Europe' approach; combining resources from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Together with our partners, we are making sure that the substantial EU funding already allocated to the Western Balkans is targeted to help them address the impact of the pandemic.In parallel, some EU Member States are also providing bilateral support, whether financial or donations of supplies.</p>\n<h3><strong>For More Information</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-commission-european-parliament-council-economic-social-committee-regions-support-western-balkans-covid-19-recovery_en\" target=\"_blank\">Link to Communication</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/coronavirus_support_wb_april_2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Factsheet on EU response to the coronavirus pandemic in the Western Balkans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/eu-wb_relations_april_2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Factsheet EU Western-Balkans relations</a></p>\n<p><strong>Factographs for partners: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/near_factograph_albania.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Albania</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/near_factograph_bosnia_and_herzegovina.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/near_factograph_kosovo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Kosovo</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/near_factograph_montenegro.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Montenegro</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/near_factograph_north_macedonia.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">North Macedonia</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/near_factograph_serbia.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Serbia</a></p></div>",

Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra, President of the Central African Republic, as well as humanitarian organisations.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Janez<strong> Lenar\u010di\u010d</strong> said: <em>\u201cLeaving any area of the world unprotected today leaves us all unprotected tomorrow.</em><em> As part of our global response, the EU will open a dedicated Humanitarian Air Bridge to get aid into areas which lack supplies due to the difficulties of global transit. This can be a lifeline for some of the most vulnerable communities worldwide.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The first EU flight, operated in cooperation with France,is departing from Lyon and will transport around 60 humanitarian workers from various NGOs and 13 tonnes of humanitarian cargo. Two subsequent humanitarian cargo flights will follow in the coming days to transport a further 27 tonnes of humanitarian supplies in total. On their return leg, the Air Bridge flights will also bring back EU citizens and other passengers from the Central African Republic in a repatriation effort.</p>\n<p>More EU humanitarian flights are being scheduled for the coming weeks, prioritising African countries where the pandemic has the potential to worsen many existing humanitarian crises.</p>\n<p><strong>How the Humanitarian Air Bridge works</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In a joint effort between the Commission and Member States, the Commission funds air transport of Member States' flights to and from the proposed destinations, where possible combined with ongoing repatriation flights, also including humanitarian workers on rotation.</li>\n<li>Humanitarian staff from national administrations, NGOs or UN Agencies can benefit from the facility.</li>\n<li>The Commission finances 100% of the transport costs, whereas the EU partners remain responsible for the procurement of the humanitarian material.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The Global EU response to Coronavirus follows a Team Europe approach. It draws on contributions from all EU institutions and combines the resources mobilised by EU Member States and financial institutions, to address the humanitarian, health, and other consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>As part of its long-standing solidarity with the people in need in the Central African Republic, through its humanitarian aid, the EU is also supporting 15 new projects in 2020 with a total funding of \u20ac15.2 million. This funding is going towards providing life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people. Since 2014, the Central African Republic received more than \u20ac770 million in humanitarianassistance from the EU and its Member States.</p>\n<p>In addition to humanitarian aid, the EU has mobilised over \u20ac30 million for the coronavirus response via its different instruments, including the B\u00eakou Trust Fund. This funding will help in addressing immediate needs in the Central African Republic in the health, water and sanitation sectors as well as supporting the State budget with an early budget support payment.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/crisis-management-and-solidarity_en\">EU Coronavirus response: crisis management and solidarity</a></p>\n<p>Factsheet: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/where/africa/central-african-republic_en\">EU Humanitarian Aid in the Central African Republic</a></p></div>",

As Member States manage to reduce the circulation of the virus, blanket restrictions to free movement should be replaced by more targeted measures. If a generalised lifting of restrictions is not justified by the health situation, the Commission proposes a phased and coordinated approach that starts by lifting restrictions between areas or Member States with sufficiently similar epidemiological situations. The approach must also be flexible, including the possibility to reintroduce certain measures if the epidemiological situation requires. </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Member States should act on the basis of the following 3 criteria:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>epidemiological</strong>, notably focusing on areas where situation is improving, based on guidance by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and using the regional <a href=\"https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html\">map developed by the ECDC</a>;</li>\n<li>the ability to apply <strong>containment measures</strong> throughout the whole journey including at border crossings, including additional safeguards and measures where physical distancing may be difficult to ensure and</li>\n<li><strong>economic and social considerations, </strong>initially prioritising cross-border movement in key areas of activity and including personal reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <strong>principle of non-discrimination</strong> is of particular importance: when a Member State decides to allow travel into its territory or to specific regions and areas within its territory, it should do so in a non-discriminatory manner \u2013 allowing travel from all areas, regions or countries in the EU with similar epidemiological conditions. In the same vein, any restrictions must be lifted without discrimination, to all EU citizens and to all residents of that Member State regardless of their nationality, and should be applied to all parts of the Union in a similar epidemiological situation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Restoring transport services across the EU while protecting the health of transport workers and passengers: </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/covid-19-guidelines-progressive-restoration-transport-services-and-connectivity_en\">guidelines</a> present general principles for the safe and gradual restoration of passenger transport by air, rail, road and waterways. The guidelines put forth a series of recommendations, such as the need to limit contact between passengers and transport workers, and passengers themselves, reducing, where feasible, the density of passengers.</p>\n<p>The guidelines also include indications on the use of personal protective equipment such as face masks and on adequate protocols in case passengers present coronavirus symptoms. The guidelines also make recommendations for each mode of transport and call for coordination among Member States in light of re-establishment of gradual connections between them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Safely resuming tourism services: </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span class=\"None\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Commission sets out a common framework providing criteria to safely and gradually restore tourism activities and developing health protocols for hotels and other forms of accommodation, to protect the health of both guests and employees. These criteria include epidemiological evidence; sufficient health system capacity being in place for local people and tourists; robust surveillance and monitoring and testing capacity and contact tracing. </span><span lang=\"NL\">These guidelines will allow people to safely stay at hotels, camping sites, Bed&amp;Breakfasts or other holiday accommodation establishments, eat and drink at restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9s and go to beaches and other leisure outdoor areas.</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ensuring cross-border interoperability of tracing apps: </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span class=\"None\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Member States, with the support of the Commission, agreed on\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/contacttracing_mobileapps_guidelines_en.pdf\">guidelines</a> to ensure cross-border interoperability between tracing apps so that citizens can be warned of a potential infection with coronavirus also when they travel in the EU. This will guide developers working with national health authorities. Such tracing apps must be voluntary, transparent, temporary, cybersecure, using anonymised data, should rely on Bluetooth technology and be inter-operable across borders as well as across operating systems. Interoperability is crucial: EU citizens must be able to receive alerts of a possible infection in a secure and protected way, wherever they are in the EU, and whatever app they are using. The Commission is supporting Member States in finding the right solution, in line with the principles set out in the </span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\"><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_670\">EU toolbox</a></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">and the </span><span lang=\"EN-US\"><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020XC0417%2808%29\">Commission guidance on data protection</a><span class=\"None\">.</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Making vouchers a more attractive option for consumers:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span lang=\"NL\">Under EU rules, travellers have the right to choose between vouchers or cash reimbursement for cancelled transport tickets (plane, train, bus/coach, and ferries) or package travel. While reaffirming this right, the Commission's recommendation aims to ensure that vouchers become a viable and more attractive alternative to reimbursement for cancelled trips in the context of the current pandemic, which has also put heavy financial strains on travel operators. The voluntary vouchers should be protected against insolvency of the issuer, with a minimum validity period of 12 months, and be refundable after at most one year, if not redeemed. They should also provide passengers sufficient flexibility, should allow the passengers to travel on the same route under the same service conditions or the travellers to book a package travel contract with the same type of services or of equivalent quality. They should also be transferable to another traveller.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\"><strong>For tourism businesses</strong></span></p>\n<p>The Commission aims to support Europe's tourism sector by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ensuring liquidity for tourism businesses, in particular SMEs, through:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>o\u00a0\u00a0Flexibility\u00a0<span class=\"None\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">under <strong>State aid rules</strong> allowing Member States to introduce schemes, such as guarantee schemes for vouchers and further liquidity schemes, to support companies in the transport and travel sectors and to ensure that reimbursement claims caused by the coronavirus pandemic are satisfied.

We will not allow our efforts to be lost.\u201d</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Commissioner for Justice and Consumers, Didier <strong>Reynders</strong>, said: \u201c<em>European consumers can be reassured: The Commission will not downgrade their EU rights for reimbursement for cancelled travel.

Travel, transport, accommodation, food, recreation or culture, contribute to almost 10% of EU GDP and provide a key source of employment and income in numerous European regions. 267 million Europeans (62% of the population) make at least one private leisure trip per year and 78% of Europeans spend their holidays in their home country or another EU country.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><span class=\"None\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The tourism ecosystem has also been one of the most affected by the heavy restrictions on movement and travel imposed in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak. The World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) foresees a 60% to 80% reduction in international arrivals, amounting to losses of between \u20ac840 and \u20ac1.100 billion in export revenues worldwide.

Restrictions on free movement and internal border controls will need to be lifted gradually before we can remove restrictions at the external borders and guarantee access to the EU for non-EU residents for non-essential travel.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The travel restriction, as well as the invitation to extend it, applies to the \u2018EU+ area', which includes all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) \u2013 30 countries in total. The Commission calls for a continued coordinated approach to the prolongation, as action at the external borders can only be effective if implemented by all EU and Schengen States at all borders, with the same end date and in a uniform manner.</p>\n<p>The Commission will continue to assist Member States in implementing the restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, including through regular videoconference meetings with Home Affairs Ministers. Any further prolongation of the travel restriction beyond 15 June 2020 would need to be assessed again, based on the evolution of the epidemiological situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>The Commission <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:115:FIN\">invited</a> Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days. On 8 April, the Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_616\">called for prolonging the travel restriction</a> until 15 May. All EU Member States (except Ireland) and non-EU Schengen countries have since taken national decisions to implement and prolong this travel restriction.</p>\n<p>To assist Member States, the Commission presented on 30 March 2020 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_543\">guidance</a> on how to implement the temporary travel restriction, facilitate repatriations from across the world, and deal with those compelled to stay in the EU longer than they are authorised to as a result of travel restrictions.</p>\n<p>The travel restriction does not apply to EU citizens, citizens of non-EU Schengen countries and their family members, and non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in the EU for the purpose of returning home. In addition, to limit to the minimum the impact of the restriction on the functioning of our societies, Member States should not apply the restrictions to specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need. Essential staff, such as doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, researchers and experts helping to cope with the coronavirus, as well as persons carrying goods, frontier workers and seasonal agricultural workers, should also continue to be allowed to enter the EU.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-restriction-non-essential-travel-eu_en\">Communication</a> on the second assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 8 May 2020</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-and-transportation-during-coronavirus-pandemic/travel-and-eu-during-pandemic_en\">Q&amp;A</a> for people travelling to and from the EU during the pandemic</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:115:FIN\">Communication</a> on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 16 March 2020</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_616\">Press release</a> - Coronavirus: Commission invites Member States to prolong restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 May, 8 April 2020</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_543\">Press release</a> - Coronavirus: Commission presents practical guidance on implementing the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, 30 March 2020</p></div>",

Furthermore, a large-scale infestation of locusts threatens food security and livelihoods of many vulnerable people in the region.</p>\n<p>Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez<strong> Lenar\u010di\u010d</strong> said: \u201c<em>The EU remains committed to help address humanitarian needs in countries in the Horn of Africa, all the more so in these challenging times. EU aid will support communities at risk of hunger and strengthen measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. A global pandemic requires a global response.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Funding from this aid package gos to humanitarian projects in <strong>Djibouti </strong>(\u20ac500,000), <strong>Ethiopia </strong>(\u20ac42 million), <strong>Kenya</strong> (\u20ac15 million) and <strong>Somalia</strong> (\u20ac48 million). It will help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>support the health facilities in the provision of basic services, epidemics control and prepare them to face the coronavirus pandemic.</li>\n<li>provide food assistance to people in need, such as by supporting farmers to get seeds and fodder for their livestock; provide treatment for acute malnutrition, especially for young children</li>\n<li>address the basic needs of refugees and internally displaced people, such as protection, shelter, food, access to health and nutrition care and clean water, and education for children.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The EU's humanitarian aid forms part of the broader EU support in the region, which includes longer-term development cooperation.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p>With some 25 million people already at risk of food shortages in the region, the looming desert locust upsurge is an additional threat to food security and livelihoods, especially for the most vulnerable communities. Their food access is at risk of being further cut down by rising food prices. The situation is further aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic, as prevention and control measures can also, as an indirect consequence, place additional challenges to the delivery of humanitarian aid and to reaching people in need.</p>\n<p>EU humanitarian projects in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia addressing food shortages and loss of livelihoods caused by locust swarms are being allocated \u20ac22 million from this aid package. Furthermore, earlier in 2020, the EU already mobilised <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_308\">\u20ac11 million</a> in humanitarian and development funding to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to help it address the locust outbreak in the region and provide support to affected pastoralists and farmers.</p>\n<p>A share of the funding announced today will also contribute to the Team Europe's response to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, EU humanitarian aid will be provided to the World Health Organization's global coronavirus response in partnership with health authorities in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia to scale up operational readiness for early detection and response to the pandemic.</p></div>",

The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated how vulnerable the increasing biodiversity loss makes us and how crucial a well-functioning food system is for our society.

The two appointments take effect on 1 June while the date of effect of the transfer will be determined later. Commissioner <strong>Hahn</strong> emphasised that the breadth of experience of all three officials will be an asset for their new services in the important work they all have to tackle going forward. Ms Vitcheva, a Bulgarian national, has been Deputy Director-General of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) for the past three and a half years following a number of years as Director in the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (REGIO). Prior to joining the Commission in 2009, Ms Vitcheva was Minister Plenipotentiary at the Permanent Representation of Bulgaria to the European Union. Mr Nava, from Italy, joined the Commission in 1994 and is currently Director for Horizontal Policies in the Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union (FISMA), having previously served in the same DG as Director for financial system surveillance and crisis management and in the Directorate-General for Internal Market (MARKT) as Head of Unit and then Director, in the Group of Policy Advisers and in one Cabinet. He was also seconded from the Commission to the position of President of the Italian Financial Markets Authority. Ms Bury, a British national, brings with her a wide range of experience gained both during the past four years as Deputy Director-General in the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (CNECT) as well as during her previous assignments in the Directorate-General for Internal Market and Services, the Cabinets and the Legal Service. <em>(For more information: Balazs Ujvari \u2013 Tel.: +32 460 760296; Claire Joawn \u2013 Tel.: +32 460 756859)</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a id=\"5\"></a>EU grants nearly \u20ac49 million to boost innovation in cybersecurity and privacy systems</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission announced today that it will commit nearly \u20ac41 million, through <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en\">Horizon 2020</a>, the EU's research and innovation programme, to support <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/news-redirect/677104\">9 projects</a> aimed at working on innovative cybersecurity and privacy solutions.

The proposed measures are temporary and aim at addressing the challenges faced by the organisers during the coronavirus outbreak, where public campaigning and paper collection of statements of support have become nearly impossible. For all the initiatives that were ongoing on 11 March 2020, the day when the World Health Organization declared the Coronavirus outbreak a worldwide pandemic, the Commission proposes to extend the period for collecting statements of support by 6 months. Initiatives that started their collection after 11 March and before 11 September should benefit from \u201ca proportionate extension\u201d. This means that the 1 year collection period will be counted only as of 11 September, however the ECIs can start collecting signatures already before that date. The Commission can introduce further prolongations to the collection periods in case of continued application of national measures in response to the pandemic or a new outbreak. Finally, the Commission proposal allows for possible extensions up to 3 months for the verification of the initiatives, which have completed their collection process. The possibility for an extension will also exist for the examination phase. The proposed temporary measures now need to be agreed by the European Parliament and the Council. The text of the proposal is available <a href=\"https://europa.eu/citizens-initiative/how-it-works/regulatory-framework_en\">online</a> and more information available on the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/citizens-initiative/home_en\">European Citizens' Initiatives website</a>. <em>(For more information: Christian Wigand - Tel.: +32 229 62253; Katarzyna Kolanko - Tel.:+32 229 6 34 44; Guillaume Mercier - Tel.: +32 229 80564)</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a id=\"9\"></a>Coronavirus: EU supports Member States dealing with the impact of the pandemic on the education, youth and culture sectors</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission is continuing to support EU Member States as they deal with the substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on schools and universities, on young people and on the cultural and creative sectors. At meetings via videoconference on 18 and 19 May 2020, EU Education, Youth and Culture Ministers shared information on their experiences of dealing with the crisis. Mariya <strong>Gabriel</strong>, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, updated them on the Commission's latest activities to help them find solutions. Commissioner <strong>Gabriel</strong> said: <em>\u201cDuring our constructive discussions over the past two days, I called on EU Ministers to back two initiatives under preparation under the Erasmus+ programme. The first would support distance learning and acquiring digital skills. The second would support skills development, digital competencies and social inclusion through the arts, linking our education, training and youth stakeholders with our grassroots organisations in the cultural and creative sectors.

Vice-President <strong>\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d</strong> asked to keep the momentum based on the increased uptake of electric vehicles, the expected electric vehicle production trends and EU's prospects of self-sufficiency in the lithium industry. Maro\u0161 <strong>\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d</strong>, Vice-President for Interinstitutional Relations and Foresight, said: <em>\u201cThe corona crisis has further highlighted the importance of the rationale behind the European Battery Alliance \u2013 to bolster Europe's resilience and strategic autonomy in critical industrial sectors and in key, game-changing technologies. I am pleased to see that the private sector has kept the momentum thanks to the traction created by the Alliance. Accelerating our work is both, possible and needed.

The support will take the form of direct grants and will be accessible to companies of all sizes, including the self-employed, active in the agriculture, fishery and aquaculture sectors in the territory of Campania. The purpose of the scheme is to address the liquidity needs of these companies and to help them continue their activities during and after the outbreak. The measure is expected to support over 1,000 enterprises. The Commission found that the Italian scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. In particular, aid does not exceed \u20ac120,000 per company active in the fishery and aquaculture sector and \u20ac100,000 per company active in the primary production of agricultural products. The Commission concluded that the measure is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework.

The Commission found that the amended Danish aid scheme will compensate damages that are directly linked to the coronavirus outbreak. It also found that the amended measure is proportionate, as the foreseen compensation does not exceed what is necessary to make good the damage. The Commission concluded that the amended scheme is in line with EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107(2)(b) TFEU, as it will contribute to mitigate the negative consequences of coronavirus for Danish businesses, without unduly distorting competition in the Internal Market.

The Commission has also unveiled its <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/2020-commission-work-programme-key-documents_en\">adjusted Work Programme for 2020</a>, which will prioritise the actions needed to propel Europe's recovery and resilience.</p>\n<p>The coronavirus has shaken Europe and the world to its core, testing healthcare and welfare systems, our societies and economies and our way of living and working together. To protect lives and livelihoods, repair the Single Market, as well as to build a lasting and prosperous recovery, the European Commission is proposing to harness the full potential of the EU budget. Next Generation EU of \u20ac750 billion as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027 will bring the total financial firepower of the EU budget to \u20ac1.85 trillion.</p>\n<p>European Commission President Ursula<strong> von der Leyen</strong> said: \u201c<em>The recovery plan turns the immense challenge we face into an opportunity, not only by supporting the recovery but also by investing in our future: the European Green Deal and digitalization will boost jobs and growth, the resilience of our societies and the health of our environment. This is Europe's moment. Our willingness to act must live up to the challenges we are all facing. With Next Generation EU we are providing an ambitious answer</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Commissioner Johannes<strong> Hahn</strong>, in charge of the EU budget, said: \u201c<em>Our common budget is at the heart of Europe's recovery plan. The additional firepower of Next Generation EU and the reinforced multiannual financial framework will give us the power of solidarity to support Member States and the economy. Together, Europe will arise more competitive, resilient and sovereign</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vice-President Maro\u0161<strong> \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d</strong>, in charge of interinstitutional relations and foresight, said: \u201c<em>The recovery will need strong policy direction. The adapted Work Programme, reflecting the new reality, shows that we will focus all our actions on overcoming the crisis, jumpstarting our economy and putting the European Union firmly on a resilient, sustainable and fair recovery path. It will help us rebound stronger</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>INVESTING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION </strong></p>\n<p>Complementing national efforts, the EU budget is uniquely placed to power a fair socio-economic recovery, repair and revitalise the Single Market, to guarantee a level playing field, and support the urgent investments, in particular in the green and digital transitions, which hold the key to Europe's future prosperity and resilience.</p>\n<p>Next Generation EU will raise money by temporarily lifting the own resources ceiling to 2.00% of EU Gross National Income, allowing the Commission to use its strong credit rating to borrow \u20ac750 billion on the financial markets. This additional funding will be channelled through EU programmes and repaid over a long period of time throughout future EU budgets \u2013 not before 2028 and not after 2058. To help do this in a fair and shared way, the Commission proposes a number of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/financing-recovery-plan-europe_en\">new own resources</a>. In addition, in order to make funds available as soon as possible to respond to the most pressing needs, the Commission proposes to amend the current multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 to make an additional \u20ac11.5 billion in funding available already in 2020.</p>\n<p>The money raised for Next Generation EU will be invested across<strong> three pillars:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

To increase <strong>crisis preparedness</strong> and crisis management, the Commission will reinforce the European Medicines Agency and give a stronger role to the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) in coordinating medical responses in crises.</p>\n<p>The recovery must unequivocally be based on <strong>fundamental rights and full respect of the rule of law</strong>. Any emergency measures must be limited in time and be strictly proportionate. The Commission's assessment will be included in the first report under the rule of law mechanism.</p>\n<p>We can and must learn the lessons from this crisis, but this can only be done by involving our citizens, communities and cities. The <strong>Conference on the Future of Europe</strong> will play an important role in further strengthening Europe's democratic foundations in the post-coronavirus crisis world.</p>\n<p><strong>RESPONSIBLE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP</strong></p>\n<p>The EU is committed in leading international efforts towards a truly global recovery, notably though joint coordination with the United Nations, the G20 and G7, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or the International Labour Organisation. The EU will continue working particularly closely with its immediate neighbourhood in the East and South and its partners in Africa.</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/03/26/joint-statement-of-the-members-of-the-european-council-26-march-2020/\">Joint Statement</a> of the Members of the European Council adopted on 26 March 2020 called on the European Commission to develop a coordinated exit strategy, a comprehensive recovery plan and unprecedented investment to allow a normal functioning of our societies and economies and get to sustainable growth, integrating inter alia the green transition and the digital transformation. On the basis of this mandate, on 15 April the Presidents of the Commission and the Council presented, as a first step, a Joint <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/european-roadmap-lifting-coronavirus-containment-measures_en\">European Roadmap towards lifting Covid-19 containment measures</a>. The package presented today, based on a revamped proposal for the next long-term EU budget and the updated Commission Work Programme for 2020, addresses the second part of the mandate, namely the need for a comprehensive recovery plan.</p>\n<p>The EU has already delivered a coordinated and powerful collective response to cushion the economic blow of the coronavirus crisis. We have relaxed our fiscal and state aid frameworks to give Member States room to act. We are using every available euro in the EU budget to support the healthcare sector, workers and businesses, and mobilising finance from the markets to help save jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-europes-moment-repair-and-prepare-next-generation_en\">Recovery Plan Communication: \u201cEurope's moment: Repair and Prepare for the Next Generation\u201d</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-commission-eu-budget-powering-recovery-plan-europe_en\">EU Budget Communication: \u201cThe EU budget powering the recovery plan for Europe\u201d</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/economy-finance/assessment_of_economic_and_investment_needs.pdf\">Staff working document</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-long-term-budget/2021-2027_en\">Website for the MFF proposals</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/2020-commission-work-programme-key-documents_en\">Website for the adjusted Commission Work Programme 2020</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Website on the Commission's coronavirus response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_935\">Q&amp;A on the MFF and Next Generation EU</a> <em><span lang=\"EN-IE\"><br></span></em></p>\n<p>Factsheet 1\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-budget-powering-recovery-plan-europe_en\">The EU budget powering the Recovery Plan for Europe</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Factsheet 2 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/key-instruments-supporting-recovery-plan-europe_en\">Key instruments supporting the Recovery Plan for Europe</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Factsheet 3 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/financing-recovery-plan-europe_en\">Financing the Recovery Plan for Europe</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Factsheet 4 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/2020-adjusted-commission-work-programme-2020-factshet_en\">Adjusted Commission Work Programme 2020</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_20_941\">Speech of President von der Leyen in European Parliament</a></p></div>",

However, as this recent sweep has shown, rogue traders continue to find new ways to exploit consumers' vulnerabilities, circumvent algorithmic checks and set up new websites. In the midst of a global pandemic, you need to be aware of this as a consumer \u2013 there are no miracle online cures. I am grateful that national consumer authorities remain on high alert and are working together with the Commission to protect consumers online.\u201d </em>The Consumer Protection Authorities of 27 countries participated in the high-level screening of platforms and submitted 126 replies concerning both the companies with which the Commission has been in regular contact and additional national players.

Private investment is essential to finance Europe's economy and businesses. It contributes to the creation of jobs and to the diversification of services and products in our Single Market. Mobilising private funding will be particularly important to cope with the negative economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. If we are to encourage individuals and businesses to invest across the EU and to benefit from the Single Market, then our investment environment needs clear and coherent rules, with effective remedies. As announced in the New Industrial Strategy for Europe, the new Action Plan on Capital Markets Union will include an initiative to strengthen intra-EU investment protection and efforts to unlock more diverse sources of funding for European businesses, especially SMEs. Following the recent <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/200505-bilateral-investment-treaties-agreement_en\">termination of the intra-EU Bilateral Investment Treaties, </a>today's public consultation invites EU citizens and other stakeholders to express their views on the strengths or weaknesses of cross-border investing in the EU. The aim is to assess the current framework of investment protection, including both substantive rules and dispute settlement mechanisms. Valdis <strong>Dombrovskis,</strong> Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said: <em>\u201cWe need to do everything we can to help Europe recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Fostering cross-border investment within the EU is now more important than ever. If we are to increase cross-border investment, we need to increase investors' confidence. I encourage as many stakeholders as possible to share their views and experiences concerning cross-border investing in the EU and how it can be improved.\u201d</em> The public consultation will feed into the Commission's upcoming policy initiatives. Respondents are encouraged to provide as much information as possible <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/finance-consultations-2020-investment-protection_en\">here</a>.

The Commission is concerned that the proposed transaction may reduce competition in the passenger air transport services between the European Economic Area (EEA) and Canada. Air Canada\u00a0and Transat are respectively the first and second largest providers of scheduled passenger air transport services between the EEA and Canada. At this stage, the Commission is concerned that the proposed transaction could significantly reduce competition on 33 origin and destination (O&amp;D) citypairs between the EEA and Canada. The Commission's preliminary market investigation revealed that Air Canada and Transat have been historically competing head-to-head for the passenger air transport services between the EEA and Canada. At this stage, the Commission found that even if the Canadian airline WestJet has expanded its transatlantic operations to the EEA countries, it is unlikely that WestJet would exert a sufficient competitive constraint on the merged entity with respect to the O&amp;Ds that the Commission found problematic following its preliminary market investigation. The Commission investigated the extent to which the coronavirus crisis would impact Air Canada, Transat and their competitors' operations and hence the competitive landscape in the mid- and long-term. The Commission will now carry out an in-depth investigation into the effects of the proposed transaction to determine whether it is likely to significantly reduce effective competition. Air Canada and Transat have decided not to submit commitments during the initial investigation to address the Commission's preliminary concerns. The opening of an in-depth investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation. Executive Vice-President Margrethe <strong>Vestager</strong>, responsible for competition policy, said: \u201c<em>Air Canada and Transat are the two leading airlines operating a wide network of routes between Europe and Canada. We will carefully assess whether the proposed transaction would negatively affect competition in these markets leading to higher prices, reduced quality or less choice for travellers flying over the Atlantic. This is a challenging time, especially in markets severely impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, but a return to normal and healthy market conditions must be based on markets that remain competitive.\u201d </em>The full press release is available <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_934\">online</a><em>.

The scheme is part of a wider Polish support programme, the so-called \u201cFinancial Shield for Large Enterprises.\u201d The total amount of loans that can be granted under the scheme is PLN 10 billion (approximately \u20ac2.2 billion). Under the scheme, the public support will take the form of subsidised loans at favourable interest rates. The scheme, which will be managed by the Polish Development Fund, is mostly targeted at large enterprises. It will however also be open to certain small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) registered in Poland, which will be eligible based on criteria defined by Poland. The scheme aims at enhancing access to liquidity for companies that are severely affected by the outbreak, thus helping them continue their activities, start investments and maintain employment. The Commission found that the Polish scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission therefore concluded that the measure is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework.

Trade credit insurance protects companies supplying goods and services against the risk of nonpayment by their clients. Given the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the risk of insurers not being willing to issue this insurance has become higher. The Dutch scheme ensures that trade credit insurance continues to be available to all companies, avoiding the need for buyers of goods or services to pay in advance, therefore reducing their immediate liquidity needs. The Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, and in particular <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12008E107&amp;from=EN\">Article 107(3)(b)</a> of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which enables the Commission to approve State aid measures implemented by Member States to remedy a serious disturbance in their economy.

In addition, the Commission is providing direct funding for the work of humanitarian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, which are in the frontline of the humanitarian response to Coronavirus.</li>\n<li>EU Humanitarian Air Bridge: On 8 May, the Commission also announced the establishment of an EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to transport humanitarian workers and emergency supplies for the Coronavirus response to some of the most critically affected areas around the world. The first flight on 8 May, operated in cooperation with France, transported around 60 humanitarian workers from various NGOs and UN agencies and 13 tonnes of humanitarian cargo to Bangui in the Central African Republic. Two subsequent humanitarian cargo flights to Central African Republic will transport a further 27 tonnes of humanitarian supplies in total.On 15 May, on the second destination of the EU humanitarian air bridge 20 tons of supplies and humanitarian and health workers were flown to the West-African country of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe. The flight was set-up in cooperation with the Portuguese government and several humanitarian partner organisations. On their return leg, the flight also brought back over 200 EU citizens and other passengers to Lisbon in a repatriation effort.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The additional humanitarian funding comes on top of some \u20ac20 billion in development and emergency funding from the Commission and Member States for both short-term and long-term needs around the world as part of a \u201cTeam Europe\u201d approach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/crisis-management-and-solidarity_en#assistance-outside-the-eu\">A global European Union response to the pandemic</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_813\">Coronavirus Global Response: EU sets up a Humanitarian Air Bridge</a></p></div>",

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, the Commission registered \u20ac7.4 billion, equivalent to $8 billion, in pledges from donors worldwide during the Coronavirus Global Response pledging event. This includes a pledge of \u20ac1.4 billion by the Commission. This almost reaches the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_710\">initial target</a> of \u20ac7.5 billion and is a solid starting point for the worldwide pledging marathon, which begins today. The aim is to gather significant funding to ensure the collaborative development and universal deployment of <strong>diagnostics, treatments </strong>and<strong> vaccines</strong> against coronavirus.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission, Ursula<strong> von der Leyen</strong>, said: <em>\u201cToday the world showed extraordinary unity for the common good. Governments and global health organisations joined forces against coronavirus. With such commitment, we are on track for developing, producing and deploying a vaccine for all. However, this is only the beginning. We need to sustain the effort and to stand ready to contribute more. The pledging marathon will continue. After governments, civil society and people worldwide need to join in, in a global mobilisation of hope and resolve.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The pledging event was co-convened by the European Union, Canada, France, Germany, Italy (also incoming G20 presidency), Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (also holding the G20 presidency), Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. The initiative is a response to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/access-to-covid-19-tools-(act)-accelerator\">call</a> from the World Health Organization (WHO) and a group of health actors for a global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global access to new coronavirus essential health technologies. The Coronavirus Global Response Initiative is comprised of <strong>three partnerships</strong> for testing, treating and preventing underpinned by health systems strengthening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>An ongoing pledging marathon</strong></p>\n<p>Today is an extraordinary achievement but also the start of a process to mobilise more resources. The initial target of \u20ac7.5 billion will not be enough to ensure the distribution of coronavirus health technologies worldwide, as this involves significant costs in terms of production, procurement and distribution.</p>\n<p>To help reach the objectives of the Coronavirus Global Response, the European Commission is committing \u20ac1 billion in grants and \u20ac400 million in guarantees on loans through reprioritisation of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en\">Horizon 2020</a> (\u20ac1 billion), <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/resceu_en\">RescEU</a> (\u20ac80 million), the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_577\">Emergency Support Instrument</a> (\u20ac150 million) and\u00a0<a href=\"https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/75968/eu-action-against-covid-19_en\">external instruments</a> (\u20ac170 million).</p>\n<p>\u20ac100 million will be donated to CEPI and \u20ac158 million to the World Health Organization. EU-funded calls for proposals and subsequent projects under Horizon 2020 will be aligned with the objectives of the three partnerships and subject to open access to data. Funding under RescEU will go towards the procurement, stockpiling and distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.</p>\n<p>Donors are invited to continue pledging to the Coronavirus Global Response. They can choose which priority to donate to \u2013 Test, Treat or Prevent. They can also donate to the horizontal work stream of the Coronavirus Global Response, aiming to help health systems in the world cope with the pandemic.</p>\n<p>The Commission will soon announce the breakdown of the amount raised today and how much will go to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and health systems strengthening related to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>A cooperation framework to align global efforts</strong></p>\n<p>A universal and affordable <strong>Access to COVID-19 Tools</strong> (ACT-Accelerator) was the main objective of the 24 April <a href=\"https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/access-to-covid-19-tools-(act)-accelerator\">call to action</a> from global health partners. For this, significant funding is needed, as well as a solid collaborative structure, with a clarity of purpose to ensure that the donated money is put to good use and to avoid fragmentation of efforts.</p>\n<p>Based on discussions with public and private sector partners as well as non-profit organisations, the European Commission proposes a collaborative framework for the ACT-accelerator global response. This framework is designed as a coordination structure to steer and oversee progress made globally in accelerating work on developing vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics with universal access as well as strengthening health systems as required for meeting these three priorities.</p>\n<p>This collaboration framework is intended to be time-bound (2 years, renewable) and build on existing organisations without creating any new structures. In the European Commission's view, it would bring together partners like the WHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and some of the initial convenor countries\u00a0 as well as many recognised global health actors such as CEPI, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund or UNITAID.</p>\n<p>The core of the framework would be <strong>three partnerships </strong>based on the three priorities of the Coronavirus Global Response. They gather industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations, with a \u201cwhole-value-chain\u201d approach: from research to manufacturing and deployment. The three partnerships would work as autonomously as possible, with a transversal work stream on enhancing the capacity of health systems and knowledge and data sharing.</p>\n<p>The Commission registers and keeps track of pledges up until end of May but will not receive any payments into its accounts. Funds go directly to the recipients. Recipients will, however, not decide alone on the use of the donation, but deploy it in concertation with the partnership.The commitment is for all new vaccines, diagnostics and treatments against coronavirus to be made available globally for an affordable price, regardless of where they were developed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p>The global response must also include civil society, and the global community of citizens. For that reason, the European Commission is joining forces with NGOs such as Global Citizen and other partners.</p>\n<p>The Global Vaccines Summit that Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will organise on 4 June will mobilise additional funding to protect the next generation with vaccines. As the world relies on Gavi's work for making vaccination available everywhere, the success of Gavi's replenishment will be crucial to the success of the Coronavirus Global Response.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The Coronavirus Global Response builds on the commitment made by G20 leaders on 26 March.</p>\n<p>Grounded in a vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of the coronavirus, an initial group of global health actors launched a call to action for global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global access to new coronavirus essential health technologies.</p>\n<p>On 24 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) and an initial group of health actors launched a collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global Access to COVID-19 Tools \u2013 the ACT Accelerator. Together, they issued a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/access-to-covid-19-tools-(act)-accelerator\">call to action</a>.</p>\n<p>The European Commission responded to this call by joining forces with global partners to host a pledging event \u2013 the Coronavirus Global Response Initiative \u2013 as of 4 May 2020.</p>\n<p>Funding, including the EU contribution, pledged since 30 January 2020 \u2013 the date when the WHO declared coronavirus a global health emergency \u2013 will be counted as part of the Coronavirus Global Response funding target with the commitment that these will contribute to and align with the ACT-Accelerator framework.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://europa.eu/global-response/\">Coronavirus Global Response website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_731\">Questions and Answers: the Coronavirus Global Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/coronavirus-global-response-factsheet_en\">Factsheet \u2013 The Coronavirus Global Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">The Commission's Coronavirus Response</a></p></div>",

It will help immunise 300 million children around the world and finance vaccine stockpiles to shield against outbreaks of infectious diseases.</p>\n<p>Today's Global Vaccine Summit organised by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is an important milestone in strengthening health systems and immunisation capacities of the world's most vulnerable countries. This is instrumental in reaching the objectives of the <a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\" target=\"_blank\">Coronavirus Global Response</a>.</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_797\" target=\"_blank\">Coronavirus Global Response pledging event</a> co-hosted by the European Commission on 4 May, more than \u20ac1.5 billion was pledged for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, including \u20ac488 million for deploying, once available, a vaccine against coronavirus.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong> said, <em>\u201cVaccines can only save lives if everyone who needs them can access them, especially in the most vulnerable communities and regions of the world. This is why Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance's work is so important. It gives developing countries the means to build stronger health systems and immunisation programmes, to make the world a safer place. I am glad that the European Commission can support Gavi in such a crucial endeavour. This will help us overcome this pandemic and avoid another.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta <strong>Urpilainen</strong> said, \u201c<em>Building up immunisation systems is a fundamental part of the work the EU does with partner countries and Gavi to strengthen health systems, which will be more important than ever on our road to recovery from COVID-19. Improving children's access to basic health care, notably effective and safe vaccines, was key to almost halving global child mortality between 2000 and 2017. Ensuring more vulnerable children have continued access to vaccines will be key for our collective success over the next five years.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The new Commission pledge of \u20ac300 million represents more than its total contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance so far. The funding will help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vaccinate 300 million children and save up to 8 million lives.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n<li>Ensure the successful transition of some countries into self-financing.</li>\n<li>Leverage US$ 3.6 billion in national co-financing and self-funded vaccine programmes.</li>\n<li>Deliver over 3.2 billion doses of life-saving vaccines to 55 countries.</li>\n<li>Facilitate 1.4 billion contacts between families and health services through vaccination.</li>\n<li>Insure the world against the re-emergence of polio through routine inactivated polio vaccine programmes in collaboration with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.</li>\n<li>Fund vaccine stockpiles for emergency use to stop dangerous outbreaks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today's pledge is made under the assumption that the EU's new\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/documents/multiannual-financial-framework/2021-2027_en\" target=\"_blank\">Multiannual Financial Framework</a> and in particular the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/documents/eu-budget-future-neighbourhood-development-and-international-cooperation-instrument_en\" target=\"_blank\">Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI)</a>, where the funds pledged for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, would come from, are adopted broadly along the lines proposed by the European Commission. On 2 June, the Commission proposed to increase NDICI funding for 2021-2027 to \u20ac86 billion in 2018 prices (\u20ac96.4 billion in current prices), including \u20ac10.5 billion from the new \u2018Next Generation EU'.</p>\n<p><strong>Background<br> </strong></p>\n<p>Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is a non-profit global public-private partnership, based in Geneva. Gavi's model is designed to leverage financial resources and expertise, bringing together governments and vaccine manufacturers in both industrialised and developing countries, key UN agencies, public health and research institutions, private sector and civil society, to save lives and protect health by increasing access to new and underused vaccines in poor countries. By August 2019, Gavi had helped avert 13 million deaths through routine immunisation for more than 760 million people as well as campaigns in 74 countries to immunise more than 960 million people.</p>\n<p>Gavi is one of the 12 global health initiatives that have committed to working better together in the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Wellbeing for All, launched during the High Level Event at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019.</p>\n<p>The Coronavirus Global Response builds on the commitment made by G20 leaders on 26 March to present a united front against the pandemic. With this in mind, on 24 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) and an initial group of health actors launched a global collaboration for the accelerated development, production and equitable global Access to COVID-19 Tools \u2013 the ACT Accelerator. Together, they issued a call to action.</p>\n<p>The European Commission responded to this call by joining forces with global partners to host a pledging event \u2013 the Coronavirus Global Response Initiative \u2013 as of 4 May 2020.</p>\n<p>The Coronavirus Global Response has so far raised \u20ac9.8 billion.

Team Europe's support to the whole African continent in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic amounts to \u20ac3.25 billion, reaffirming the EU's leading partner to African countries. This funding is helping countries strengthen their health system, support their economies in these challenging times, train health staff and reinforce social support systems.</p>\n<p><strong><em>EU humanitarian and development aid support in the DRC</em></strong></p>\n<p>Humanitarian needs in the DRC are among the highest in the world. While battling the coronavirus pandemic, the country continues to grapple with Ebola (the 11<sup>th</sup> Ebola virus disease outbreak declared on 01 June 2020, just as the 10<sup>th</sup> one was dwindling), a measles outbreak, and cholera. The EU's 2020 humanitarian funding in the DRC includes recently announced EU humanitarian assistance in reaction to the coronavirus pandemic: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/news/coronavirus-global-response-eu-allocates-additional-50-million-humanitarian-aid_en\">\u20ac4.5 million</a> is allocated to coronavirus infection prevention and control measures, and access to quality health care, water, sanitation and hygiene. An additional \u20ac2.78 million has been channeled to the World Health Organization (WHO) to support early detection and response, and expertise on the ground.</p>\n<p>Through its development aid, the EU is also, among other sectors, supporting the health care system in the DRC through a multi-year programme (2014-2020) with an overall budget of \u20ac222 million. It aims at improving both the accessibility and quality of health services through support to health centres and hospitals, to local health supervision authorities, and the medicines supply system.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information </strong></p>\n<p>Factsheets:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/hab_en.pdf\">EU Humanitarian Air Bridge</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/where/africa/congo_en\">EU humanitarian aid in the Democratic Republic of Congo</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/wa_ebola_en.pdf?\">EU response to the Ebola epidemic in the DRC</a></p></div>",

The EIC responded quickly to the coronavirus crisis and demonstrated the agility and impact of EU funding.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The selected 36 companies that will contribute to the fight against the coronavirus will work on pioneering projects, such as on expanding the production of bio-decontamination wipes, developing ventilation monitoring systems that provide first aiders with real-time feedback on the quality of the ventilation given to the patient, developing an antibody platform to treat severe cases of infection, and many more. Furthermore, 139 companies tackling the coronavirus that could not receive funding in this round due to budget limitations have received the newly introduced COVID-19 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/seal-excellence_en\">Seal of Excellence</a>, in recognition of the value of their proposal and in order to help them attract support from other funding sources.</p>\n<p>An additional 36 companies, set to support the recovery plan for Europe, will work across a multitude of sectors and projects, which include for example the development of stronger and taller wind turbine towers made from wood modules, with the potential to massively reduce wind energy costs, an organic fertilizer production system, and a blockchain-based solution for sustainable recycling practices of manufacturers. And, another 679 Seals of Excellence were awarded to high-quality proposals who passed the EIC funding criteria, but could not be funded due to limited budget.</p>\n<p>A record number of almost 4000 start-ups and small and medium businesses (SMEs) applied to the EIC Accelerator pilot in March, of which over 1400 proposed innovations relevant to the coronavirus outbreak.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today the Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-third-assessment-application-temporary-restriction-non-essential-travel-eu_en\">recommends</a> to Schengen Member States and Schengen Associated States to lift internal border controls by 15 June 2020 and to prolong the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU until 30 June 2020; and sets out an approach to progressively lifting the restriction afterwards.</p>\n<p>Given that the health situation in certain third countries remains critical, the Commission does not propose a general lifting of the travel restriction at this stage. The restriction should be lifted for countries selected together by Member States, based on a set of principles and objective criteria including the health situation, the ability to apply containment measures during travel, and reciprocity considerations, taking into account data from relevant sources such as ECDC and WHO.</p>\n<p>For countries towards which the restriction remains in place, the Commission proposes to enlarge the categories of permitted travellers to include, for instance, international students. The Commission is also issuing <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/guidance-phased-and-coordinated-resumption-visa-operations_en\">guidance</a> to Member States to ensure that the resumption of visa operations abroad is well coordinated with the gradual lifting of the travel restrictions.</p>\n<p>Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva<strong> Johansson</strong>,said: \u201c<em>Following the lifting of all internal border checks inside the Union, we are proposing a clear and flexible approach towards removing r</em><em>estrictions on travel to the EU starting on 1 July. </em><em>International travel is key for tourism and business, and for family and friends reconnecting. While we will all have to remain careful, the time has come to make concrete preparations for lifting restrictions with countries whose health situation is similar to the EU's and for resuming visa operations.\u201d </em></p>\n<p><strong>Gradually removing restrictions on travel to the EU</strong></p>\n<p>Actions at the EU's external borders must be coordinated and uniform to be effective. As travellers entering the EU can move freely from one country to another, it is crucial that Member States coordinate their decisions on lifting travel restrictions. This is why Member States should agree on a <strong>common list of non-EU countries</strong> for which travel restrictions can be lifted as of 1 July, to be reviewed on a regular basis. To this end, the Commission proposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective criteria</strong>: The decision to lift restrictions for a specific country should be based on the epidemiological situation and coronavirus response in that country, the ability to apply containment measures during travel, and whether or not that country has lifted travel restrictions towards the EU. Restrictions should be lifted first with countries whose epidemiological situation is similar to the EU average and where sufficient capabilities to deal with the virus are in place. Restrictions should remain in place for countries whose situation is worse than in the EU. The Commission proposes a detailed <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/annex-communication-third-assessment-application-temporary-restriction-non-essential-travel-eu_en\">checklist</a> to help Member States reach a common assessment. Decisions on lifting travel restrictions would concern non-EU nationals residing in a specific country (not its nationals).</li>\n<li><strong>Common and coordinated approach</strong>: The Commission proposes a coordination mechanism whereby it would support Member States and Schengen Associated States at technical level and facilitate the preparation of a list of countries for which travel restrictions could be lifted. Decisions on lifting restrictions should then be prepared with Member States under the EU's integrated political crisis response mechanism. Member States should adopt such decisions in a coordinated manner and ensure uniform application across the EU. This will be a dynamic process and the integrated political crisis response mechanism would need to coordinate further updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: It will be possible to reintroduce travel restrictions for a specific country if the criteria are no longer met. In addition, Member States can still refuse entry to a non-EU traveller presenting a threat to public health, even coming from a country for which restrictions were lifted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In line with the proposed checklist, the Commission also recommends to lift travel restrictions for <strong>Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia</strong> and <strong>Serbia</strong> as of 1 July, given that their epidemiological situation is similar or better than that of the EU. This also follows on the Commission's readiness to closely associate the Western Balkans region with the implementation of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_652\">roadmap</a> towards lifting containment measures.</p>\n<p>Where the travel restrictions continue to apply, Member States should ensure that <strong>those travelling to study </strong>are exempted, together with <strong>highly skilled non-EU workers</strong> if their employment is necessary from an economic perspective and the work cannot be postponed or performed abroad. EU citizens and citizens of Schengen Associated States and non-EU nationals legally residing in the EU, as well as their family members, should also be exempt from the travel restriction regardless of whether or not they are returning home, as was the case until now.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_652\">roadmap</a> on lifting containment measures presented on 15 April, the Commission indicated that travel restrictions within the EU would need to start being lifted gradually before restrictions at the external borders can be relaxed in a second stage. This is now well under way, with several Member States having already lifted restrictions within the EU and others planning to do so as of 15 June 2020. The Commission strongly encourages the remaining Member States to <strong>finalise the process of removing restrictions to free movement and lifting internal border controls</strong> within the EU <strong>by 15 June 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Resuming visa operations</strong></p>\n<p>Most Member States decided to suspend or reduce the processing of visa applications as part of pandemic-related measures. Travellers will need to be able to access visa services again and Member States should <strong>synchronise the resumption of visa operations </strong>with the lifting of travel restrictions. This is why today the Commission presents <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/guidance-phased-and-coordinated-resumption-visa-operations_en\">guidance</a> for a phased and coordinated return of visa operations to normal.</p>\n<p>A harmonised approach is best achieved through consulates simultaneously resuming operations in each location and through full implementation of <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02009R0810-20200202\">EU visa rules</a>, together with good communication towards the public. The guidance also covers hygiene measures and precautions for receiving visa applicants.</p>\n<p>Finally, if a Member State requires health checks, these should take place at the time of travel or shortly before, rather than when applying for a visa; and should apply to all travellers from a given location irrespective of their nationality or visa status.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>The Commission <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:115:FIN\">invited</a> Heads of State or Government on 16 March 2020 to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for an initial period of 30 days, subsequently extending it twice<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_823\">until 15 June</a>.</p>\n<p>The travel restriction, as well as today's invitation to prolong it until 30 June, applies to all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) \u2013 30 countries in total.

The deal will also allow the company to expand its manufacturing capacity\u00a0in order to supply the vaccine fast worldwide in response to the pandemic. This will be done at the company's own risk while the clinical studies are ongoing. BioNTech became the first European company to enter clinical testing, having started a clinical trial in Germany in April and a further clinical trial in the United States at the beginning of May. BioNTech's development programme for BNT162 is one of the broadest development programmes globally, with four vaccine candidates being tested in parallel.</p>\n<p>mRNA vaccines consist of genetic material, called messenger RNA, that provides instructions for a human cell to make a target protein, or immunogen, which activates the body's immune response against the respective virus. The goal of a vaccine is to stimulate the immune system to generate protective, long-lasting antibody and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and prevent subsequent infection upon exposure to the virus. mRNA vaccines are a potent new developmental class of vaccines with potential for high versatility and favourable safety properties. BioNTech was able to bring the first vaccine candidates from concept into clinical testing in less than three months. Safety, speed and flexibility are of the utmost importance in reacting to the current pandemic.</p>\n<p>The EIB debt investment will be disbursed in two tranches of \u20ac50\u00a0million each, following completion of pre-defined milestones. It is backed by the <a href=\"https://www.eib.org/en/efsi/index.htm\">European Fund for Strategic Investments</a>, the financial heart of the Investment Plan for Europe, in which the EIB and the European Commission partner to kick-off investment for EU priority projects.

For this purpose we recently launched the Coronavirus Global Response initiative, while at the same time we mobilised significant funding through Horizon 2020 for research projects aimed at developing a prophylactic and a therapeutic vaccine.

The Trust Fund reinforces an integrated EU response to the crisis and primarily addresses longer-term resilience and needs to enhance the self-reliance of Syrian refugees. At the same time, it contributes to ease the pressure on host communities and the administrations in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The Trust Fund has also underpinned the EU Compacts agreed with Jordan and Lebanon to better assist them in coping with the protracted refugee crisis. With the newly adopted package, it has mobilised over \u20ac900 million for Lebanon, over \u20ac500 million for both Jordan and Turkey and more than \u20ac160 million for Iraq. Overall, more than \u20ac2.2 billion have been mobilised from the EU budget and contributions from 21 EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.</p>\n<p>The Trust Fund's programmes support basic education and child protection services for refugees, training and higher education, better access to healthcare, improved access to water and wastewater infrastructure, support to resilience, women empowerment and fighting gender based violence, as well as economic opportunities and social stability.

They originated from within as well as outside the EU. To fight disinformation, we need to mobilise all relevant players from online platforms to public authorities, and support independent fact checkers and media. While online platforms have taken positive steps during the pandemic, they need to step up their efforts. Our actions are strongly embedded in fundamental rights, in particular freedom of expression and information.\u201d</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The crisis has become a test case showing how the EU and its democratic societies deal with the disinformation challenge. The following aspects are key for a stronger and more resilient EU: </span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Understand</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">: First, it is important to distinguish between illegal content and content that is harmful but not illegal. Then, there are blurred boundaries between the various forms of false or misleading content: from disinformation, which is defined as intentional, to misinformation, which can be unintentional. The motivation can range from targeted influence operations by foreign actors to purely economic motives. A calibrated response is needed to each of these challenges. Furthermore, there is a need to provide more data for public scrutiny and improve analytical capacities. </span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Communicate</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">: During the crisis, the EU has been stepping up its work to inform citizens about the risks and to enhance cooperation with other international actors to tackle disinformation.

The European External Action Service, together with the Commission, enhanced strategic communication and public diplomacy in third countries, including the EU's neighbourhood. Foreign actors and certain third countries, in particular Russia and China, have engaged in targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally. For example, the EEAS East Stratcom Task Force detected and exposed more than 550 disinformation narratives from pro-Kremlin sources on the </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><a href=\"https://euvsdisinfo.eu/\">EUvsDisinfo website</a></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"5Normal\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Cooperation </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">has been an important cornerstone of the fight against disinformation:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>With <span lang=\"EN-GB\">the European Parliament and the Council and between EU institutions and Member States</span><strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">,</span></strong></strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> by using established channels, such as the </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><a href=\"https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/ras_factsheet_march_2019_0.pdf\">Rapid Alert System</a></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> and the EU </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><a href=\"https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/412/Crisis%20management%20and%20Response\">integrated political crisis response</a></span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, to help protect people everywhere, the European Commission is presenting a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of vaccines against COVID-19. An effective and safe vaccine against the virus is our best bet to achieve a permanent solution to the pandemic. Time is of the essence. Every month gained in finding such a vaccine saves lives, livelihoods and billions of euros. Today's strategy proposes a joint EU approach and builds on the mandate received from EU health ministers.</p>\n<p>European Commission President Ursula<strong> von der Leyen</strong> said: <em>\u201cThis is a moment for science and solidarity. Nothing is certain, but I am confident that we can mobilise the resources to find a vaccine to beat this virus once and for all. We must be ready to manufacture and deploy such a vaccine across Europe and the world. This vaccine will be a breakthrough in the fight against the coronavirus, and a </em><em>testament to what partners can achieve when we put our minds, research and resources together. The European Union will do all in its power to ensure that all peoples of this world have access to a vaccine, irrespective of where they live.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong> said: <em>\u201cWorking together will increase our chances of securing access to a safe and effective vaccine at the scale we need and as quickly as possible. It will ensure fair and equitable access for all across the EU and globally, thus offering the best opportunity of finding a permanent exit strategy from the COVID-19 crisis. This is the EU at its best: pooling resources, joining efforts, bringing tangible results to the everyday lives of people. No one is safe until everyone is safe and we will leave no stones unturned in our efforts to protect EU and global citizens.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Vaccine development is a complex and lengthy process. With today's strategy, the Commission will support efforts to accelerate the development and availability of safe and effective vaccines in a timeframe between 12 and 18 months, if not earlier. Delivering on this complex undertaking requires running clinical trials in parallel with investing in production capacity to be able to produce millions, or even billions, of doses of a successful vaccine. The Commission is fully mobilised to support the efforts of vaccine developers in their endeavour.</p>\n<p>This is not a European challenge, but a global one. The European Union will not be safe until the entire world has access to a vaccine, and as such, the EU and its Member States have both a responsibility and an interest to make a vaccine universally available.</p>\n<p>An important step towards joint action between Member States has already been taken in the formation of an inclusive vaccine Alliance by France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The EU Vaccine Strategy will implement a joint approach going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>The strategy has the following objectives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensuring the <strong>quality, safety and efficacy </strong>of vaccines.</li>\n<li>Securing <strong>swift access</strong> to vaccines for Member States and their populations while leading the global solidarity effort.</li>\n<li>Ensuring <strong>equitable access</strong> to an affordable vaccine as early as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The EU strategy rests on two pillars:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Securing the production of vaccines in the EU and sufficient supplies for its Member States </strong>through Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers via the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/emergency-support-instrument_en\">Emergency Support Instrument</a>. Additional financing and other forms of support can be made available on top of such agreements.</li>\n<li><strong>Adapting the EU's</strong> <strong>regulatory framework to the current urgency and making use of existing regulatory flexibility </strong>to accelerate the development, authorisation and availability of vaccines while maintaining the standards for vaccine quality, safety and efficacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Advance Purchase Agreements</strong></p>\n<p>In order to support companies in the swift development and production of a vaccine, the Commission will enter into agreements with individual vaccine producers on behalf of the Member States. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission will finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers. This will take the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided will be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.</p>\n<p>The related funding will come from a significant part of the \u20ac2.7 billion <strong>Emergency Support Instrument</strong>. Additional support will be available through loans from the European Investment Bank.</p>\n<p><strong>Financing criteria </strong></p>\n<p>When taking the financing decision on what vaccines to support, the following non-exhaustive criteria will be taken into account, including: soundness of scientific approach and technology used, speed of delivery at scale, cost, risk sharing, liability, coverage of different technologies, early engagement with EU regulators, global solidarity, and capacity to supply through development of production capacity within the EU.</p>\n<p>There is always a risk that supported candidates fail during clinical trials. This Strategy is therefore similar to an insurance policy, by transferring some of the risks from industry to public authorities in return for assuring Member States of equitable and affordable access to a vaccine, should one become available.</p>\n<p><strong>A flexible and robust regulatory process</strong></p>\n<p>Regulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will make the greatest use of existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. This includes an accelerated procedure for authorisation, flexibility in relation to labelling and packaging, and a proposal to provide temporary derogations from certain provisions of the GMO legislation to speed up clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines containing genetically modified organisms.</p>\n<p>Companies with a promising vaccine candidate, already in or close to starting clinical trials, are invited to contact the Commission at <a href=\"mailto:EC-VACCINES@ec.europa.eu\">EC-VACCINES@ec.europa.eu</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Global solidarity </strong></p>\n<p>The EU is contributing to the global effort for universal testing, treatment and vaccination by mobilising resources through international pledging and by joining forces with countries and global health organisations through the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/access-to-covid-19-tools-(act)-accelerator\">Access To Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator</a> collaborative framework. The Global Coronavirus Response pledging campaign raised \u20ac9.8 billion by the end of May 2020. A second step is underway in partnership with Global Citizen and other governmental and non-governmental partners, culminating in a global pledging summit on 27 June.</p>\n<p>The European Commission is committed to the principle of universal, equitable and affordable access to vaccines, especially for the most vulnerable countries. It is ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world.</p>\n<p><strong>More information</strong></p>\n<p>President von der Leyen's video message is available in <a href=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-192140\">English</a>, <a href=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-192196\">French</a>, <a href=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-192197\">German</a>, and <a href=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-192198\">sign language</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">Communication on the EU Strategy for COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/public-health/coronavirus-vaccines-strategy_en\">Coronavirus Vaccines Strategy Factsheet</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Website on the Commission's Coronavirus Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\">Coronavirus Global Response Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/coronavirus-global-response-united-make-world-safer-place_en\">Coronavirus Global Response Factsheet</a></p></div>",

It will provide real-time information on borders and available means of transport and tourism services in Member States. Re-open EU will also include practical information provided by Member States on travel restrictions, public health and safety measures such as on physical distancing or wearing of facemasks, as well as other useful information on EU and national tourism offers. This will allow Europeans to take responsible and well-informed decisions on how to manage continuing risks related to Coronavirus while planning their holidays and travels during this summer and beyond.</p>\n<p>Thierry <strong>Breton</strong>, Commissioner for Internal Market, said: <em>\u201cAfter weeks of confinement, EU internal borders are reopening. The Re-open EU website we are launching today will provide travellers with easy access to information to help them confidently make their travel plans and stay safe during their trip. It will also help small restaurant and hotel owners, as well as towns across Europe, draw inspiration from innovative solutions developed by others.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Mariya <strong>Gabriel</strong>, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, and responsible for the Joint Research Centre (JRC), said: <em>\u201cEurope's vast and rich cultural heritage is one of our major assets. But with no possibility to travel and with most venues closed these past months, culture and tourism have been hit hard. The Re-open EU platform provides up to date, essential information so that we can start exploring Europe safely again\u201d. </em></p>\n<p>The Re-open EU platform is part of the Commission's <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-commission-tourism-transport-2020-and-beyond_en.pdf\">Tourism and Transport package</a> of 13 May 2020, launched to rebuild confidence among travellers in the EU and help European tourism resume safely, in line the necessary health precautions. The new <a href=\"https://reopen.europa.eu/\">platform</a>, which also comes with a mobile friendly version (a web-based app), acts as a key point of reference for anyone travelling in the EU as it centralises up-to-date information from the Commission and the Member States in one place. It will allow people to browse country-specific information, updates and advice for each EU Member State through an interactive map. It will be easily accessible via app or website, and be available in the 24 official EU languages.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the platform includes information on <strong>patronage voucher schemes</strong> that allow consumers to show support for their favourite hotels or restaurants by buying vouchers for a future stay or meal once they reopen, to help the European hospitality industry as restrictions are lifted and borders reopen. Patronage vouchers help businesses to overcome cash-flow bottlenecks, with services provided later. The amount paid by the customer goes directly to the service provider. By setting up the dedicated page, the Commission intends to help better link participating businesses and interested customers, especially when travelling abroad.</p>\n<p>Finally, Europe's digital cultural platform, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/europeana-platform-europes-digital-cultural-collection-responsible-accessible-sustainable-and\"><strong>Europeana</strong></a>, is launching <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/discovering-europe\">Discovering Europe</a>, a collection of art works and photographs of some of Europe's most iconic landmarks. Furthermore, a dedicated tourism hub will be created on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/discovering-europe%20\"><strong>Europeana Pro</strong></a> to help cultural heritage professionals discover initiatives supporting tourism throughout the EU.</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission package on tourism and transport in 2020 and beyond, adopted on 13 May 2020, announced the publication of a dedicated website to provide travellers with all relevant information to travel safely in the EU.\u00a0The Commission also announced its intention to build on the momentum of patronage voucher schemes and work with national authorities, local tourism organisations and businesses to multiply and scale up such initiatives.</p>\n<p>Ministers responsible for tourism first discussed the launch of a dedicated Re-open EU platform during their 20 May video conference and broadly welcomed the initiative. Developed by the Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), Re-open EU offers real-time information covering some 30 indicators on transport, public health and tourism, provided by Member States and supplemented by data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).</p>\n<p>On 11 June 2020, the Commission presented its <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1035\">recommendations</a> for a partial and gradual lifting of travel restrictions to the EU after 30 June and called on Member States to remove restrictions to free movement and lift internal border controls by 15 June, considering the improving health situation in the EU and the implementation of physical distancing and other health-related measures by Member States.</p>\n<p>Through Re-open EU, the Commission also provides relevant information on tourism offers in different Member States, including EU actions such as European Capitals of Smart Tourism, European Destinations of Excellence (EDEN) and the European Capitals of Culture.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reopen.europa.eu/#/en\">Re-Open EU website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/europeana-platform-europes-digital-cultural-collection-responsible-accessible-sustainable-and\"><strong>Europeana </strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/discovering-europe%20\"><strong>Discovering Europe</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/discovering-europe%20\">Europeana Pro</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_854\">Tourism and Transport package</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-third-assessment-application-temporary-restriction-non-essential-travel-eu_en\">Communication on the third assessment of the application of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/consumers/resolve-your-consumer-complaint/european-consumer-centres-network-ecc-net_en\">European Consumer Centres - help and advice for consumers in Europe</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">European Commission Corona Response website</a></p></div>",

This additional budgetary support aims to help the country address the socio-economic risks associated with the health crisis and contribute to the gradual restoration of State authority over the country, which is essential for the country's economic and social development.</em>'</p>\n<p>Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 virus means that the Central African government must use part of its resources for preventive health measures, which significantly increases pressure on public finances. The EU is therefore intervening with two budget support programmes going towards consolidating the State (\u20ac45\u00a0million) and reforming the security and governance sector (\u20ac9\u00a0million).</p>\n<p>The new programme for consolidating the State (PACAE-RCA II) will consolidate economic governance in the Central African Republic and increase its fiscal space in 2020-21, by enhancing dialogue with the government in terms of the macroeconomic framework, public-finance reform, and the education and health sectors.</p>\n<p>Budgetary strengthening under the ongoing Support Programme for Reforming the Security and Governance Sectors will ensure continued European support for a return to peace and security. It is in addition to the initial allocation of \u20ac38\u00a0million to meet the funding needs for national security and justice policies and gradually to redeploy and resize the Central African Republic's domestic security forces and judiciary.</p>\n<p>In order to get help to the government as quickly as possible, an advance disbursement of \u20ac23.5\u00a0million will be made in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Other measures to support the COVID-19 response in the Central African Republic</strong></p>\n<p>This financial support is supplemented by an immediate reallocation of \u20ac6.5\u00a0million from ongoing European Development Fund (EDF) programmes and the B\u00eakou Trust Fund to help the water, sanitation and health (WASH) sector. Water fountains and water supply sources have already been built in Bangui and Paoua and the distribution of medical equipment and local production of masks have been stepped up (160,000 units).</p>\n<p>On 8\u00a0May, the Central African Republic benefited from the first \u2018Team Europe' humanitarian air bridge bringing in health equipment and humanitarian staff to support the fight against the pandemic in the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The Central African Republic is trying to recover from the crisis it has been in since 2013. More than a year after the signing of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation between the Central African authorities and the 14 main armed groups in February\u00a02019, the humanitarian situation remains particularly critical (25% of the population displaced, 63% in need of humanitarian assistance) and the security situation is still fragile.</p>\n<p>The European Union is the Central African Republic's leading partner from both a political and financial point of view. It has applied an integrated approach combining all the instruments at its disposal to support the country's progress towards peace, stability, democracy and development.</p>\n<p>The National Indicative Programme (NIP) for the Central African Republic, totalling \u20ac442\u00a0million from the 11th EDF, is in line with the National Plan for Recovery and Peacebuilding (RCPCA). The priority sectors are: (1)\u00a0support for economic governance and social services, including education and health; (2) support for security sector reform and democratic governance; and (3) support for rural resilience and job creation. Support to civil society complements these three focal sectors.</p>\n<p>The Central African Republic also benefits from the EU's B\u00eakou Trust Fund, which was set up in 2014 and has been extended until December\u00a02020. The Trust Fund totals \u20ac291\u00a0million. It is the only tool available to bridge the gap between the Central African Republic's humanitarian and developmental needs. Most projects under the Fund focus on more remote parts of the country and on the fields of health, rural development, economic recovery and job creation, support for civil society and the media, reconciliation, social cohesion, and the return of displaced persons.</p></div>",

The programme will focus on vulnerable groups, including migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons and cross-border communities and deliver medical equipment, including more than 8.5 million items of personal protective equipment. It will also help ensure borders and critical supply chains are safe for trade and promote digital solutions to monitor the crisis.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\">Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta <strong>Urpilainen</strong>, said: \u201d<em>The programme will help mitigate the impact of the pandemic by providing coordinated, coherent, and comprehensive actions across the region. It will be implemented in collaboration not only with partner countries but also with UN agencies, illustrating the benefits of a joint multilateral response. We want to ensure that no one is left behind. This is why we will make sure it reaches the most vulnerable communities and includes measures to fight gender-based violence. Nearly 430,000 people, predominantly women and children, will receive necessary basic care including vaccinations whilst almost 570,000 people will receive critical water, sanitation and hygiene supplies and services, in addition to reaching more than 1.6 million people through awareness campaigns to help prevent the spread of the virus.\u201d</em></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\">On this occasion, Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), H.E. Dr Workeneh Gebeyehu, stressed: <em>\u201cThis project will make a significant contribution to saving lives, protecting and motivating frontline health workers, as well as preventing community transmission through rapid and coordinated contact tracing and isolation. It will boost the remarkable efforts of national response committees in IGAD Member States to contain and control the pandemic, promote trade and protect livelihoods. This project therefore will be key to support the IGAD Regional Response Strategy to COVID-19. This is a concerted multi-sectoral response in partnership with our Member States to address the impact of COVID-19 on Health, Food Security as well as Peace and Security\u201d.</em></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\">This programme will establish the IGAD Emergency Coordination Unit as well as the Rapid Regional Response Team (RRRT) to be deployed in the region. It will also support measures for the safe circulation of goods and commodities through Safe Trade Zones, thereby preserving critical supply chains, such as food, fuel and medicines.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\">The programme will also provide a wide range of medical and personal protective equipment, including 3.5 million surgical masks, 70,000 test kits and 24 ambulances. It will also increase access to health and socio-economic support for vulnerable groups, including migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons and cross-border communities. Prevention and response interventions to address gender-based violence, in the framework of the programme, aim to reach more than 89,000 people. Furthermore, it will promote digital solutions relevant to the health COVID-19 response, such as regional surveillance and monitoring systems.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\">This programme is a response to the call for international support made by IGAD Heads of States, Health and Finance Ministers to help to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in the Horn of Africa. The Member States of IGAD are Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, the Sudan, South Sudan and Uganda. This programme will be implemented by UNOPS, UNICEF, GIZ, IOM and Trade Mark East Africa.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\">The Global EU response to coronavirus follows a Team Europe approach. It draws on contributions from all EU institutions and combines the resources mobilised by EU Member States and financial institutions, to address the humanitarian, health, and other consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. The total Team Europe global response package reaches almost \u20ac36 billion.\u00a0In addition, the Commission also started a pledging marathon on 4 May, the <a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/about_en\" target=\"_blank\">Coronavirus Global Response</a>, to lead global action for universal access to affordable coronavirus vaccination, treatment and testing, which was followed by the launch of a new campaign with the international advocacy organisation <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Citizen,</a> \u201c<em>Global Goal: Unite For Our Future\u201d, </em>culminating in a Global Pledging Summit on Saturday 27 June.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\">In East Africa, \u20ac261 million from development funds are being redirected to support the immediate health care response and \u20ac475 million will help ease the economic and social consequences of COVID-19. More than \u20ac11 million worth of humanitarian funds have also been allocated to the region to support coronavirus control and prevention and help provide vulnerable groups with access to healthcare, water and sanitation.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\">In addition to this, the EU has also provided \u20ac32 million to address the Desert Locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\"><strong>For More Information</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"prdnormal\"><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/topics/eu-global-response-covid-19_en\" target=\"_blank\">EU Global Response to COVID-19</a></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/documents/factsheet-eu-response-health-and-socio-economic-impact-covid-19-igad-region_en\" target=\"_blank\">Factsheet: EU response to the impact of COVID-19 in the IGAD region</a><span class=\"prdnormal\"> <br></span></p>\n<p class=\"ecl-heading ecl-heading--h1\">\u00a0</p></div>",

I welcome this second flight to Sudan that has now landed in Khartoum.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The EU's Humanitarian Air Bridge to Sudan is part of the EU's Global Response to the coronavirus pandemic. Through the Global Response, \u20ac6 billion is supporting countries in Africa, of which more than \u20ac120 million was mobilised in Sudan.</p>\n<p>As part of the Team Europe support, the EU is also announcing today the signature of a \u20ac11.5 million programme with the World Health Organization (WHO), of which \u20ac10 million is channelled through the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfundforafrica/region_en\">EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa</a>. The programme will address critical needs in health governance, epidemiological surveillance, epidemic preparedness and response in the current coronavirus pandemic, including in Sudan where the focus will be on forcibly displaced people and vulnerable host communities.</p>\n<p>On this occasion, the EU is also marking its support to a humanitarian project of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which will restart operations in Sudan after its expulsion by the previous regime in 2009 has been revoked.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p>Sudan faces one the world's largest humanitarian crises, with around 9 million people estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance. Despite the positive political transition process, the country continues to grapple with multiple challenges including a dire economic crisis as well as the desert locust outbreak. Moreover, the coronavirus pandemic adds to the pressure on the country's beleaguered health system.</p>\n<p>The objective of the High-Level Sudan Partnership Conference to be held on 25 June 2020 is precisely to muster the necessary support. During this virtual event co-hosted by the EU, Germany, the United Nations and Sudan, international partners will showcase both their political support as well as pledge further financial assistance in support of Sudan's transition.</p>\n<p><strong>EU humanitarian aid in Sudan</strong></p>\n<p>The EU has allocated, since 2011, around \u20ac550 million in funding for aid organisations in the country in response to this complex crisis. The overall humanitarian response in Sudan continues to address the most critical needs, in terms of food, shelter, emergency health care, access to clean water, education and protection assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>EU development aid in Sudan</strong></p>\n<p>Since 2016, the EU has supported the Sudanese population and the high number of refugees it hosts with development aid up to \u20ac242 million, mostly through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. These funds have been used, among others, to promote peace, support women and youth's economic empowerment, and ensure inclusive and sustainable growth for all. Since the civilian-led government took office in early September 2019, the EU has provided \u20ac88 million in development assistance to support political and economic reforms and contribute to stability and peace in Sudan.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information </strong></p>\n<p>Factsheets:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/hab_en.pdf\">EU Humanitarian Air Bridge</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/where/africa/sudan_en\">EU Humanitarian Aid in Sudan</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfundforafrica/sites/euetfa/files/sudan_factsheet_short_removed.pdf\">EU Development Aid in Sudan</a></p></div>",

The Temporary Framework was first <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_570\">amended on 3 April 2020</a> to increase possibilities for public support to research, testing and production of products relevant to fight the coronavirus outbreak, to protect jobs and to further support the economy. On <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_838\">8 May 2020</a>, the Commission adopted a second amendment extending the scope of the Temporary Framework to recapitalisation and subordinated debt measures.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice-President Margrethe <strong>Vestager</strong>, in charge of competition policy, said \u201c<em>Micro, small and start-up companies are crucial for the economic recovery of the Union. They have been particularly affected by the liquidity shortage caused by the coronavirus outbreak, and face greater difficulties to access financing</em>.<em> Today, we have extended the Temporary Framework to enable Member States to support these companies further. We have also introduced conditions that provide incentives for private investors to participate alongside the State in recapitalisations, thus reducing the need for State aid and the risk of distortions to competition. Finally, we recall that State aid shall not be granted on the condition of the relocation of production or of another activity of the beneficiary from elsewhere in our Union \u2013 because the Single Market is our greatest asset. We continue to work closely with Member States to help European businesses weather this crisis and bounce back strongly, whilst maintaining a level playing field to the benefit of all European consumers and businesses.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>Support to support micro and small companies including start-ups</strong></p>\n<p>The main purpose of the Temporary Framework is to provide targeted support to otherwise viable companies that have entered into financial difficulty as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Therefore, companies that were already in difficulty before 31 December 2019 are not eligible for aid under the Temporary Framework, but may benefit from aid under existing State aid rules, in particular the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-795_en.htm\">Rescue and Restructuring Guidelines</a>. These Guidelines set clear conditions according to which such companies must define sound restructuring plans that will allow them to achieve long-term viability.</p>\n<p>At the same time, micro and small companies (i.e. undertakings with less than 50 employees and less than EUR 10 million of annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total)have been particularly affected by the liquidity shortage caused by the economic impact of the current coronavirus outbreak, exacerbating their existing difficulties to access financing compared to larger enterprises. If left unaddressed, these difficulties could lead to a large number of bankruptcies of micro and small companies, causing serious disturbances for the entire EU economy.</p>\n<p>Today's amendment extends the Temporary Framework to enable Member States to provide public support under the Temporary Framework to all <strong>micro and small companies</strong>, even if they were already in financial difficulty on 31 December 2019.</p>\n<p>This will apply, unless such companies are in insolvency proceedings, have received rescue aid that has not been repaid, or are subject to a restructuring plan under State aid rules. Given their limited size and involvement in cross-border transactions, temporary State aid to micro and small companies is less likely to distort competition in the Internal Market than State aid to larger companies.</p>\n<p>This amendment also effectively increases the possibilities to support start-up companies, the vast majority of which fall within the micro and small companies cluster, especially innovative ones which may be loss-making in their high-growth phase, which are crucial for the economic recovery of the Union.</p>\n<p>The Commission recalls further that all small and medium-sized enterprises that were in existence for less than three years on 31\u00a0December 2019 could already benefit from the aid measures laid down in the Temporary Framework provided they are not in insolvency proceedings or have received rescue aid that has not been repaid or are subject to a restructuring plan under State aid rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentives for private investors to participate in coronavirus-related recapitalisation aid measures</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission has also adapted the conditions for recapitalisation measures under the Temporary Framework for those cases where <strong>private investors contribute to the capital increase of companies together with the State</strong>.</p>\n<p>These changes will encourage capital injections with significant private participation in companies, limiting the need for State aid and the risk of competition distortions. In particular, if the State decides to grant recapitalisation aid, but private investors contribute to the capital increase in a significant manner (in principle at least 30% of the new equity injected) at the same conditions as the State, the acquisition ban and the cap on the remuneration of the management are limited to three years. Furthermore, the dividend ban is lifted for the holders of the new shares as well as for existing shares, provided that the holders of those existing shares are altogether diluted to below 10% in the company.</p>\n<p>This will increase the incentives for companies to seek market as well as State contributions to their capital needs, whilst maintaining safeguards to preserve effective competition in the Single Market.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in line with the principle of neutrality towards public or private ownership of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, today's amendment will also enable companies with an existing State shareholding to raise capital from their shareholders similar to private companies. Where the conditions above as regards the participation of private investors in the capital increase are met and the State is an existing shareholder (<em>i.e.</em> was a shareholder already before the granting of recapitalisation aid) investing pro rata to its existing shareholding, the Commission does not consider it necessary to impose specific conditions as regards the State's exit.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection of the Single Market and ensuring a level playing field </strong></p>\n<p>With the amendment, the Commission has clarified that aid should not be conditioned on the <strong>relocation</strong> of the production activity or of another activity of the beneficiary from another country within the European Economic Area (EEA) to the territory of the Member State granting the aid, since such a condition would be particularly harmful for the internal market.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>On 19 March 2020, the Commission adopted a new State aid <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_496\">Temporary Framework</a> to support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, based on Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Temporary Framework was amended on <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_570\">3 April</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_838\">8 May</a> 2020. The Temporary Framework recognises that the entire EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. It enables Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy, while limiting negative consequences to the level playing field in the Single Market.</p>\n<p>On 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_459\">Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak</a> setting out these possibilities. For example, Member States can make generally applicable changes in favour of businesses (e.g. deferring taxes, or subsidising short-time work across all sectors), which fall outside State Aid rules. They can also grant compensation to companies for damage suffered due to and directly caused by the coronavirus outbreak. This can be useful to support particularly impacted sectors, such as transport, tourism, hospitality and retail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

This package includes \u20ac80 million in new funds as well as \u20ac30 million reallocated from non-contracted actions under the EUTF.</p>\n<p>In line with the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/joint_communication_global_eu_covid-19_response_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Communication on the global EU response to COVID-19</a>, this new funding will also strengthen the immediate response capacity, reinforce the health systems and services in the North African partner countries, mitigate the socio-economic impact of the crisis, as well as allow for the continuation of actions to protect refugees and migrants and stabilise local communities.</p>\n<p>Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliv\u00e9r <strong>V\u00e1rhelyi</strong>, said: \u201c<em>With today's substantial and targeted assistance package we are responding to the urgent needs to fight the COVID-19 crisis and address the needs of some of the most vulnerable groups in North Africa, in particular refugees, migrants and displaced persons. In Libya, while the armed conflict continues, the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa has already supported over 200,000 beneficiaries with hygiene kits and medical assistance and over 1.7 million people have now better access to basic services in local communities, thanks to the renovation of health centres</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Support to Libya</strong></p>\n<p>Libya remains the biggest beneficiary under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, with \u20ac455 million in programmes, with the majority going to protection of migrants and refugees and community stabilisation, alongside actions for border management.</p>\n<p>As part of the EU's comprehensive approach and support on migration in Libya, three new programmes adopted today will improve the resilience of both Libyans and migrants for the health challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>\u20ac30.2 million protection programme </strong>will provide protection services to migrants and vulnerable groups, such as health assistance to treat tuberculosis, non-food items, emergency cash assistance and emergency evacuations outside of Libya (when travel restrictions are lifted);</li>\n<li>A <strong>specific \u20ac20 million COVID-19 programme</strong> will strengthen immediate response to the virus, including personal protective equipment and training for health staff; the strengthening of laboratory capacities and intensive care response. It will also reinforce the health system and services in the country in the medium term;</li>\n<li>A <strong>\u20ac25 million community stabilisation programme</strong> to continue to improve the living conditions in the Libyan municipalities, in particular in the South, by enhancing access to basic and social services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to fund these essential new actions, \u20ac30 million has been re-allocated from existing Border Management programmes in Libya, which will now amount to \u20ac57.2 million. While Border Management in Libya remains a priority in order to continue to save lives at sea, the reallocation of funding reflects the need to adapt existing actions to the changing security situation on the ground. The revised Border Management programme will strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and Port Security's capacity for search and rescue activities and prevention of migrant smuggling, support the maintenance of boats, provide further training as well as support the establishment of the Libyan Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre.</p>\n<p><strong>Support to Tunisia</strong></p>\n<p>In Tunisia, two new programmes will strengthen support to migrants and the most vulnerable groups, who may be particularly hard hit by the current crisis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>\u20ac9.3 million governance and protection programme</strong> to provide protection services to vulnerable migrants, improve access to health services as well as to continue to support migration governance and to the Tunisian-led service for the reintegration of returnees hosted by the \u2018Office des Tunisiens \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger' (OTE);</li>\n<li>A <strong>\u20ac5 million skills mobility programme</strong> built on two bilateral mobility agreements in place between France and Tunisia for young professionals and seasonal workers, based on the principle of circular mobility and for workers to gain needed skills in the country of origin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Regional COVID-19 response</strong></p>\n<p>A new \u20ac10 million COVID-19 fast track emergency response programme has also been adopted to support the most vulnerable populations in North Africa tackling their emergency needs as well as the social and economic consequences of the crisis in order to contribute to the national efforts already in place.</p>\n<p><strong>Other regional initiatives</strong></p>\n<p>A \u20ac3.7 million regional child protection programme, with a focus on Libya and Egypt, has been adopted to improve the protection and expand access to sustainable solutions for unaccompanied and separated children and youth along the Central Mediterranean Route.</p>\n<p>\u20ac6.5 million was also adopted to fund a Technical Cooperation Facility to ensure effective monitoring and evaluations of all the actions implemented under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund of Africa.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa was established in 2015 to address the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration and to contribute to better migration management. The Trust Fund covers three windows: the Sahel and Lake Chad, the Horn of Africa, and the North of Africa.</p>\n<p>Today's assistance package brings the total funding mobilised through the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa to nearly \u20ac888 million since its launch in 2015. The new funding was approved by the Operational Committee of the Trust Fund, which brings together the European Commission, the EU Member States, the United Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland. Observers of the Operational Committee include partner countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia as well as Members of the European Parliament.</p>\n<p>The Trust Fund is also reorienting ongoing interventions in key sectors in Libya to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Reallocation of existing actions in Libya allowed implementing partners to provide personal protective equipment, hygiene kits, training to medical staff as well as awareness campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus among vulnerable groups.</p>\n<p>EU Institutions, EU Member States and other donors have so far allocated resources amounting to \u20ac5 billion to the EUTF.</p>\n<p>With today's adoption, the EUTF now funds 246 programmes totalling close to \u20ac4.8 billion. The funding is divided between three regions as follows: Sahel/Lake Chad, \u20ac2 billion (104 programmes); Horn of Africa, \u20ac1.79 billion (99 programmes); North of Africa, \u20ac888 million (39 programmes).</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfundforafrica/index_en\" target=\"_blank\">EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfundforafrica/sites/euetfa/files/facsheet_north_africa_dec_2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Factsheet the EU support on migration in North Africa</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfundforafrica/sites/euetfa/files/eutf-factsheet_libya_dec_2019_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Factsheet the EU support on migration in Libya</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfundforafrica/sites/euetfa/files/eutf-factsheet_tunisia_dec_2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Factsheet the EU support on migration in Tunisia</a></p></div>",

It is the Commission's response to the global call for action launched by the World Health Organization with governments and partners on 24 April 2020, for access to coronavirus vaccines everywhere, for everyone who needs them.</p>\n<p>To help protect people everywhere, the Commission has recently presented an\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1103\">EU Vaccines Strategy</a> to speed up the development, manufacturing and deployment of coronavirus vaccines. With this strategy, the Commission will support efforts to accelerate the development and availability of safe and effective vaccines in a timeframe between 12 and 18 months, if not earlier. Delivering on this complex undertaking requires running clinical trials in parallel with investing in production capacity to be able to produce millions, or even billions, of doses of a successful vaccine. The Commission is fully mobilised to support the efforts of vaccine developers in their endeavour.</p>\n<p>In addition, as a way to enhance vaccine multilateralism and avoid harmful competition between countries, President <strong>von der Leyen</strong> has proposed to explore, with our international partners, the creation of an inclusive international vaccine procurement mechanism. For this to work, a significant number of high-income countries would need to join an international buyers' group. They would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies, while at the same time enabling advance reservations for low- and middle-income countries.\u00a0 This would accelerate the development of vaccines and improve access to them across the world for all who need it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/about_en\">Coronavirus Global Response website</a></p></div>",

The Company's proprietary RNAoptimizer\u00ae platform aims to optimize the properties of mRNA medicines based on its three core pillars: protein design, mRNA optimization and mRNA delivery. The technology can be tailored to induce varying degrees of immune responses against specific protein antigens of choice, potentially providing potent prophylactic vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases at a low dose, such as Rabies, as well as immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. The technology can also be adapted to avoid immune activation for purposes of protein therapy and antibodies, thereby providing potential new therapeutic modalities for patients suffering from a vast range of diseases.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.eib.org/attachments/thematic/innovfin_infectious_diseases_en.pdf\">Infectious Diseases Finance Facility</a> (IDFF) of the EU's Horizon 2020 programme backs the loan to CureVac. The IDFF is an example of successful collaboration between the European Commission and the EIB in the face of a health crisis. Through the IDFF, the EIB has supported 13 companies with total lending of \u20ac316 million for developing cures, vaccines and diagnostics against various infectious diseases, most prominently the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The European Investment Bank is the long-term lending institution of the European Union owned by its Member States. It makes long-term finance available for sound investments in order to contribute towards EU policy goals. The EIB also supports investments outside the EU.</p>\n<p>The InnovFin Infectious Diseases Finance Facility (IDFF) is a financial product dedicated to support the fight against infectious diseases.

Now is not the time to let our guard down.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has put unparalleled pressure across the EU and indeed around the world. Many countries had to face widespread transmission of the virus in the community. The EU and its Member States have introduced measures to mitigate social and economic impacts, such as maintaining the functioning of the internal market, supporting the transport and tourism sectors, protecting employment and supporting medical care services for vulnerable groups. The Commission has also issued recommendations on <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-and-transportation-during-coronavirus-pandemic_en#traveladviceandbordermeasures\">travel and border measures</a> necessary to protect the health of our citizens while also preserving the internal market.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Member States are increasingly coordinating their response, which is absolutely vital in ensuring that the epidemiological situation remains low across the EU. The public health measures taken by the countries helped to decrease the numbers of new infections to a level that was manageable by health systems. This in turn allowed the progressive lifting of the various restrictions imposed and the reopening of most activities, guided by the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/european-roadmap-lifting-coronavirus-containment-measures_en\">European roadmap to lifting of coronavirus measures</a>.</p>\n<p>The virus does not stop at EU borders.

In some countries, this burden comes on top of already-crippling economic woes.</p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic is likely to compound already significant humanitarian needs in the region.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p>Factsheet: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/where/africa/southern-africa_en\">Southern Africa and Indian Ocean</a></p></div>",

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, the European Commission presents Guidelines to ensure the protection of seasonal workers in the EU in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. It provides guidance to national authorities, labour inspectorates, and social partners to guarantee the rights, health and safety of seasonal workers, and to ensure that seasonal workers are aware of their rights.</p>\n<p>Cross-border seasonal workers enjoy a broad set of rights, but given the temporary nature of their work, they can be more vulnerable to precarious working and living conditions. The coronavirus pandemic has given more visibility to these conditions, and in some cases exacerbated them. In some cases such problems can increase the risk of COVID-19 clusters.</p>\n<p>Nicolas<strong> Schmit</strong>, the Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: <em>\u201c</em><em>Each year, hundreds of thousands of seasonal workers help to underpin hugely important sectors of the EU's economy, such as food and agriculture. The coronavirus pandemic has shone a light on the challenging living and working conditions they face. This has to be addressed. Our guidelines are a wake-up call to Member States and companies to ensure they are fulfilling their duties to protect indispensable, yet vulnerable, workers.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>While the Commission monitors the proper application of Union rules in relation to seasonal workers, the responsibility for their proper application belongs to national authorities. Thus, appropriate actions are needed as a matter of urgency.</p>\n<p>The guidelines cover a range of aspects, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the right of seasonal workers to work in an EU Member State regardless of whether they are EU nationals or come from countries outside the EU</li>\n<li>suitable living and working conditions, including physical distancing and appropriate hygiene measures</li>\n<li>clear communication to workers of their rights</li>\n<li>undeclared work</li>\n<li>social security aspects</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>National action</h3>\n<p>The Guidelines call on national authorities and social partners to make a renewed effort in fulfilling their role of ensuring the proper application and enforcement of the rules. They include concrete recommendations and suggestions on activities to be undertaken at national or EU level, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calling on Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure decent working and living conditions for seasonal workers</li>\n<li>Calling on Member States to raise awareness on Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) requirements affecting seasonal workers, helping employers implement the relevant legal requirements and providing clear information to workers in a language they understand</li>\n<li>Inviting Member States to provide practical guidance to smaller companies</li>\n<li>Asking Member States to strengthen field inspections to ensure to the proper application of the OSH rules for seasonal workers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Commission will continue to work with Member States, social partners, the <a href=\"https://osha.europa.eu/en\">European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ela.europa.eu/\">European Labour Authority (ELA)</a> on this important issue.</p>\n<h3>EU action</h3>\n<p>The Commission has planned a number of actions to boost the protection of seasonal workers' rights, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A study collecting data on intra-EU seasonal work and identifying the main challenges, including in relation to sub-contracting;</li>\n<li>A survey on high-risk occupations, including seasonal workers, carried out by the EU-OSHA in close collaboration with the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee;</li>\n<li>An awareness-raising campaign targeting sectors more exposed to seasonal work, coordinated by ELA;</li>\n<li>A hearing with European social partners on seasonal workers;</li>\n<li>A comparative analysis study in different Member States by the network of legal experts on free movement and the coordination of social security (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1098&amp;langId=en\">MoveS</a>);</li>\n<li>Support to Member States through the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1299&amp;langId=en\">European Platform tackling undeclared work</a> and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=88&amp;eventsId=1605&amp;furtherEvents=yes&amp;langId=en\">#EU4FairWork4 campaign</a>, to foster better awareness of rights and obligations among workers and employers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>The Guidelines presented today recall the rights of seasonal workers regardless of their status: whether they are EU citizens or third-country nationals, including those working regularly abroad on their own accord, or are posted for example through temporary work and recruitment agencies.</p>\n<p>It is essential that seasonal workers and their employers have all the information they need both about the protection they enjoy as well as the obligations they need to fulfil.</p>\n<p>More than 17.6 million EU citizens live or work in a Member States other than that of their nationality. Certain sectors of the European economy, in particular the agri-food and tourism sectors, depend on the support of seasonal workers from EU and non-EU countries for specific periods of the year. The Commission estimates that the average of active seasonal workers in the EU per year is between several hundred thousand and a million.</p>\n<p>While the Commission monitors the proper application of Union and national law rules in relation to seasonal workers in the EU, the responsibility for the proper application of these rules belongs to national authorities. In order to protect seasonal workers, Member States are invited to step up the enforcement of existing EU and national law and strengthen the field inspections in this respect, including with the support of the European Labour Authority (ELA).</p>\n<p>These guidelines complement the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020XC0330%2803%29\">Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak</a>, published on 30 March 2020, and respond to a call of the European Parliament in its resolution of 19 June 2020 on the protection of cross-border and seasonal workers.</p>\n<h3>For More Information</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=22866&amp;langId=en\">Guidelines on seasonal workers in the EU in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak</a> (16 July 2020)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020XC0330%2803%29\">Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak</a> (30 March 2020)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>The Commission adopted today an additional package of exceptional measures to support the wine sector, following the coronavirus crisis and its consequences on the sector. The wine sector is among the hardest hit agri-food sectors, due to rapid changes in demand and the closure of restaurants and bars across the EU, which was not compensated by home consumption.</p>\n<p>These new measures include the temporary authorisation for operators to self-organise market measures, the increase of the European Union's contribution for wine national support programmes, and the introduction of advance payments for crisis distillation and storage.</p>\n<p>Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner Janusz <strong>Wojciechowski</strong> said: \u201c<em>The wine sector has been among the sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus crisis and the related lockdown measures taken across the EU. The first package of market-specific measures adopted by the Commission has already provided significant support. Nonetheless, the uncertainties surrounding the scale of the crisis at EU and global level, and a close monitoring of the market has led us to propose a new package of measures for the wine sector. I am confident that these measures will provide rapidly concrete results for the EU wine sector and soon provide stability.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The exceptional measures include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Temporary derogation from the European Union's competition rules</strong>: Article 222 of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32013R1308\">Common Markets Organisation Regulation</a>\u00a0(CMO) allows the Commission to adopt temporary derogations from certain EU competition rules in situations of severe market imbalances. The Commission has now adopted such a derogation for the wine sector, allowing operators to self-organise and implement market measures at their level to stabilise their sector and in the respect of the functioning of the internal market for a maximum period of 6 months. For example, they will be allowed to plan joint promotion activities, to organise storage by private operators and to commonly plan production.</li>\n<li><strong>Increase of the European Union's contribution</strong>: the European Union's contribution for all measures of the national support programmes will increase by 10% and reach 70%. A previous exceptional measure had already increased it from 50% to 60%. This will provide financial relief to beneficiaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced payments for crisis distillation and storage</strong>: the Commission will allow Member States to provide advanced payments to operators for on-going distillation and crisis storage operations. These advances can cover up to 100% of costs and will allow Member States to fully utilise their national support programme funds for this year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these support measures for the wine sector, the fruit and vegetable sector will also benefit from an increase of the EU's contribution (from 50% to 70%) for programmes managed by producer organisations. This will provide further flexibility to producer organisations in the implementation of their programmes.</p>\n<p>These measures complement the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_798\">recently adopted package</a>, which benefited the wine sector through the flexibility provided under market support programmes. This included for instance an increased flexibility of tools to control production potential, the so-called green harvesting tool, and the possibility to include temporary new measures such as the opening of distillation of wine in case of crisis or an aid to crisis storage of wine.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Commission has recently launched <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/covid-19-commission-launches-two-additional-calls-promotion-programme-proposals-2020-jun-30_en\">two calls for proposals for promotion programmes</a> that aim to support the sectors most affected by the crisis, including the wine sector.

A contract has been signed yesterday, less than a month after the authorisation of Remdesivir, which will allow the delivery of treatments from early August for thousands of patients. The Commission is leaving no stone unturned in its efforts to secure access to safe and efficient treatments, and is supporting the development of vaccines against coronavirus.

This will ensure the treatment of approximately 30,000 patients presenting severe COVID-19 symptoms. This will help to cover the current needs over the next few months, while ensuring a fair distribution at EU level, based on an allocation key, taking into account the advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>\n<p>The Commission is now also preparing a joint procurement for further supplies of the medicine, expected to cover additional needs and supplies as from October onwards.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>On 3 July, Remdesivir became the first treatment to be authorised for a conditional marketing authorisation. This authorisation facilitates early access to medicines in public health emergency situations, such as the current pandemic.</p>\n<p>Remdesivir is a treatment against COVID-19 for adults and adolescents as from age 12 with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen. The application for the marketing authorisation was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 8 June. EMA's recommendation was endorsed by the Member States through the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use.</p>\n<p>While authorised in the EU, the medicine continues to be monitored to ensure safety. Gilead has also been requested to submit the final reports of the Remdesivir studies to the EMA by December 2020 as part of the conditions to be fulfilled to move from a conditional marketing authorisation to a full marketing authorisation. Further data on the effectiveness and safety of the medicine is expected to be submitted by August 2020 in order to finalise this process.</p>\n<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/human-use_en\">EU legislation on medicinal products</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19\">EMA and COVID-19 treatments</a></p></div>",

This will allow \u20ac197 million of new investments by the concession operator to go ahead, while limiting distortions of competition. The Istrian Y motorway is a 145 km long motorway linking the Istrian region with the rest of Croatia. The motorway is operated under a concession agreement from 1995, which was awarded to the company Bina-Istra until 2034. In June 2020, Croatia notified to the Commission a prolongation of the concession agreement until 2039. The prolongation will allow Bina-Istra to finance the construction of a second carriageway (one more lane in each direction) between Vranja Interchange and the U\u010dka tunnel/Kvarner portal - an 8km stretch on the north-eastern side of the motorway. The aid takes the form of a prolongation of the concession. This will allow the \u20ac197 million investment, which will mainly be used to construct a new 5.63 km-long second tube to the U\u010dka tunnel, which is necessary to meet the minimum safety requirements, as well as several new viaducts, underpasses and overpasses. Bina-Istra will also renew the Kvarner rest area. \u00a0The Commission examined the measure under EU State aid rules on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52012XC0111(03)&amp;from=EN\">services of general economic interest</a> (SGEI) and EU public procurement rules, notably the EU Directive on the award of concession contracts (<u><a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2014_094_R_0001_01\">Directive 2014/23/EU</a></u>), according to which companies can be compensated for the extra cost of providing a public service on certain conditions. The Commission found that, under the Croatian plan to extend the Istrian Y motorway concession agreement, all compatibility conditions are fulfilled. The prolongation of the concession is proportionate to the amount needed to finance the required works and Bina-Istra is not overcompensated. The Commission concluded that the measure will promote growth and unlock investment, without unduly distorting competition and trade between Member States in line with EU State aid and public procurement rules. On this basis, the Commission approved under EU State aid rules the Croatian support through the prolongation of the Istrian Y motorway concession. The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.56832 in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/register/\">State aid register</a> on the Commission's <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html\">competition</a> website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. \u00a0<em>(For more information: Arianna Podesta\u00a0\u2013 Tel.: +32 229 87024; Giulia Astuti </em><em>\u2013</em><em> Tel.: +32 229 55344)</em></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><a id=\"4\"></a>Mergers: Commission clears acquisition of joint control over One Tap Buy by the Softbank Group and the Mizuho Financial Group</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">The European Commission has approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the acquisition of joint control over One Tap BUY Co., Ltd.

Those cities have been severely hit, impeding them to implement their European Capital of Culture initiatives. The Commission also proposes to postpone the year in which Novi Sad (Serbia) is due to host a European Capital of Culture from 2021 to 2022 and the year in which Timisoara (Romania) and Elefsina (Greece) will hold the title from 2021 to 2023. Margaritis <strong>Schinas</strong>, Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, said: \u201c<em>Rijeka and Galway deserve a fair chance to bounce back and showcase their resilience and creativity. Opening hearts and minds, welcoming diverse audiences and artists has always been the lifeblood of the European Capitals of Culture. And it shall remain so. I am confident that for Novi Sad, Timisoara and Elefsina, additional time will allow weathering the current downturn in the cultural and tourism sectors and mobilising relevant investment, including through solidarity at European level</em>.\u201d Mariya <strong>Gabriel</strong>, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: \"<em>Culture has been badly hit by the pandemic and European Capitals of Culture are no exception. Despite the energy, enthusiasm and professionalism of their teams and partners, Rijeka and Galway were unable to roll out their 2020 European Capital of Culture programmes as planned. I hope that both cities will make the most of the possibility offered to them to prolong their special year. I am sure that Timisoara, Elefsina and Novi Sad, the European Capitals of Culture next in line, will benefit from extra time to prepare their ambitious programmes</em>.\u201d The Commission's <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/sites/creative-europe/files/2020-ecoc-amendment_en.pdf\">proposal</a> now passes to the European Parliament and the Council for consideration and final adoption. <em>(For more information: Susanne Conze \u2014 Tel.: +32 229 80236; Veronica Favalli\u00a0 \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 87269)</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a id=\"2\"></a>Coronavirus: \u20ac12 million to support Bosnia and Herzegovina's SMEs</strong></p>\n<p>The European Investment Fund (EIF) and Raiffeisen Bank dd Bosna i Hercegovina (RBBH) signed a guarantee agreement allowing the bank to increase its lending capacity to offer \u20ac12 million of new financing with improved terms and conditions to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The EIF's guarantee to RBBH is provided under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/growth/access-to-finance/cosme-financial-instruments_en\">COSME</a> Loan Guarantee Facility, as part of its coronavirus economic support package. This tool helps provide working capital to European SMEs for the recovery. Thierry <strong>Breton, </strong>Commissioner for Internal market, said: <em>\u201cSmall and medium-sized enterprises are heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic. We reacted very quickly to provide them with immediate liquidity. Thanks to this rapid action, the coronavirus measure under the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility is already available in more than 20 European countries.

The measure was approved under the State aid <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AJOC_2020_091_I_0001\">Temporary Framework</a>. The recapitalisation measure is part of a larger recapitalisation package, which also foresees a significant participation of private investors, including the conversion of outstanding privately-held debt instruments into equity. SAS is a major network airline operating in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. In the second quarter of 2020, SAS suffered substantial losses due to the coronavirus outbreak and the travel restrictions that Denmark, Sweden and other countries had to impose to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The Commission found that measure notified by Denmark and Sweden is in line with <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A12008E107\">Article 107(3)(b) </a>TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. The Commission concluded that the recapitalisation measure will contribute to manage the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in Denmark and Sweden: the measure aims at restoring the balance sheet position and liquidity of SAS in the exceptional situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic, while maintaining the necessary safeguards to limit competition distortions. It is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the two Member States, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the general principles as set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measure under EU State aid rules. Executive Vice-President Margrethe <strong>Vestager</strong>, in charge of competition policy, said: <em>\u201cSAS plays a key role for the connectivity and economy of Scandinavian countries. As many other companies active in the aviation sector, SAS has been severely hit by the current crisis. With this measure, Denmark and Sweden will contribute up to \u20ac1 billion to SAS's recapitalisation and help the airline weather the current crisis.</em> <em>At the same time, the Member States will be sufficiently remunerated for the risk taxpayers assume, and the support will come with strings attached to limit distortions of competition. I welcome the participation by private investors to the plan, as it limits the need for State aid, while contributing to the recovery of companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d </em>A <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1488\">full press release</a> is available online. <em>(</em><em>For more information: Daniel Ferrie \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 86500; Giulia Astuti \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 55344)</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a id=\"4\"></a>Mergers: Commission approves acquisition of Nets' account-to-account payment business by Mastercard, subject to conditions</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission has approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the proposed acquisition of Nets' account-to-account payment business by Mastercard, subject to conditions. The Commission found that the transaction, as originally notified, would have raised competition concerns in the EEA market for account-to-account core infrastructure services (\u201cA2A CIS\u201d) in relation to managed solutions. The Commission was concerned that the proposed acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices and less choice in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services. To address the Commission's concerns, Mastercard and Nets offered to transfer to a suitable purchaser a global license to distribute, supply, sell, develop, modify, upgrade or otherwise use Nets' Realtime 24/7 technology, with which the target business currently competes in A2A CIS tenders. The transfer also includes all necessary personnel and services, such as consultancy services and transitional support services, including access to all necessary components and capabilities to provide managed services based on Nets' Realtime 24/7 technology. The proposed commitments fully address the Commission's competition concerns, as they will increase competition in the market for the provision of A2A CIS as managed services in the EEA, by allowing a new player to effectively and credibly compete in this space. The Commission therefore concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, no longer raises competition concerns in the EEA. Executive Vice-President Margrethe<strong> Vestager</strong>, responsible for competition policy, said: \u201c<em>Companies and citizens seek competitive and innovative payment solutions for their banking transactions. This merger, as originally notified, would have significantly reduced competition in the market for account-to-account core infrastructure services and undermined the development of new real-time payment solutions, which are becoming increasingly important. Today's decision ensures that effective competition is preserved and facilitates the emergence of a new provider of real-time payment infrastructure services in the European Economic Area</em>.\u201d\u00a0 A <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1487\">full press release</a> is available online. <em>(</em><em>For more information: Daniel Ferrie \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 86500; Giulia Astuti \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 55344)</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a id=\"5\"></a>Concentrations : La Commission autorise l'acquisition de Kernaman par Total Direct Energie</strong></p>\n<p>La Commission europ\u00e9enne a approuv\u00e9, en vertu du r\u00e8glement europ\u00e9en sur les concentrations, l'acquisition de Kernaman SAS par Total Direct Energie S.A., une filiale \u00e0 100% de TOTAL S.A., toutes trois bas\u00e9es en France.

Both Gehe and Alliance Healthcare are mainly active in pharmaceutical wholesaling in Germany and supply retail pharmacies in Germany. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns, either at national level or at\u00a0 regional level in the catchment areas around distribution warehouses across Germany.

In 2018, inflation in Venezuela exceeded one million percent. This multifaceted crisis has affected the country's healthcare system and caused a lack of basic medication as well as the migration of around one third of its professional medical staff. The result is a growing number of people lacking regular health services and treatment for chronic illnesses and emergency medical care. More than five million Venezuelans (about 10 percent of the population) have left the country since 2015.</p>\n<p><strong>EU humanitarian aid in Venezuela</strong></p>\n<p>Since 2018, the European Union has allocated EUR 154 million in emergency humanitarian aid, to assist Venezuelans in need inside the country, and those hosted in neighbouring countries.</p>\n<p>The aid focuses on addressing the most pressing needs of the affected population, targeting the most vulnerable groups such as, children under five years of age, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, the elderly, school children and indigenous groups.</p>\n<p>Projects focus on delivering vital healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene, education in emergencies, protection of the most vulnerable population groups, and nutritional and food support. Assistance is also provided to support humanitarian coordination and to improve local capacities for emergency response.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p>Factsheet: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/humanitarian-aid/humanitarian-air-bridge_en\">EU Humanitarian Air Bridge</a></p>\n<p>Factsheet: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/where/latin-america-caribbean/venezuela_en\">Venezuela</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

This is following the positive steps regarding the conclusion of exploratory talks with <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1439\">Sanofi-GSK</a> announced on 31 July and with <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1481\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a> on 13 August. Once the vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission now has agreed the basis for a contractual framework for the purchase of 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option to purchase 100 million more, on behalf of EU Member States. The Commission continues discussing similar agreements with other vaccine manufacturers.</p>\n<p>Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, President of the European Commission, said: \u201c<em>The European Commission's intense negotiations continue to achieve results. Today's agreement is the first cornerstone in implementing the European Commission's Vaccines Strategy. This strategy will enable us to provide future vaccines to Europeans, as well as our partners elsewhere in the world.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: <em>\u201cToday, after weeks of negotiations, we have the first EU advance purchase agreement for a vaccine candidate. I would like to thank AstraZeneca for its constructive engagement on this important agreement for our citizens. We will continue to work tirelessly to bring more candidates into a broad EU vaccines portfolio. A safe and effective vaccine remains the surest exit strategy to protect our citizens and the rest of the world from the coronavirus.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The agreement approved today will be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca's vaccine candidate is already in large-scale Phase II/III Clinical Trials after promising results in Phase I/II concerning safety and immunogenicity.</p>\n<p>The decision to support the vaccine proposed by AstraZeneca is based on a sound scientific approach and the technology used (a non-replicative recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccine ChAdOx1), speed at delivery at scale, cost, risk sharing, liability and the production capacity able to supply the whole of the EU, among others.</p>\n<p>The regulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will use existing flexibilities in the EU's regulatory framework to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. This includes an accelerated procedure for authorisation and flexibility in relation to labelling and packaging.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission would finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of <strong>Advance Purchase Agreements</strong>. Funding provided would be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.</p>\n<p>Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreement will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen.</p>\n<p>The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the <a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\">Coronavirus Global Response</a>, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1597339415327&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0245\">EU Vaccines Strategy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">EU Coronavirus Response</a></p></div>",

SURE is a crucial element of the EU's comprehensive strategy to protect citizens and mitigate the severely negative socio-economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. It is one of the three safety nets agreed by the European Council to shield workers, businesses and countries.</p>\n<p>Once the Council approves these proposals, the financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States. These loans will assist Member States in addressing sudden increases in public expenditure to preserve employment. Specifically, they will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, in particular for the self-employed.</p>\n<p>Following consultations with the Member States that have requested support and after assessing their requests, the Commission proposes to the Council to approve the granting of financial support to:</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Belgium</td>\n<td>\u20ac7.8 billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bulgaria</td>\n<td>\u20ac511 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Czechia</td>\n<td>\u20ac2 billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Greece</td>\n<td>\u20ac2.7 billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spain</td>\n<td>\u20ac21.3 billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Croatia</td>\n<td>\u20ac1 billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Italy</td>\n<td>\u20ac27.4 billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cyprus</td>\n<td>\u20ac479 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Latvia</td>\n<td>\u20ac192 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lithuania</td>\n<td>\u20ac602 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Malta</td>\n<td>\u20ac244 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poland</td>\n<td>\u20ac11.2 billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Romania</td>\n<td>\u20ac4 billion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slovakia</td>\n<td>\u20ac631 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slovenia</td>\n<td>\u20ac1.1 billion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>SURE can provide financial support of up to \u20ac100 billion in total to all Member States.\u00a0 The proposals put forward by the Commission to the Council for decisions to grant financial support amount to \u20ac81.4 billion and cover 15 Member States. Portugal and Hungary have already submitted formal requests which are being assessed. The Commission expects to put forward a proposal to grant support to Portugal and Hungary shortly. Member States which have not yet made formal requests may still do so.</p>\n<p>Loans provided to Member States under the SURE instrument will be underpinned by a system of voluntary guarantees from Member States. The Commission expects that the process of Member States finalising their guarantee agreements with the Commission will be completed very shortly.</p>\n<p><strong>Members of the College said</strong>:</p>\n<p>President Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong> said: \u201c<em>We must do everything in our power to preserve jobs and livelihoods. Today marks an important step in this regard: just four months after I proposed its creation, the Commission is proposing to provide \u20ac81.4 billion under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic across the EU. SURE is a clear symbol of solidarity in the face of an unprecedented crisis. Europe is committed to protecting citizens</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Valdis\u00a0<strong>Dombrovskis</strong>, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said:\u00a0\u201c<em>Workers are currently enduring enormous insecurity, and we need to support them to overcome this crisis and relaunch our economies. That is why the Commission proposed SURE, to help protect workers and facilitate the economic rebound. Today, we welcome Member States' strong interest in accessing the cheap funding available under SURE to support short-time work schemes and similar measures, and we look forward to a fast decision process to start disbursing the loans</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nicolas\u00a0<strong>Schmit</strong>, Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, said: \u201c<em>SURE was one of the first safety nets we decided to put in place to guarantee that workers have an income while their jobs have been suspended, and that their employment is preserved. SURE will therefore help a swifter recovery. All Member States will soon have provided a cumulative \u20ac25 billion in guarantees, and we propose that the 15 Member States who requested support receive a cumulated \u20ac81.4 billion in loans. This is a demonstration of European solidarity, of how together we are stronger for the benefit of all European citizens</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Paolo\u00a0<strong>Gentiloni</strong>,\u00a0Commissioner for Economy, said: \u201c<em>Short-time work schemes have played a key role in cushioning the impact on jobs of the COVID-19 pandemic. SURE is the European Union's contribution to these essential safety nets. It will help to protect workers against unemployment and preserve the jobs and skills that we will need as our economies recover. The high demand from our Member States confirms the vital importance of this scheme</em>.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>As part of its coronavirus response, the Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_582\">proposed</a> SURE on 2 April 2020.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with a pharmaceutical company to purchase a potential vaccine against COVID-19. The envisaged contract with Sanofi-GSK* would provide for an option for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine. It is envisaged that, once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission would have a contractual framework in place for the purchase of 300 million doses, on behalf of all EU Member States. The Commission continues intensive discussions with other vaccine manufacturers.</p>\n<p>President <strong>von der Leyen</strong> said: <em>\u201c</em><em>The European Commission does all in its power to ensure that Europeans have rapid access to a vaccine that is safe and protects them from coronavirus. Today's step with\u00a0Sanofi-GSK is a first important cornerstone of a much broader European Vaccines Strategy. More will follow soon. We are in advanced discussions with several other companies. While we do not know today which vaccine will work best in the end, Europe is investing in a diversified portfolio of promising vaccines, based on various types of technologies. This increases our chances to obtain rapidly an effective remedy against the virus. </em><em>A vaccine would be a truly global good. We are committed to help secure access also for more vulnerable countries to find their way out of this crisis.<em>\u201d</em></em></p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201c<em>A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is the surest exit strategy from the crisis. For that reason, we have been negotiating a united EU approach to</em><em> secure doses of promising vaccine candidates in recent weeks. Today's announcement of the conclusion of exploratory talks with\u00a0Sanofi-GSK is the first important step in this direction, to provide equal access to the vaccine for our citizens.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.</p>\n<p>This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the <a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\">Coronavirus Global Response,</a> the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Commission is also ready to explore with international partners if a significant number of countries would agree to pool resources for jointly reserving future vaccines from companies for themselves as well as for low and middle-income countries at the same time. The high-income countries could act as an inclusive international buyers' group, thus accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines and maximise access to them for all who need it across the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission would finance part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of <strong>Advance Purchase Agreements</strong>. Funding provided would be considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.</p>\n<p>Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen.</p>\n<p>Sanofi-GSK's vaccine candidate is planning to seek marketing authorisation from EMA in June 2021, following Phase III clinical trials yielding the induction of a promising immune response.</p>\n<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/public-health_en#eu-vaccines-strategy\">EU Vaccines Strategy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">EU Coronavirus Response</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Updated on 31/07/2020 at 19:00</p></div>",

We must avoid further disruption of already fragile economies and additional uncertainty for citizens who have made huge sacrifices. They expect this from us after so many months living with COVID-19.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Justice, Didier<strong> Reynders</strong>, said: <em>\u201cOur right to move freely in the EU has been heavily impacted by the pandemic. For the many citizens who rely on frictionless travel every day, the cacophony of national rules in the EU is overwhelming. We want to simplify things. We are proposing straightforward criteria, applicable without discrimination, which are easy to follow by Member States and allow to inform Europeans properly.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva<strong> Johansson</strong>, said<em>: \u201cSince March, the Commission has developed and delivered a solid foundation of internal and external border control recommendations for Member States to follow. Today's measures builds on this track record so that we can fully benefit from our Schengen area. That is why we want a clear \u2018green, orange, red' system and not a kaleidoscope of individual measures\u201d. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Common criteria \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong></p>\n<p>There is currently a wide discrepancy between national criteria for introducing measures that restrict free movement in the European Union. The Commission is proposing that each Member State takes into account the following criteria when putting in place any restrictive measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases per 100 000 people in a given area in a 14-day period;</li>\n<li>The percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests carried out in given area during a seven-day period;</li>\n<li>The number of COVID-19 tests carried out per 100 000 people in a given area during a seven-day period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Member States should provide this data on a weekly basis to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Member States should also provide this data at the regional level to ensure that any measures can be targeted to those regions where they are strictly necessary.</p>\n<p>On the basis that the Member State of departure has a weekly testing rate of more than 250 per 100 000 people, the Commission is proposing that Member States should not restrict free movement of people travelling from another Member State where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases in a given area is equal to less than 50 per 100 000 people during a 14-day period, <strong>OR</strong>,</li>\n<li>The percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests in a given area is less than 3%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A common colour code</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the data provided by Member States, the Commission proposes that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publishes a map of EU and EEA countries, updated weekly, with a common colour code to support Member States and travellers. The Commission proposes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Green</strong> for an area where the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is less than 25 during a 14-day period<strong> AND </strong>the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is less than 3%;</li>\n<li><strong>Orange</strong> for an area where the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is less than 50 during a 14-day period <strong>BUT</strong> the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is 3% or more <strong>OR </strong>the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is between 25 and 150 <strong>BUT</strong> the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is less than 3%;</li>\n<li><strong>Red</strong> for an area where the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is more than 50 during a 14-day period <strong>AND </strong>the percentage of positive tests from all COVID-19 tests is 3% or more <strong>OR </strong>the total number of newly notified COVID-19 cases is more than 150 per 100 000 people during a 14-day period;</li>\n<li><strong>Grey</strong> if there is insufficient information available to assess the criteria proposed by the Commission <strong>OR </strong>the number of COVID-19 tests carried out per 100 000 people is less than 250.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A common approach for travellers from high-risk areas</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission proposes a common approach amongst Member States when dealing with travellers coming from \u2018high-risk' zones. Member States should not refuse the entry of persons travelling from other Member States. Member States that introduce restrictions to free movement based on their own decision-making processes, could require:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>persons travelling from an area classified as \u2018red' or \u2018grey' to either undergo quarantine <strong>OR </strong>undergo a COVID-19 test after arrival \u2013 COVID-19 testing being the preferred option;*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where justified, Member States could consider recommending that persons travelling from an area classified as \u2018orange' undergo at least a COVID-19 test prior to departure or upon arrival. Member States could require persons arriving from an area classified as \u2018red', \u2018orange' or \u2018grey' to submit passenger locator forms, notably those arriving by airplane, in accordance with data protection requirements. Travellers with an essential function or need \u2013 such as workers exercising critical occupations, frontier and posted workers, students or journalists performing their duties - should not be required to undergo quarantine.</p>\n<p><strong>Clear and timely information to the public </strong></p>\n<p>The Commission proposes that Member States provide details of upcoming restrictions to free movement or the lifting of travel restrictions to Member States and the Commission on a weekly basis. Changes should be notified a week before entering into force.</p>\n<p>Information should also be made available on the \u2018<a href=\"https://reopen.europa.eu/en\">Re-open EU</a>' web platform, with a link to the weekly-published map by the <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en\">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</a></p>\n<p>Citizens and businesses need predictability. Member States must make all efforts to minimise the social and economic impact of travel restrictions. This should include the provision of information to the public in in a clear, comprehensive and timely manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The right of European citizens to move and reside freely within the European Union is one of the most cherished achievements of the European Union, as well as an important driver of our economy. Any restrictions to the fundamental right of free movement within the EU should only be put in place where strictly necessary and be coordinated, proportionate and non-discriminatory to address public health risks. \u00a0To limit the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on free movement. A well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, safeguard the health of citizens as well as maintain free movement within the Union, under safe conditions. This is important for the millions of citizens who rely on frictionless cross-border travel every day, and crucial for our efforts to start safely re-building the economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p>The Commission's proposal for a Recommendation will be discussed by the Council with the aim of an adoption in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>More information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/proposal-council-recommendation-coordinated-approach-restriction-free-movement-response-covid-19-pandemic_en\">Proposal for a Council Recommendation</a> on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reopen.europa.eu/en\">Re-open EU</a></p></div>",

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, the European Commission announces that it will issue its forthcoming EU SURE bonds of up to \u20ac100 billion as social bonds. To that end, the Commission has adopted an independently evaluated <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower/eu-borrowing-activities/eu-sure-social-bond-framework_en\">Social Bond Framework</a>. This Framework is meant to provide investors in these bonds with confidence that the funds mobilised will serve a truly social objective.</p>\n<p>This announcement follows the Council's approval to grant financial support to 16 Member States under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and people in work.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, said<em>: \u201cWe are not only investing billions of euros to save jobs in Europe and reduce the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but we are also doing it by issuing social bonds. This will give investors the chance to contribute to our efforts and up to \u20ac100 billion will help keep people in jobs in our Member States.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner Johannes <strong>Hahn</strong>, in charge of Budget and Administration, said: <em>\u201cThe decision to issue the EU SURE bonds as social bonds will be a game changer for the global social bonds market. At the same time, it is a clear demonstration of the EU's long-term commitment to sustainable financing. I am very excited about today's announcement and looking forward to the forthcoming EU SURE issuance in the very near future.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The funds raised will be transferred to the beneficiary Member States in the form of loans to help them cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes and similar measures as a response to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Today's Framework demonstrates to the investor community how the funds raised by SURE bond issuance will be used for a clearly identified objective: alleviating the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences across the EU. Investors can therefore be confident that their investments in these bonds will be used to finance targeted social policy measures. At the same time, the Commission's Social Bond Framework will contribute to the further development of the social bond market which is one pillar of the European \u2018Sustainable Finance' market.</p>\n<p>In order to guarantee that the funds will be used for social purposes, the Social Bond Framework, underpinned by the SURE Regulation, requires Member States to report on how the borrowed funds have been spent. Under the Framework, Member States are also required to report on the social impact of the EU SURE bonds. Based on the information in these reports, the European Commission will be able to demonstrate to investors that the EU SURE bonds have been used to finance programmes with a positive social impact.</p>\n<p>By preparing and presenting a Social Bond Framework, the Commission seeks to appeal to investors who want to put their funds to work for Environmental, Social and Corporate governance (ESG) purposes. The Commission's Social Bond Framework has been established in full compliance with the Social Bond Principles (SBP) published by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). It has been independently evaluated by an external evaluator, Sustainalytics.</p>\n<p>Following today's announcement, the Commission is moving one step closer towards the issuance of the first SURE bonds. The first transaction will follow in the second half of October.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>So far, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/sure_en\">16 Member States will receive financial support</a> under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. Financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States. The Commission has today presented a proposal to the Council for a decision to grant \u20ac504 million in financial support to Hungary under the SURE instrument. Including Hungary, the Commission has now proposed a total of \u20ac87.8 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States.</p>\n<p>These loans will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the pandemic, in particular for the self-employed. SURE could also finance some health-related measures, in particular at the work place, used to ensure a safe return to normal economic activity.</p>\n<p>Member States can still submit formal requests for support under SURE, which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion to help protect jobs and workers affected by the pandemic.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_1809\">Questions and Answers</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower/eu-borrowing-activities/eu-sure-social-bond-framework_en\">Social Bond Framework</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/sure_en\">SURE website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower_en\">EU as a borrower website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/sure_en\">Proposal for a Council Implementing Decision for Hungary</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

The EU will use all its convening power to help keep the world united against coronavirus. With the chairmanship of Norway and South Africa representing the global North and South, and the expertise of the WHO and our international partners, no country or region will be left behind in this fight.</em><em>\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Dr Tedros <strong>Adhanom Ghebreyesus</strong>, WHO Director-General, said<em>: \u201cNearly 5,000 lives are lost each day due to COVID-19 and the global economy is expected to contract by trillions of dollars this year. The case for investing to end the pandemic has never been stronger. The ACT Accelerator is the best way to ensure equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, but at present is facing financing gap of US$35 billion. Fully financing the ACT Accelerator would shorten the pandemic and pay back this investment rapidly as the global economy recovers</em><em>.\u201d</em><em> \u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201c<em>The only way to defeat COVID-19 is together, globally. The only way forward is solidarity, responsibility and global cooperation. Today, we step up our global leadership to accelerate the development and equitable distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. The Facilitation Council will play an instrumental role in delivering on this goal.</em><em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p>During its first meeting, the Council has adopted a political statement highlighting global collaboration as key to defeat the virus. It stresses the importance of testing, treatment, vaccination and improved health systems to overcome the pandemic. The statement also mentions the progress made and call for additional resources to deliver on the mission.</p>\n<p>The Facilitation Council is composed by governments and non-governmental partners (BMGF, Wellcome Trust). It is co-chaired by Norway and South Africa, achieving geographical balance. The Council build on what the ACT-A has achieved in only four month, such as more than 200 vaccine candidates, 1700 clinical trials, and 80 diagnostics being followed, as well as 100 countries surveyed to identify capacity gaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p>Final comments on investment case and ACT-A Plan will be forthcoming on 17 September and then the ACT-A high-level event at UNGA will take place on 30 September.</p>\n<p>Between 15-30 September, there will be UNGA and G20 meetings and this will act to amplify the call to world leaders. Between 12-18 October, World Bank / IMF Annual meetings will take place to explore the scale of economic challenge and initial commitments. From November to March 2021, the G20 Summit and other related meetings will react upon the series of commitments.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the ACT-A Advocacy Campaign aims to address major political challenges and secure the more than \u20ac29 billion (US$35 billion) financing needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Launched at the end of April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator brings together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, and philanthropists and global health organizations (the <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://cepi.net/\">CEPI</a>, <a href=\"https://www.finddx.org/\">FIND</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/\">Gavi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/\">The </a><a href=\"https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/\">Global Fund</a>, <a href=\"https://unitaid.org/\">Unitaid</a>, <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/\">Wellcome</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/home\">WHO</a>,\u00a0the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/\">World Bank</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.globalfinancingfacility.org/\">Global Financing Facility</a>). It intends to accelerate the development of universally accessible <strong>vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics</strong>, and the improvement of the necessary health systems. Knowledge and data sharing are key. The ACT will be in place for 2 years (renewable). No new physical structure will be established, but use will be made of the expertise of existing institutions and partners.</p>\n<p>Three partnerships on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics define the strategy, identify the resources needed and set the accountability rules. They bring together industry, research, foundations, regulators and international organisations, following a value chain approach, from research to manufacturing and deployment. These partnerships work as autonomously as possible and are supported by a group of governmental and private non-profit partners.</p>\n<p>ACT-A's goal is to protect health systems and restore societies and economies by accelerating development, equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of 2 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2021, 245 million courses of therapeutics by mid-2021, and 500 million tests by mid-2021.</p>\n<p>The European Commission is committed in a global solution to the pandemic. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the <a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\">Coronavirus Global Response</a>, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">EU Coronavirus Response</a></p></div>",

The contract will allow all EU Member States to purchase up to 300 million doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine. Moreover, Member States may donate reserved doses to lower- and middle-income countries. Sanofi and GSK will also endeavour to provide a significant portion of their vaccine supply through a collaboration with the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility - the vaccine pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator for lower and middle income countries - in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>The Commission has already signed a contract with <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1524\">AstraZeneca</a> and continues discussing similar agreements with other vaccine manufacturers (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1481\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1494\">CureVac</a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1513\">Moderna</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1556\">BioNTech</a>) with which it has concluded exploratory talks.</p>\n<p>President <strong>von der Leyen </strong>said: \u201c<em>With today's contract with Sanofi-GSK, the European Commission shows once again its commitment </em><em>to ensuring equitable access to safe, effective and affordable vaccines not only for its citizens but also for the world's poorest and most vulnerable people</em><em>. Agreements with other companies will be concluded soon and build a diversified portfolio of promising vaccines, based on various types of technologies, increasing our chances to find an effective remedy against the virus</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: <em>\u201cWith several countries in Europe experiencing new outbreaks after the summer period, a safe and effective vaccine is more instrumental than ever to overcome this pandemic and its devastating effects on our economies and societies. This second agreement is yet another milestone in our EU Vaccine Strategy. Today we are expanding our possibilities to ensure that EU citizens and citizens around the world can gradually resume daily life and feel safe again.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Today's contract is financed by the Emergency Support Instrument, which dedicates funds to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.</p>\n<p>Sanofi and GSK are developing a recombinant vaccine for COVID-19, using innovative technology from both companies. Sanofi will contribute its S-protein COVID-19 antigen, which is based on recombinant DNA technology. GSK will contribute its adjuvant technology, of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore helping to protect more people.\u00a0The combination of a protein-based antigen together with an adjuvant is well-established and used in a number of vaccines available today to enhance the immune response. It can also improve the likelihood of delivering an effective vaccine that can be manufactured at scale.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The companies started a Phase 1/ 2 study in September, followed by a Phase 3 study by the end of 2020. If successful, and subject to regulatory considerations, the companies aim to have the vaccine available by the second half of 2021.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Together with the Member States and the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will use existing flexibilities to accelerate the authorisation and availability of successful vaccines against COVID-19. The regulatory processes will be flexible but remain robust. Any vaccine put on the market will have to meet the necessary safety requirements and undergo the scientific assessment by the European Medicines Agency as part of the EU market authorisation procedure.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of <strong>Advance Purchase Agreements</strong>. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.</p>\n<p>Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreement will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise would simply probably not happen.</p>\n<p>The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.

After a successful <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1606\">pilot phase</a>, the system goes live today with the first wave of national apps now linked through this service: Germany's Corona-Warn-App, Ireland's COVID tracker, and Italy's immuni. Together, these apps have been downloaded by around 30 million people, which corresponds to two-thirds of all app downloads in the EU.</p>\n<p>Thierry <strong>Breton</strong>, Commissioner for Single Market, said: <em>\u201cMany Member States have launched voluntary contact tracing and warning apps, and the Commission has supported them in make these apps safely interact with each other. Free movement is an integral part of the Single Market \u2013 the gateway is facilitating this while helping save lives.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Stella<strong> Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, added<em>: </em><em>\u201cCoronavirus tracing and warning apps can effectively complement other measures like increased testing and manual contact tracing. With cases on the rise again, they can play an important role to help us break the transmission chains. When working across borders these apps are even more powerful tools. Our gateway system going live today is an important step in our work, and I would call on citizens to make use of such apps, to help protecting each other.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Jens <strong>Spahn</strong>, Germany's Federal Minister of Health, said:<em> \u201cEverywhere in Europe, infections are on the rise again. Right now, national warning apps are making a real difference. Because every infection chain that, thanks to an app, is broken more quickly helps to contain the pandemic. With the new gateway service, we are connecting apps across Europe. Like this, contacts can also be warned during or following a trip abroad.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>In the fight against coronavirus, most Member States have decided to launch a contact tracing and warning app. In total, 20 apps which are based on decentralised systems can be interoperable through the gateway service. They can be linked to the gateway after following a protocol that foresees several tests and checks, and an update has to be issued for each app. The second group of apps will be linked next week. Then, Czechia's eRou\u0161ka, Denmark's smitte stop, Latvia's Apturi COVID and Spain's Radar Covid are expected to join, while further apps will be linked to the system in November. The overview of participating Member States is available on a dedicated <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/digital-solutions/tracing-warning-apps-coronavirus-crisis_en\">webpage</a>.</p>\n<p>The gateway ensures that apps work seamlessly cross-borders. Thus, users will only need to install one app and when they travel to another participating European country they will still benefit from contact tracing and receiving alerts, be it in their home country or abroad. The gateway server keeps the amount of data exchanged to a minimum. It will efficiently receive and pass on arbitrary identifiers between national apps. No other information than arbitrary keys, generated by the apps, will be handled by the gateway: the information is pseudonymised, encrypted, kept to the minimium, and only stored as long as necessary to trace back infections. It does not allow the identification of individual persons, nor to track location or movement of devices.</p>\n<p>The setup of the gateway follows the agreement by Member States on <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1043\">technical specifications</a> to ensure a safe exchange of information between the backend servers of national contact tracing and warning apps based on a decentralised architecture. The system was developed and set up in less than two months by T-Systems and SAP, and will be operated from the Commission's data centre in Luxembourg.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Contact tracing apps, if fully compliant with EU rules and well-coordinated, can play a key role in all phases of crisis management. They can complement existing manual contact tracing and help interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Thereby, they can contribute to saving lives.</p>\n<p>Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Member States, backed by the Commission, have been assessing the effectiveness, security, privacy, and data protection aspects of digital solutions to address the crisis. They have developed an\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdf\">EU toolbox</a>\u00a0for contact tracing and warning apps, which was accompanied by <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_669\">guidance on data protection</a>. This was part of a common coordinated approach to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures, as\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_626\">set out in a Commission Recommendation</a>. To ensure tracing and warning apps work cross-border, Member States, with the support of the Commission agreed on <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/contacttracing_mobileapps_guidelines_en.pdf\">interoperability guidelines</a> in May, on a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/key_documents_en#anchor0\">set of technical specifications</a> in June, and the Commission adopted an <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.LI.2020.227.01.0001.01.ENG\">Implementing Decision</a> to provide a legal basis for the gateway service.

Today, an important milestone has been reached as a group of Member States starts testing the infrastructure. The Commission has kicked off test runs between the backend servers of the official apps from the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Latvia, and a newly established gateway server.</p>\n<p>Thierry <strong>Breton</strong>, Commissioner for Single Market, said: <em>\u201cMany Member States have implemented national contact tracing and warning applications. It is now time to make them interact with each other. Travel and personal exchange are the core of the European project and the Single Market. The gateway will facilitate this in these times of pandemic and will save lives.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Stella<strong> Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, added<em>: \u201cCoronavirus tracing and warning apps working across borders can be powerful tools in our efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. With cases on the rise again, apps can complement other measures like increased testing and manual contact tracing. If used widely enough, they can help us break the chains of transmission. We will not stop fighting on all fronts against the pandemic.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>In the fight against coronavirus, most Member States have launched a national contact tracing and warning app, or plan to do so. The setup of the interoperability gateway service by the Commission follows the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1043\">agreement by Member States on technical specifications</a> to deliver a European solution to ensure a safe exchange of information between the backends of national contact tracing and warning apps based on a decentralised architecture. This covers almost all such apps launched in the EU.</p>\n<p>The gateway, a digital infrastructure that ensures the communication of information between national apps' backend servers, will ensure that apps will work seamlessly also cross-borders. Thus, users will only need to install one app and will still be able to report a positive infection test or receive an alert, even if they travel abroad.</p>\n<p>The gateway will efficiently receive and pass on arbitrary identifiers between national apps to minimise the amount of data exchanged and thus reduce users' data consumption. No other information than arbitrary keys, generated by the national apps, will be handled by the gateway. The information exchanged is pseudonymised, encrypted, kept to the minimium, and only stored as long as necessary to trace back infections. It does not allow the identification of individual persons.</p>\n<p>The gateway is developed and set up by T-Systems and SAP and will be operated from the Commission's data centre in Luxembourg. After testing, it will start to be operational in October.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Member States, backed by the Commission, have been assessing the effectiveness, security, privacy, and data protection aspects of digital solutions to address the crisis. Contact tracing apps, if fully compliant with EU rules and well coordinated, can play a key role in all phases of crisis management, especially during this time when most countries are gradually lifting social distancing measures. They can complement existing manual contact tracing and help interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Thereby, they can contribute to saving lives.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Member States in the eHealth Network, supported by the Commission, have developed an\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdf\">EU toolbox for the use of mobile applications for contact tracing and warning</a>\u00a0in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which\u00a0was accompanied by\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_669\">guidance on data protection</a>\u00a0for mobile apps. This is part of a common coordinated approach to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures, as\u00a0<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_626\">set out in a Commission Recommendation</a>. To ensure contact tracing and warning apps work also cross-border, Member States, with the support of the Commission agreed on <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/contacttracing_mobileapps_guidelines_en.pdf\">interoperability guidelines</a> in May, on a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/key_documents_en#anchor0\">set of technical specifications</a> in June, and the Commission adopted an <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.LI.2020.227.01.0001.01.ENG\">Implementing Decision</a> to provide a legal basis for the set-up of the gateway service.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_869\">Questions and Answers: a common approach for safe and efficient mobile tracing apps across the EU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/key_documents_en#anchor0\">Technical specifications for interoperability of contact tracing apps</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/contacttracing_mobileapps_guidelines_en.pdf\">Interoperability guidelines for contact tracing apps</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdf\">EU toolbox on mobile applications to support contact tracing in the EU's fight against COVID-19</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_669\">Guidance to ensure full data protection standards of apps fighting the pandemic</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/covid-19-mobile-applications-support-contact-tracing\">ECDC guidance on mobile applications in support of contact tracing for COVID-19</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/recommendation-apps-contact-tracing_en\">Commission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Commission coronavirus response page</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/content/digital-technologies-actions-response-coronavirus-pandemic\">Digital technologies in response to coronavirus</a></p></div>",

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>The European Commission issued a \u20ac17 billion inaugural social bond under the EU SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac10 billion due for repayment in October 2030 and \u20ac7 billion due for repayment in 2040. There was very strong investor interest in this highly rated instrument, and the bonds were more than 13 times oversubscribed, resulting in favourable pricing terms for both bonds.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong> said: <em>\u201cFor the first time in history, the Commission is issuing social bonds on the market, to raise money that will help keep people in jobs. This unprecedented step matches the extraordinary times we are living in. We are sparing no efforts to safeguard livelihoods in Europe. I'm glad that countries hit badly by the crisis will receive support under SURE rapidly.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>European Commissioner Johannes <strong>Hahn</strong> in charge of Budget and Administration said: <em>\u201cWith this operation, the European Commission has made a first step towards entering the major league in global debt capital markets. The strong investor interest and the favourable conditions under which the bond was placed are further proof of the great interest in EU bonds. The \u201csocial bond\u201d character of the issuance has helped to attract investors who wish to help EU Member States in supporting employment through these difficult times.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Both bonds were issued on attractive terms, reflecting the high level of interest. The 10-year bond was priced at 3 basis points above mid-swaps. The 20-year bond was priced at 14 basis points over mid-swaps. The final new issue premiums have been estimated at 1 bps and 2 bps for the 10-year and 20-year tranches respectively, both values being extremely limited given the amounts printed.</p>\n<p>These represent attractive pricing conditions for the Commission's largest ever bond issuance and a favourable debut for the SURE programme. The terms on which the Commission borrows are passed on directly to the Member States receiving the loans. (See <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/about_the_european_commission/eu_budget/sure_1st_dual_tranche_press_release_final_cln.pdf\">here</a> for more details on the pricing of the transaction).</p>\n<p>The banks that supported the European Commission with this transaction (\u201cjoint bookrunners\u201d) were Barclays (IRL), BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Nomura and UniCredit.</p>\n<p>The funds raised will be transferred to the beneficiary Member States in the form of loans to help them cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes and similar measures as a response to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>In that context, the Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1808\">announced</a> earlier this month that it would issue the entire EU SURE bond of up to \u20ac100 billion as social bonds, and adopted an independently evaluated <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower/eu-borrowing-activities/eu-sure-social-bond-framework_en\">Social Bond Framework</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background on SURE</strong></p>\n<p>So far, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/sure_en\">17 Member States will receive financial support</a> under the SURE instrument to help protect jobs and keep people in work. Financial support will be provided in the form of loans granted on favourable terms from the EU to Member States.</p>\n<p>These loans will help Member States to cover the costs directly related to the financing of national short-time work schemes, and other similar measures they have put in place as a response to the pandemic, in particular for the self-employed. SURE could also finance some health-related measures, in particular at the work place, used to ensure a safe return to normal economic activity.</p>\n<p>Member States can still submit formal requests for support under SURE, which has an overall firepower of up to \u20ac100 billion to help protect jobs and workers affected by the pandemic. The Commission has already proposed a total of \u20ac87.8 billion in financial support under SURE to 17 Member States.</p>\n<p><strong>Background on the EU borrowing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The EU was established by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and is 0% risk weighed as an issuer (Basel III).

The European Commission is empowered by the EU Treaty to borrow on the international capital markets, on behalf of the European Union.</li>\n<li>The EU borrows exclusively in Euros for on-lending in Euros to sovereign borrowers. The EU currently operates four loan programmes: The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (\"EFSM\"), the Balance of Payments facility (\"BoP\"), the Macro-Financial Assistance (\"MFA\") and the Support to mitigate Unemployment Risk in an Emergency (SURE), recently adopted by the Council on 19 May 2020.</li>\n<li>The bonds issued by the EU under SURE will benefit from a social bond label.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Further details on the issuance:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ahead of the transaction, the EU sent a Request for Proposal (RfP) to 20 banks on 9 October 2020 informing them of its intention to raise significant amounts in the market.</li>\n<li>The formal mandate for a dual tranche issue was announced on Monday, 19 October at 13:25 CET.</li>\n<li>Books were opened on Tuesday, 20 October 2020 in the morning at 08:55 CET and closed at 10:00 CET.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_1955\">Questions and Answers</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/about_the_european_commission/eu_budget/sure_1st_dual_tranche_press_release_final_cln.pdf\">Technical press release</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower/eu-borrowing-activities/eu-sure-social-bond-framework_en\">Social Bond Framework</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/funding-mechanisms-and-facilities/sure_en\">SURE website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/eu-borrower_en\">EU as a borrower website</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

The number of coronavirus cases is rising rapidly. And it needs medical equipment to treat patients in hospitals. We do not leave our European friends alone in these hard times. The European Commission is mobilising medical material through our Civil Protection Mechanism. I just called the Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 to tell him that we are dispatching rapidly to Czechia a set of 30 ventilators from our RescEU reserve. We created this reserve in record time in spring, to stockpile essential medical material that we can send to European countries in need. And we are in touch with other EU countries, to mobilise more ventilators for the Czech Republic. We are in this together.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201dWe have been working around the clock to avoid a repetition of the situation experienced at the end of February, when whole EU was overwhelmed in the fight against the pandemic. We created the rescEU medical reserve so no Member State is left alone when dealing with the same challenge. After already delivering protective face masks across Europe, this will be the first time the European Commission is dispatching ventilators from the EU level reserve,\u201d</em> said Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez <strong>Lenar\u010di\u010d</strong><em>.</em></p>\n<p>The EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre is in constant contact with authorities in Czech and more EU assistance can be channelled in the coming days via the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en\">EU Civil Protection Mechanism</a>, coming from Member States. In order to give Member States time to assess their response capacity and taking into account the gravity of the situation in the Czech Republic, the EU has proactively initiated the rescEU deployment of medical reserve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The rescEU capacity can include different types of medical equipment, such as protective masks or medical ventilators used in intensive care, and is constantly replenished. The reserve is hosted by several Member States who are responsible for procuring the equipment. The European Commission finances 100% of the assets, including storage and transport.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, the European Commission is launching an additional set of actions to help limit the spread of the coronavirus, save lives and strengthen the internal market's resilience. Concretely, the measures aim to better understand the virus' spread and the effectiveness of the response, ramp up well-targeted testing, bolster contact tracing, improve preparations for vaccination campaigns, and maintain access to essential supplies such as vaccination equipment, while keeping all goods moving in the single market and facilitating safe travel. This comes ahead of the European Leaders' virtual meeting on 29 October on COVID-19 coordination, following the <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/10/16/european-council-conclusions-15-16-october-2020/\">15 October European Council</a>. Even though Member States are better prepared and more coordinated than in the early months of the pandemic, citizens, families and communities across Europe continue to face an unprecedented risk to their health and well-being.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, said: <em>\u201cThe COVID-19 situation is very serious. We must step up our EU response. Today we are launching additional measures in our fight against the virus; from increasing access to fast testing, and preparing vaccination campaigns to facilitating safe travel when necessary. I call on Member States to work closely together. Courageous steps taken now will help save lives and protect livelihoods. No Member State will emerge safely from this pandemic until everyone does.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: <em>\u201cThe rise in COVID-19 infection rates across Europe is very alarming. Decisive immediate action is needed for Europe to protect lives and livelihoods, to alleviate the pressure on healthcare systems, and to control the spread of the virus. Next month, we will present the first step towards a European Health Union. In the meantime, Member States must improve cooperation and data sharing. Our EU surveillance system is only as strong as its weakest link. It is only by showing true European solidarity and working together that we can overcome this crisis. Together we are stronger.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The Commission's Communication on additional COVID-19 response measures sets out <strong>next steps\u00a0in key areas</strong> to reinforce the EU's response to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases: \u00a0</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Improving the flow of information to allow informed decision-making </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ensuring accurate, comprehensive, comparable and timely information on epidemiological data, as well as on testing, contact tracing and public health surveillance, is essential to track how the coronavirus spreads at regional and national level. To improve the sharing of data at EU level, the Commission calls on Member States to provide all relevant data to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Commission.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Establishing more effective and rapid testing </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Testing is a decisive tool to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. To promote a common approach and effective testing, the Commission is today <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/preparedness_response/docs/covid19_testingstrategies_recommendation_en.pdf\">adopting</a> a <strong>Recommendation on COVID-19 testing strategies</strong>, including the use of rapid antigen tests. It sets out key elements to be considered for national, regional or local testing strategies, such as their scope, priority groups, and key points linked to testing capacities and resources, and indications as to when rapid antigen testing may be appropriate. It also calls on Member States to submit <strong>national strategies on testing by mid-November</strong>. <strong>To directly purchase rapid antigen tests</strong> and deliver them to Member States, the Commission is mobilising <strong>\u20ac100 million </strong>under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/emergency-support-instrument_en\">Emergency Support Instrument</a>. In parallel, the Commission is launching a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/public-health_en#ensuring-the-availability-of-supplies-and-equipment\">joint procurement</a> to ensure a second stream of access. Where Member States are applying prior testing requirements to incoming travellers and where no testing capacities are available for asymptomatic travellers in the country of origin, <strong>travellers should be offered the possibility to undergo a test after arrival.</strong> If negative COVID-19 tests are to be required or recommended for any activity, mutual recognition of tests is essential, in particular in the context of travel.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Making full use of contact tracing and warning apps across borders </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic/how-tracing-and-warning-apps-can-help-during-pandemic_en\">Contact tracing and warning apps</a> help to break transmission chains. So far, Member States have developed 19 national contact tracing and warning apps, downloaded more than 52 million times. The Commission recently launched a solution for linking national apps across the EU through a \u2018<strong>European Federation Gateway Service</strong>'. Three national apps (Germany, Ireland, and Italy) were first linked on 19 October when the system came online. Many more will follow in the coming weeks. In total, 17 national apps are currently based on decentralised systems and can become interoperable through the service in the coming rounds; others are in the pipeline. All Member States should set up effective and compatible apps and reinforce their communication efforts to promote their uptake.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Effective vaccination</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The development and uptake of safe and effective vaccines is a priority effort to quickly end the crisis. Under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/public-health_en#eu-vaccine-strategy\">EU Strategy on COVID-19 vaccines</a>, the Commission is negotiating agreements with vaccine producers to make vaccines available to Europeans and the world as soon as soon as they are proven safe and effective. Once available, vaccines need to be quickly distributed and deployed to maximum effect. On 15 October, the Commission set out the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1903\">key steps</a> that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission will put in place a <strong>common reporting framework </strong>and a<strong> platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies</strong>. To share the best practices, the conclusions of the first review on national vaccination plans will be presented in November 2020.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Effective communication to citizens </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Clear communication is essential for the public health response to be successful since this largely depends on the public adherence to health recommendations. <strong>All Member States should relaunch communication campaigns</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>counter false, misleading and dangerous information</strong> that continues to circulate, and to address the risk of \u201cpandemic fatigue\u201d. Vaccination is a specific area where public authorities need to step up their actions to tackle misinformation and secure public trust, as there will be no compromise on safety or effectiveness under Europe's robust vaccine authorisation system. Vaccines do not save lives \u2013 vaccination does.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Securing essential supplies</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since the beginning of the outbreak, the EU has supported manufacturers to ensure the availability of essential medicines and medical equipment. The Commission has launched a <strong>new joint procurement for medical equipment for vaccination</strong>. In order to give Member States better and cheaper access to the tools needed to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19, the Commission is today also <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/public-health_en#ensuring-the-availability-of-supplies-and-equipment\">extending</a> the <strong>temporary suspension of customs duties and VAT on the import of medical equipment</strong> from non-EU countries. The Commission is also <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/news/covid-19-commission-puts-forward-taxation-and-customs-measures-support-access-more-affordable-equipment-vaccines-and-testing-kits_en\">proposing</a> that hospitals and medical practitioners should <strong>not have to pay VAT on vaccines and testing kits used in the fight against the coronavirus.</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> Facilitating safe travel </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Free movement within the EU and the border-free Schengen area are prized achievements of European integration - the Commission is working to ensure that travel within Europe is safe both for travellers and for their fellow citizens:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Commission calls on Member States to <strong>fully implement the </strong><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic/common-approach-travel-measures-eu_en\"><strong>Recommendation</strong></a><strong> adopted by the Council for a common and coordinated approach to restrictions to free movement</strong>. Citizens and businesses want clarity and predictability. Any remaining COVID-19 related internal border control measures should be lifted.</li>\n<li>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the ECDC are working on a <strong>testing protocol for travellers</strong>, to be used by public health authorities, airlines and airports to help the safe arrival of passengers. The Commission will also work with Member States and agencies on a <strong>common approach to quarantine practices</strong>, with inputs from ECDC to be presented in November.</li>\n<li>Passenger Locator Forms help Member States undertake risk assessments of arrivals and enable contact tracing. A pilot next month will allow Member States to prepare for the launch and use of a common <strong>EU digital Passenger Locator Form</strong>, while fully respecting data protection.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reopen.europa.eu/\">Re-open EU</a> provides timely and accurate information on health measures and travel restrictions in all Member States and some partner countries. The Commission calls on Member States to provide accurate and up-to-date information to <strong>turn Re-open EU into the</strong> <strong>one-stop-shop </strong>for information about health measures and travel possibilities across the EU. A<strong> mobile Re-open EU app </strong>is being developed and will launch in the coming weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When it comes to restrictions on non-essential travel from non-EU countries into the EU, the Commission is presenting <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20201028_com-2020-686-commission-communication_en.pdf\">guidance</a> on categories of persons considered to be essential and therefore exempted from restrictions. This will help Member States to consistently implement the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32020H0912\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Council Recommendation</span></a> on the temporary travel restriction to the EU. The Commission also once more encourages Member States to facilitate the <strong>reunion of those in durable relationships</strong> and provides examples of evidence that can be used for this purpose.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong> Green Lanes extension</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since March, the application of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/transportation-during-pandemic_en\">Green Lanes</a> \u2013 most notably for road freight to cross borders in less than 15 minutes \u2013 has helped to maintain the supply of goods and the economic fabric of the EU. The Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/legislation/com20200685-green-lanes-upgrade_en.pdf\">proposes</a> to <strong>extend the Green Lane approach</strong> to ensure that multi-modal transport works effectively in areas including rail and waterborne freight and air cargo, and provides additional guidance to facilitate application in practice, on issues such as electronic documentation, and availability of rest and refuelling points. Member States should ensure the seamless free movement of goods across the Single Market.</p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>Recent weeks have seen an alarming increase in the rate of COVID-19 infections across Europe, and sparked new measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus and mitigate its impact. With health systems again under pressure, more needs to be done to control and overcome the situation, protecting lives and livelihoods, and promote European solidarity. Although preparedness and cooperation between Member States has improved since the start of the pandemic, coordination remains essential and must be enhanced.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-additional-covid-19-response-measures_en\">COVID-19 Communication on additional measures</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">Commission's coronavirus response website </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_1998\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Factsheet: Coronavirus Resurgence: New preparedness and response measures across the EU</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_1911\">Factsheet: EU Coronavirus response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reopen.europa.eu/\">Re-open EU</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic/how-tracing-and-warning-apps-can-help-during-pandemic_en\">Contact tracing and warning apps</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/emergency-support-instrument_en\">Emergency Support Instrument</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/transportation-during-pandemic_en\">Green Lanes</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

The EU established SURE (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risk in an Emergency) earlier this year to help protect jobs and workers across Europe, which have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The social bond will be displayed on the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX).</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe are extremely proud to celebrate the listing of the SURE social bond on our exchange and its display on LGX, our platform dedicated exclusively to sustainable securities. This bond raises funds to secure hundreds of thousands of jobs in multiple Member States. Contributing to inclusive and sustainable growth is at the core of LGX's mission, and today's bond listing marks an important milestone not just for Europe, but for sustainable finance</em>,\u201d commented Robert <strong>Scharfe</strong>, CEO of LuxSE.</p>\n<p><strong>Unprecedented investor response</strong></p>\n<p>The EUR 17 billion social bond issuance is the very first social bond issued by the European Commission. It consists of two tranches; a EUR 10 billion tranche with a 10-year maturity and a EUR 7 billion tranche with a 20-year maturity. The bond was 13 times oversubscribed, with demands exceeding EUR 233 billion, which reflects the enormous support from the investor community for a social bond that will safeguard jobs and fight the rising unemployment in European countries stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cToday's listing at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange is another highlight of a process which started months ago with our dedicated work to establish SURE. This instrument enables quick financial support for social matters, especially in the area of employment which is heavily affected by the crisis. The issuance of social bonds demonstrates the EU's firm commitment to foster sustainable finance also at global level. Last week's successful launch is proof that investors appreciate not only the safety guaranteed by the EU, but also the quality of investments, aligned with the EU's strategic political priorities such as sustainability, social fairness and an environmental-friendly economy,\u201d</em> stated Johannes <strong>Hahn</strong>, European Commissioner for Budget and Administration.</p>\n<p><strong>Fighting unemployment</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the European Commission established a Social Bond Framework aligned with the International Capital Market Association's Social Bond Principles. The Social Bond Framework received a favourable second-party opinion by Sustainalytics. Issued under the EU Debt Issuance Programme, the social bond issuance is governed by Luxembourg law.</p>\n<p>The EU SURE programme has a mandate of borrowing up to EUR 100 billion on capital markets to support efforts to protect jobs and fight unemployment across Europe. So far, 17 Member States will receive financial support totalling EUR 87.9 billion under the programme to protect jobs and workers in their respective countries. Under the Social Bond Framework, the Member States will report on the allocation of the funds and on the concrete impact in terms of the number of jobs supported.</p>\n<p><strong>Social brought to the fore</strong></p>\n<p>The EU SURE social bond is listed at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and displayed on the Luxembourg Green Exchange, the world's leading platform exclusively dedicated to sustainable securities. LuxSE established LGX in 2016 as a direct contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. LGX facilitates sustainable investment and helps reorient capital flows towards green and sustainable development. Today, LGX encompasses around 830 securities representing more than EUR 320 billion.</p>\n<p>The EU SURE social bond framework will contribute to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 on Good health and well-being and Goal 8 on Decent work and economic growth. In this way, the SURE social bond programme contributes to the sustainable development strategy established by the EU.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Luxembourg Stock Exchange</strong></p>\n<p>The Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) is the gateway to access international investors. With more than 37,000 listed securities, including 33,000 debt instruments, from 2,000 issuers in 100 countries, LuxSE is one of the world's leading exchanges for the listing of international, financial securities and offers a unique and integrated service offering covering listing, trading and information services.</p>\n<p>In 2016, LuxSE launched the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX) and became the first exchange in the world to operate a platform dedicated entirely to sustainable securities.

We now need to move forward with finalising the agreement on the next long-term budget and NextGenerationEU by the end of the year. Help is needed for citizens and business badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Our recovery plan will help us turn the challenge of the pandemic into an opportunity for a recovery led by the green and digital transition\u201d.</em></p>\n<p>European Commissioner Johannes<strong> Hahn</strong> in charge of the budget, who worked to facilitate the deal since the beginning of the mandate, said: <em>\u201cToday's agreement will allow to reinforce specific programmes under the long-term budget for 2021-2027 (including Horizon Europe, Erasmus+, EU4Health). All in all, the EU long-term budget together with NextGenerationEU will amount to more than \u20ac1.8 trillion.

The package also pays a specific attention to <strong>biodiversity protection and gender equality.</strong></li>\n<li>The budget will have <strong>strengthened flexibility mechanisms</strong> to guarantee it has the capacity to address unforeseen needs. <strong>This is making it a budget fit not only for today's realities but also for tomorrow's uncertainties. </strong></li>\n<li>As proposed in May 2020 and agreed by EU leaders on 21 July 2020, to finance the recovery, the EU will borrow on the markets at more favourable costs than many Member States and redistribute the amounts.</li>\n<li>A clear roadmap towards new own resources to help repay the borrowing. The Commission has committed to put forward proposals on a carbon border adjustment mechanism and on a digital levy by June 2021, with a view to their introduction at the latest by 1 January 2023. The Commission will also review the EU Emissions Trading System in spring 2021, including its possible extension to aviation and maritime. It will propose an own resource based on the Emissions Trading System by June 2021. In addition, the Commission will propose additional new own resources, which could include a Financial Transaction Tax and a financial contribution linked to the corporate sector or a new common corporate tax base. The Commission will work to make a proposal by June 2024.</li>\n<li>In terms of EU budget protection, now, for the first time, the EU will have a specific mechanism to protect its budget against breaches of the rule of law as agreed on 5 November. At the same time, final beneficiaries of EU funding in the Member State concerned will not be negatively affected by this mechanism.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps </strong></p>\n<p>The MFF Regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement endorsed today must now be formally adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, in line with their respective roles and procedures.</p>\n<p>In parallel, work must continue towards a final adoption of all other elements of the package, including the sectoral legislation and the Own Resources Decision.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Own Resources Decision, which will enable the Commission to borrow, ratification by all Member States in line with their constitutional requirements is also needed. The European Parliament, at the September plenary, has already provided its positive opinion on this piece of legislation. The adoption by the Council is the next step.</p>\n<p>In parallel, negotiations on the annual budget for 2021 have to take place. The 21-day conciliation period, during which the European Parliament and the Council should reach an agreement, runs between 17 November and 7 December this year.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Commission remains fully committed to accompany the process.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background </strong></p>\n<p>The Commission put forward its proposal for the EU's next long-term budget on 2 May 2018. The framework proposal was immediately followed by legislative proposals for the 37 sectoral programmes (e.g. cohesion, agriculture, Erasmus, Horizon Europe, etc). Between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the Commission worked hand in hand with the rotating Presidencies of the Council, and in close collaboration with the European Parliament, to take the negotiations forward.</p>\n<p>On 27 May 2020, in response to the unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus, the European Commission proposed the temporary recovery instrument NextGenerationEU of \u20ac750 billion, as well as targeted reinforcements to the long-term EU budget for 2021-2027.</p>\n<p>On 21 July 2020, EU heads of state or government reached a political agreement on the package. Since then, the European Parliament and the Council, and with the participation of the European Commission, held 11 trilateral political trilogues on the deal with the aim of fine-tuning the final parameters of the deal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eus-next-long-term-budget-nextgenerationeu-key-facts-and-figures_en\">Factsheet</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/long-term-eu-budget/eu-budget-2021-2027_en\">MFF website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2088\">Questions and Answers</a></p></div>",

Member States can decide to donate the vaccine to lower and middle-income countries or to re-direct it to other European countries.</p>\n<p>Today's contract with the BioNTech-Pfizer alliance builds upon the broad portfolio of vaccines to be produced in Europe, including the already signed a contracts with <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1524\">AstraZeneca</a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1680\">Sanofi-GSK</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1829\">Janssen Pharmaceutica NV</a>, and the concluded successful exploratory talks with <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1494\">CureVac</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1513\">Moderna</a>. This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective.</p>\n<p>President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, said: <em>\u00a0\u201c</em><em>In the wake of Monday's promising announcement by BioNTech and Pfizer on the prospects for their vaccine, I'm very happy to announce today's agreement with the European company BioNTech and Pfizer to purchase 300 million doses of the vaccine. With this fourth contract we are now consolidating an extremely solid vaccine candidate portfolio, most of them in advanced trials phase. Once authorised, they will be quickly deployed and bring us closer to a sustainable solution of the pandemic.</em><em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: \u201c<em>A safe and effective vaccine is the only lasting exit strategy from the pandemic, and is at the centre of our European Vaccine Strategy. Today's agreement follows the encouraging first indications from the clinical trial results and is further evidence of our commitment to putting more Europe in the area of health. It is a very telling example of what the EU can achieve when working together, as a Union, and a case in point of what a future European Health Union will be able to deliver.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>BioNTech is a German company working with US-based Pfizer to develop a new vaccine based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in\u00a0 biology, transferring instructions from DNA to cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions make harmless fragments of the virus which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease.</p>\n<p>The Commission has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the companies' experience in vaccine development and their production capacity to supply the whole of the EU.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>In June, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and BioNTech concluded a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1034\">\u20ac100 million debt financing agreement</a> to allow the company to expand its manufacturing capacity in order to supply their vaccine quickly worldwide. The financing is backed by the <a href=\"https://www.eib.org/en/efsi/index.htm\">European Fund for Strategic Investments</a> and also benefits from <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/access-risk-finance\">InnovFin Risk Sharing</a> for Corporate Research backed by Horizon 2020.*</p>\n<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of <strong>Advance Purchase Agreements</strong>. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.</p>\n<p>Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.</p>\n<p>Once vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1903\">key steps</a> that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies.</p>\n<p>The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the <a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\">Coronavirus Global Response</a>, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere.

COVAX is an example of this. With this additional contribution we are one step closer to the objective of funding the purchase of 2 billion vaccines for the most vulnerable populations in 92 low and middle-income countries. But more support will be required next year to produce and distribute a safe and efficacious vaccine across the world as soon as it becomes available. We will not relent in this effort.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The proposed allocation of \u20ac100 million from the 11<sup>th</sup> European Development Fund (EDF) general reserve will adopt the form of a grant contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as administrator of COVAX Facility, the world's facility for universal and fair access to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>\n<p>To date, a total of 184 countries participate in the COVAX Facility, being 92 of them low and middle-income economies eligible to get access to COVID-19 vaccines through Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). Through this grant, the Commission and its partners will secure purchase options for future COVID-19 vaccines for all the participants in the Facility, including African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.</p>\n<p>This grant support will strategically complement the \u20ac400 million of bank guarantees the EU will make available to Gavi through the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the framework of the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), raising the total EU contribution for COVAX to \u20ac500 million.*</p>\n<p>Several EU Member States are contributing as well to COVAX and its underlying objectives, highlighting another example of the power of Team Europe, that is mobilising more than \u20ac870 million for COVAX, including the \u20ac100 million in EU grant and \u20ac400 million in guarantees. The figure also includes new contributions announced today by France (\u20ac100 million), Spain (\u20ac50 million) and Finland (\u20ac2 million).</p>\n<p>Vaccines will be procured and delivered to countries by UNICEF Supply Division and the PAHO's Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>COVAX is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.</p>\n<p>The COVAX Facility aims to purchase 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. It will help to develop a diversified portfolio of vaccines, negotiated with different suppliers, and covering different scientific technologies, delivery times and prices. The COVAX Facility is a risk-sharing mechanism: it reduces the risk for manufacturers who invest without being sure about future demand, and it reduces the risk that countries would fail to secure access to a viable vaccine.</p>\n<p>The European Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home, and to promote global health. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the\u00a0<a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coronavirus Global Response</a>, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.\u00a0<em>Team Europe</em>'s contribution was as follows: EU Member States (\u20ac3.1 billion), European Commission (over \u20ac1.4 billion) and EIB (almost \u20ac2 billion pledged in May and \u20ac4.9 billion pledged in June).</p>\n<p>The EU's participation in COVAX will be complementary with the ongoing EU negotiations with vaccine companies launched under the EU Vaccines Strategy. The EU's efforts to develop and produce an effective vaccine will benefit all in the global community. The EU investment in scaling up manufacturing capacity will be to the service of all countries in need. Through its Advanced Purchase Agreements, it requires manufacturers to make their production capacity available to supply all countries and calls for the free flow of vaccines and materials with no export restrictions. For instance, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-GSK, with whom the Commission <u><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1680\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">concluded an Advanced Purchase Agreement in September</a>,</u>\u00a0will endeavour to provide a significant portion of their vaccine supply through the COVAX facility.</p>\n<p>World leaders and international organizations are participating in this virtual third edition of <strong>The Paris Peace Forum</strong>, initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron to revive collective governance, international cooperation and multilateralism at a time of growing challenges and when international norms and institutions are being challenged.

The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac8 billion due for repayment in November 2025 and \u20ac6 billion due for repayment in November 2050. The issuance has received an overwhelming response in the capital markets and the bonds were 13 and 11.5 times oversubscribed, respectively for the 5- and 30-year tranche, resulting in favourable pricing terms for both bonds. The terms on which the Commission borrows are passed on directly to the beneficiary Member States.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bonds issued by the EU under SURE benefit from a social bond label.

    "article_content": "<div _ngcontent-c1=\"\" class=\"ecl-paragraph\"><p>Today, the European Commission has granted a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for the COVID\u201119 vaccine developed by Moderna, the second COVID-19 vaccine authorised in the EU. This authorisation follows a positive scientific recommendation based on a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is endorsed by the Member States.</p>\n<p>The President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, said: <em>\u201cWe are providing more COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans. With the Moderna vaccine, the second one now authorised in the EU, we will have a further 160 million doses. And more vaccines will come. Europe has secured up to two billion doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines. We'll have more than enough safe and effective vaccines for protecting all Europeans.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: <em>\u201cWe are all in this together and united. This is why we have negotiated the broadest vaccine portfolio in the world for all our Member States. Today we are authorising a second safe and effective vaccine from Moderna, which together with BioNTech-Pfizer, will ensure that 460 million doses will be rolled out with increasing speed in the EU, and more will come. Member States have to ensure that the pace of vaccinations follows suit. Our efforts will not stop until vaccines are available for everyone in the EU.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Moderna submitted on 30 November 2020 an application for marketing authorisation to EMA, which had already started a rolling review of the data in November. Thanks to this rolling review, EMA has been assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine as data has become available. EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has thoroughly assessed the data and recommended by consensus that a formal conditional marketing authorisation is granted. A conditional marketing authorisation is one of EU's regulatory mechanisms for facilitating early access to medicines that fulfil an unmet medical need, including in emergency situations such as the current pandemic.</p>\n<p>On the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional market authorisation.</p>\n<p>The Moderna vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA plays a fundamental role in\u00a0biology, transferring instructions from DNA to the cells' protein making machinery. In an mRNA vaccine, these instructions produce harmless fragments of the virus, which the human body uses to build an immune response to prevent or fight disease. When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions and produce a spike protein, a protein on the outer surface of the virus which it uses to enter the body's cells and cause disease. The person's immune system will then treat this protein as foreign and produce natural defences \u2014 antibodies and T cells \u2014 against it.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps*</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"background: white;\">Moderna, with whom the Commission signed a </span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2200\"><span style=\"background: white;\">contract</span></a><span style=\"background: white;\"> on 25 November, will deliver the total amount of 160 million doses between the first and the fourth quarters of 2021. It will add to the 300 million doses of the vaccine distributed by BioNTech/Pfizer, the first vaccine to have been authorised in the EU on 21 December 2020. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>A conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However, once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks.</p>\n<p>Moderna submitted on 30 November 2020 an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA. EMA has already been assessing data on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality and results from laboratory studies and clinical trials in the context of a <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-mrna-covid-19-vaccine-moderna-biotech-spain-sl\">rolling review</a>. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.</p>\n<p>The European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional market authorisation.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1597339415327&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0245\">EU Vaccines Strategy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2390\">Questions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en\">Safe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">EU Coronavirus Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/human-use_en\">EU's legislation on medicinal products</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en\">EMA and COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2363\">Factsheet: How vaccines work</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2364\">Factsheet: Health benefits of vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2245\">Factsheet: Authorisation process</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2365\">Factsheet: Long-term safety</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2244\">EU's current portfolio</a></p>\n<p>* Updated on 11 January 2021 at 12:05.\u00a0</p></div>",

This diversified vaccines portfolio will ensure Europe is well prepared for vaccination, once the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective, as is already the case for <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2466\">BioNTech/Pfizer</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3\">Moderna</a>, recently authorised in the EU.

Today's step toward reaching an agreement with Valneva further complements the EU's vaccines portfolio and demonstrates the Commission's commitment to find a lasting solution to the pandemic.\"</em></p>\n<p>Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: <em>\"With this eighth vaccine, we are adding to our already broad and diversified range of vaccines in our portfolio. By doing this, we can maximise our chances of making sure that all citizens can have access to safe and effective of vaccinations by the end of 2021. All Member States have now started their vaccination campaigns and will start receiving an increasing number of doses in order to cover all their needs during this year</em><em>.\"</em></p>\n<p>Valneva is a European biotechnology company developing an inactivated virus vaccine. This is a traditional vaccine technology, used for 60-70 years, with established methods and a high level of safety. Most of the influenza vaccines and many childhood vaccines use this technology. This is currently the only inactivated vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe.</p>\n<p>The Commission, with the support of EU Member States, has taken a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company's experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply all EU Member States.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States.</p>\n<p>Since the high cost and high failure rate make investing in a COVID-19 vaccine a high-risk decision for vaccine developers, these agreements will therefore allow investments to be made that otherwise might not happen.</p>\n<p>Once vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective and have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, they need to be quickly distributed and deployed across Europe. On 15 October, the Commission set out the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1903\">key steps</a> that Member States need to take to be fully prepared, which includes the development of national vaccination strategies. The Commission is putting in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national vaccine strategies and has adopted <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1986\">further actions </a>\u00a0to reinforce preparedness and response measures across the EU and a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2254\">strategy</a> on staying safe from COVID-19 during winter offering further support to Member States in the deployment of vaccines.</p>\n<p>The Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. This is why it has raised almost \u20ac16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the <a href=\"https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en\">Coronavirus Global Response</a>, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery and has confirmed its interest to participate in the COVAX Facility for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines everywhere. As part of a Team Europe effort, the Commission announced is contributing with \u20ac400 million in guarantees an additional \u20ac100 million in grant funding to support COVAX Facility and its objectives in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response. This \u20ac500 million from the EU budget combined with contributions from EU Member States and the EIB will be a key contribution for the COVAX Facility to ensure over one billion vaccine doses will be made available to people in low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1597339415327&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0245\">EU Vaccines Strategy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en\">Safe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_48\">Questions and Answers on vaccine negotiations</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2390\">Questions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">EU Coronavirus Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/overview-commissions-response_en\">Overview of the Commission's Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2363\">Factsheet: How vaccines work</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2364\">Factsheet: Health benefits of vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2245\">Factsheet: Authorisation process</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2365\">Factsheet: Long-term safety</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2244\">Factsheet: EU's current portfolio</a></p></div>",

In a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-united-front-beat-covid-19_en\">Communication</a> adopted today, it calls on Member States to accelerate the roll-out of vaccination across the EU: by March 2021, at least 80% of people over the age of 80, and 80% of health and social care professionals in every Member State should be vaccinated. And by summer 2021, Member States should have vaccinated a minimum of 70% of the adult population.</p>\n<p>The Commission also calls on Member States to continue to apply physical distancing, limit social contacts, fight disinformation, coordinate travel restrictions, ramp up testing, and increase contact tracing and genome sequencing to face up to the risk from new variants of the virus. As recent weeks have seen an upward trend in case numbers, more needs to be done to support healthcare systems and to address \u201cCOVID-fatigue\u201d in the coming months, from accelerating vaccination across the board, helping our partners in the Western Balkans, the Southern and Eastern neighbourhood and in Africa.</p>\n<p>Today's Communication sets out key actions for Member States, the Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which will help reduce risks and keep the virus under control:</p>\n<p><strong>Speeding up the roll-out of vaccination across the EU </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>By <strong>March</strong> <strong>2021</strong>, at least <strong>80%</strong> of people <strong>over the age of 80</strong>, and <strong>80%</strong> of <strong>health and social care professionals</strong> in every Member State, should be <strong>vaccinated</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>By summer 2021</strong>, Member States should have <strong>vaccinated 70% of the entire adult population</strong>.</li>\n<li>The Commission, Member States and the EMA will work with companies to use the EU's potential for<strong> increased vaccine manufacturing capacity </strong>to the fullest.</li>\n<li>The Commission is working with Member States on <strong>vaccination certificates, in full compliance with EU data protection law, </strong>which can support the continuity of care. A common approach is to be agreed <strong>by the end of January 2021</strong> to allow Member States' <strong>certificates</strong> to be rapidly useable in health systems across the EU and beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Testing and genome sequencing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Member States should <strong>update their testing strategies </strong>to account for<strong> new variants</strong> and expand the use of<strong> rapid antigen tests</strong>.</li>\n<li>Member States should urgently <strong>increase genome sequencing to at least 5% and preferably 10% of positive test results</strong>. At present, many Member States are testing under 1% of samples, which is not enough to identify the progression of the variants or detect any new ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Preserving the Single Market and free movement while stepping up mitigation measures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Measures should be applied to further <strong>reduce the risk of transmission</strong> linked to the means of travel, such as <strong>hygiene and distancing measures</strong> in vehicles and terminuses.</li>\n<li>All <strong>non-essential travel should be strongly discouraged</strong> until the epidemiological situation has considerably improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Proportionate travel restrictions, including testing of travellers, should be maintained</strong> for those travelling from areas with a higher incidence of variants of concern.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ensuring European leadership and international solidarity</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure early access to vaccines, the Commission is to set up a <strong>Team Europe mechanism to structure the provision of vaccines shared </strong>by Member States with partner countries. This should allow for sharing with partner countries access to some of the 2.3 billion doses secured through the EU's Vaccines Strategy, paying special attention to the Western Balkans, our Eastern and Southern neighbourhood and Africa.</li>\n<li>The European Commission and Member States should continue supporting <strong>COVAX, </strong>including through early access to vaccines. Team Europe has already mobilised \u20ac853 million <strong>in support of COVAX</strong>, making the EU one of COVAX's biggest donors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Members of the College said:</strong></p>\n<p>President of the European Commission, Ursula <strong>von der Leyen</strong>, said: <em>\u201c</em><em>Vaccination is </em><em>essential to get out of this crisis. We have already secured enough vaccines for the entire population of the European Union. Now we need to accelerate the delivery and speed up vaccination. Our aim is to have 70% of our adult population vaccinated by summer. That could be a turning point in our fight against this virus. However, we will only end this pandemic when everyone in the world has access to vaccines. We will step up our efforts to help secure vaccines for our neighbours and partners worldwide</em><em>.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Vice-President Margaritis <strong>Schinas</strong>, responsible for Promoting our European Way of Life, said: <em>\u201cThe emergence of new variants of the virus and substantial rises in cases leave us no room for complacency.\u00a0Now more than ever must come a renewed determination for Europe to act together with unity, coordination and vigilance. Our proposals today aim to protect more lives and livelihoods later and relieve the burden on already stretched health care systems and workers. This is how the EU will come out of the crisis. The end of the pandemic is in sight though not yet in reach.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Stella<strong> Kyriakides</strong>, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said<em>: \u201c</em><em>Working together with unity, solidary and determination, we can soon start to see the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Now in particular, we need swift and coordinated action against the new variants of the virus. Vaccinations will still take time until they reach all Europeans and until then we must take immediate, coordinated and proactive steps together.

Protecting the health of our citizens remains our utmost priority, and we must put in place the necessary measures to ensure we achieve this. This transparency and authorisation mechanism is temporary, and we will of course continue to uphold our commitments towards low and middle income countries.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Executive Vice-President and Commissioner for Trade Valdis <strong>Dombrovskis</strong> said: <em>\u201cThis time-limited and targeted system covers only those COVID-19 vaccines that were agreed by Advanced Purchase Agreements with the EU. The aim is to provide greater clarity on vaccine production in the EU and their exports \u2013 this transparency has been lacking and is vital at this time. This mechanism includes a wide range of exemptions to fully honour our humanitarian aid commitments and protect vaccines deliveries to our neighbourhood, and to countries in need covered by the COVAX-facility.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella <strong>Kyriakides</strong> said: <em>\u201cFor the best part of the last year we worked hard to get Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers to bring vaccines to the citizens, in Europe and beyond. We gave upfront funding to companies to build the necessary manufacturing capacity to produce vaccines, so deliveries can start as soon as they are authorised. We now need transparency on where the vaccines we secured are going and ensure that they reach our citizens. We are accountable towards the European citizens and taxpayers \u2013 that is a key principle for us.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The Commission has invested large amounts in the development of the production capacity of vaccine developers in the EU. This with the aim to ensure quicker delivery of vaccines to the European citizens, support planning and vaccination strategies with the ultimate goal to protect public health. It is therefore reasonable for the EU to monitor how the funds disbursed under the Advance Purchase Agreements (APA) have been used, especially in a context of potential shortages of essential COVID-19 vaccines. The main purpose is to offer public transparency to the European citizens. The transparency and authorisation system will require companies to notify the Member State authorities about the intention to export vaccines produced in the European Union.</p>\n<p><strong>The export authorisation scheme</strong></p>\n<p>This implementing act, adopted by urgency procedure and published today, provides for authorisations of exports outside the EU of COVID-19 vaccines until the end of March 2021. This scheme only applies to exports from companies with whom the EU has concluded Advance Purchased Agreements.</p>\n<p>Based on the previous experience with a similar measure on personal protective equipment in Spring 2020, the Commission will assist Member States in setting up the relevant mechanism to ensure a smooth and coordinated implementation of the regulation.</p>\n<p>This measure is targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary. It is fully consistent with the EU's international commitment under the World Trade Organization and the G20, and in line with what the EU has proposed in the context of the WTO trade and health initiative. Committed to international solidarity, the EU excluded from this scheme vaccine supplies for humanitarian aid or destined to countries under the COVAX facility, as well as our neighbourhood.</p>\n<p><strong>About the EU's vaccine strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en\">European strategy</a> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of <strong>Advance Purchase Agreements (APA)</strong>. Funding provided is considered as a down-payment on the vaccines that will actually be purchased by Member States. The APA is therefore a de-risk investment upfront <span style=\"background: white;\">against a binding commitment from the company to pre-produce, even before it gets\u00a0marketing authorisation.</span> This should allow for a quick and steady delivery as soon as the authorisation has been granted.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R0111\">Commission Implementing Regulation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_308\">Questions and Answers</a></p></div>",

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. People vaccinated will receive two injections of the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-recommends-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-authorisation-eu\">EMA</a>, most of the participants in the studies were between 18 and 55 years old. There are not yet enough results in older participants (over 55 years old) to provide a figure for how well the vaccine will work in this group. However, protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines; as there is reliable information on safety in this population, EMA's scientific experts considered that the vaccine can be used in older adults. More information is expected from ongoing studies, which include a higher proportion of elderly participants.</p>\n<p>On the basis of EMA's positive opinion, the Commission has verified all the elements supporting the marketing authorisation and consulted Member States before granting the conditional marketing authorisation.</p>\n<p>The AstraZeneca vaccine is based on an adenovirus, a harmless virus which delivers the \u2018instructions' from the virus that causes COVID-19.This allows the body's own cells to make the protein unique to the COVID-19 virus. The person's immune system recognises that this unique protein should not be in the body and responds by producing natural defences against infection by COVID-19.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1524\">contract</a> signed with the European Commission on 27 August 2020, AstraZeneca will deliver the total amount of 400 million doses throughout 2021. These will add to the 600 million doses of the vaccine by BioNTech-Pfizer and the 160 million doses of the vaccine by Moderna.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>A conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) is an authorisation of medicines on the basis of less complete data required for a normal marketing authorisation. Such a CMA may be considered if the benefit of a medicine's immediate availability to patients clearly outweighs the risk linked to the fact that not all the data are yet available. However it also ensures that this COVID-19 vaccine meets the EU standards, as for all other vaccines and medicines.</p>\n<p>Once a CMA has been granted, companies must provide within certain deadlines further data including from ongoing or new studies to confirm that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. CMAs are foreseen in the EU legislation specifically for public health emergencies and is considered the most appropriate regulatory mechanism in this pandemic for granting access to all EU citizens and for underpinning mass vaccination campaigns.</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca submitted an application for a CMA for their vaccine to EMA on 11 January 2021. However, assessment already started beforehand. EMA had started <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-first-rolling-review-covid-19-vaccine-eu\">assessing non-clinical data</a> from laboratory studies in October 2020 and updated its <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/update-rolling-review-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine\">rolling review</a> end of December 2020 on the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and quality. This rolling review and the assessment of the CMA application allowed EMA to quickly conclude on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine. EMA recommended granting the conditional marketing authorisation as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.</p>\n<p>The European Commission has verified whether all necessary elements \u2013 scientific justifications, product information, educational material to healthcare professionals, labelling, obligations to marketing authorisation holders, conditions for use, etc. - were clear and sound. The Commission also consulted the Member States, as they are responsible for the vaccines marketing and the use of the product in their countries. Following the Member States' endorsement and on the basis of its own analysis, the Commission decided to grant the conditional marketing authorisation.</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en\">Safe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1597339415327&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0245\">EU Vaccines Strategy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2390\">Questions and Answers: Conditional marketing authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans_en\">Safe COVID-19 vaccines for Europeans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response_en\">EU Coronavirus Response</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/human-use_en\">EU's legislation on medicinal products</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en\">EMA and COVID-19 vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2363\">Factsheet: How vaccines work</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2364\">Factsheet: Health benefits of vaccines</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2245\">Factsheet: Authorisation process</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2365\">Factsheet: Long-term safety</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_2244\">EU's current portfolio</a></p></div>",

And we need to act in a coordinated manner.</em> <em>This new Temporary Framework enables Member States </em><em>to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy at this difficult time</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, based on Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, recognises that the entire EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. To remedy that, the Temporary Framework provides for five types of aid:</p>\n<p>(i)\u00a0 <strong>Direct grants, selective tax advantages and advance payments</strong>: Member States will be able to set up schemes to grant up to \u20ac800,000 to a company to address its urgent liquidity needs.</p>\n<p>(ii)\u00a0 <strong>State guarantees for loans taken by companies from banks</strong>: Member States will be able to provide State guarantees to ensure banks keep providing loans to the customers who need them.</p>\n<p>(iii) <strong>Subsidised public loans to companies</strong>: Member States will be able to grant loans with favourable interest rates to companies. These loans can help businesses cover immediate working capital and investment needs.</p>\n<p>(iv)<strong> Safeguards for banks that channel State aid to the real economy</strong>: Some Member States plan to build on banks' existing lending capacities, and use them as a channel for support to businesses \u2013 in particular to small and medium-sized companies. The Framework makes clear that such aid is considered as direct aid to the banks' customers, not to the banks themselves, and gives guidance on how to ensure minimal distortion of competition between banks.</p>\n<p>(v) <strong>Short-term export credit insurance</strong>: The Framework introduces additional flexibility on how to demonstrate that certain countries are not-marketable risks, thereby enabling short-term export credit insurance to be provided by the State where needed.</p>\n<p>Given the limited size of the EU budget, the main response will come from Member States' national budgets. The Temporary Framework will help target support to the economy, while limiting negative consequences to the level playing field in the Single Market.</p>\n<p>The Temporary Framework therefore includes a number of safeguards. For example, It links the subsidised loans or guarantees to businesses to the scale of their economic activity, by reference to their wage bill, turnover, or liquidity needs, and to the use of the public support for working or investment capital. The aid should therefore help businesses to weather the downturn and to prepare a sustainable recovery.</p>\n<p>The Temporary Framework complements the many other possibilities already available to Member States to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, in line with EU State aid rules. On 13 March 2020, the Commission adopted a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_459\">Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak</a> setting out these possibilities. For example, Member States can make generally applicable changes in favour of businesses (e.g. deferring taxes, or subsidising short-time work across all sectors), which fall outside State Aid rules. They can also grant compensation to companies for damage suffered due to and directly caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. This can be useful to support particularly impacted sectors, such as transport, tourism, hospitality and retail.</p>\n<p>The Framework will be in place until the end of December 2020. With a view to ensuring legal certainty, the Commission will assess before that date if it needs to be extended.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>State aid rules enable Member States to take swift and effective action to support citizens and companies, in particular SMEs, facing economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>\n<p>The Temporary Framework adopted today complements the ample possibilities for Member States to design measures in line with existing EU State aid rules, as set out in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_459\">Communication on a Coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak</a> of 13 March 2020. In particular, they can adopt measures that fall outside the scope of State aid control, such as national funds granted to health services or other public services to tackle the Covid-19. Member States can also immediately act through public support measures that are available to all companies such as wage subsidies, suspension of payments of corporate and value added taxes or social contributions. In addition, Member States can grant financial support directly to consumers, for example for cancelled services or tickets that are not reimbursed by the operators concerned.</p>\n<p>In addition, EU State aid rules enable Member States to help companies cope with liquidity shortages and needing urgent rescue aid. Article 107(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enables Member States to compensate companies for the damage directly caused by exceptional occurrences, such as those caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, including measures in sectors such as aviation and tourism.</p>\n<p>The Commission had adopted a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/temp_framework_en.pdf\">Temporary Framework in 2008</a>, in response to the global financial crisis.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/what_is_new/sa_covid19_temporary-framework.pdf\">Communication from the Commission - Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>#coronavirus</p></div>",
