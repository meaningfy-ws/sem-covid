Europe\u2019s industry, economy and \nsociety are changing at the speed of light. This \ncreates not only an urgent challenge beyond \nthe means of individual Member States, \nbut also provides a unique opportunity to \ntransform the EU into a fair and prosperous \nsociety, with a modern, resource-efficient and \ncompetitive economy that works for people.\n\nIn order to live up to European citizens\u2019 \nexpectations, we also need to anticipate, react \nquickly and effectively to unexpected events of \nglobal magnitude, as it is now the case of the \nCovid19 pandemic. Europe is demonstrating \nclearly that science, research, innovation and education are fundamental, not only to tackle the \npandemic and protect citizens, but also to exit the crisis as strong as before, and to be prepared \nfor similar situation in the future. Protecting citizens and delivering solutions that meet their \nneeds is vital, and is the European Commission priority.\n\nResearch, innovation and education are also key drivers for Europe\u2019s sustainable and inclusive \nrecovery, boosting the resilience of our production sectors, the competitiveness of our economies \nand the transformation of our socio-economic systems. It goes without saying that in times of \nlooming economic and social activity, strong investments in research, innovation and education \nremain indispensable. Within the EU's long-term budget, the new framework programme for \nresearch and innovation, Horizon Europe, is called upon to play a very strong role in support of the \nEU\u2019s competitive sustainability. The time has come to boldly turn Europe\u2019s frontier research and \ncutting-edge technology into solutions addressing societal challenges. Working together will make \nus worldwide innovation leaders and frontrunners in sustainability.\n\n\n\n3\n\nI am proud to present this edition of our \u201cSRIP 2020\u201d flagship report, which includes contributions \nfrom leading scholars and international organisations. This European Commission report \ninvestigates relevant global trends and provides an in-depth analysis of Europe\u2019s performance in \nscience, research and innovation over the past years. In addition, the SRIP 2020 offers extensive \nevidence and \u201cdeep dives\u201d into emerging trends. It also captures the very complex reality in which \nresearch and innovation are operating nowadays, and their interaction with other crucial policies \nsuch as education and skills.\n\nMariya Gabriel,  \nEuropean Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth\n\n\n\n4\n\nSRIP Co-creation\n\nThe authors of this report gratefully acknowledge the policy steering by the Director-General for \nResearch & Innovation (R&I), Jean-Eric Paquet, and the Director \u201cPolicy and Programming Centre\u201d \nin the Directorate-General for R&I, Julien Guerrier.

Doughnut visualisation based on Kate Raworth's work on the Doughnut Economics.\n\nResearch and innovation (R&I) are key for \nthe future we want. They enable and drive \nthe transition to a green and sustainable Europe \ntomorrow. They help us to better understand our \nworld and provide solutions for the challenges \nahead. While the COVID-19 pandemic (Box 0-1) \nhas recently been disrupting our society, Europe \nhas been facing global forces in the longer term \n\n1 Global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on \nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services (2019).\n\nand our planet has reached a tipping point.. \nClimate change poses an existential threat: one \nof the 8 million species on earth is at risk of \nbeing lost1, and forests and oceans are being \npolluted and destroyed. At the same time, no \none should fall short on life\u2019s essentials, such \nas food, housing, health and education. In this \ncontext, R&I helps us to build a safe and just \n\nTowards social, environmental\nand economic sustainability\n\nPLA\nNETAR\n\nY BOUNDARIES\n\n S\n\nAF\nE A\n\nND \nJUST SPACE FOR HUMANITYSO\nCIAL \n\nFOUNDATIONS\n\nShortfall Overshoot\n\nCompetitive sustainability Sustainablecompetitiveness\n\nResearch and Innovation\n\nCo-creation Transformation Uptake\n\nDirectionalityDiffusion\n\n\n\n11\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 0\n\nspace for humanity, which avoids the overshoot \nof our planetary boundaries and preserves \nour social foundations. At the same time, the \ndigital transformation of our economy and \nsociety, empowered by artificial intelligence \n(AI), blockchain and quantum computing, is \nrevolutionising the way we live, work and \ninnovate at an unprecedented speed. \n\nHence, Europe must address the twin \nchallenge of the green and digital transitions \nto become a modern, resource- efficient and \ncompetitive economy. This means that our \nR&I policy will need to adapt to ensure that R&I \ncontributes to an ample concept of sustainability \u2013 \nsocial, environmental and economic \u2013 while driving \nEU competitiveness. Europe's competitiveness \nshould build on a framework of institutions, \npolicies and factors that ensure sustainability \nin the long term (sustainable competitiveness), \nand sustainability should become a key driver of \nEurope's competitiveness and growth (competitive \n\nsustainability). To achieve this, EU R&I policy \nshould be guided by the following principles (see \nalso Chapter 1):\n\n\u00dd\u00dd co-creation, working and acting together \nfor a better society;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd diffusion, sharing knowledge across soci-\nety, territories and people;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd uptake, turning research into sustainable \nsolutions with social and economic value;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd transformation, changing the way we \nconsume and produce; and\n\n\u00dd\u00dd directionality, with R&I leading the way.\n\nThe evidence presented in this report leads to \n11 policy headlines to support our people, \nplanet and prosperity. These include, but are \nnot limited to, messages for EU R&I policy:\n\nR&I FOR A SAFE AND JUST SPACE FOR HUMANITY\n#1. As an overarching policy message: the European Green Deal requires a shift \n\ntowards a transformative innovation policy.\n\n#2. Making sure that growth does not leave anyone behind \u2026 people, regions, \ncountries and firms.\n\n#3. Equipping Europeans with the skills to navigate the changing world.\n\n#4.

Anticipating the future world through better evidence for policy.\n\n\n\n12\n\nBOX 0-1 COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 crisis is unprecedented and \nthe world has been struggling to contain the \npandemic. It has disrupted our lives, economy \nand society and stopped almost all economies \nworldwide from fully functioning. This crisis has \ndemonstrated how our intimately connected \nworld has contributed to a global pandemic \ncausing widespread sickness and casualties and \ndisrupting people\u2019s personal and professional \nlives and economies on a global scale. The crisis \nshows how our citizens\u2019 health and well-being, \nour economy and our society in general are \nclosely interlinked. \n\nThe situation demonstrates more than ever \nhow an anticipative, rapid and effective R&I \nresponse is crucial. R&I is an essential part of \nthe coordinated EU response to the threat to \npublic health from COVID-19. EU actions for \nR&I are focusing on: \n\n \u00dd funding and financing R&I in virology, \nvaccine development, treatments and \ndiagnostics, and wider social and economic \nimpacts; \n\n \u00dd speeding up research by optimising \nframework conditions such as research \ninfrastructures, platforms to share \ninformation, and taking ethical issues into \naccount; \n\n \u00dd translating research findings into public \nhealth policy to mitigate the impacts and \nimprove crisis preparedness; \n\n \u00dd internal and external coordination; and \n\n \u00dd citizen outreach and communication. \n\nIn global emergencies, such as this pandemic, \nit is essential to remove all obstacles to the \nfree flow of data, researchers and ideas. AI \nand other digital technologies can also help to \ntrack the spread of the virus and speed up the \nprocess of diagnosis, detection and monitoring. \n\nMoreover, while R&I is at the core of the \nresponse to the pandemic itself, it will also be \ncrucial in the economic recovery from the crisis, \nnot only to spur economic activity, but also \nto accelerate the transitions our planet and \nsociety need \u2013 a new economy for health and \nwell-being in a broad sense (physical, mental, \nskills, social, environmental and economic \naspects). \n\nHence, R&I can directly contribute to a recovery \nthat delivers on the European Green Deal. \nEurope should strive to make its economic \nrecovery truly transformative by investing \nmassively in science-driven and innovative \nsolutions that accelerate the transitions both \nour planet and society need. R&I will thus be \nfundamental to underpinning the shift towards \na circular and low-carbon economy and \nsecuring a path to net-zero emissions by 2050. \n\nR&I can also help to build system-wide \nresilience. Technologies are already helping \nto alleviate, at least partially, the severity \nof the current economic shock, with digital \ntechnologies at the core of business continuity \nin several sectors. It is of paramount import-\nance to invest in making our society and \neconomy stronger, more resilient and capable \nof a rapid and integrated response by drawing \non the latest scientific discoveries and ensuring \nequal access to healthcare across the EU.\n\n\n\n13\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 0\n\nFigure 0-1 R&I and economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis \n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation\n\nse\nve\n\nri\nty\n\n?\n\nduration?\n\nrecovery\n\neffective response \n\ncontraction\n\nslow and delayed recovery \n\nGDP \ngrowth\n\nTime\u2022 R&I stimulus as key \nresponse to Covid-19 \npandemic\n\n\u2022 R&I slowdown with \neconomic contraction \nand R&I reallocation\n\n\u2022 R&I to alleviate the \nseverity of the shock\n\n\u2022 R&I for accelerated\neconomic recovery and\nEU competitiveness\n\n\u2022 R&I for transformation\nof our economy and society\n\n\u2022 R&I for system\nresilience\n\n\n\n14\n\nR&I FOR A SAFE AND JUST SPACE FOR HUMANITY\n\n2 These can include science-driven and deep-tech innovations as well as social innovations and non-research-based inno-\nvations\n\nOur climate and environment, economy \nand society are experiencing profound \nchanges that will fundamentally alter \nour current way of life. R&I activities, and \nR&I policy, are taking place in a context where \nglobal and long-term forces are influencing \nour needs, including climate change, loss of \nbiodiversity, an ageing population, and growing \ninequalities. Against this backdrop, the way we \nboth produce and consume is not sustainable: \ncurrently, no country in the world seems able \nto meet its citizens\u2019 basic needs at a globally \nsustainable level of resource use.\n\nR&I contributes to address these \nchallenges and is key to delivering on the \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \nR&I can provide solutions2 to overcome the \nchallenges we face, enable us to better \nunderstand our world and make our society \nmore resilient in the long term. In the context \nof accelerating digitalisation, R&I solutions are \nalso needed to mitigate the environmental \nfootprint of ICT and AI, improving, for example, \nthe energy efficiency of data centres and \nhigh-performance computers, and telecom-\nmunications infrastructure. The EU is already \nperforming strongly in several areas, leading \ntechnological progress in the fields of energy, \nclimate, environment, food and the bioeconomy. \n\nIt is crucial that the EU maintains and reinforces \nleadership in key areas to successfully deliver \non the SDGs.\n\nThe interconnection between social, \neconomic and environmental issues calls \nfor a profound transformation of our \nsystems, in particular agro-food, energy and \ntransport. This sustainability transformation is \nan unprecedented governance challenge at all \nlevels, from local to global.

A transformative innovation \npolicy can become a compass to help the \nEU to navigate the complexities of our world \nand co-create a common direction, as a key \nenabler of the European process for SDG \npolicy coordination. However, this is not an \neasy task: a transformative innovation policy \ninvolves several policy challenges, such as \nsynergies between policies, co-creation, \n\ninvolving a wider set of actors, and ensuring \nthe dissemination of radical innovation across \nthe market and society. Horizon Europe, the \nEU\u2019s R&I Framework Programme for 2021-\n2027, is a key part of EU transformative policy. \nIt will continue to create new knowledge and \nsolutions to achieve the SDGs and will provide \nincreased directionality through its mission-\noriented approach (on, for example, climate \nchange, healthy oceans, climate-neutral and \nsmart cities, and soil health and food) and \nEuropean partnerships. \n\nBOX 0-2 Instruments for an EU R&I policy\n\nActions to deliver on EU R&I policy can be \nregrouped under three main categories \u2013 \ninvestment, regulation and reforms \u2013 in \ncombination with a co-creation approach \nacross the entire Commission agenda \nand joining up capacity with and across \nthe Member States through the European \nResearch Area (see Box 0-3). \n\nInvestment \n\nSeveral EU initiatives aim to step up \ninvestment in R&I capacity. Among them, the \nEU\u2019s R&I Framework Programmes are its main \ninstruments for investing in R&I and directing \ninvestment towards EU political priorities. \n\nHorizon Europe, covering the period 2021-\n2027, will be the EU\u2019s largest ever R&I \nFramework Programme, and will present \ndifferent novelties compared to its predecessor, \nHorizon 2020, which has covered the period \n2014-2020. \n\n \u00dd EU-wide missions are an important new \nfeature of Horizon Europe. They will focus on \na handful of ambitious but time-bound and \nachievable high-visibility goals. They are \nan R&I tool but offer the scope to support \n\nmuch broader aims to deliver European \npublic goods on issues that really matter, \nsuch as fighting cancer, preserving our \ncitizens\u2019 health from all kinds of pollution, \nensuring food security and restoring land, \nand protecting our seas and oceans. \n\n \u00dd The European Innovation Council (EIC) is \nanother major novelty in Horizon Europe. It \naims to put Europe on top of the next wave \nof breakthrough, market-creating innovation \nat the intersection of digital/AI and deep tech. \nIt will be the one-stop shop for innovation, \ndelivering on EU objectives to enable more \ninnovators to bring breakthrough technologies \nto market and making it easier for small \nbusinesses to become large innovators. \n\n \u00dd The next generation of R&I European \npartnerships also aims to respond to \nthe needs of all EU Member States and \nstakeholders (citizens, industry including \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \nand civil society) in line with agreed EU \nstrategic priorities. \n\n\n\n16\n\nSmart specialisation strategies under the EU \nStructural Funds are another key initiative to \nsupport R&I. During 2014-2020, the European \nRegional Development Fund has contributed \nmore than EUR 40 billion to the development of \nR&I strategies by Member States and regions \na Europe. \n\nIn the coming years, the Commission will aim \nto ensure access to affordable finance and \nmobilise private funds for R&I through different \ninstruments, such as a dedicated window under \nthe InvestEU Fund that relies on financial \ninstruments and budgetary guarantees. The \nEuropean Investment Fund also provides \nrisk financing for SMEs and small mid-caps.\n\nRegulation \n\nThe impact of these investment instruments \nwill be greater if policy and regulation \nactively stimulate innovation. By applying \nthis innovation principle, the Commission \ncan help ensure that innovative activities by \nEuropean entrepreneurs, researchers, business \nand civil society are aligned with the broader \nsocial, environmental and economic objectives \nand that innovation realises these objectives \nbetter and more quickly. The acceleration of \ntechnological development also calls for less \ntraditional approaches to regulation and policy, \nsuch as regulatory sandboxes and policy \nexperimentation (see also message #10).\n\nReforms \n\nMost of the public budget and policies for R&I \nare in the hands of the Member States. This \nis why there is a need to encourage national \npolicy reforms. A European Semester \nintegrating the SDGs supports Member States \nin making effective reforms of their national \nand regional policies and systems. Notably, this \ninvolves linking up the necessary reforms with \nan appropriate synergy of investments from \nthe relevant programmes in the Multiannual \nFinancial Framework (e.g. European Structural \nand Investment Funds (ESIF), European Social \nFund (ESF), Horizon Europe). This will support \nthe alignment of efforts at the national \nand EU levels to address the ecological, \neconomic and social transitions. The European \nSemester is reflected and reinforced by the \nEuropean Research Area (see Box 0-3) and \ncomplemented by specific R&I assessment and \ngovernance. The Policy Support Facility (PSF) \nis an instrument to encourage Member States \nto improve their R&I policies. The Structural \nReform Support Service (SRSS) also helps \nEU countries to design and carry out structural \nreforms as part of their efforts to support job \ncreation and sustainable growth.\n\n\n\n17\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 0\n\nGiven the size of the challenges ahead, \nhaving an ambitious target for investing \nin R&I will be crucial.

National R&I investments \nthat are aligned with a common direction can \nsignificantly accelerate the transition towards \n\nan environmentally, socially and economically \nsustainable Europe. The European Research \nArea (see Box 0-3) can drive such an ambition \nand make a significant contribution to \naddressing our challenges by building critical \nmass across countries, leveraging the renewed \nEuropean Semester along the SDGs. \n\nBOX 0-3 The European Research Area\n\nThe European Research Area (ERA) provides \na framework to join up our national and \nEuropean R&I agendas, strengthen national, \nregional and local capabilities, bridge gaps \nin R&I performance, and achieve the critical \nmass needed to maintain our international \ncompetitiveness and tackle the major \nchallenges we face together.\n\nThe ERA is key for all dimensions that \nrelate to researchers in Europe, including \ntheir working conditions and mobility \n(see message #7).

Against this backdrop, \neducation and training will be key to refining and \namplifying research skills in Europe.

Competitiveness, productivity \nand innovation are separate although very \nclosely interrelated concepts. In the global \ncontext, it would be a mistake to ignore the fact \nthat innovation can drive EU competitiveness \nthrough productivity growth: spurring innovation \nacts directly on what is produced, making goods \nbetter and cheaper, as well as ensuring that what \nis used to produce is done efficiently. Productivity \ncan also help overcome the trade-off between \nenvironmental policy and long-term growth. \nIncreasing efficiency in the production process \ncan be compatible with producing in a sustainable \nway and supporting the sustainable transition. \nHowever, despite the rise in digital technologies \nin the past decade promising large productivity \ngains, productivity growth has been sluggish, \nholding back more robust economic growth in \nEurope and other advanced economies.\n\nEU technological sovereignty at risk has \nseveral implications which link R&I policy to \nindustrial policy. An EU industrial strategy, \nsupported by a vibrant ecosystem that allows \nfor the scaling up of its innovators and SMEs \n(see policy message #7), is key to countering the \ndeindustrialisation trends in the EU and increasing \nlong-term EU competitiveness while meeting the \nneeds of a transition towards a climate-neutral \nand sustainable economy. It is crucial that the \nindustry plays its part in achieving EU technological \nsovereignty by safeguarding essential elements \n\nof strategic value chains, including raw materials, \nassembly lines, machine tools and services. The \nEU\u2019s strategy for cooperation in R&I with third \ncountries should take into full consideration \nthe need to protect EU strategic interests. R&I \ncooperation also provides a common basis for \nengagement, developing trust and common \nagendas that can be blueprints for common \ngovernance of broader issues. In this context, \nscience diplomacy can be an effective instrument \nof soft power in support of EU external action. \nFurthermore, these international considerations \nshould be made in the light of European values \nand the European identity, including the choice of \na different social protection system compared, for \nexample, to the USA.\n\nAt the same time, the EU approach to \nR&I has long been one of openness to \nthe world to facilitate brain and knowledge \ncirculation, combined with strategically \ntargeted actions with key partner countries. \nThis multilateral approach is at the heart \nof EU efforts for international coordination \ntowards achieving the SDGs, and has served \nEU interests by establishing mutually \nbeneficial cooperation with international \npartner countries. This approach is becoming \nincreasingly necessary as more and more new \ncentres of excellence and markets develop \noutside Europe. Attracting talents to EU R&I is \nkey to sustaining EU excellence in R&I as other \ncountries, in particular China, are expanding \ntheir talent pools while the EU is facing negative \ndemographic developments. Moreover, in the \ncurrent R&D and geopolitical landscape, setting \nup a level playing field for fair competition and \ncooperation with third countries is lagging \nbehind in some cases, calling for the EU to \nredouble negotiating efforts while anticipating \nany risks to its interests. Against this backdrop, \nensuring multilateralism and purposeful \nopenness, while assertively negotiating \na global level playing field, should be \nat the heart of the EU\u2019s approach to \ninternational cooperation.\n\n\n\n23\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 0\n\nREAD MORE IN:\n\n \u00dd Chapter 3 Productivity, structural change and business dynamism\n\n \u00dd Chapter 5 Investment in intangible assets\n\n \u00dd Chapter 6 Scientific performance, knowledge flows and innovation output\n\n \u00dd Chapter 7 R&I enabling artificial intelligence\n\nDigitalisation is transforming R&I.

While top-performing \nEU Member States have very efficient products \nand labour markets, on average, the EU lags \nbehind the United States and Japan in these \naspects. Institutional quality is high in the core \nof the EU and in capitals, with a high degree \nof regional variation and heterogeneity within \nand across countries. Lower access to risk \ncapital remains a constraint to scaling up: in \nthe United States, eight times more venture \ncapital funds are raised for innovation than in \nthe EU. Slightly more than 1 in 10 enterprises \nin the EU are high-growth, but only a relatively \nsmall share are in high-tech, medium-high-\ntech manufacturing and high-tech knowledge-\nintensive services. Overall, the EU presents \n7 ecosystems in the world \u2018top 30\u2019 start-up \necosystems, compared to 12 in the United \nStates and only 3 in China. It also presents \na decline in business dynamism over time, \nwhich is observed in other regions in the world \nand may hamper productivity growth. \n\nEurope needs to better support the scaling \nup of its innovators and SMEs. When it \ncomes to tech scaleups and unicorn companies, \na pronounced scaling-up gap remains in relation \nto the United States and (sometimes to) China. \nEurope should capitalise on its strong science \nand richness of ideas for innovation to have \nkey players in the global scene that reflect \n\nEU\u2019s values and ambitions. This is compatible \nwith a \u2018tech-with-a-purpose\u2019 approach which \nintegrates social and environmental concerns in \nbusiness missions to ensure that new products \nand services bring not only economic but also \nsocietal value. Overall, there is a strong need for \npolicy initiatives that aim to tackle the scaling-\nup needs in terms of capital in EU startups, \nsuch as the European Innovation Council, \nthe VentureEU programme, and the different \nfinancial instruments available via the European \nInvestment Bank. \n\nThese results also call for policies that \ntackle the heterogeneity among Member \nStates by ensuring efficient framework \nconditions and institutional quality across \nregions and countries, in particular in the \nperipheral economies in the south and east. \nThere is a need to improve overall framework \nconditions for innovation, including access to \nfinance \u2013 risk capital and other alternative \nsources of financing \u2013 and the deepening of \nthe Single Market to ensure the scaling-\nup of \u2018made in EU\u2019 disruptive ideas, and their \npermanence in the EU, while maintaining \na global outreach. It also means building more \nresilient start-up ecosystems underpinned \nby a strategic vision that builds upon the \nEU\u2019s industrial strengths and tackles societal \nchallenges by providing solutions addressing, \nfor example, climate change (interlinked with \nthe European Green Deal).\n\n#8   Building a vibrant and resilient R&I ecosystem in the post-\nSiemens-Alstom era \n\n \u00dd 7 out of 30 top global start-up ecosystems are in the EU\n \u00dd 7 % of \u2018today\u2019s unicorns\u2019 are based in the EU\n \u00dd 8 times more venture capital funds are raised in the USA than in the EU\n \u00dd In 2018, the share of public sources in total venture capital funds was 22 %\n\n\n\n27\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 0\n\nR&I for economic and societal impact\n\nProducing excellent solutions is not \nenough. It is necessary to go beyond the \napproach of innovation output only and have \na more holistic approach to ensure robust \nexploitation of R&I results and, overall, \nknowledge valorisation. This refers to the \nprocess of creating value from knowledge and \nturning the results into sustainable solutions \nwith economic value and societal benefits. R&I \ncan only play a decisive role in shaping social, \nenvironmental and economic transitions if \nexcellent results are quickly made available \nand put to practical use on a large scale.\n\nEurope needs to make more of its R&I. Even \nthough the EU outperforms the United States \nin terms of scientific output and number of \nresearchers, it is surpassed in scientific quality, \ntechnological progress, share of high-tech \n\nsectors in the economy, and business-academia \nlinkages. Hence, Europe needs to address \nits deficiencies by promoting a culture of \nknowledge valorisation in European R&I policy, \nensuring that knowledge-based institutions \nknow how to manage their intellectual capital \nand improving the links between academia, \nindustry, citizens and policymakers.\n\nThis calls for a reinforced knowledge-\nvalorisation policy in Europe that relies on \na set of instruments acknowledging different \nknowledge-valorisation channels.

Regulation, \nwhen featuring adequate levels of stringency \nand appropriate timing, can steer innovation \ntowards addressing societal needs. At the same \ntime, regulation needs the flexibility to adapt \nto an industry and society that are evolving \nrapidly. It should strike a balance between \npredictability and flexibility, and should also \nguarantee fair competition without sanctioning \nfailure or risk-taking.\n\nThere is room to make regulation smarter \nin Europe, in particular for R&I. There are \nstrong differences between the EU Member \nStates in terms of perceived regulatory quality. \nHowever, compared to China, Europe appears to \nenjoy substantially more trust and confidence \nregarding its regulations and standards. This \nmeans that Europe should capitalise on its \nacquis while facing potentially unfair practices; \nthis calls for proper agility and flexibility in its \nregulatory framework.\n\nA fast-moving and increasingly complex \nenvironment poses new challenges for \nregulation design. The growing role of \ndigitalisation in various sectors of the economy \nmay not always be properly reflected in regulation, \nand the same applies to the increasingly data-\ndriven nature of innovation. In this context, \nexperimental approaches to regulation, including \nthe so-called \u2018regulatory sandboxes\u2019 and \npolicy experimentation can also be relevant. \n\nRegulation design can be a crucial lever \nfor stimulating R&I to deliver on policy \nobjectives. It goes beyond improving the \nenvironment for doing business and can \ncontribute to achieving sustainable growth \nand desirable social and environmental \nbenefits. Using horizon scanning and innovative \nregulatory approaches to harness future \ntechnological advances and steer them \ntowards delivering on European Commission \npriorities, the innovation principle can provide \nvaluable insights into other policies in the \nareas of climate, environment, health, food, \ncompetitiveness and industry.

Priorities and choices must be informed, \nand evidence from various sources, such as \nindicators, analyses, and policy evaluations, are \nessential to guide policymaking. However, when \nit comes to predicting or forecasting future \ndevelopments, the task is not a trivial one. \nAlthough the notion that the future is uncertain \nis hardly novel, it poses challenges for policies \nthat take a long time to set up and execute \nas they must rely on longer-term forecasts \nthat can have a poor track record. Debates on \nthe future of work illustrate the need for solid \nevidence in order to better anticipate upcoming \ndevelopments in the labour market. While \ntechnological transformation is not expected \nto be friction free, there is still little evidence, \nbeyond the perception of stakeholders, on the \nextent of massive disruption across sectors. \nIn this context, faster and more accurate \nforecasts that provide better quality can be \nmore desirable, for example, to identify the \nrequired future skills, but they imply policy \ndesign that allows for a faster response. \n\nHorizon scanning is key for a strategic \nR&I policy that anticipates the future \nworld. A good understanding of capacities \nand aspirations for future innovation is an \ninvaluable basis for reflection and debate on \nthe potential impacts of different investment \ndecisions and on the normative and strategic \nconsiderations that should guide such \ninvestment decisions. A scan of the horizon at \na specific point in time raises our awareness of \npotentially important areas of R&I and enables \na better-informed R&I strategy. It allows us to \nask ourselves whether or not we need to invest \nin all these areas and why, and by so doing, \nto better understand the opportunity cost of \nour choices. Foresight analyses and horizon \nscans should be systematic, continuous and \ncomprehensive, feeding into decision-making \nprocesses that are engaging and participative, \ninvolving broad sets of stakeholders and the \nconcerned publics, in a new EU R&I policy that \nwill successfully pave the way to a fair, green \nand digital Europe.\n\nREAD MORE IN:\n\n \u00dd Chapter 11 The consequences of AI-based technologies for jobs\n\n \u00dd Chapter 15 Scanning the innovation horizon and throughout the whole report\n\n#11   Anticipating the future world through better evidence \nfor policy\n\n\n\n\n\nPART \n\nI\n\n\n\nCHAPTER \n1\n\n\n\nCH\nA\n\nPTER 1\n\nMEGATRENDS AND \nSUSTAINABILITY\n\nKEY FIGURES\n\n100 % \nincrease in \n\ngreenhouse gas \nemissions since \n\n1980\n\n45 %  \nof global wealth \n\nowned by the \nrichest 1 %\n\n2x \nmore Europeans \n\naged 80+ by \n2100\n\n84 % \nof Horizon 2020 \n\ninvestments relate to \nat least one SDG\n\n0 \ncountries in the world \nmeet basic needs for \n\nits citizens at a globally \nsustainable level of \n\nresource use\n\n\n\n34\n\n What can we learn?  \n\n\u00dd\u00dd R&I activities, and R&I policy, take \nplace in a context where global and \nlong-term forces are influencing our \nneeds, including climate change, an ageing \npopulation, and growing inequalities.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Climate change is the most serious among \nthese trends.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd R&I is key for addressing SDGs, going \nbeyond GDP.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd More than 80 % of investments under \nHorizon 2020 can be directly related to \naddressing specific SDGs.\n\n What does it mean for policy?\n\n \u00dd SDGs require transformative change. \nEU R&I policy can set a direction to \ngenerate knowledge and solutions for this \ntransformation.\n\n \u00dd Transformative R&I policy can also be \na key enabler of the European process for \nSDG policy coordination.\n\n \u00dd Transformative innovation and sys-\ntemic transitions involve several new \npolicy challenges, such as horizontal policy \ncoordination, the diffusion of radical innov-\nations and providing directionality.\n\n\n\n35\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 1\n\n1.

These \nforces, or megatrends1, are shaping our world \nand will drastically influence our future (Figure \n1-1). While the COVID-19 pandemic has been \ndisrupting our society in recent months, the \nEU has been facing global forces in the longer \nterm that are influencing our needs, including \nclimate change, loss of biodiversity, an ageing \npopulation, and growing inequalities. It is crucial \nthat we understand what these forces mean \nfor R&I: how they affect R&I, but also how R&I \ncan contribute to addressing the challenges \nthey entail, by providing solutions for them, by \nenabling a better understanding of them, and \nby making our society more resilient in the long \nterm (Ricci et al., 2017).\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis is unprecedented \nand the world is struggling to contain \nthe pandemic. It has disrupted our lives, \neconomy and society and stopped almost all \neconomies worldwide from fully functioning. \nWhile R&I is at the core of the response \nto the pandemic itself in the areas of \nvirology, vaccine development, treatments and \ndiagnostics, it will be also crucial in the \neconomic recovery from the crisis, not only \nto spur economic activity, but also to accelerate \nthe transitions that our planet and society need \n- a new economy for health and well-being in \na broad sense (physical, mental, skills, social, \nenvironmental and economic aspects).\n\nFigure 1-1 Megatrends in the EC Megatrends Hub\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Commission\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-1.xlsx\n\nMEGATRENDS\nDiversifying \ninequalities\n\nClimate change \nand environmental \n\ndegradation\n\nDiversification of \neducation and learning\n\nDiversifying Increasing \nsignificance of migration\n\nChanging nature \nof work\n\nGrowing\nconsumerism\n\nAggraving resource \nscarcity Continuing urbanisation\n\nIncreasing demographic \nimbalances\n\nChanging security \nparadigm\n\nShi\ufffding health \nchallenges\n\nExpanding influence \nof east and south\n\nIncreasing influence of \nnew governing systems\n\nAccelerating \ntechnological change and \n\nhyperconnectivity\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-1.xlsx\n\n\n36\n\nClimate change poses an existential threat\n\nAmong these megatrends, climate change \nposes an existential threat and requires \nenhanced ambition and greater climate \naction by the EU and at the global level2. \nThe scientific case for climate action has become \nincreasingly overwhelming and shows that \na business-as-usual scenario, with continued \npollution and greenhouse gas emissions3, largely \ndriven by economic and population growth, will \nlead to a further increase in global warming, \nocean acidification, desertification and changing \nclimate patterns (Figure 1-2).

It has been shown that \nunfavourable local conditions such as, for \n\nexample, regional unemployment (linked \nto industrial decline) and their perception \nhave repercussions regarding trust towards \nthe political institutions or can drive anti-\nsystem and populist voting in Europe \n(Dijkstra et al., 2018).\n\nIncreased inequality as well as underper-\nforming productivity and growth dynam-\nics are becoming the main challenges for \nEurope\u2019s social political agenda. Overall, \ncompared to other countries, Europe is a more \nequal place to live. This situation is largely \ndriven by Europe\u2019s distribution of incomes and \nresources. Nevertheless, the commonly used \nGini coefficient as a measure of inequality \nof income shows that EU income inequality \nhas increased during the last two decades \n(Figure 1-7)12. Greater inequalities challenge \nthe balance between distributional tensions \nand preferences for equity, in particular within \ncountries and for population groups of a certain \nage or place of residence (OECD, 2019a; World \nBank, 2019). Gender inequalities also remain \nin Europe, with an average EU gender pay gap \nof 16 % and extremely slow progress over time \n(European Commission, 2019a and 2019b).\n\n11 Recent figures suggest that the 45 % of global wealth is owned by the richest 1 % (Credit Suisse Research Institute, 2019).\n12 The Gini Index for market income (before taxes and social transfers) in the EU rose from 46 in 1995 to 48.4 in 2016, \n\nbeing larger than Japan (42 in 2015) and Korea (34 in 2016) but lower than the United States (50.8 in 2016).\n\nThese evolutions challenge the view \nthat high competitiveness and strong \ninvestments in R&I automatically lead to \nmore equality, driven by higher growth and \nmore jobs. There is growing awareness that \ncompetitiveness and inclusiveness must go hand \nin hand. Recent evidence suggests that overly \nhigh levels of inequality are not economically, \nsocially or politically sustainable (Iammarino \net al., 2018; IMF, 2019; OECD, 2019b). If there \nis no diffusion of innovation, there is a risk \nthat the benefits of innovation will be limited \nto skilled individuals, areas or companies \nwith strong R&I assets. Evidence focusing on \ntop income inequality and its interplay with \ninnovation shows that technological change \nis associated with a higher share of income \nfor the entrepreneur, at the expense of \nworkers\u2019 compesation hence increasing the top \ninequalities (Aghion et al., 2016). \n\n\n\n42\n\nThe rapid changes in global value chain \nconfigurations enabled by the application \nof new technologies have important \nimplications for the new models of work \norganisation and workplace management. \nSo far, most of the debate has focused on the \nphenomena of skill-biased technological \nchange, whereby greater automation and \ndigitalisation could enable the displacement \nof low-skilled jobs while increasing the \ndemand for high-skilled jobs (software and \ndata experts, engineering, etc.). These shifts \nin production technology that favour skilled \nlabour over unskilled labour have provoked \ndiscussions on the effects of technological \nchange on labour market and wage inequalities \n(Acemoglu and Autor, 2011; Okazawa 2013). \nRoutine-biased technological change rep-\n\nresents a more recent approach predicting \nthat automation and digitalisation will lead to \na decline in jobs that are rich in the routine \ncomponent while increasing jobs that entail \nfewer routine tasks. This adjusted approach \ncaptures well the latest changes in the \nemployment distribution with a declining \nshare of middle-skilled occupations relative \nto high- and low-wage occupations, defined as \n\u2018job polarisation\u2019 (Sebastian and Biagi, 2018). \nIn this context, skills will largely determine \nEurope's competitiveness and capacity to \ndrive innovation. Chapter 5.2 \u2018Investment in \neducation, human capital and skills\u2019 elaborates \non the skills required in future labour markets, \nwhile Chapter 4.1 \u2018Innovation, the future of \nwork and inequality\u2019 explains in more detail \nthe impacts on labour markets. \n\nFigure 1-7 EU(1) - Gini index of inequality \u2013 market income and disposable income \n(1995 = 100), 1995-2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat\nNote: (1)EU is the weighted average of the values for the 27 EU Member States.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-7.xlsx\n\nMarket incomeDisposable income\n\n98\n\n100\n\n102\n\n104\n\n106\n\n108\n\n19\n95\n\n19\n96\n\n19\n97\n\n19\n98\n\n19\n99\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n01\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n03\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n06\n\n20\n07\n\n20\n08\n\n20\n09\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n11\n\n20\n12\n\n20\n13\n\n20\n14\n\n20\n15\n\n20\n16\n\nG\nin\n\ni i\nnd\n\nex\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-7.xlsx\n\n\n43\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 1\n\n2. An aspiration towards sustainability\n\n13 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\n\nThese trends mean that our climate and \nenvironment, economy and society are \nexperiencing profound changes that will \nfundamentally alter our current way of \nlife. This is happening against a backdrop of \nrapid technological change that is redefining \nour economies and societies. Taken together, \nthese challenges imply the need for three deep \ntransitions along the axes of ecology, economy \nand society, going beyond the traditional focus \n\non GDP growth. In this context, the EU and its \nMember States have signed up to the UN 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development13 \nthat specifies 17 Sustainable Development \nGoals with 169 targets to guide the transition \ntowards sustainable development (Figure 1-8). \nThe SDGs represent an integrated concept \nthat reconciles economic with social and \nenvironmental challenges.\n\nFigure 1-8 Megatrends and Sustainable Development Goals\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: BOHEMIA project (European Commission, 2018)\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-8.xlsx\n\nDRIVERS OF CHANGE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nBIOSPHERESOCIAL NEEDS\n\nTowards a world of cities\n\npe\n\nop\nle a\n\nnd t\nech c\n\nonverge\nnce\n\nAc\ncel\n\nera\nte in\n\nnovat\nions:\n\nGl\n\noba\nl pol\n\nitical & Soc\nio-economic context\n\nSe\ncu\n\nrit\n\ny, R\nesi\n\nlien\nce &\n\n Health\nResources & Services\n\nClimate & Energy\n\nEnvironment & Ecosystem\n\nMEGATRENDS\n\nMEGATRENDS\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-8.xlsx\n\n\n44\n\nEconomic, social, and environmental \nsustainability are not separate. They are \ninterdependent and build upon one another. \nA prosperous and efficient economy thrives within \na healthy, inclusive and resilient society, and both \ndepend on a healthy biosphere. Thus, restoring \nand growing the stock of life and prosperity \nsupporting ecosystems is a key dimension of \neconomic sustainability. The shift from a sectoral \nto a holistic perspective is visualised in the \n\u2018wedding cake\u2019 model of sustainability (Figure \n1-9), developed by the Stockholm Resilience \nCentre. This vision implies that the economy \nserves society so that it evolves within the \nsafe operating space of the planet. These \n\ninterconnections also imply that there are trade-\noffs and synergies between the SDGs. While the \nSDG framework shows many synergies, those \nrelated to higher incomes, better access to \nenergy, more economic growth, and industrial \nand infrastructure investments tend to increase \nthe overall extraction and consumption of natural \nresource, making it harder to achieve targets on \ntheir efficient use, the better management of \nchemicals and waste, climate mitigation and \nthe protection of terrestrial ecosystems and \nbiodiversity (EEA, 2020). The key challenge lies \nin making the right policy choices to leverage the \nsynergies and minimise the potential trade-offs \namong the SDGs.\n\nFigure 1-9 Sustainable Development Goals\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Stockholm Resilience Centre\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-9.xlsx\n\nECONOMY\n\nSOCIETY\n\nBIOSPHERE\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-9.xlsx\n\n\n45\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 1\n\nSustainability implies that we should \nthrive in a safe and just space between \nplanetary boundaries and social bound-\naries14 (Raworth, 2017). On the one hand, an \nenvironmental ceiling of planetary boundaries \nshould not be crossed as this would mean \nunacceptable environmental degradation and \npotential tipping points in Earth systems. On \nthe other hand, many dimensions of human \ndeprivation lie below social foundations. Moving \ninto the space between these two boundaries \nis an aspiration that requires \u2018far greater equity \nin the use of natural resources, and far greater \nefficiency in transforming those resources to \nmeet human needs\u2019 (Raworth, 2012).\n\nCurrently, no country in the world seems \nto meet basic needs for its citizens at \na globally sustainable level of resource \nuse. O\u2019Neil et al. (2018) aim to quantify \nthe transgression of biophysical boundaries \nand achievement of social thresholds for \nover 150 countries (Figure 1-10). They \nshow that \u2018physical needs such as nutrition, \n\n14 Planetary boundaries\u2019 is a concept which refers to a series of sustainability limits beyond which lie tipping points for many earth \nsystems that could result in the planet becoming inhospitable for humanity. In her book \u2018Doughnut Economics\u2019, Kate Raworth \njoined the idea of planetary boundaries with that of a social foundation to provide the \u2018safe operating space\u2019 for humanity.\n\nsanitation, access to electricity and the \nelimination of extreme poverty could likely \nbe met for all people without transgressing \nplanetary boundaries. However, the universal \nachievement of more qualitative goals (for \nexample, high life satisfaction) would require \na level of resource use that is 2-6 times \nthe sustainable level, based on current \nrelationships.\u2019 Europe achieves the social \nthresholds for almost every indicator, but it \ndoes so by transgressing the safe levels for \nalmost all biophysical boundaries. The only \none that Europe does not exceed is water \nuse. At the other extreme, countries like Sri \nLanka stand within the safe boundary for \nevery single environmental indicator but \nonly achieve an acceptable level for three \nof the social indicators. The situation in the \nUnited States is similar to the EU, with most \nsocial thresholds achieved and biophysical \nboundaries transgressed. In comparison, \nChina presents more shortfalls regarding the \nsocial dimensions but less overshoot on the \nbiophysical aspects.\n\n\n\n46\n\nFigure 1-10 Doughnut representation of biophysical boundaries \nand social thresholds\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: https://goodlife.leeds.ac.uk/\nNote: Orange wedges show social performance relative to a threshold associated with meeting basic needs (blue circle); light blue \nwedges show resource use relative to a biophysical boundary associated with sustainability (green circle).

R&I can accelerate the transition to a sustainable \n\nEurope\n\nThe interconnection between social, \neconomic and environmental issues call \nfor systemic change in which R&I plays \na key role. EPSC (2019) highlights the need for \npolicy action directed at \u2018capturing the multiple \ndimensions of sustainability [\u2026] to overcome the \noften siloed approach pursued by most actors \nat all levels of government\u2019, referring to the \ninextricable links of the safe and just space for \nhumanity between social shortfall and ecological \novershoot. In this context, cross-cutting policies \nsuch as R&I will play a key role in achieving \n\nsustainable development. They have the unique \ncapacity to set directionality without being \nprescriptive, and to create synergies across \npolicies to increase overall impact. Science and \ntechnology are key levers for the transformation \nrequired to address SDGs (United Nations, \n2019b). However, R&I will need to interact with \nother levers, such as governance, economy and \nfinance, and individual and collective action, \nin order to bring about the transformations \nrequired to address the SDGs (United Nations, \n2019b) (Figure 1-14).\n\nFigure 1-14 Entry points for transformation\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: United Nations (2019c), Global Sustainable Development Report\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-14.xlsx\n\nScience &\ntechnology\n\nIndividual &\ncollective action\n\nEconomy \n& finance\n\nGovernance\n\nLEVERS\n\nENTRY POINTS FOR TRANSFORMATION\n\nHuman\nwell-being\n\nand \ncapabilities\n\nUrban\nand\n\nped-urban\ndevelopment\n\nGlobal\nenvironmental\n\ncommons\n\nEnergy\ndecarbonisation\nwith universal\n\naccess\n\nSustainable\nfood systems\nand healthy\n\naccess\n\nSustainable\nand just\n\neconomies\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-14.xlsx\n\n\n51\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 1\n\nR&I is a cornerstone for a robust European \nproject in a global context that can \naccelerate the transition to sustainability, \nwhile improving our well-being and \nensuring longer-term prosperity. First, R&I \nis needed to produce novel solutions in areas \nlike health, digital technologies, industrial \ntransformation, resilient societies, natural \nresources, energy, mobility, environment, \nfood, low-carbon economy and security. R&I \nsolutions also enable both economic and \nenvironmental efficiency to be improved while \ndeveloping new sustainable ways to satisfy \nhuman needs. Second, R&I helps to build the \n\nnecessary knowledge and understanding of \nthe phenomena to be addressed. Third, R&I, \nin particular frontier research, can strengthen \nsociety\u2019s resilience by building a reservoir of \nknowledge over the long term (Ricci, 2017). \nHence, R&I can become a compass helping \nthe EU to navigate the complexities of the \n'Anthropocene\u2019 and to co-create a common \nroute. R&I can also be the engine room for \nanswers and solutions in the transformation \ntowards sustainability, contributing to solving \nchallenges at the global level.

Industrial symbiosis is the use by one \ncompany or sector of by-products, including \nenergy, water, logistics and materials, from \nanother. The development of a secure platform \nallows for the flexible management of shared \nprocess resources with intelligent decision-\nsupport tools. It provides plant operations \nand production managers with the robust and \nreliable information that they need in real time \nto effectively and confidently share resources \n(plant, energy, water, residues and recycled \nmaterials) with other companies in an optimum \nsymbiotic ecosystem. There is the potential for \na 10 % reduction in industry\u2019s GHG emissions, \nwhile industry has less needs for fresh water \nacross Europe: up to 40 %.

R&I can help to \novercome these trade-offs, although there is \nalso a risk of their exacerbation17.\n\nFigure 1-17 Overview of the interlinks between SDGs based on Horizon 2020 projects\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Commission (2020), Monitoring Flash: Sustainable Development Goals\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-17.xlsx\n\n14\n L\n\nife\n b\n\nel\now\n\n w\nat\n\ner\n   \n\n   \n   \n\n15\n Li\n\nfe \non\n\n la\nnd \n\n     \n     \n\n     1\n6 Pe\n\nace    \n               01 Poverty     02 Hunger            O3 Good health            04 Education   05 Gender\n\n13 Clim\nate action                    12 Consumption               11 Cities                10 Inequalities      09 I\n\nndust\nry   \n\n     \n   0\n\n8 W\nork\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n  0\n\n7 \nEn\n\ner\ngy\n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n06\n C\n\nle\nan\n\n w\nat\n\ner\n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n     \n     \n\n      \n     1\n\n7 Partn\nerships\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-17.xlsx\n\n\n58\n\n4. Conclusion: a transformative innovation policy\n\nThe EU is fully committed to sustainable \ndevelopment and endorses its holistic and \nintegrated approach, mainstreaming the \nSDGs into EU policies and initiatives, with \nsustainable development as an essential guiding \nprinciple for all of its policies. This calls for policy \ncoherence for sustainable development across \ndifferent dimensions: social, environmental \nand economic, in relation to our people, planet \nand prosperity. Hence, it requires an integrated \nmultidimensional policymaking approach, which \nis directional and evidence-based (Figure 1-18). \nThe sustainability transformation is also an \n\nunprecedented governance challenge at all \nlevels from local to global. This results from the \ncombined effect of the urgency, the scale of the \nnecessary transformations, and the complexity \nand interdependence of issues in a context of \nfragility and unpredictability. Well-conceived \nand coherent policies should stimulate the three \nsustainability dimensions \u2013 environmental, social \nand economic \u2013 to reinforce each other. In order \nto achieve this, EU R&I policy should be guided \nby principles such as co-creation, diffusion, \nuptake, transformation and the directionality \nof research and innovation (Box 1-3).\n\nFigure 1-18 Example of translation of 17 SDGs into four dimensions\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Muff et al.

The founding \nprinciple of European cooperation through \nthe EU was to facilitate and cultivate the \nbuilding of trust, understanding and sharing \nas a method of achieving common goals \n(Monnet, 1996) in a community open to ideas, \ninnovation and peace. The efforts of the last \n60 years have cultivated a robust culture of \ndoing things together resulting in stronger pan-\nEuropean collaborations necessary to address \nthe most pressing continental issues at hand. \nThese efforts have also recognised the fact that \nno EU Member State is big enough to tackle \nissues such as energy transitions and the fight \nagainst climate change alone. These issues \nprofoundly challenge almost all aspects of \nour society. So right effort should be met with \nthe right action. A co-creation approach that is \nhorizontal, inclusive, with a sense of a common \nEuropean purpose, would respond directly to \nthe challenges and crises of our time. \n\nDiffusion: a functioning European innovation \nsystem requires the right links among actors \nand the knowledge flows between them \nto be nurtured and progressively created. \nChaminade and Edquist (2010) describe how \nthe innovation systems theory was a reaction \nto the inadequacies of the neoclassical \u2018market \nfailure\u2019 approach to justify public intervention \nto support innovation processes. They postulate \nthat interventions by the public sector should be \n\ndone in those cases in which the system does \nnot function well, i.e. where system actors are \nnot communicating well. If we observe the whole \nof the EU as a big potential innovation system, \ncomprising universities, entrepreneurs, citizens, \ngovernments and the environment, there is a case \nto ensure that knowledge flows freely and that at \na systemic level there is no unfair concentration \nto hamper economic and social progress. \n\nUptake: a modern European R&I innovation \nstrategy should create system conditions \nthat are favourable for market uptake \nand societal benefit of research and \ninnovation. The challenges of designing \neffective innovation policies, including their \nindustrial dimensions, imply understanding \nthe dynamics and roles of technological \ndevelopment. Tassey (2007, 2014) introduces \nnew elements relevant to the transition from \nbasic science to commercial products - generic \ntechnology platforms, infratechnologies (e.g. \nmeasuring methods and standards) and \nproprietary technologies. His model opens up \nthe space for exploring interdependencies in \nboth markets and innovation systems over time, \nand at the level of a critical commercialisation \npath for the industrialisation of emerging \ninnovations. Hence, it is not enough to promote \nresearch results and individual pieces of \ninnovation \u2013 there is also a need to ensure \na systemic approach that extends to all the \ntechnology elements needed for successful \nuptake to happen. \n\n\n\n60\n\nTransformation: R&I will have a major role \nin supporting a profound transformation \nof our value chains, which is needed \nto achieve the SDGs. The incentives for \nsystemic changes in industries, especially \nlegacy industries (e.g. agro-food, energy, \nlegacy IT, transport, construction), and in \ncustomer behaviour are often too low in \nthe short term. These changes can also \ninvolve high risks in the medium term so \nlong-term benefits for sustainability are \ndifficult to capture. However, innovation, \nespecially digital innovation, is causing wide-\nranging industrial transformations (McFee \nand Brynjolfsson, 2017). One of the roles of \npublic policy interventions through R&I will be \nto facilitate these reconfigurations of value \nchains. Even if innovations often come from \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), \nmost of such organisations may not have the \nrequired resources and organisational skills to \ncompete in globally disrupted and changing \nvalue chains. In the past, this was addressed \nin certain sectors by ensuring rich access to \nventure and other capital (Janeway, 2018), but \nlegacy sectors, which are also being disrupted \nand transformed, call for the deployment of \na full range of innovation policy interventions \n(Bonvillian and Singer, 2017). \n\nDirectionality: an SDGs framework for \nthe implementation of EU R&I policy calls \nfor direction and an effective framework \nfor coordination, alignment and \nsynchronisation. This framework calls for \nsteering of R&I to address specific issues but \nit does not prescribe the way how they should \nbe addressed. Research into policy design for \ninvestment in R&I indicates that there can \nbe different methods for priority setting in \nthe research agenda, involving the science \npush or demand pull for innovation (Nemet, \n2009; Stewart, 1995; Mazzucato, 2017). \nDifferent approaches have been explored to \nexplain and systemise how R&I contributes to \ntechnological change. Because technological \ntransitions in societies take distinct (Geels and \nSchot, 2007; Svensson and Nikoleris, 2018) \nand converging (Bainbridge and Roco, 2016; \nRoco and Bainbridge, 2013) integral pathways \nit is necessary to be able to direct the evolution \nof the R&I portfolios. Such directionality should \nbe based on sound evidence gathered for \nexample from foresight analysis (Schaper-\nRinkel, 2013). In this context, an agile, \nresponsive and socially accountable R&I policy \nthat provides directionality must integrate \na horizontal approach that encompasses \nthe coordination of policy instruments, \nan alignment of policy objectives and the \nsynchronisation of investments.\n\n\n\n61\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 1\n\nEU R&I policy can set the direction (see Box \n1-4) to generate knowledge and solutions for \nthe transformation towards sustainability, \nwhile improving our well-being and ensuring \nlong-term prosperity and enhancing Europe\u2019s \ncompetitiveness as a global sustainability \nleader. It should promote systemic approaches \nbeyond disciplines, sectors and policy areas. \nWhen challenges cross several policies, such as \nthe food system, the strength of R&I is evidence-\nbased orchestration. Transformative R&I policy \n\n18 The Joint Research Centre is making an important contribution to the operationalisation of transformative innovation with \nthe recently launched Territorial Reviews of Industrial Transition (https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/industrial-transition).\n\ncan be a key enabler of the European process \nfor SDG policy coordination. This is only possible \nwith synergies between the environmental, \nsocial, and economic dimension of sustainable \ndevelopment by following a comprehensive, \nsystemic, and ambitious approach at the EU \nlevel. A new transformative R&I policy will also \nneed to engage with other actors in society to \ndeploy new solutions on a massive scale, in \nparticular the radical innovations required for \nsuch a transformation18. \n\nBOX 1-4 Transformative innovation and socio-\ntechnical transitions to address grand challenges\nFrank Geels, University of Manchester\n\nTransformative innovation and systemic \ntransitions are gaining increasing \nattention in the context of three policy \nproblems. First, addressing the climate \nchange problem will require radical \ninnovation and low-carbon transitions in \nmany systems. Second, addressing other \ngrand societal challenges (like ageing, \nobesity, energy security, urban quality of \nlife, inequality) and the SDGs will require \ntransformative innovations in healthcare, \nagro-food, and urban systems. Third, low-\ncarbon and sustainability transitions offer \nattractive growth prospects.\n\nTransformative innovation and systemic \ntransitions involve several new policy \nchallenges:\n\n1. Horizontal policy coordination\n\n2. Transform social, business model and \ninfrastructural innovation, not just \ntechnologies\n\n3. Wider set of actors and coalitions \n(startups, cities, communities, citizens, \nNGOs)\n\n4. Visions and missions (drive and \ndirectionality)\n\n5.  Diffusion of radical innovations into \nmarkets and society\n\nContinue reading in Chapter 9 - Trans-\nformative innovation and socio-technical \ntransitions to address grand challenges\n\nhttps://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/industrial-transition\n\n\n62\n\nR&I will play a crucial role in driving the \ntransition to a climate-neutral Europe \nand green economy. The European Green \nDeal Communication confirms that: \u2018New \ntechnologies, sustainable solutions and \ndisruptive innovation are critical to achieve \nthe objectives of the European Green Deal\u2019 \n(Figure 1-19). To deliver on the Green Deal, \nHorizon Europe will continue to create new \nknowledge and solutions to attain the SDGs \n\nand will provide even more directionality \nthrough its mission-oriented approach (e.g. \non climate change, healthy oceans, climate-\nneutral and smart cities, and soil health and \nfood) and European partnerships. In addition, \nit has set a 35 % spending target for climate. \nIt is also important to acknowledge that \nthe vast majority of current Horizon 2020 \nprogramme investment is expected to foster \nthe Sustainable Development Agenda.\n\nFigure 1-19 European Green Deal \n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, adapted from the Communication on The European Green Deal19\n\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-19.xlsx\n\n19 COM(2019) 640 final.\n\nThe EU as global leader A European Climate Pact\n\nTRANSFORMING THE \nEU ECONOMY FOR A \n\nSUSTAINABLE FUTURE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN \nGREEN DEAL\n\nFinancing the transition Leave no one behind (Just Transition)\n\nMobilising research and innovation\n\nIncreasing the EU\u2019s climate\nambition for 2030 and 2050\n\nA zero pollution ambition for \na toxic-free environment\n\nBuilding and renovating in an \nenergy- and resource-efficient way\n\nAccelerating the shi\ufffd to sustainable \nand smart mobility\n\nSupplying clean, affordable and \nsecure energy\n\nPreserving and restoring \necosystems and biodiversity\n\nMobilising industry for a clean \nand circular economy\n\nFrom \u2018Farm to Fork\u2019: a fair, healthy and \nenvironmentally friendly food system\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter1/figure-1-19.xlsx\n\n\n63\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 1\n\n5.

The 5 Cs of the changing dynamics \nof innovation: celerity, complexity, \nconcentration, costs and consumers\n\nDigitalisation is transforming every aspect \nof our world. The rise of new technologies, \nin particular digital technologies and their \nconvergence with the physical world, is affecting \nmillions of workers and companies. New \ntechnologies have triggered a global race for \ninvestment, talent, knowledge and research. \nThis has several consequences, in particular in \nterms of industrial policy. Moreover, these new \ndigital technologies have redefined the way \nin which markets operate and have attracted \nmore attention to high-growth innovative \nplatform-based companies, e.g. the so-called \n\u2018tech giants\u2019 (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, \nMicrosoft, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba), a set of \nglobal companies which are reaping large \neconomic benefits. The traditional \u2018innovation \npipeline\u2019 \u2013 research leading to discovery leading \nto innovation and growth \u2013 no longer describes \nthe reality, or not necessarily in those terms.\n\nFurthermore, many innovations in the \ndigital age have enabled companies to \n\noperate under a paradigm of close to \u2018zero \nmarginal cost\u2019. For instance, more and more \nindividuals playing music and using software \ndoes not generate additional costs for the \ncompany. Innovation has also become more \n\u2018consumer-centric\u2019 as consumers increasingly \nlook for customised \u2018solutions\u2019 rather than \n\u2018products\u2019 or \u2018services\u2019.\n\nAt the same time, new technologies are \npromising large productivity gains al-\nthough these have yet to materialise. In \nparticular, productivity growth, which largely \ndepends on R&I, is sluggish and continues to \nhold back more robust growth (see Chapter 3.1 \n- Productivity puzzle and innovation diffusion).\n\nHence, in this chapter, we describe in more \ndetail the five main characteristics of the \nchanging dynamics of innovation in the \nage of digital transformation \u2013 celerity, \ncomplexity, concentration, costs and con-\nsumers - as represented in Figure 2-1.\n\nFigure 2-1 Main characteristics of the 'changing dynamics of innovation'\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-1.xlsx\n\nCelerity\n\nelerity\n\nComplexity\n\nConcentrationCosts\n\nConsumers\n\nChanging dynamics \nof innovation \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-1.xlsx\n\n\n70\n\n2. Celerity\n\nTechnology, and notably consumer-\ndriven innovation, is spreading faster \nthan ever due to the transition from \nphysical to digital goods combined \nwith strong network effects in the age \nof digital transformation. The pace of \nchange in consumer-driven innovation has \naccelerated tremendously over time in the era \nof digitalisation and increasing connectivity. \nIndeed, innovations are being adopted at \na higher rate than in previous decades and \ncenturies. Figure 2-2 shows that it took much \nlonger for potentially all US households to have \n\na flush toilet in their homes, own a car and \na dishwasher, or have electricity than to use the \ninternet and even less to use a smartphone or \nengage in social media channels. The steeper \nthe lines in the graph, the faster the adoption \nrates for those technologies. However, as \nnoted in Chapter 3.1 - Productivity puzzle and \ninnovation diffusion, a slowdown in innovation \ndiffusion continues to hold back a stronger \nuptake of innovations across companies and \nindustries, even if business-to-consumer (B2C) \ninnovations have been adopted at faster rates \nthan before, fostered by digitalisation.\n\nFigure 2-2 Technology adoption rates of selected innovations(1) over time, \nUS households, 1860-2019\n\nAutomobile\nMobile phone\nComputer\nDishwasher\n\nElectric power\nFlush toilet\nInternet\nLandline\n\nSmartphone usage\nSocial media usage\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n%\n U\n\nS \nho\n\nus\neh\n\nol\nds\n\n18\n60\n\n18\n70\n\n18\n80\n\n18\n90\n\n19\n00\n\n19\n10\n\n19\n20\n\n19\n30\n\n19\n40\n\n19\n50\n\n19\n60\n\n19\n70\n\n19\n80\n\n19\n90\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n20\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit, adapted from Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser \n(2019).

For \nexample, mobile phones failed to make \nthe transition to \u2018smartphones\u2019 on time \nand rapidly lost their market share and \nrelevance. Another example is \u2018Pay television\u2019: \nit appears that cable TV\u2019s subscription \nbase has been in decline, in favour of the \nalmost linear growth of Netflix subscribers \n(Figure 2-3). Netflix is a subscription-based \nonline streaming platform for movies and \nTV shows which also produces in-house \ncontent. This streaming platform makes use \nof sophisticated algorithms to generate new \ncontent and recommendations according to \nuser preference. It would appear that, since \n2017, the number of Netflix subscriptions in \nthe United States has surpassed the number \nof subscribers to Pay TV. Another example \n\nis the decline in the photographic industry \nfrom 121 million of shipments worldwide in \n2010 to only 19 million in 2018, partly due \nto the global expansion of smartphones with \nembedded cameras (Statista, 2019).\n\nAnother way to look into the speed of \ntechnology adoption is to consider the \ntime it took for new products and services \nto reach 100 million users since they \nwere launched to the public (Figure 2-4). \nThe telephone was launched in 1878 and it \ntook 75 years for 100 million people to use it \nsince it also relied on the parallel development \nand expansion of physical infrastructure. This \ncompares to 16 years for the mobile phone, \nlaunched in 1979, and 7 years for the internet. In \nthe 2000s, digitalisation spread to the economy \nquicker than ever, which means that less and \nless time was needed for new digital products to \nreach a customer base of 100 million users. For \ninstance, it took just 2 years and 8 months for \n\nFigure 2-3 Number of Netflix subscribers vs. pay-tv subscribers in the  \nUnited States, in millions, 2012-2017\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Statista based on Netflix, Leichtman Research Group\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-3.xlsx\n\n23.4\n\n29.2\n\n35.7\n\n41.4\n\n47.0\n\n50.9\n52.6 51.0 50.4 49.2 49.1\n\n48.6\n\nQ1 2012 Q1 2013 Q1 2014 Q1 2015 Q1 2016 Q1 2017\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nM\nill\n\nio\nn \n\nsu\nbs\n\ncr\nib\n\ner\ns\n\nNetflix Cable\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-3.xlsx\n\n\n72\n\nNetwork effects are also underpinning the \nspeed of these developments, particularly \nin the digital age. According to Metcalfe\u2019s law, \n\u2018the effect of a network is proportional to the \nsquare of the number of connected users of \nthe system\u2019. Essentially, each new user brings \nmore and more value to the network, which is \nbehind the spectacular growth of social media \nnetworks and certain apps.\n\nQuantum computing has the potential \nto solve highly complex problems in less \n\ntime than classical computers, which \ncould speed up scientific discoveries and \npredictions in the future. Unlike classical \ncomputers which use \u2018bits\u2019 (i.e. 0 or 1), quantum \ncomputers use \u2018quantum bits\u2019 or \u2018qubits\u2019 \nwhich allow for the so-called superposition \nphenomenon, as qubits can take the two \nvalues of 0 and 1 simultaneously (Figure 2-5). \nAs a result, qubits enable greater computing \npower, which could lead to new applications in \nfields such as big data, cryptography, medicine, \nweather prediction, and machine learning.\n\nFigure 2-4 Time for new products and services to reach 100 million users(1), \nby year of launch\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit, adapted from BCG (2015) and based on ITU \n(Telephone and Mobile phone), Scientific American (World Wide Web), Internet Live Stats, Fortune (iTunes), Facebook, Wired (WhatsApp), \nTechcrunch (Instagram), AppMtr.com (Candy Crush Saga),  arinsider.co (Pokemon Go), Searchengineisland (Twitter)\nNote: (1)iTunes: number of accounts; Facebook: monthly active users; WhatsApp: active users; Instagram: monthly users; Candy Crush \nSaga: Facebook users only; Pokemon Go: number of downloads; Twitter: active users; Skype: registered users.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-4.xlsx\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go\n\nCandy Crush Saga\n\nInstagram\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nSkype\n\niTunes\n\nInternet\n\nMobile phone\n\nTelephone\n\n16 years\n\n6 years, 5 months\n\n5 years\n\n4 years, 6 months\n\n3 years, 4 months\n\n2 years, 8 months\n\n2 years, 4 months\n\n1 year, 3 months\n\n75 years\n\nYear of launch\n\n1878\n\n1979\n\n1990\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n7 years\n\n1 month\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\n2016\n\nSkype to get 100 million registered users, 2 years \nand 4 months for Instagram to register 100 million \nmonthly users, and only 1 month for 100 million \ndownloads of Pok\u00e9mon GO.

Complexity\n\nConvergence of the digital and physical \nworlds is increasing the complexity of \ninnovation. Innovations are increasingly the \nresult of the convergence between digital \ntechnologies and scientific fields leading to \n\u2018deep-tech innovations\u2019 (Figure 2-7). In other \nwords, this means deeply transformative \nand increasingly science-based and complex \ninnovations. This includes digital supply \nchains, precision agriculture, 3D bioprinting, \nautonomous vehicles, among many others. \nIn order to reap the full benefits of these \ndeep-tech innovations, companies must have \nin place the right economic competencies, \nwhich include an organisational structure that \n\nenables the agility and flexibility among teams \nto master different technologies and new \nbusiness models, management quality with \na strategic vision, staff training, and branding \n(see Chapter 5.3 - Investment in economic \ncompetencies). Moreover, despite having the \npotential to be deeply transformational, these \ninnovations may take years and sometimes \ndecades to be market ready. As a result, \ndeep-tech, science-driven innovations require \n\u2018patient capital\u2019 funds that account for the \nhigher uncertainty involved as well as the \nlonger time span to enable them to be tested, \nimproved and hopefully made commercially \nviable (see Chapter 8 - Framework conditions).\n\nFigure 2-7 Deep-tech innovation: science-based digitally-enabled innovations\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Commission, DG Research and Innovation,  Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-7.xlsx\n\nMedicine\n\nBio-technology Agriculture \n\nEducation\n\nRetail\nFinance\n\nLogisticsEnergy\n\nManufacturing\n\nHospitality\n\nTransport\n\nPredictive gene-based \nhealthcare\n\nContinuous \nglucose \n\nmonitoring\n\n3D \nbioprinting\n\nOrgan-on-a-chip\n\nNanopore \nDNA sequencer\n\nVR learning \ncentres for \n\nmedical \nstudents Digital \n\ntechnologies\n+\n\nElectronics\n\nMOOC \n(Massive \n\nopen online \ncourses)\n\nE-commerce\n\nRobo-advisor\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nPeer-to-peer \nlending\n\nDigital\nsupply chain\n\nSharing\neconomy\n\nAutonomous\nvehicles\n\nCobots \n\nNew battery\ntechnologies\n\nPredictive\nmaintenance\n\nWireless \npower\n\ntransfer\n\nVirtual \npower \nplant\n\nCRISPR/Cas9\n\nCRISPR/Cas9\n\nPrecision \nagriculture\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-7.xlsx\n\n\n75\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 2\n\n4. Concentration\n\n1 In fact, industry concentration in Europe seems more stable (average over the period will be close to zero).\n\nIndustry concentration is a rising pheno-\nmenon in North America, and to a less \nextent in Europe1. Bajgar et al. (2019) show \nthat overall sales concentration has been \nincreasing since 2000 in both North America \nand Europe (Figure 2-8). It is interesting to note \nthat the rising trend in industry concentration \nin terms of sales is observable in both digital-\nintensive and other sectors of the economy. In \nfact, concentration in North America appears \n\nmore pronounced in sectors other than those \nwith higher digital intensity, even though \nconcentration in the latter appears to have \nbe on the rise since 2007. This could relate to \nthe significant growth in the US in high-tech \nbusiness dynamism in the early late 1990s \nand early 2000s (Decker et al., 2016), which \nwas then interrupted. In Europe, differences in \nconcentration in both sectors are not as evident \nas they are in the United States and Canada. \n\nFigure 2-8 Concentration in digital-intensive vs. less-digital industries  \nin Europe and North America(1), 2000-2014\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Bajgar et al.

Mark-ups in the top \ndigital-intensive sectors are higher and \ngrowing faster than in the rest of the \neconomy. As mentioned in De Loecker and \nEeckhout (2017), mark-ups are a market \npower measure for how much higher prices \nare relative to marginal costs. Calligaris et \nal. (2018) studied the evolution of mark-ups \nover time to investigate whether they are on \n\nthe rise in the age of digital transformation, \nand whether there are differences between \nthe top 25 % most digital-intensive and the \nless digital-intensive sectors of the economy. \nIndeed, Figure 2-9 shows that mark-ups have \nrisen over time in both top-intensive and \nless-intensive digital sectors, although this \nincrease has been more pronounced in the top \ndigital-intensive sectors (see Chapter 10 - \nThe bottom also matters: policies for \nproductivity catch-up in the digital economy).\n\nFigure 2-9 Mark-up growth over time in digital-intensive vs. less-digital-intensive \nsectors, 2001-2014\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: OECD based on Calligaris, S., C.

For example, Apple \nand Alphabet climbed 31 and 18 positions, \nrespectively, compared to the 2009 ranking. \n\nthat the rise in mark-ups and the concentration \nof benefits of innovations in a handful of global \ndigital giants may be deterring new firms from \nentering the most digital-intensive sectors. As \na result, the productivity gap between frontier \n\nand laggard firms may continue to widen as \nproductivity gains may become concentrated \nin a small number of firms (see Chapter 3.1 \n- Productivity puzzle and innovation diffusion).\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-10.xlsx\n\n\n78\n\nMost of the so-called \u2018digital\u2019 or \u2018tech\u2019 giants \nbenefit from the increasing connectivity of \ntheir users which also gives them access to \nenormous volumes of data in their customer \nbase.

(2019) looked into the top 2 000 \nR&D investors worldwide. Having linked this  \ninformation to data on publications, patents \nand trademarks, the authors found that the top \n250 R&D investors alone actually account for \naround 72 % of total R&D expenditure, 71 % of \n\npublications, 65 % of patents and 42 % of regis-\ntered trademarks among the top corporate R&D  \nsample (Figure 2-12). When extending the an-\nalysis to the top 2 000 corporate R&D investors, \nthe authors concluded that this group of com-\npanies was responsible for almost two thirds of \npatents filed at the largest intellectual property \n(IP) offices worldwide, for example.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n250 500 750 1 000 1 250 1 500 1 750 2 000\n\nCu\nm\n\nul\nat\n\niv\ne \n\n(%\n)\n\nR&D ranking of companies\n\nR&D expenditure Patents Scientific publications Trademarks\n\n0\n\nFigure 2-12 R&D investment, publications and IP bundle of the world's \ntop 2 000 R&D investors, 2014-2016(1)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Dernist et al.

When looking \nto the top 1 000 R&D investors in the EU, an \nunequal distribution of R&D expenditure among \ncompanies (Figure 2-13) can be observed. \n\nThe same uneven picture applies to sales and \nemployment, albeit less pronounced than R&D \ninvestments. For example, the top 25 R&D \ninvestors in the EU account for half of the \ngroup\u2019s R&D expenditure.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-12.xlsx\n\n\n80\n\nThe rising concentration of R&D invest-\nments among a relatively small number \nof players is also visible at the global \nlevel. According to European Commission \n(2018), the top 2 500 R&D investors account \nfor 90  % of the world\u2019s business-funded R&D. \nMoreover, just a few companies account for \na significant share of all R&D expenditure \n(Figure 2-14) in each region.\n\nWhen it comes to AI science and innova-\ntion, the weight of the world\u00b4s top cor-\nporate R&D investors also appears to \n\nbe higher than in other companies, as \nmeasured by publications, patents and \ntrademarks. As mentioned in Chapter 7 - R&I \nenabling artificial intelligence, in recent years \nthere has been a boom both in AI publications \nand patenting activity. In this context, the \nglobal 2 000 corporate R&D investors seem \nmore active than other players in producing \nAI scientific publications and patenting and \ngenerating trademarks for their innovations \n(Figure 2-15). This indicates that the develop-\nment of AI R&I may also become increasingly \nconcentrated.\n\nFigure 2-13 R&D investments, employment and net sales  \nof the top EU28 1 000 R&D investors, 2019\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit, based on EU Industrial R&D Investment \nScoreboard 2019\nNote: Data refers to the top 1 000 R&D investors in the EU.

Figure 2-16 shows \nthat just a few companies \u2013 Google, Amazon, \nMicrosoft, Apple and Facebook \u2013 account for very \nlarge shares in different digital markets, notably \ninternet search, web browsers, cloud hosting, \ndesktop and mobile operating systems, and online \nadvertising revenues. For example, Google is the \nclear leading search engine with a market share \nclose to 90 %3. Amazon alone is the top cloud \ninfrastructure provider with 33 % market share \nworldwide. Van Reenen (2018) argues that the \n\n3 https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/\n4 https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/will-regulating-big-tech-stifle-innovation\n\n\u2018growth of platform competition in digital markets \nhas led to the dominance by a small number of \nfirms such as internet search (Google), operating \nsystems for cell phones (Apple, Android), ride-\nsharing (Uber), home sharing (Airbnb)\u2019. Moreover, \nthe author4 highlights that the mechanism of \ncompeting on platforms means that, for example, \nin the case of Google, online searches will give \nthe company increasingly larger amounts of \ndata which will optimise their algorithms. As \na result, this will attract more users to the \nplatform and hence generate further advertising \nrevenues. Moreover, the ownership and control of  \nusers\u00b4 data for advertising or improving the quality \nof products has led to considerable concerns over \ndata privacy as well as market power.\n\nFigure 2-16 Global market shares by company - internet search, web browsers, \ncloud hosting, desktop operating systems, mobile operating systems and \n\nonline advertising revenue, 2017\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/will-regulating-big-tech-stifle-innovation (September 2018), based on \nSynergy Research, CNBC, Statista\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-16.xlsx\n\nGoogle\nOther\n\nGoogle (Chrome)\nOther\n\nAmazon\nMicroso\t\nOther\n\nMicroso\t (Windows)\nApple (OSX)\nOther\n\nGoogle (Android)\nApple (IOS)\nOther\n\nGoogle\nFacebook\nOther\n\nInternet search Web browsers Cloud hosting\n\nDesktop\noperating systems\n\nMobile\noperating systems Online and revenue\n\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/will-regulating-big-tech-stifle-innovation\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-16.xlsx\n\n\n83\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 2\n\n5.

In other \nwords, the marginal cost for digital goods \ndeclines indefinitely5 (Figure 2-17). Indeed, the \n\nbiggest transformation created by digitalisation \nconcerns the \u2018move from atoms to bytes\u20196. \nWhile \u2018physical innovations\u2019 such as the landline \ntelephone rely on inputs for their production \nbased on atoms (e.g. physical infrastructure, \nraw materials, human capital) which follow \nthe laws of physics, in the digital age, bytes \nallow a digital good to be produced at close-\nto-zero marginal cost since there is almost \nzero cost for reproduction and communication \n(Guellec and Paunov, 2018). Therefore, digital \ncompanies do not have the same needs for \nphysical infrastructure and tangible capital as \nother industries. In fact, they often benefit from \nIT platforms, software systems and tools, cloud \nstorage capacity, etc. which tend to be more \ninexpensive than other types of tangible assets.\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit, based on Essays, UK.

Consumers\n\nNetwork effects can also play an important \nrole in fostering the use and uptake of \ndigital technologies, even though there is \nthe risk of \u2018consumer lock-in\u2019. In the case of \nsocial networks (but also other digital products \nsuch as online platforms or certain software \ntools), the higher the scale of users in the \nnetworks the greater the consumer value from \nthat interconnectedness. However, consumers \nmay be \u2018locked in\u2019 to such products or services \nas the cost associated with changing provider \nis too high since their network is established \nthrough a different provider. For instance, \nMicrosoft\u2019s strong position in terms of office \noperating systems means that a network of \npeople are using the same systems to work \nand collaborate in a compatible way. For this \n\nreason, the incentives to change to a different \noperating system provider are low considering \nthe cost of learning and setting new \nharmonised standards for sharing information \nand communicating.\n\nBusiness model innovation contributes to \ncapturing greater value from new goods \nand services. In particular, various digital \nbusiness models have emerged to benefit \nfrom the new opportunities brought by the \ndigital age. As mentioned in Baden-Fuller and \nHaefliger (2013), \u2018business models mediate the \nlink between technology and firm performance\u2019. \nBox 2-1 summarises the different approaches \nto business model innovation, especially in the \ndigital age.\n\nBOX 2-1 Business model innovation: capturing value\n\n7 https://www.slideshare.net/jindrichweiss/55-business-models-to-revolutionize-your-business-by-michaela-csik\n\nCompanies increasingly compete not only \non the products and services they sell but \nalso in terms of the underlying business \nmodel. In fact, business model innovation \ncan be a true disruptor in many markets \nand an important differentiator when \nthere is a high degree of competition.\n\nFor example, in clothing retail there \nare many established brands, including \nstrong European multinationals such as \nthe United Colors of Benetton (Italy) or \nH&M (Sweden), with successful business \nmodels. In this context, the business \nmodel of ZARA (Spain) enabled the \ncompany to differentiate itself from its \ncompetitors. For example, instead of \noutsourcing most of its production to \nAsia, it also has production units in Spain \n\nand Portugal. Moreover, the company has \ncollections which change on a weekly \nbasis rather than the longer design cycles \nof its competitors7.\n\nAnother example is that of Skype in the \ntelecommunications sector. Skype was \ncreated by Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m (Sweden) \nand Janus Friis (Danish), in cooperation \nwith Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu, and \nJaan Tallinn (Estonia). While calls and, \nin particular, international calls can be \nexpensive, Skype used the VoIP \u2013 Voice \nover Internet Protocol \u2013 technology to allow \nusers to communicate over the internet \nby voice, for free if you subscribe to the \nfree version. Moreover, it relies mainly on \nsoftware development, thereby reducing \nthe need for physical infrastructure.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/jindrichweiss/55-business-models-to-revolutionize-your-business-by-michaela-csik\n\n\n85\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 2\n\nIn the era of digitalisation, companies operating \nin the digital space are adopting different \nbusiness model strategies.

In other words, consumers \nare no longer mere users of new technologies \nbut are actually driving innovations. As they are \nmore informed than ever, companies face even \ngreater pressure, including trying to anticipate \nfuture needs. Another growing practice is to have \ncustomers\u2019 involvement and feedback early in \nthe process of creating a new product or service \nso that companies can customise the new \nsolutions to the exact needs of the consumer and \n\nhence differentiate from their main competitors \nto secure a higher market share. Figure 2-20 \npresents an overview of the main trends driving \nconsumer-centric behaviour. These include \nthe big data analytics revolution,  extensive \nsocial networks and interconnectedness, multi-\nchannel customer experience, a strong demand \nfor almost tailored-made and personalised \nproducts and services, and the rise of cloud \ncomputing, although there are certainly other \nfactors behind this trend.\n\nFigure 2-20 Visual representation of the trends shaping consumer-centric \nbehaviour\n\nAnalytics\nrevolution\n\nSocial to share, \nto know and to \n\nco-create\n\nMulti-channel\ncustomer\n\nexperience \n\nHigh demand\nfor\n\ncustomisation \n\nDigital evolution\n\nCloud computing \n\nConsumer-centricity\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource:  DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit, adapted from Accenture \nhttps://insuranceblog.accenture.com/the-customer-centric-insurer-how-digital-is-creating-a-more-uncertain-competitive-landscape\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-20.xlsx\n\nhttps://insuranceblog. accenture.com/the-customer-centric-insurer-how-digital-is-creating-a-more-unc\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter2/figure-2-20.xlsx\n\n\n88\n\nConsumers are also increasingly putting \npressure on companies to become more \nenvironmentally friendly, with millennials \nleading this push for change in organisa-\ntions.

Conclusions  \n\n9 For more information please visit https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/content/european-digital-strategy\n10 See for instance Brynjolfsson and Collis (2019), \u2018How Should We Measure the Digital Economy?\u2019.\n11 https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/company-tax/fair-taxation-digital-economy_en\n\nDigitalisation has deeply transformed our \neconomies and societies. In the digital age, the \nadoption of technologies is happening at an \nunprecedented speed due to the rise of digital \ninnovations combined with strong network \neffects. In this context, fostering the uptake \nand diffusion of digital skills, competences \nand practices across individuals, companies, \nregions and countries is paramount. At the EU \nlevel, the expected Updated Skills Agenda for \nEurope, and the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, \naim to tackle the digital skills gap. Furthermore, \npolicies must be faster to react to the changing \ncontexts.\n\nMoreover, digital technologies such as artificial \nintelligence are increasingly merging with the \nphysical world across a wide range of sectors, \nleading to a new wave of \u2018deep-tech innovation\u2019 \nthat has intrinsically different \u2018needs\u2019 to other types \nof innovation. In particular, deep-tech innovation \nis very science-based, multidisciplinary and \ncapital-intensive. The risk associated with these \ninnovations is also very high as they may take \nsome time to be market-ready (if ever), although \nthe private and social returns from a commercially \nviable and disruptive product may also be extremely \nhigh. As a result, these innovations require \u2018patient \ncapital\u2019, multidisciplinary teams, R&D labs, and well-\nconnected innovation hubs, among other factors. \nWithin Horizon Europe, the European Council will \nsupport breakthrough, deep-tech innovators.\n\nIndustry concentration is also on the rise, \nalthough the phenomenon is more prevalent \nin North America than in Europe. Similarly, \nincreasing concentration is also visible in \nterms of R&D investments and outputs \nsuch as sales, whereby most of the benefits \nare concentrated in a small group of \u2018superstar\u2019 \nfirms. Furthermore, some of the technologies \n\nunderpinning digitalisation, such as cloud \ninfrastructure, appear to be concentrated in \na few US tech giants. This calls, for instance, for \ncompetition policies that are 'fit for the digital age\u2019. \n\nAccess to data is also increasingly seen \nas a competitive advantage to thrive \nin the digital era and gain market shares, \nespecially at a time when innovation is more \nand more \u2018customer-centric\u2019 and enabling \nproduct differentiation. However, access to data \nshould be in line with principles and regulations \nregarding privacy and the ethical use of data. In \nthe EU, the General Data Protection Regulation \n(GDPR) provides guidance on the fair use of data. \nMoreover, the European Data Strategy will make \nmore data available for use in the economy and \nsociety, while keeping those who generate the \ndata in control. It will ensure that European rules, \nin particular privacy and data protection, as well \nas competition law, are fully respected. The EU will \ncreate a single market for data where \u20ac4-6 billion \nwill be invested in total in common European \ndata spaces and a European federation of cloud \ninfrastructure and services9.\n\nMeasuring the digital economy to understand \nits impacts is key. For instance, new studies argue \nthat the digital economy has been underestimated \nin traditional measures such as gross domestic \nproduct, or that consumers\u2019 welfare linked to \ndigital innovations is also not being duly accounted \nfor10. In a global and digital economy, interna-\ntional tax rules need to be rethought as they \n'do not capture business models that can make \nprofit from digital services in a country without \nbeing physically present', nor do they account for \nthe new ways in which profits are created including \n'the role that users play in generating value for \ndigital companies'.11\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/content/european-digital-strategy\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/company-tax/fair-taxation-digital-economy_en\n\n\n90\n\n8.

Productivity, competitiveness and innovation are \nclosely related\n\nHigher productivity means stronger \ncompetitiveness, which is crucial for EU \ncompanies in a globalised economy. This is \neven more true as the EU risks gradually losing \nits competitiveness, with slow innovation, \nadoption of technologies and productivity \ngrowth in a context where technology is \nchanging fast and new global players are \nemerging rapidly (European Investment \nBank, 2019). Higher productivity will also be \nessential in the future in the light of ageing \nsocieties to compensate for a declining share \nof the workforce in the population. In this \ncontext, productivity will be a key determinant \nof Europe\u2019s future prosperity. \n\nCompetitiveness, productivity and innov-\nation are separate concepts but are very \nclosely interrelated. In the global context, \nit would be a mistake to ignore the fact that \ninnovation can drive the EU\u2019s competitiveness \nthrough productivity growth. Spurring innovation \nhas a direct effect on what is produced, making \ngoods better and cheaper whilst also ensuring \nthat the production process is efficient. This \nimprovement in the ratio of production output \nto input is referred to as productivity. Hence, \nit is a measure of efficiency. Enterprises are \ncompetitive when their productivity grows \nconsistently and enables them to reduce \nthe unit costs of their outputs. In turn, if this \nhappens in traded sectors it can allow EU \ncompanies to compete on global markets \nwithout relying on government support. \n\nProductivity growth and sustainability \ncan reinforce each other. Productivity can \nalso help overcome the trade-off between \nenvironmental policy and long-term growth \nwhen coupled with appropriate action, such \nas investment in pollution abatement (Basu \nand Jamasb, 2019). Boosting productivity \n\ngrowth needs refocusing the use of available \nresources and investments on more efficient \nproduction activities and systems, which \nmust also be environmentally friendly in \norder to ensure a sustainable growth path \n(Kalff et al., 2019). Hence, increasing the \nefficiency of the production process can be \ncompatible with sustainable production and \nsupport the sustainable transition. This raises \nthe issue of ensuring a proper decoupling \nbetween economic activity and the negative \nexternalities related to the production process. \nR&I can play a key role here. Productivity gains, \nand the related economic benefits in terms \nof value added and jobs, can also be directly \ngenerated by more competitive sustainable \nactivities. For example, in Europe, the value \nadded and employment of the environmental \nsector has increased rapidly compared to the \nrest of the economy, together with a steady \nincrease in labour productivity (Box 3.1-1). \nThe International Labour Organization (2018) \nshows an overall positive employment impact \nfrom the action taken in the energy transport \nand construction sectors to limit global warming \nto 2 \u00b0C. By 2030, the estimated job creation, \ndriven by the high demand for labour from \nrenewable energy sources, is around 18 million \njobs globally. Under the same logic, it can be \nshown that the stringency of environmental \npolicies is accompanied by higher levels of \neco-innovation and economic competitiveness \n(European Environment Agency, 2020).\n\n\n\n96\n\nFigure 3.1-1 Sectors most affected by the transition to sustainability \nin the energy sector (in million jobs)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: ILO (2018).

The trend reveals that \nthe EU has embarked on a sustainable \ndevelopment path, with a steady increase \nin the weight of the \u2018environmental sector\u2019 \nin terms of both employment and gross \nvalue added, as well as productivity. \nIndeed, these activities are growing faster than \nthe overall economy, with a steady and positive \ntrend being in place since 2001.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter31/figure-31-1.xlsx\n\n\n97\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nFigure 3.1-2 Growth of the environmental sector in the EU28(1), 2001-2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat  \n(online data code: env_ac_egss2 and env_ac_egss1)\nNote: Data are normalised to 100 in 2001. \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter31/figure-31-2.xlsx\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nVa\nlu\n\ne \nad\n\nde\nd \n\nan\nd \n\nem\npl\n\noy\nm\n\nen\nt \n\nin\nde\n\nx \n(2\n\n00\n1 \n\n= \n10\n\n0)\n\nEnvironmental value added Total value added\n\nEnvironmental employment Total employment\n\nFurthermore, productivity growth brings \nbenefits to consumers through higher wages \nfor workers. At the same time, businesses \nbecome more profitable, which also benefits \ninvestment and jobs. The question is to what \nextent these (technological/digital) productivity \ngains benefit society as a whole and what share \nis captured by a small number of dominant firms. \nThis deserves further investigation, although \nthe dominant market power of a few extremely \nproductive large players could raise distributional \nquestions (ILO, 2018).  \n\nR&I is crucial for the EU\u2019s productivity. \nFor a long time, economic theory has \nhighlighted the role of technical progress in \nproductivity growth and the key role innovation \nsystems play in this (Solow, 1957; Romer, \n1986; Romer, 1990). Innovation has two roles \nin stimulating productivity (Hall, 2011). First, \n\nR&I can increase firms\u2019 efficiency through \nprocess innovation and improve the goods and \nservices they produce. This raises their demand \nand reduces production costs. Second, firms \nthat innovate are also likely to grow more, \nand new entrants with better products should \ndisplace existing inefficient firms. Overall, \nthis contributes to increasing aggregate \nproductivity: new ideas help to generate \ngreater (or the same) output with the same (or \nless) input, for both companies and the whole \neconomy. This, in turn, should positively affect \nwages and business profitability. Similarly, once \na new technology is produced, its diffusion \nthroughout the economy is a key productivity \ndriver: higher adoption rates reduce the gap \nbetween leaders and laggard companies \n(and regions) and eventually positively affect \naggregate performance (Andrews et al., 2016; \nAnzoategui et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n98\n\nBOX 3.1-2 Investments in intangible assets, innovation \nand productivity performance\nCincera, M.

(2017), Capitalism without capital: The rise of the intangible economy, Princeton, NJ: Princeton \nUniversity Press. \n\nInvestment in intangible assets has increased \nrapidly over the past few decades, mainly driven \nby changes in industrial market structure, with \nseveral important implications for how firms \noperate1. While the manufacturing sector is \nbecoming more oriented towards services and \ncustomers, an increasing number of tasks in the \nservices sector are automated thanks to artificial \nintelligence and robotisation. In this context, \ninformation and communications technologies \n(ICT) affect firms\u2019 organisational structure and \ncommercial strategies by providing them with \nnew ways of selling products and services (e.g. \ne-commerce) or giving fast and easy access \nto data (e.g., information about customers). \nTechnological change is also affecting the \nstructure of the labour market, creating a need \nfor new jobs in the ICT sector and changes in the \ndemand for workers\u2019 skills. \n\nEU firms are facing new challenges.

Recent evidence also suggests that \nthe decline in R&D and adoption investments \n\n2 Growth accounting is a standard approach to estimating the contribution of capital, R&D and other intangible (and tangible) \ncomponents to labour productivity growth, following the seminal work by Solow (1957). TFP is usually considered as the \nproxy of technological change, while different specifications of the estimation model allow the role of specific factors to be \ntraced back, such as, for instance, ICT capital, R&D, economic competences, etc. The search for the contribution by intangi-\nbles has increased in recent years due to the increasing availability of reliable data.\n\ncontribute to explaining the productivity slowdown \npreceding the last economic crisis and in its \naftermath, respectively (Anzoategui et al., 2019). \nTo quantify the contribution of R&I and intangible \ninvestments to productivity and economic growth, \nthe most notable findings suggest that2:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Before the crisis, almost two thirds of \neconomic growth in Europe from 1995 \nto 2007 were derived from R&I, broadly \ndefined as TFP and intangible investments, \nincluding R&D, as reported in Figure 3.1-5 \n(Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013).\n\nFigure 3.1-5 Contribution to European economic growth \u2013  \npercentage per annum (1995-2007)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Bravo-Biosca et al.

Unlike \n\nthe precrisis estimates by Bravo-Biosca et \nal. (2013), the contribution of R&I declined \nslightly due to the significant increase in the \nrole of hours worked, which had been rather \nminimal in the previous period.  \n\n\u00dd\u00dd  R&I contributed to nearly two thirds of \nlabour productivity growth in Europe \nfrom 2010 to 2016. If the focus is on labour \nproductivity growth, then the contribution \nof R&I, as defined above, is equal to about \n65.7 % of total productivity growth, signalling \n\nits key role as productive-enhancing \ninvestments even in the aftermath of the \ncrisis.

While R&D has been and continues \nto be a relevant factor for economic and \nproductivity growth, economic competences \nand intellectual property products (including \ndesign) have become key drivers of growth \nacross the globe, including in the EU. It is \nworth noting the decline over time of the \ncontribution of ICT capital (Figure 3.1-8).\n\n3 It should be noted that a 10 % increase in R&D investment corresponds to a 0.2 % increase in GDP terms (i.e. R&D invest-\nment over GDP). This implies that, assuming no change in the number of hours worked, an increase in R&D investment of \n0.2 % of GDP would result in an increase of 1.1 % of GDP, five times larger.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd An increase in 10 % in R&D investment is \nassociated with gains in productivity between \n1.1 % and 1.4 %, as shown in the meta-\nanalysis by Donselaar and Koopmans (2016)3.\n\nFigure 3.1-7 Contribution to European labour productivity growth \u2013  \npercentage per annum (2010-2016)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on EU KLEMS 2019 (Analytical Database)\nNote: Data covers 19 EU Member States: BE, CZ, DE, DK, EE, ES, FR, IT, LV, LT, LU, HU, NL, AT, RO, SI, SK, FI and SE.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter31/figure-31-7.xlsx\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nLabour composition\nchange\n\nTangible\ncapital\n\nR&D and other\nintangibles\n\nTFP Total\n\nInnovation:\n65.7 % of productivity growth\n\nAv\ner\n\nag\ne \n\nan\nnu\n\nal\n g\n\nro\nw\n\nth\n r\n\nat\ne\n\n\n\n103\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nFigure 3.1-8 Contribution of ICT capital and intangible to value added \nand productivity growth\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n19\n95\n\n-1\n99\n\n9\n\n20\n00\n\n-2\n00\n\n6\n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n00\n\n9\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n7\n\n(1) EU-15 (2) EU-CEEC\n\n(3) Japan (4)  United States\n\nValue Added\nLP per\n\npers. empl.\nLP per\n\nhours worked\n\nValue Added\nLP per\n\npers. empl.\nLP per\n\nhours worked\n\nValue Added\nLP per\n\npers. empl.\nLP per\n\nhours worked\n\nValue Added\nLP per\n\npers. empl.\nLP per\n\nhours worked\n\nICT So\ufffdDB RD OlnnProp EconComp\n\nG\nro\n\nw\nth\n\n c\non\n\ntr\nib\n\nut\nio\n\nns\n %\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nBOX 3.1-3 Total factor productivity and \nlabour productivity\n\nLabour productivity measures the \namount of value added produced per work \nhour and is very often considered to be \na good measure of the economy\u2019s overall \nefficiency.

Productivity slowdown: a productivity paradox\n\n4 Source: DG Regio.\n5 Except for Ireland, although productivity growth levels in Ireland should be analysed with caution due to a statistical break \n\nfollowing a revision in the calculation of GDP that led to a GDP growth rate of 26 % in 2015.\n\nDespite the rise in digital technologies \nover the last decade, promising large \nproductivity gains, productivity growth \nhas been sluggish, holding back more \nrobust economic growth in Europe and other \nadvanced economies. This is referred to as \na productivity paradox which flags long-\nterm risks for the competitiveness of European \neconomies. The rise in digital technologies and \ntheir convergence with the physical world, in \nwhat some have called the Fourth Industrial \nRevolution, is transforming our economies and \nsocieties. Automation, big data, the Internet of \nThings and artificial intelligence are all digital \ntechnologies that are coming of age, promising \nnew and more efficient business processes \nand products, which would bring significant \ngains in productivity growth in our economy. \nHowever, economic growth in Europe, and in \nother advanced economies, has been held back \nby very low levels of productivity growth that \nhave remained almost flat for over a decade. \n\nWhile the slowdown is also true in other \nmajor economies, over the last decade, \nproductivity growth in the EU has been \nparticularly poor compared to global \ncompetitors (Figure 3.1-10). From 2008-\n2018, TFP growth in the EU was less than half \nwhat it was over the period 1995-2007. While \nit was also low in other advanced economies, \nsuch as the United States and Japan, which \n\nonly managed growth rates below 1 %, \nthe slowdown in productivity growth was \nparticularly acute in the EU. Labour productivity \ngrowth rates in the EU also tend to decline over \ntime. While labour productivity per working \nhour in the EU increased on average by 2.1 % \n(1.9 % per worker) per year in the period 1995-\n2000, in the decade 2000-2010 this fell to \n1.2 % (0.9 %) per year then decelerated further \nto 1.0 % (0.8 %) from 2010 to 20184. Box 3.1-4 \nexplores TFP dynamics at the sectoral level for \na few Member States.\n\nThis productivity slowdown is also observed \nsystematically at Member-State level5 \n(Figure 3.1-11). Over the last decade, low EU \ngrowth was mainly driven by declines in Greece, \nLuxembourg and other Member States with \nvalues close to -1 %.

As such, TFP is thus a fundamental \ndriver of global productivity and is linked to \ntechnological progress in an economy. Figure \n3.1-13 shows the evolution of TFP over the \npost-crisis period (2010-2017) for the EU196 \nand a number of reference countries and \nacross three aggregate sectors: manufacturing, \nmarket services7 and non-market services8.\n\nIt appears that, on average for EU19 countries, \nTFP has known divergent evolutions across \nthese 3 macro-sectors: while it increased \nsteadily in the manufacturing industries (+9 %), \nits progression was more moderate in market \nservices (+4 %) and even declined slightly in \nnon-market services (-1 %).\n\nWith respect to these averages, individual \ncountries have evolved differently and \na variety of trends can be observed. In the \nmanufacturing sector, TFP growth has proved \nparticularly vigorous in Belgium but rather \nsluggish in France and Italy. Germany, the \nNetherlands and Austria have remained \nclose to the EU19 average. On the contrary, \nGermany and the Netherlands have performed \nparticularly well in the market-services sector \nwhile France, Belgium and Italy have stagnated \nand have proved to be the worst-performing \neconomies in our sample. Concerning the non-\nmarket-services sector, countries\u2019 performance \nis even more adverse, in particular for Italy \nand Austria (-2 %), Belgium (-3 %) and more \nspectacularly Spain (-7 %). Conversely, TFP \nin Germany, France and the Netherlands has \nincreased by 1 to 1.5 % over the same period \nin non-market services.\n\nFigure 3.1-13 Total factor productivity by sector and selected EU countries, 2010-2017\n\n98\n\n99\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\n105\n\n106\n\n107\n\n108\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nManufacturing\n\n95\n\n100\n\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nMarket services\n\n92\n\n94\n\n96\n\n98\n\n100\n\n102\n\n104\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nNon-market services\n\nItaly\n\nSpain\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nEU-19\n\n\n\n109\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\n98\n\n99\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\n105\n\n106\n\n107\n\n108\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nManufacturing\n\n95\n\n100\n\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nMarket services\n\n92\n\n94\n\n96\n\n98\n\n100\n\n102\n\n104\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nNon-market services\n\nItaly\n\nSpain\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nEU-19\n\n98\n\n99\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\n105\n\n106\n\n107\n\n108\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nManufacturing\n\n95\n\n100\n\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nMarket services\n\n92\n\n94\n\n96\n\n98\n\n100\n\n102\n\n104\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nNon-market services\n\nItaly\n\nSpain\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nEU-19\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 own computations based on EUKLEMS, 2019 release\nNote: TFP is set at 100 in 2010.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter31/figure-31-13.xlsx\n\n\n\n110\n\n3.  A growing productivity gap and a lack \ninnovation diffusion\n\nThe productivity paradox points to \ndeep changes in innovation dynamics. \nThese changes relate to the rise of several \nbreakthrough innovations led by new \nglobal technological champions that \nare creating and shaping entirely new \nmarkets. However, they are also linked to the \nslowdown in innovation diffusion, which is \nholding back a stronger uptake of innovations \nacross companies, sectors and regions. The \nconvergence of digital technologies with the \nphysical world has enabled the rise of many \nimportant breakthrough innovations. At the \nsame time, it has rendered the innovation \nprocess more complex as companies need \nto master different technologies and new \nbusiness models. This, coupled with the rise \nin network effects, has led to a slowdown in \ninnovation diffusion across firms, regions and \nsectors, preventing the benefits of innovation \nfrom being disseminated fully across the \neconomy.\n\nThis slowdown in innovation diffusion has \nbeen observed since the beginning of the \n2000s. A small number of leading firms (in \nparticular, platform-economy companies, see \nBox 3.1-5) have championed strong productivity \ngrowth rates, while a \u2018fat tail\u2019 of laggard firms \nhave depicted disappointing productivity \ngrowth rates that translate into low aggregate \nproductivity growth. These differences are found \nacross sectors, although there are some intra-\nsectoral differences, notably with lower overall \ngrowth rates in the business service sector. This \nwidening of the productivity gap may explain why \na rapid technological change and productivity \nslowdown can be observed at the same time. This \nhas strong implications not only for productivity \ngrowth but also for rising inequality patterns. \nWage inequality has increased both within \nand between firms, suggesting that increasing \nbetween-firm inequality does not simply reflect \nthe flow of similar workers into similar firms but \nthat the ones at the top of the wage distribution \nare seeing even higher rewards (OECD, 2019). \n\nFigure 3.1-14 Labour productivity gap between global frontier firms and \nother firms, 2001-2013\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013\n\nFrontier firms (top 5%) Laggards\n\nAv\ner\n\nag\ne \n\nof\n lo\n\ng \nla\n\nbo\nur\n\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n\niv\nit\n\ny\n\nAv\ner\n\nag\ne \n\nof\n lo\n\ng \nla\n\nbo\nur\n\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n\niv\nit\n\ny\n\nManufacturing Services\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Andrews et al.

Evidence shows \nthat, between 2000 and 2014, three quarters \nof European industries saw a concentration \nincrease in market performance in the order \nof 4 percentage points for the average European \nindustry (Bajgar et al., 2019). \n\nIn parallel, as a result of persisting \nrigidities that affect the well-functioning \nof the markets, \u2018zombie\u2019 firms9 continue \nto \u2018capture\u2019 capital and labour resources \nthat could otherwise be redirected towards \ninnovative, more productive activities, thereby \nhindering Europe\u2019s innovation performance (see \nalso Chapter 3.3 - Business Dynamics and its \ncontribution to structural change and productivity \ngrowth). The misallocation of resources, including \n\n9 Zombie firms are defined as those companies with a low ratio of operating income to interest expenses (less than one third \nfor three consecutive years in McGowan et al., 2017), suggesting that they do not make enough profit to pay debt obliga-\ntions on bank loans.\n\ncredit, barriers to entry and inefficient product \nand labour markets ease the survival of less-\nproductive firms which would otherwise have \nexited the market. Consequently, the economy \nis characterised by a wider distribution of \nproductivity among firms, with a larger gap \nbetween the laggards and the most-productive \ncompanies. This also means that a more efficient \nallocation of resources across companies, \nallowing less productive firms to exit and \nproductive firms to grow, would enable significant \ngrowth.\n\nInequalities between firms are also driven \nby sectoral dynamics, with the uptake \nof digital technologies over the past \ntwo decades varying significantly across \ndifferent sectors of the economy. Some \nsectors have benefited more from the uptake of \nadvanced digital technologies and have adapted \ntheir products, services and business models \naccordingly. On the other hand, other sectors \nseem to have lagged behind. These disparities \ncould be broadened with the rising applications \nof artificial intelligence. Promising developments \nin artificial intelligence can go far beyond labour \n\nBOX 3.1-5 The rise of platform-economy companies\n\nIn the past two decades or so, digital \ntechnologies have enabled some of \nthe most impressive breakthrough \ninnovations in our economy, which \nhave revolutionised entire industries \nand markets. The rise of the so-called \nplatform-economy companies, such as \nAlphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, \nUber or Netflix, has deeply transformed \nhow we search for things, communicate \nwith each other, buy products, move \n\nwithin cities or consume entertainment. \nMany of these firms have been able \nto grow at an unprecedented pace to \nbecome global economic behemoths by \nmarket capitalisation, transforming entire \nindustries and markets. At the same time, \nthese companies do not seem to improve \nthe quality of employment as they tend \nto offer less-stable contracts and fewer \nprospectives for career development \n(EPSC, 2019).\n\n\n\n112\n\nBOX 3.1-6 Chapter 10 \u2013 The bottom also matters: \npolicies for productivity catch-up in the digital economy\nThis chapter provides an overview of recent and \nongoing analysis of these issues and discusses \npolicies that affect the catch-up of laggards \nin the context of digital transformation.\n\nFirst, the chapter introduces productivity \ndivergence in the context of the global \nphenomenon linked to digital transformation \nand the knowledge economy. Then, it examines \ntrends in productivity divergence and \nbusiness dynamism, respectively, with \na focus on the bottom of the productivity \ndistribution.  Beyond common trends, a few \n\nexamples highlight cross-country and cross-\nsector heterogeneity. The descriptive sections \nconclude with company and sector characteristics \nand discussions about the possible explanations \nbehind the documented trends at the bottom, \nincluding the role of openness. \n\nThe final analytical section provides a framework \nand summarises the main results of the analysis \non the role of policies on the speed of \nlaggards catching up. \n\nRead more in Chapter 10.\n\nFigure 3.1-15 Average productivity by performance group relative to the \n'typical firms' group multifactor productivity\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 own computations based on the EIB Investment Survey (EIBIS waves 2016 to 2018) \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter31/figure-31-15.xlsx\n\nAv\ner\n\nag\ne \n\nM\nul\n\nti\nfa\n\nct\nor\n\n P\nro\n\ndu\nct\n\niv\nit\n\ny\n\nBottom\nperformers\n\nLow\nperformers Typical firms\n\nHigh\nperformers\n\nTop\nperformers\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\nLaggards\n\n0-10\npercentile\n\n10-40\npercentile\n\n40-60\npercentile\n\n60-90\npercentile\n\n90-100\npercentile\n\n\n\n113\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nautomation with impacts on business models \nand innovation activity. The differences observed \nbetween firms with strong digital capability \nand a well-designed AI adoption strategy could \nreinforce the differences in uptake, enabling these \ncompanies to raise profit margins or increase the \nefficiency of their R&D operations. Overcoming \nthat gap requires, among others, policies to \nimprove the conditions to speed up knowledge \ncreation and diffusion via more investments \nin intangible assets and skills, and innovation-\nfriendly regulation that supports transformative \ntechnological change across sectors.\n\nEnsuring the EU\u2019s competitiveness and \nprosperity will require a boost in product-\nivity. The gap in productivity performance \n between highly productive firms at the frontier \n\nand the rest points to a clear lack of innovation \ndiffusion in Europe. As Member States approach \nhigher levels of prosperity, the adoption of an \ninnovation-based model is crucial to avoid the \nmiddle-income trap that this lack of diffusion can \nexacerbate, especially for Member States in the \nCESEE. Overcoming that gap requires policies to \nimprove the conditions to speed up knowledge \ncreation and diffusion via increased investments \nin intangible assets and skills, innovation-friendly \nregulation that supports transformative techno-\nlogical change across sectors, stronger sci-\nence-business links, adequate conditions for the \ncreation, scaleup and orderly exit of firms, access \nto risk capital, and efforts to raise the capacity \nand quality of national research and innovation \nsystems.\n\n\n\n114\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nR&I are key engines for Europe\u2019s productivity \ngrowth, driving long-term competitiveness \nand economic performance. Innovative \ninvestments make the production process \nmore efficient and improve produced goods \nand services. Provided supportive framework \nconditions are in place, innovative companies can \nflourish and the process of creative destruction \nwill make room for new entrants with better \nproducts, displacing existing inefficient and less-\ninnovative companies.\n\nAfter the last economic crisis, from 2010 \nto 2016, nearly two thirds of labour \nproductivity growth in Europe derived \nfrom R&I, broadly defined. The contribution \nof different intangible investments has \nchanged over time, reflecting the evolving \ninnovation dynamics, including the increasing \nrole of digitisation and AI and the rise of \nglobal technological champions creating and \nshaping entire markets. In particular, economic \ncompetences and intellectual property products \nhave emerged as key intangible assets, \ntogether with R&D, software and databases.\n\nIn this context, the increasing concen-\ntration of R&I activities highlights the \nneed to foster the diffusion of innovation \ncreation and its uptake in order to spread \nthe benefits across countries, regions and \ncompanies. This is particularly important for \neconomies in the southern periphery of the EU, \nwhich have been unable to keep pace with the \ninnovation leaders, and for the CESEE countries \nin order to ensure a continued (and sustainable) \ngrowth model in the long term. Innovation \ndiffusion and knowledge absorption are also \ncrucial to close the gap between a few leading \ntop companies and the rest.\n\nProductivity growth can and needs \nto drive the sustainability transition. \nAs productivity growth entails more (equal) \noutput with the same (fewer) resources, such \nan improvement in the efficiency of production \nsystems is necessary to reduce the impact \nof production on the planetary boundaries. \nSimilarly, innovation diffusion and its uptake \ncan ensure that the benefits of productivity \ngrowth are widespread across companies, \nsectors and places, contributing to meeting the \nsocial dimension of the sustainability transition.\n\n\n\n115\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\n5.

In particular, some countries have \n\nbeen moving away from medium-high-\ntech and high-tech manufacturing while \nthe catching up by others (most notably \nthe central, eastern and south-eastern \nEurope - CESEE economies) is driven by \ngreater specialisation in medium-high-tech \nmanufacturing.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Differences in productivity performance \nalso exist within sectors and contribute to \nexplain the productivity gap between the EU \nand the United States.\n\n What does it mean for policy?\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Mobilise national and European resour-\nces towards knowledge-intensive acti-\nvities as a lever to increase Europe\u2019s ability \nto invest in R&I and its productivity prospects.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd An EU industrial strategy is key to \ncounter the deindustrialisation trends in \nthe EU and to increase long-term EU \ncompetitiveness while meeting the \nneed for a transition towards a climate-\nneutral and sustainable economy.\n\n\n\n119\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nWhile R&D is the engine of long-term \nproductivity growth, the capacity of an \neconomy to invest in R&D is shaped by \nits economic structure. Europe is slowly \nemerging from a period of sluggish economic \ngrowth since the aftermath of the last economic \ncrisis. While high heterogeneity can be observed \nacross Member States and their regions, low \nor null productivity growth has been identified \nas one of the key causes behind the weak \neconomic performance, which is a challenge \nEurope must face in order to achieve greater \nand widespread prosperity. As acknowledged in \nthe economic literature and described previously \n(see Chapter 3.1 - Productivity puzzle and \ninnovation diffusion), investments in knowledge \nand innovation, measured most notably by \nR&D expenditure, are a fundamental lever to \nimprove the competitiveness of an economy \nand its capacity to create value. However, while \nin general terms higher investments in R&D \nincrease the innovation potential of economies \nand their productivity, several factors affect the \n\nproduction of knowledge and its diffusion. This \nchapter and Chapter 3.3 explore two of them, \ndefined as structural as they determine \u2013 ceteris \nparibus \u2013 the overall capacity of an economic \nsystem to innovate and invest in R&D. These two \nelements are: i) the structural composition of an \neconomy and its change; and ii) the dynamism \nof the business sector. As will be shown below, \nknowledge-intensive sectors are \u2018naturally\u2019 \ncharacterised by higher R&D intensity and they \ntend to innovate more. Therefore, economies \nspecialising in knowledge-intensive activities \nexperience the highest levels of productivity \nand the largest productivity growth. This will \nbe the subject of this chapter. Furthermore, \ninnovative companies are more likely to emerge \nin countries where the business environment is \nmore dynamic, i.e. where there is a larger share \nof new companies entering the markets, as they \ncontribute to boosting competition, introducing \nnew business models and upgrading the \neconomic structure. This topic will be analysed \nin Chapter 3.3.\n\n1.  Economic structure shapes economies\u2019 R&D \nintensity and labour productivity \n\nCountries that have been able to \nchange the structure of their economy \nby increasing their specialisation in \nknowledge-intensive sectors will become \nmore productive, leading to greater \nprosperity in the long term. This section \nanalyses the economic structure of the EU \nand its Member States and investigates its \ndynamics in recent years. The focus is on those \nsectors characterised by a higher intensity of \nresearch and innovation activities as they are \nthe main drivers of productivity gains and are \nof fundamental importance for innovation \nand greater levels of prosperity.  \n\nTo measure the degree of knowledge across \ndifferent sectors, the analysis makes use of \nR&D intensity, i.e. the share of R&D investment \nin a sector\u2019s total value added. Being the most-\nused indicator, it is easily comparable across \ndifferent countries and is a reasonable proxy \nfor knowledge and innovation creation. Hence, \nthe analysis below will use and compare four \nmain knowledge-intensive macro-sectors: \nhigh-tech manufacturing, medium-high-tech \nmanufacturing, high-tech knowledge-intensive \nservices and (non-high-tech) knowledge-\nintensive services. Here, these four macro-\nsectors are referred to as knowledge-intensive \nactivities or sectors.\n\n\n\n120\n\nBOX 3.2-1 Classification of manufacturing industries and \nknowledge-intensive services\n\n1 See https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5902521/KS-RA-07-015-EN.PDF\n\nThe definition of manufacturing industries \nand knowledge-intensive services follows \nthe aggregation by Eurostat according to \ntechnological intensity and based on NACE \nRev.21. Beyond the four knowledge-intensive \nmacro-sectors, the remaining activities are used \nfor the analysis later in this chapter and the \ncorresponding classification is presented below.\n\nHigh-tech manufacturing includes the \nmanufacture of: basic pharmaceutical products \nand pharmaceutical preparations (C21) and of \ncomputer, electronic and optical products (C26).\n\nMedium-high-tech manufacturing includes the \nmanufacture of: chemicals and chemical products \n(C20), electrical equipment (C27), machinery and \nequipment (C28), motor vehicles, trailers and \nsemi-trailers (C29), and the manufacture of \nother transport equipment (C30).\n\nMedium-low-tech manufacturing includes \nboth the medium-low and the low-technology \nmanufacturing industries. These include the \nmanufacture of: coke and refined petroleum \nproducts (C19), rubber and plastic products \n(C22), other non-metallic mineral products \n(C23), basic metals (C24), fabricated metal \nproducts, except machinery and equipment \n(C25), the repair and installation of machinery \nand equipment (C33), the manufacture of \nfood products (C20, beverages (C11), tobacco \nproducts (C12), textiles (C13), wearing apparel \n(C14), leather and related products (C15), wood \nand wood and cork products except furniture, \narticles of straw and plaiting materials (C16), \npaper and paper products (C17), the printing \nand reproduction of recorder media (C18), \nthe manufacture of furniture (C31) and other \nmanufacturing (C32).\n\nKnowledge-intensive services  include water \ntransport (H50), air transport (H51), information \nand communication (J), financial and insurance \nactivities (K), professional, scientific and \ntechnical activities (M), employment activities \n(N78), public administration and defence, \ncompulsory social security (O), education (P), \nhuman health and social work activities (Q), \nand arts, entertainment and recreation (R). They \ndo not include services with high technological \ncontent which are classified separately as \nhigh-tech knowledge-intensive services. \n\nHigh-tech knowledge-intensive services include \nmotion picture, video and television programme \nproduction, sound recording and music publishing \nactivities (59), programming and broadcasting \nactivities (60), telecommunications (61), \ncomputer programming, consultancy and \nrelated activities (62), information service \nactivities (63), and scientific research and \ndevelopment (72).\n\nOther services include services not belonging to \nany of the above categories (including G, I, L, \nS, T and U).\n\nAgriculture, hunting and forestry, mining and \nquarry (B) and construction (F) are classified as \nRest of the economy.\n\n\n\n121\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nThe structural composition of the EU\u2019s \neconomies is a key factor in explaining \nwhy most Member States fall short in \nreaching high R&D intensity, with most \nof them remaining below 3 %. The Lisbon \nAgenda sets the R&D intensity target for the \nEU at 3 %. However, only a few Member States \nhave met this target, while the EU as a whole \nis a long way off and will not be able to meet \nit by 2020 (see Chapter 5.1 - Investment in \nR&D). Countries more specialised in knowledge-\n\n2 A similar graph can be produced using value-added shares. Employment shares are used to be consistent with the analysis \nin the rest of this chapter.\n\nintensive sectors tend to be characterised by \nhigher R&D intensity, driven by larger shares \nof R&D over value added in the business sector \n(BERD). Indeed, activities belonging to high-tech \nand medium-high-tech manufacturing and high-\ntech and the other knowledge-intensive services \nare intrinsically more innovative and require \nmore resources to be invested in intangible \nassets.

Figure 3.2-1 shows that the EU, like \nany modern economy, is characterised by the \npredominance of services, representing more \nthan 70 % of total activities. In particular, \nknowledge-intensive services have a weight \nof more than 40 % and constitute the main \nbulk of employment shares in the EU. When \nconsidering high-tech knowledge-intensive \nservices only, their share is around 3 % of total \nemployment, even though, as for high-tech \nmanufacturing, they are characterised by the \nhighest productivity levels, as shown below. \nThe economic structure of the EU is similar to \nthat of the United States, which have a smaller \nshare of medium-high-tech manufacturing and \na higher specialisation in knowledge-intensive \nservices. It is worth noting that South Korea \nstands out among the peer countries for high-\ntech and medium-high-tech manufacturing, \nwith a significantly higher weight at 8.4 %.\n\nWithin Europe, significant heterogeneity \ncan be observed across the Member \nStates.  First, there are economies with \na fairly high share of knowledge-intensive \nsectors, above 50 %, and with the highest \nvalue (Belgium) falling slightly below 60 %. \nOn the other end of the distribution, there is \na group of countries recording a total below \n40 %, mainly due to significantly lower shares \nof knowledge-intensive services. This group \nmainly includes eastern European economies \nand countries from southern Europe, following \ndifferent paths over time. Indeed, the former \nare economies that are building their \nknowledge-based sectors, while the latter are \n\ncountries facing difficulties to upgrade their \neconomic structure, such as, for instance Italy, \nGreece and Portugal. Second, while Europe \ntends historically to be specialised in medium-\nhigh-tech manufacturing, there are a few \ncountries with relatively higher shares. These \nare mainly central, eastern and south-eastern \neconomies that have developed a large base in \nthese sectors in recent decades, most notably \nin the automobile sector, driven by the location \nof production from other countries, such as, for \nexample, from Germany. As will be shown below, \nthis process has mainly involved production, \nwhile R&D intensity has not increased that \nmuch. It should be noted that Germany, Austria \nand Italy are three countries with a significant \nand long-standing specialisation in medium-\nhigh-tech manufacturing.\n\nThe larger the weight of knowledge-\nintensive sectors, the higher the capacity \nto invest in R&D and innovate. Given the \nabove scenario, it is possible to investigate the \nrelationship between R&D intensity and the \nweight of knowledge-intensive sectors which \neventually determines how much an economy \ncan invest in R&I. Figure 3.2-2 plots business \nR&D intensity and the sum of the employment \nshares of medium-high-tech and high-tech \nmanufacturing and knowledge-intensive ser-\nvices. The private sector is the main performer \nin R&D investment, accounting for around 65 % \nof total R&D investment in the EU and 72 % \nin the United States. The figure reveals a clear \npositive relationship: countries with a larger \ntotal share of knowledge-intensive sectors are \nalso those with larger R&D intensities. Empirical \nevidence suggests that differences in structural \ncomposition do explain most of the EU-United \nStates business R&D gap, and that this is true \n\n\n\n123\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\neven when accounting for the role of company \nsize and the share of young innovative firms \nin the two economies (Cincera and Veugelers, \n2013). Among knowledge-intensive activities, \nhigh-tech and medium-high-tech manufacturing \nare key engines for R&D investments in the \nbusiness sector, as a relevant share occurs in \nindustry (European Commission, 2018; Coad and \nVezzani, 2017). It is interesting to observe that, \nwhile there is a positive correlation between the \nshare of knowledge-intensive manufacturing \n\nactivities and business R&D intensity, there are \na few exceptions (Figure 3.2-3). This is notably \nthe case in some CESEE economies, which \nhave the highest specialisation in knowledge-\nintensive manufacturing \u2013 especially in the \nmedium-high-tech sectors \u2013 but relatively lower \nR&D intensity. As mentioned above, this is due \nto the delocalisation of production from abroad \nwhich does not come with the relocation of R&D \nactivities (Correia et al., 2018).\n\nFigure 3.2-2 Business R&D intensity and sum of employment shares in \nknowledge intensive sectors, 2016(2)(3) \n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat \n(online data code: nama_10_a64_e) and OECD\nNotes: (1)Knowledge-intensive sectors include high-tech manufacturing, medium-high-tech manufacturing and knowledge-\nintensive services.

The high level of R&D intensity and \nthe larger innovation propensity in knowledge-\nintensive sectors are fundamental drivers of \nlabour productivity. New firms with innovative \nand more efficient business models or introducing \nbreakthrough innovations to the market tend to \ndevelop more easily in these sectors. Similarly, \nthey are more likely to adopt innovative products \nor processes due, for instance, to network effects \nand the technological proximity to those sectors \nwhere the original innovation was developed3. \n\n3 See, for instance, Xiao et al. (2018) on the concept of related variety for industrial diversification in Europe.\n4 In what follows, labour productivity is given by value added at constant prices (2010) over the number of workers.\n\nTherefore, it follows that there is significant \ncorrelation between economic performance and \nan economy\u2019s economic structure: higher shares \nof knowledge-intensive sectors in the economy \nbring higher productivity which, among others, is \na driver of prosperity in the medium-long term. \n\nThe most productive EU economies tend to \nhave a higher specialisation in knowledge-\nintensive sectors, while a significant gap \nbetween the EU and the United States \npersists, revealing an overall better \nperformance.

The graph \nreveals a positive relationship: labour productivity \nincreases with the weight of knowledge-intensive \nsectors in the economy. A group of leading EU \neconomies with productivity and specialisation \nin knowledge-intensive activities higher than \nthe EU average can be observed on the right \nof the graph. A large group of countries follow, \nwith employment shares and productivity levels \n(with the exception of Italy, Austria and Spain) \nbelow the EU average. Most countries lie around \nthe dashed line representing the average trend, \nwhile a few exceptions can be identified. First, \nIreland, with the highest labour productivity \nacross countries, is also significantly higher \nthan might be expected, given the share of \n\nknowledge-intensive sectors. While the data \nused in this chapter do not allow any conclusions \nto be drawn, this could be because Ireland is the \nEuropean hub of international companies with \nstrong innovation performance and generating \nhigh value added. Second, the United States is \nthe second most productive economy, having \nhigher labour productivity than countries with \na similar economic structure. The relevance of \nhigh-tech knowledge-intensive services and \nthe large numbers of unicorns, startups and \nmultinational giants at the innovation frontier \n\u2013 e.g. in the Internet of Things and the digital \neconomy \u2013 contribute to explain the United \nStates\u2019 good performance. It is also worth noting \nthat the United States experiences higher labour \nproductivity across all sectors in the economy (see \nFigure 3.2-5). Finally, mention should be made \n\n\n\n126\n\nof the group of CESEE economies previously \nhighlighted. While their R&D intensity is relatively \nlow compared to their economic structure, their \nlabour productivity seems consistent with the \nobserved trend, as suggested by the dashed \nline. While this corroborates that their growth \nmodel has paid off to date, previous analyses \nhave suggested a shift towards more R&D and \nthat intangible investment could be beneficial to \nsustain productivity growth and prosperity in the \nfuture (Correia et al., 2018).\n\nKnowledge-intensive activities are \nthe most productive sectors, although \ndifferences exist across countries. \nKnowledge-intensive sectors have the highest \nproductivity levels in the economy. However, \ndifferences in performance do exist, with \n\nsome sectors being more productive in some \ncountries compared to others. These within \nsector differentials depend on countries\u2019 \ncharacteristics, specific activities within sectors \nand other factors, including policy, and contribute \nto shaping overall total productivity and the \ndistribution of countries observed in Figure 3.2-\n4. Figure 3.2-5 compares labour productivity \nacross sectors in the EU and the United States. \nHigh-tech manufacturing is the most productive \nsector, significantly ahead of the others. High-\ntech knowledge-intensive services and medium-\nhigh-tech manufacturing come next, the former \nshowing productivity levels significantly higher \nthan the other services, including knowledge-\nintensive ones. Most importantly, the figure \nhighlights the productivity gap between the EU \nand the United States.

Furthermore, \ndifferences in terms of labour productivity also \nexist within the same sectors, as shown by the \ncomparison between the EU average and the \nUnited Sates. \n\nGiven the above scenario, it is interesting to \nsee how countries evolve over time: first, how \ntheir sectoral specialisation has changed, \ni.e. whether they have been moving towards \nactivities with higher knowledge intensity or \nthe opposite trend has been taking place. \nThis is usually defined as structural change. \nSecond, it is interesting to note the impact of \nthis transition on labour productivity dynamics. \nHas the change of economic structure had \na positive impact on labour productivity \ngrowth, i.e. is the EU experiencing a growth-\nenhancing structural change? What has been \nthe main driver of labour productivity growth \nin the EU since the 2000s? The analysis below \nfocuses on these questions.\n\n2.  The contribution of structural change to \nproductivity growth in the EU is limited\n\nThe economic structure of countries \nchanges slowly over time. To observe the \nsectoral dynamics and their direction, this \nsection takes a medium-term perspective \nby considering the period 2000-2016. \nFurthermore, a narrower time span is taken into \naccount to identify the structural trend in the \naftermath of the last economic crisis, focusing \non the years after 2008. While movements are \ngoing to be smaller in such a shorter period, \nthis allows for an analysis of how change \nhas taken place in the post-crisis period, as \nwell as seeing whether or not the trend has \nbeen affected by the recession. Figure 3.2-\n6 shows how structural change has affected \nknowledge-intensive sectors, reporting the \ncumulative growth rate in the period 2000-\n2016 for knowledge-intensive services (Panel \nA) and manufacturing (Panel B).\n\nOverall, a clear trend towards knowledge-\nintensive services can be observed for \nall countries. The increase in their share \n\naverages 16 % for the EU, higher than in the \nUnited States (9 %) but around half the shift \nnoted in the Japanese economy (32 %). The \nincrease is higher for high-tech knowledge-\nintensive services, at 22 % for the EU and 23 % \nfor Japan, while the growth rate is significantly \nlower (3.2 %) for the United States. \n\nHowever, this process is accompanied by \na transformation in the opposite direction \nin relation to manufacturing: employment \nshares declined for both high-tech and \nmedium-high-tech manufacturing activities. \nWhile the weight of the former decreased at \na faster pace than the latter, the lower initial \nvalues contribute to the larger variations, due \nto the potential impact of single shocks on the \noverall economy. Increased specialisation in \nservices, including those intensive in knowledge, \nis a common feature of modern economies. \nHowever, excessive deindustrialisation may have \nnegative consequences because of the relevance \nof industry for innovation and productivity \n\n\n\n128\n\nprospects. This is particularly true for the deep \ntransformation industry is currently undergoing, \nat the crossroads between the physical and \ndigital world, which is radically changing the \nway production takes place and business \nmodels work and change. The need to boost the \ncompetitiveness of the EU and its industry, while \nmeeting the requirements of social, environmental \nand economic sustainability, are among the key \npolicy challenges facing Europe today5.\n\nStructural change is also heterogeneous \nacross Member States. Whilst most \ncountries have experienced a fall in \ntheir employment shares in high-tech \nmanufacturing, a few have increased \ntheir specialisation. These include some \nCESEE countries (Poland, Romania, Czechia \nand Latvia), together with Cyprus, Greece and \nDenmark. A similar scenario holds for medium-\nhigh-tech manufacturing where a positive \ngrowth rate in employment shares can be \nobserved mainly for the previously mentioned \nCESEE economies, including the high increase in \nspecialisation in Estonia and Latvia. It is worth \nnoting that the major EU economies have been \nshifting away from the sector, including those \ncountries with an historical specialisation, such \nas Germany (-7.5 %), Belgium (-42 %), France \n(-36 %) and Italy (-12 %).\n\nThe main trends reported in Figure 3.2-6 \nare also confirmed for the period 2008-\n2016, although a few differences are worth \nmentioning. Romania experienced a negative \nshift away from high-tech manufacturing, \nwhich means that the positive shift towards the \nsector observed above took place in the period \nbefore the crisis. A similar trend occurred in \nHungary in medium-high-tech manufacturing. \n\n5 See also https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/policy_en\n6 It should be noted that some time may be needed for value-added shares to react to movements in employment from one \n\nsector to another. Therefore, considering value-added shares rather than employment shares may provide different figures \nas, for instance, in the case of Portugal and Italy whose changes in value-added shares have been negative and slightly \npositive, respectively. Since the scope of this section is to highlight structural trends, the focus is mainly on employment, \nwhile value added is used to build labour productivity figures\n\nPortugal has increased its specialisation in all \nknowledge-intensive activities, reversing the \nnegative trends reported above. The positive \nshift in high-tech manufacturing (+7.1 %) \nis particularly noteworthy6. Similarly, Latvia \nhas experienced increased specialisation in \nhigh-tech manufacturing (+29 %). Finally, \nthe negative shift from knowledge-intensive \nmanufacturing in Germany and Spain has been \nrelatively contained compared to the overall \ntrend observed since 2000, flagging an ongoing \neffort to reverse the deindustrialisation trend. \nThis is particularly significant in the Spanish \ncase, where the negative shift declined \nfrom -38.1 % to -0.6 % and from -36.5 % \nto -5 % in high-tech and medium-high-tech \nmanufacturing, respectively. Finally, South \nKorea, unlike the EU, Japan and the United \nStates, has been increasing its specialisation \nin medium-high-tech manufacturing since \nthe crisis, which is the only such case among \nthe major economies included in the analysis, \nhighlighting the peculiarity of the South Korean \neconomic process.\n\nCountries that have increased their \nshare in knowledge-intensive sectors \nhave experienced better productivity \nperformance. As shown in Figure 3.2-4, there \nis a positive correlation between knowledge-\nintensive sectors and economic performance. \nThis is also true in dynamic terms: countries \nexpanding the weight of knowledge activities \ntend to enjoy higher labour productivity growth. \nThe relationship is shown in Figure 3.2-7. \nA process of structural change favouring \nknowledge-intensive sectors means that \neconomic activity is displaced towards activities \nwith higher productivity and innovation \npotential, consequently benefitting the total \n\n\n\n129\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nEU\n27\n\n(3\n)\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns\nJa\n\npa\nn\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\nSp\n\nain\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria Ita\nly\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\nCh\nan\n\nge\n in\n\n e\nm\n\npl\noy\n\nm\nen\n\nt \nsh\n\nar\nes\n\n (%\n)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nKnowledge-intensive services(2) High-tech knowledge-intensive services\n\nPanel A\n\nHigh-tech manufacturing Medium-high-tech manufacturing\n\n-100\n\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nCh\nan\n\nge\n in\n\n e\nm\n\npl\noy\n\nm\nen\n\nt \nsh\n\nar\nes\n\n (%\n)\n\nEU\n27\n\n(3\n)\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns\nJa\n\npa\nn\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\nSp\n\nain\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria Ita\nly\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\nPanel B\n\nFigure 3.2-6 Percentage change in employment share in  \nknowledge-intensive sectors(1), 2000-2016(3)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat and OECD data\nNotes: (1)Data missing for MT, LU and HR.

Panel A shows the \ncorrelation between the cumulative increase in \nthe employment share of knowledge-intensive \nsectors and productivity growth in the period \n2000-2016. The figure reveals different groups \nof countries behaving differently, some where \nthe positive relationship is steeper \u2013 i.e. Bulgaria, \nSlovakia, Poland, Ireland, Latvia and Lithuania \ntogether with Romania \u2013 and others where it is \nless straightforward, remaining rather flat. The \npositive correlation becomes clearer when using \nvalue-added shares rather than employment \nshares, as shown in Panel B, suggesting how \nthe increase in production in those sectors plays \na key role in driving productivity gains. The CESEE \neconomies stand out as having the biggest shifts \ntowards knowledge-intensive sectors and the \nlargest increases in labour productivity, together \nwith Ireland. \n\nA key message to be drawn from the \nabove figures is that structural change \nin the EU as a whole has not privileged \nknowledge-intensive activities, which \nhave increased their share by just 5 % \nsince 2000. Furthermore, this average change \nhas been driven mainly by a few countries, as \nshown in Figure 3.2-7.\n\nThe above analysis suggests that: 1) \nknowledge-intensive sectors tend to be more \nproductive than traditional ones; therefore 2) \nknowledge-oriented economies have higher \nlabour productivity levels; and 3) they enjoy \nhigher growth rates if their economic structure \nchanges to favour knowledge-intensive sectors. \n\n7 There are different ways to break down labour productivity growth into its sources. This chapter follows the approach as in \nCimoli et al. (2011) and Martino (2015), among others.\n\nThe rest of this chapter estimates the \ncontribution of structural change to total \nlabour productivity growth in the EU and peer \neconomies, disentangling it from the role of \nproductivity gains within sectors. In particular, \nlabour productivity is broken down into:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd increases (decreases) due to the shift in \nemployment shares from sectors where \nproductivity growth is lower (higher) to \nsectors where it is higher (lower); \n\n\u00dd\u00dd increases (decreases) due to productivity \ngains (losses) within the same sector \ndriven by efficiency gains, such as, for \ninstance, following productivity-enhancing \ninnovations.\n\nThe methodology is explained in more detail in \nBox 3.2-27.\n\n\n\n131\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nFigure 3.2-7 Change in the share of knowledge intensive sectors and labour \nproductivity growth, 2000-2016(1)(2)(3)(4)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat and OECD data\nNotes: (1)Knowledge Intensive sectors includes High-Tech Manufacturing, Medium-High-Tech Manufacturing and Knowledge-\nIntensive Services.

While different \napproaches do exist, the analysis is based on \nEquation (1):\n\nEquation 1 \n\nwhere L and y are employment shares \nand labour productivity for each sector i \nrespectively, the subscript \u2080 indicates the first \nyear, while \u2206 measures the change in a variable \nfrom the first to the last year. Note that the \ncomputed labour productivity growth rates are \ncumulative for the period \u2013 they are not yearly \ngrowth figures.\n\nTotal labour productivity growth is the sum of \nthe three components for every sector in the \neconomy. \n\nThe first term of Equation (1) defines \nproductivity gains (PrG) in each sector, given \nby increases (reductions) in productivity \nkeeping employment constant, and are given \nby increased (reduced) efficiency, such as, for \ninstance, due to technical progress within the \nsector in case of positive growth. The second \nand third terms make up the structural change \ncomponent of labour productivity growth, being \nthe sum of changes in employment shares \u2013 \nthe pure share effect (ShEff) \u2013 and interaction \nbetween changes in both employment shares \nand labour productivity \u2013 the dynamic effect \n(DynEff). The ShEff term provides information on \nthe direction of structural change, i.e. informs \non which sectors employment has been flowing \nto. The DynEff term refers to the interaction \n\nbetween structural change and productivity \ndynamics. Indeed, this term is positive, i.e. \nstructural change is positively contributing \nto total productivity growth, if employment \nshares are either shifting towards sectors with \nrising labour productivity or moving away from \nsectors where productivity is declining. The sum \nof the last two components indicates whether \nthe structure of the economy is shifting \ntowards activities with higher productivity \ngrowth. Note that, by construction, this term \nis also positive in cases where employment \nshares in a knowledge-intensive sector are \ndeclining if labour productivity growth in \nthat sector is negative. Therefore, the PrG \ncomponent provides fundamental information \nto complement the contribution of structural \nchange. This is the case in Italy, for instance, \nwhere the contribution of structural change in \nmedium-high-tech manufacturing is slightly \npositive, driven by negative productivity gains \nand the loss of employment shares. Of course, \nthe key elements here are rather the declining \nproductivity and reduced employment share in \na knowledge-intensive sector, which are both \ndetrimental to the competitiveness of the \nItalian economy.\n\n\ufffdy/y\u2080 = \u2211[(\ufffdy\uf6edL\u2080)/y\u2080 + (\ufffdL\uf6edy\u2080)/y\u2080 + (\ufffdy\uf6ed\ufffdL\uf6ed)/y\u2080]\nPrG ShEff DynEff\n\ni\n\n\n\n133\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nFor simplicity, the total economy is divided \ninto seven macro-sectors, three of which are \nknowledge-intensive: i.e. 1) knowledge-intensive \nservices; 2) high-tech knowledge-intensive \nservices; 3) high-tech manufacturing; and 4) \nmedium-high-tech manufacturing. The remaining \nare the more traditional ones: i.e. 5) medium-low-\ntech manufacturing; 6) other market services; \nand 7) the rest of the economy. While simple, \nsuch a classification allows the contribution of \neach sector to be traced to total productivity \ngrowth to see whether structural change has \nbeen contributing to it positively or negatively.\n\nAs from the 2000s, structural change \ntowards knowledge-intensive sectors \nhas not been the main driver of labour \nproductivity growth in the EU, while the \nperformance of knowledge-intensive \nsectors is low \u2013 although positive \u2013 \ncompared to the United States. South \nKorea is the only economy where \nstructural change has favoured medium-\nhigh-tech manufacturing. Figure 3.2-8 \nsummarises the breakdown of total labour \nproductivity growth into its structural change \nand productivity gains components, by sector, \nfor the period 2000-2016. This enables the \ntotal contribution of each sector (last column) \nand of structural change and productivity \ngains, respectively (last row), to be highlighted.\n\nWhile labour productivity has grown by \n15.67 % in the EU since 2000, the growth \nrate would have been higher if structural \nchange had favoured more the sectors \nwith higher productivity gains. As shown in \nPanel A, this is particularly true for the industrial \nsectors with high knowledge intensity, i.e. high-\ntech and medium-high tech manufacturing. \nHowever, a closer look at the figure reveals that \nthe most negative components of structural \nchanges are in non-knowledge-intensive \nsectors, most notably medium-low-tech \nmanufacturing and the rest of the economy. \nThis is linked to the high productivity gains \n\nin those sectors during the reference period, \nsuggesting that the loss of employment shares \nhas reduced the total labour productivity \ngrowth and added to the negative contribution \nof structural change (-1.19 %). \n\nA key challenge faced by the EU is that \nknowledge-intensive sectors have the \nlowest productivity gains, despite the \nhigher labour productivity levels, as \npresented in the second column of Figure 3.2-8. \nConversely, the other market services and the \nrest of the economy are by far the main sectors \nin which labour productivity has been growing \nthe most while the loss of employment shares \nin the latter is actually reducing the overall \ngrowth figures. Since these sectors are less \nknowledge-intensive, these positive productivity \ngains suggest an increase in efficiency, hinting \nat the application of productivity-enhancing \ntechnologies to traditional activities.\n\nWhile structural change has made \na similar contribution to productivity \ngrowth in both the United States and \nthe EU, productivity gains in knowledge-\nintensive activities in the former have \nbeen systematically larger. As in the \nEuropean case, structural change contributes \nnegatively to labour productivity growth \n(-3.2 %), as it does in knowledge-intensive \nmanufacturing, flagging a more intense \ndeindustrialisation trend such as in the EU. \nHowever, the productivity gains in high-\ntech and medium-high-tech manufacturing \nare higher at above 2 %, and they manage \nto counterbalance the loss in employment \nshares. The productivity performance in \nmedium-high-tech manufacturing in the \nEU is higher due to a smaller decline in the \nemployment shares, driven mostly by the \nCESEE economies. Knowledge-intensive \nservices are the main drivers of productivity \ngrowth in both economies, because of positive \nproductivity gains together with sustained \nincreases in their employment shares.

It should also be noted that, in both \neconomies, high-tech knowledge-intensive \nservices have had a relatively low growth \nrate \u2013 negative in the case of the EU \u2013 despite \nhaving the second highest labour productivity \nlevel, as shown above.\n\nFigure 3.2-8 Labour productivity growth decomposition: structural change \nand productivity gains, 2000-2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat and OECD data\nNote: EU data is until 2015.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter32/figure-32-8.xlsx\n\n\n\n135\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nThe post-crisis period reveals higher \nproductivity growth in knowledge-\nmanufacturing activities in both the EU \nand United States, although well below \nthe figures for South Korea. The low \nperformance of the EU\u2019s knowledge-\nintensive services is confirmed. Figure \n3.2-9 reports the decomposition of labour \nproductivity growth for the post-crisis period, \nincluding data which are also available for \nJapan and South Korea. Figures for the EU and \nUnited States confirm the trend observed for \nthe whole period, but with two main differences. \nFirst, productivity growth in the industrial \nsectors in the United States is higher, due to \na slowdown in the pace of structural change \naway from those sectors. Second, productivity \ngains in the EU\u2019s knowledge-intensive services \nhave been very low (+0.21 %) and negative in \nthe high-tech ones (-0.23 %). Growth in the \nsector has been entirely driven by the increase \nin employment shares (+2.69 % in knowledge-\nintensive services and +0.49 % in the high-\ntech ones) which, in turn, explains 70 % of total \nproductivity growth (3.18 % out of 4.54 %). \nOn a more positive note, productivity gains in \n\nhigh-tech manufacturing, while relatively low, \nappear to have been mainly concentrated in \nthe post-crisis period (+0.64 % between 2008-\n2016 compared to +0.95 % for 2000-2016). \nAs regards Japan and South Korea, while \ndata availability does not allow the complete \npicture to be drawn, it is worth noting the \nloss of productivity in knowledge-intensive \nservices in both countries, despite increased \nspecialisation within the sector, which has not \nfavoured the high-tech services. As already \nmentioned above, South Korea stands out for \nbeing the only economy with positive figures \nin knowledge-intensive industries, showing \nproductivity gains significantly higher than in \npeer countries.

Most of \ngrowth has been driven by productivity gains, \nwhich is true for all economies. Structural \n\nchange is a positive but still minor source \nof growth, mainly for the CESEE economies, \ntogether with Portugal, Cyprus and Greece. \nFor the remaining countries, its contribution \nis negative, and almost null for Italy. Romania \nand Ireland are two notable outliers since \nstructural change contributes to around half of \nlabour productivity growth in the former while \nreducing it by around one third in the Irish case.\n\n\n\n138\n\nBOX 3.2-3 Firm size distribution and sectoral \nlabour productivity8\n\nDavid Mart\u00ednez Tur\u00e9gano, European Commission,  \nJoint Research Centre, Unit B5\n\n8 Based on the homonymous chapter included in Bauer et al. (2020).\n9 The EU aggregate not including the UK.\n10 Labour productivity is calculated by the ratio of value added and the number of people employed. Value added is measured \n\nin purchasing power parity-adjusted euros using GDP-based price levels.\n\nDifferences in productivity between countries \nmight also arise in the face of heterogeneous \nproductivity across production units. In this box, \nwe exploit the observation that, despite sectoral \ndifferences, there is an overall positive relation \nbetween firm size and labour productivity and \nhence different firm-size distributions could \nhave an impact on aggregate productivity. We \ndevelop a decomposition analysis that splits the \nsectoral productivity in Member States relative \nto the EU9 aggregate into differences in both \nthe firm-size distribution and in the productivity \nlevel within each firm-size class.\n\nMethodology\nThe analysis relies on data from Structural \nBusiness Statistics (SBS) for five firm-size classes \n(less than 10 people employed, 10-19, 20-49, \n50-249 and 250 or more) within eight NACE \nsections: C (manufacturing), F (construction), G \n(trade), H (transportation and storage), I (accom-\nmodation and food services), J (information and \n\ncommunication), M (professional activities) and N \n(administrative and support activities).\n\nFor instance, if employment in a country was \nmore concentrated in larger firms compared to \nthe EU aggregate, given that larger firms are \nassociated on average with higher productivity, \nthe size distribution effect would be positive. \nHowever, at the same time, if average \nproductivity for larger firms in this country was \nlower than peers in the EU aggregate, the size \nclass productivity effect would be negative.\n\nFinally, to provide an overall picture, we \naggregate results at the country level. A third \ncomponent is then added to account for \ndifferences in the weight of sectors and the \nfact that productivity is higher in certain sectors \nthan others (e.g. manufacturing compared to \ntrade activities). We refer to this component as \nthe sectoral composition effect.\n\nThe decomposition is as follows10:\n\nLPc,j \ufffd LPEU,j = \u2211\u03b1c,j,i \u00d7 LPc,j,i - \u2211\u03b1EU,j,i \u00d7 LPEU,j,i =\n         i       i \n\n\u2211(\u03b1c,j,i - \u03b1EU,j,i) \u00d7  (\nLPc,j,i + LPEU,j,i) [size distribution effect] +\n\n  \ni\n\n\u2211(LPc,j,i - LPEU,j,i) \u00d7  (\n\u03b1c,j,i + \u03b1EU,j,i) [size class productivity effect] \n\n  \ni\n\nwhere:\n\n\u03b1c,j,i = employment share of firm size class i in sector j of country c\n\nLPc,j,i = labour productivity of firm size class i in sector j of country c\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\n\n139\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nCross-country comparison\nIn general terms, country differences in \nproductivity levels within each firm-size class \nplay the most important role by large and \nmainly explain the divergence across Member \nStates (Figure 3.2-11A), whereas both the \nsectoral composition effect \u2013 i.e. differences in \nsectoral employment shares \u2013 and the firm-\nsize distribution effect play a more limited role.\n\nHowever, for a few countries, having a firm \ndistribution tilted towards smaller firms \nwould seem to be significantly detrimental for \nproductivity performance. This is particularly \nthe case for Greece, where it accounts for \na quarter of the productivity difference with \nrespect to the EU benchmark, and Italy, where \nit fully offsets the positive contribution from \nthe \u2018pure\u2019 productivity effects. It is also worth \nhighlighting the case of Spain, in which the size \ndistribution effects and the sectoral composition \neffects explain 50-50 the productivity gap.\n\nFigure 3.2-11B decomposes the size distri-\nbution effect in Figure 3.2-11A by sector. \nContributions to size distribution effects are on \naverage higher than their employment share \nfor manufacturing (C), ICT services (J) and \n\nprofessional activities (M), suggesting a more \nimportant role for firm size shaping productivity \nrelative to other economic activities.\n\nSectoral contributions seem to move in \nthe same direction within most countries, \nparticularly for those where the size effect is \nlarger. Nevertheless, there are some noticeable \nexceptions: e.g. Czechia and Hungary which \nare largely involved in central European value \nchains, show positive size distribution effects in \nthe manufacturing sector but negative in some \nservice activities, while the opposite happens in \nthe Baltic countries.\n\nTo summarise, while the dispersion of firm-\nsize distributions across Member States plays \na limited role overall in explaining productivity \ngaps within the EU, there are some specific \ncases in which this effect is significant and \nmight deserve policy action. In particular, the \nrelated literature points to the importance of \nthe institutional framework in shaping firm-\nsize distributions, judicial and government \nefficiency being a supportive factor for \nincreasing firm size.\n\nFigure 3.2-11 Percentage difference in labour productivity relative to the EU28, 2016\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n\n-50\n\n-60\n\n-70\n\nSize class productivity effect\n\nSize distribution effect\nSectoral composition effect\nTotal\n\nEL LV BG LT PT RO SK HU EE HR PL CZ CY S\nI ES IT FI DE SE NL FR DK AT BE\n\nContributing effects\n\n\n\n140\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 own computations based on SBS data \nNote: Malta and Luxembourg are not included due to lack of data.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter32/figure-32-11.xlsx\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n-12\n\n-14\n\n-16\n\n-18\n\nSize distribution effect, by sector\n\nEL IT PT ES SK PL SI CY EE BG BE LV HU CZ NL LT HR RO FR AT F\nI SE DE DK\n\nC Manufacturing\nF Construction\nG Wholesale and retail trade\nH Transportation and storage\n\nI Accommodation and food service activities\nJ Information and communication\nM Professional, scientific and technical activities\nN Administrative and support service activities\n\nTOTAL\n\nRecent dynamics\n\nLabour productivity increased in recent years \n(2012-2016/17) across all countries, most \nnotably in those Member States with lower \nlevels compared to the EU benchmark (Figure \n3.2-12A), Greece being the only exception. These \ndevelopments supported a convergence process \ndriven mainly by an increase in productivity \nlevels across all firm-size classes, supported \nin some cases and to a much lesser extent by \na sectoral shift towards economic activities \nwith higher productivity levels (e.g. in Bulgaria, \nRomania and Poland).\n\nOverall, changes in firm-size distribution played \na limited role in shaping productivity growth but \nmade a significantly positive contribution in those \ncountries where size distribution had previously \nbeen identified as having a detrimental effect, \nnamely Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy. In \npolicy terms, it might be worth investigating \nwhether such a declining share of employment \n\nin smaller firms is associated with the aftermath \nof the crisis (i.e. being less resilient than bigger \nfirms) or/and the result of structural reforms \nsupporting larger enterprises.\n\nFigure 3.2-12B decomposes the size distribution \neffect in Figure 3.2-12A by sector. On average, \nthis factor made a positive contribution to \nproductivity growth in manufacturing (C), retail \ntrade (G) and accommodation and food services \n(I), while proving negative for construction (F) \nand ICT services (J), showing different sectoral \npatterns following the crisis.\n\nOn a country basis, within those recording \na significant shift in employment towards larger \nfirms, developments were driven in particular \nby accommodation and food services in Greece, \nwhile in other countries, manufacturing (e.g. in \nHungary) and trade (e.g. in Portugal and Spain) \nplayed a relatively more important role.\n\n\n\n141\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nFigure 3.2-12 Percentage change in labour productivity, 2012-2016/2017\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 own computations based on SBS data \nNote: Malta and Luxembourg are not included due to lack of data.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter32/figure-32-12.xlsx\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\nEL DE AT F\n\nI\nDK SE CY BE ES NL IT SK FR EE LV PT CZ S\n\nI PL HR HU RO LT BG\n\nSize class productivity effect\n\nSize distribution effect\nSectoral composition effect\nTotal\n\nContributing effects\n\nLV NL S\nI\n\nSK DK LT EE BE F\nI CY PL AT HR DE SE BG IT CZ RO PT ES FR HU\n\n \nEL\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nC Manufacturing\nF Construction\nG Wholesale and retail trade\nH Transportation and storage\n\nI Accommodation and food service activities\nJ Information and communication\nM Professional, scientific and technical activities\nN Administrative and support service activities\n\nTOTAL\n\nSize distribution effect, by sector\n\n\n\n142\n\n3. Conclusions\n\nThe structure of an economy shapes \nits capacity to invest in R&D and to \ninnovate. The EU and peer modern economies \nare characterised by the predominance of \nknowledge-intensive services, accounting for \nmore than 40 % of total employment and \nbeing the backbone of economic activity. The \nweight of knowledge-intensive manufacturing \nactivities is smaller and heterogeneous across \nthe Member States, with some of them being \nrelatively more specialised, most notably in \ncentral and eastern Europe. \n\nIn recent decades, Europe has gone \nthrough a generalised transformation \ntowards knowledge-intensive services, \nwhile most Member States have been \nmoving away from medium-high and high-\ntech manufacturing, with the exception \nof the CESEE countries. This trend has had \na subduing effect on economic dynamics, \n\ndespite productivity gains within knowledge-\nintensive manufacturing sectors positively \ncontributing to productivity growth. Overall, \nstructural change is not the main driver of \ngrowth, either in the EU or in peer countries, \nwith the exception of South Korea, which \nsuggests that productivity improvements \nwithin sectors are the key driving factor.\n\nIn a broader context in which a productivity \ngap between the EU and the United States \npersists across sectors, the observed \nstructural dynamics contribute to making \nthe case for an EU industrial strategy to \ncounter the deindustrialisation trends \nin the EU and to increase its long-term \ncompetitiveness while meeting the need \nfor a transition towards a climate-\nneutral and sustainable economy.\n\n\n\n143\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\n4.

Declining business dynamism may hamper \nproductivity growth\n\nBusiness dynamism, via the process of \ncreative destruction, can contribute to \nproductivity growth and a more robust \neconomy. An economy\u2019s business dynamism \ncan be examined through a set of different \nmeasures, such as firm entry and exit rates, \nchurn, and job reallocation rates (i.e. the \nsimultaneous creation and destruction of \njobs (Calvino et al., forthcoming)). Economic \ntheory shows that an economy that exhibits \nhigher firm dynamics will in principle be more \ninnovative and productive.\n\nJoseph Schumpeter coined the term \n\u2018creative destruction\u2019 in 1942. Acemoglu \n(2008) also refers to the importance of \ncreative destruction for growth. The thesis \nis that an economy where resources move \nfrom less-productive to more-productive \nbusinesses within industries will show higher \nproductivity growth (Decker et al., 2016) via \na more efficient allocation of resources in the \neconomy. Put differently, it assumes that new \nbusinesses will introduce new products and \nservices and challenge older businesses to \nadapt and compete and will eventually replace \nthem. Bauer (2020) found that higher entry \nrates improve productivity growth and that \nnet entry contribution is an important driver of \nproductivity. Moreover, Criscuolo et al. (2014) \nhighlight the role of startups in job creation \nby demonstrating that young firms contribute \ndisproportionately to net employment creation.\n\nIn this chapter, we look into recent and \nlonger-term trends across different \nmeasures of business dynamism in \nEurope, benchmarking with other major \neconomies, and we discuss the implications \nthese developments may have for innovation, \nproductivity and growth prospects. In addition, \nwe analyse the state of play of innovative \nentrepreneurship on the continent as well as \nsome enabling conditions for the success of \nEuropean entrepreneurs.\n\nIn recent years, business dynamism has \nstagnated and even declined in the EU \nand/or its international competitors. This \nmay limit its contribution to productivity \ngrowth. Figure 3.3-1 depicts the evolution \nof business churn in the EU and in other \nmajor economies between 2009 and 2016, \ndepending on data availability. Business \ndynamism is highest in South Korea and lowest \nin Japan. Over time, churn rates seem to have \nstagnated in Japan and the EU, while in the \nUnited States and South Korea a slight decline \nis more evident after 2012.\n\n\n\n148\n\nFigure 3.3-1 Business churn of employer enterprises (%)(1) by region, 2009-2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat (online data code: bd_9fh_sz_cl_r2), DG  Joint Research Centre, OECD\nNotes: (1)Business churn is the sum of birth and death rates of employer enterprises i.e. enterprises, with at least 1 employee.  \n(2)EU was estimated by DG Research and Innovation.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter33/figure-33-1.xlsx\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\n%\n\nJapan\n\nSouth Korea\n\nUnited States\n\nEU(2)\n\nThe EU exhibits slightly higher business \ndynamism than the United States. The \ncombined dynamics in high- and medium-\nhigh-tech manufacturing and knowledge-\nintensive services are similar to those \nof the overall economy. In 2016, the EU\u2019s \neconomy was somewhat more \u2018dynamic\u2019 than \nthe United States, both in all sectors and in \nhigh- and medium-high-tech manufacturing \n(HT, MHT) and knowledge-intensive services \n(KIS) sectors (Figure 3.3-2). This was mainly \ndue to slightly higher company death rates in \nthe EU. Between 2012 and 2016, there appears \nto have been a stagnation in EU business \ndynamism, and a small increase in the HT, MHT \nand KIS sectors derived from higher death rates \nin these sectors. The United States experienced \na decline in business churn activity between \n2012 and 2016 due to a slight contraction in \nboth birth and death rates.\n\nSome EU Member States have seen \na decline in business churn activity over \nrecent years, while overall increases \nwere more visible in EU-13 countries. \nFigure 3.3-3 depicts the evolution of churn \nrates between 2010 and 2017. Business churn \ndeclined in some Member States during this \nperiod.

In Iceland \nand the United Kingdom, startups comprise \nmore than 50 % of enterprises. In most EU \nMember States (for which either 2009 or the \nearliest year is available) the share of startups \nin the economy contracted. The biggest \ndeclines were registered between 2009 and \n2016 in Romania, Slovakia and Lithuania, while \nincreases were more pronounced in Malta, \nLatvia and Hungary. Chapter 8 - Framework \nconditions provides an overview of the \nframework and market conditions that may \npartly explain these cross-country differences.\n\nThe evolution of enterprise birth rates \nacross the EU reveals a mixed pattern. As \nexpected, the evolution of job creation by \nnew firms correlates positively with birth \nrates. There are considerable cross-country \ndifferences in terms of job creation rates. \nEmployer enterprise birth rates have not yet \nreached pre-crisis rates in some EU Member \nStates such as France, Luxembourg, Latvia, \nRomania and Slovenia. On the other hand, in \nSpain, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia and Hungary, \nbirth rates have surpassed those before the \ncrisis. In a few Member States, like Austria, \nBelgium, Germany, Portugal and Sweden, birth \nrates seem to be relatively stable. In 2017 (or \nlatest year available), enterprise birth rates \nranged from 19 % in Poland to only around 4 % \nin Belgium and Ireland (Figure 3.3-4). In the \nUnited States, following a rise in 2012, birth \nrates appear to have slightly declined again.\n\nFigure 3.3-4 Share of startups (up to 5 years old) in total employer enterprises, \n2009 and 2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat (online data code: bd_9fh_sz_cl_r2)\nNotes: (1)BE, BG, DK, CY, MT, NL, FI: 2012.

Figure 3.3-6 depicts the \nshare of jobs created by new firms in above- \nand below-median productivity sectors in 2016 \nand compares it with 10 years ago (whenever \ncountry-level data is available). Lithuania, \nDenmark, Finland, Estonia and Czechia registered \nthe highest percentages of new jobs created by \nnew firms in above-median productivity sectors, \nwith 30-40 % of new jobs being created in \nsectors with higher productivity. A similar picture \napplies to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, \nIceland and Norway. On the other hand, over \n80 % of jobs created by firm births in Spain, \nPortugal, Greece, Austria and the Netherlands \nwere in lower-productivity sectors.\n\nNonetheless, since 2006, there has been \nan increase in the shares of jobs being \ncreated by new firms in more productive \nsectors in some countries. This is the case \nin Lithuania, Finland, Estonia, Czechia, Latvia, \nBelgium, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Spain. In the \ncase of Lithuania, this increase almost doubled \nin percentage points. In other countries, such \nas Denmark, Hungary, Sweden, Slovakia, and \nthe Netherlands, the contribution to new job \ncreation from more productive sectors appears \nto have declined.\n\nOverall, considering the link between \nproductivity and wage-setting, it seems \nthat most jobs created by new firms were in \nlower-productivity sectors and hence, in principle, \nwere lower-paid jobs.

As mentioned above, \naccording to economic theory, stronger business \ndynamism can lead to a higher productivity-\nenhancing reallocation of resources in an \n\neconomy and consequently can be a source \nof growth. Decker et al. (2016) showed the \ndecline of business dynamism in the United \nStates as well as a reduction in high-growth \nentrepreneurship in the United States in the \npost-2000 period.

Disentangling the impact of the \nslowing pace of job reallocation and entry rates \non innovation and productivity, with certainty, \ncan be a challenging task. For example, Decker \net al. (2018) argue that to get the full picture \nabout the slowing business dynamism it is \nimportant to consider the hypothesis that \nchanges in the business model within sectors \nmay imply less need for a high pace of business \nformation and reallocation dynamics to achieve \nproductivity growth. Hence, existing firms may \ncontinue to be productive because of process, \norganisational and business model innovation. \nIn fact, Aghion et al. (2016) showed that \ninnovation by existing firms contributed more \nto productivity growth than did innovation by \nentering firms. Akcigit and Ates (2019) found \nthat the explanation for declining business \ndynamism in the United States may lie in \na decline in knowledge diffusion.\n\nBusiness dynamics in digital sectors have \nreceived closer scrutiny in the literature \ndue to concerns over market concentration \nin the digital sectors (Andrews et al., 2018). \n\nCalvino et al. (forthcoming) found that the \nhigher the digital intensity of the sector, the \nlarger the decline in entry and job reallocation \nrates (see Chapter 2 - Changing dynamics of \ninnovation in the age of digital transformation). \nOn finding a similar picture, Decker et al. (2016) \nconcluded that there has been a decline in the \ncontribution from reallocation to productivity \ngrowth since 2000, which has been particularly \ntrue in the high-tech sector.\n\nCalvino et al. (forthcoming) shed more \nlight on the impact of changes in the \ncompetitive environment on business \ndynamism measured by entry rates and \njob reallocation rates. On the impact of \nthe business cycle, they find that it plays \nan important role but the observed declines \nin dynamism do not seem to be a cyclical \nphenomenon only. Furthermore, greater \nefficiency in contract enforcement and business \nregulations was found to be associated with \nstronger business dynamism. The authors also \nidentified a negative association between the \nadministrative burden on startups and entry \nrates. These aspects are further explored in \nChapter 8 - Framework conditions.\n\n2.  Europe\u2019s scaling-up performance needs revamping\n\nSlightly more than 1 in 10 enterprises \nin the EU are high-growth companies. \nIn many EU Member States, the \nrepresentation of high-growth firms in \nthe economy has increased. High-growth \nenterprises can be measured either in terms of \nemployment or turnover growth. Since data are \nmore commonly available for employment, this \nis the criteria we have applied \u2013 a high-growth \nenterprise has at least 10 employees and an \naverage annualised employment growth of \n10 % or more per annum over a three-year \n\nperiod \u2013 which also follows the definition of \nEurostat and the OECD. Grover Goswami et al. \n(2019) from the World Bank found that high-\ngrowth firms are not only powerful engines of \njob and output growth but also create positive \nspillovers for other businesses along the value \nchain. Daunfeldt et al. (2014) show that high-\ngrowth firms contribute disproportionately to \nnew job creation.

Europe lags considerably behind \nthe United States as regards the presence \nof tech scaleups. A scaleup is defined by \nMind the Bridge (2019) as a tech company \nthat has raised more than EUR 1 million in \nfunding. Figure 3.3-10 compares the absolute \n\nand relative presence of these companies in \nEurope, the United States and China. Europe \nhas a lower number of tech scaleups than the \nUnited States and China and, when standardised \nby population, it still lags behind the United \nStates. As of 2018, there were 1.3 scaleups \nper 100 000 inhabitants in Europe compared to \nseven scaleups in the United States. \n\nFigure 3.3-10 Total number of scaleups(1) and number of scaleups per \n100 000 inhabitants, as of 2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Mind the Bridge - Tech Scaleup Europe 2019 Report\nNote: (1)A scaleup is a tech company (i.e. a company - operating in Tech & Digital industries, founded in the New Millennium, with \nat least one funding event since 2010.Biotech, Life Sciences and Pharma, Semiconductors are currently not included in the scope \nof research) which has raised more than EUR 1 million in funding, as defined by Mind the Bridge (2019).

Figure \n3.3-11 examines the distribution of tech \nscaleups within the EU. Just five EU Member \nStates \u2013 France, Germany, Sweden, Spain \nand the Netherlands \u2013 account for nearly two \nthirds of all scaleups identified in the EU3. \n\n3 These are mostly the largest Member States in terms of population, firms and GDP, so it would be expected that they also \naccount for more tech scaleups as well (size effect).\n\nFurthermore, the number of UK and Israeli tech \nscaleups is higher than any EU Member State.\n\nWhen it comes to transformational \nentrepreneurship with a global outreach, \nthe EU trails behind the United States \nand China. For example, for each private \n\n\n\n158\n\nunicorn in the EU, there are seven in the \nUnited States and four in China. As mentioned \nby the European Commission (2018), the \nterm \u2018unicorn\u2019 was first coined by Aileen Lee \nin 20134 following the emergence of a \u2018rare\u2019 \ngroup of companies that was experiencing \nspectacular growth and had reached a post-\nmoney valuation of more than USD 1 billion. \n\nAs of January 2020, there are 439 \ncompanies worldwide with private uni-\ncorn status. Of those, nearly half (or 215) \n\n4 https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/\n5 Using population data for 2018 from the World Development Indicators, we find the following results for unicorns per million \n\npopulation: United States (0.7), China (0.07) and EU (0.06).\n\nare based in the United States, around \na quarter in China (or 101), and 7 % (or 29) \nare in the EU (Figure 3.3-12).

Unicorns are usually \n\u2018born\u2019 in well-connected hubs where \nrisk finance and talent are also more \nwidely available. Unicorn companies are \nvery capital-intensive and usually connected \nto global markets from the start (i.e. \u2018born-\nglobal\u2019 companies). For this reason, they tend \nto emerge in the top entrepreneurial cities \nwhere the network of investors, partners and \nacademia is well established.

The high spatial \nconcentration of unicorns in top urban centres \nalso holds for China, with the municipality \nof Beijing currently home to almost half of \nall Chinese unicorns. Cumulatively, 82 % of \nChinese private unicorns are based in Beijing, \nShanghai and the province of Guangdong.\n\nUnicorns are mostly present in fintech, \ninternet software and services, \ne-commerce and, more recently, in\nartificial intelligence.

The previous figures only considered \nprivate unicorns. However, since 2009, there \nhave been other unicorns that were either \nacquired or are no longer private because they \nwent through an initial public offering (IPO).\n\nIn Figure 3.3-19, we assess whether the gap \nrelative to the United States and China would \nbe smaller if the definition of a unicorn was \nexpanded to include those that went public \nor were acquired by other companies. Thus, \nthe ratio of EU unicorns to the United States \nslightly increases to 1:8, while relative to China \nit improves to 1:3. \n\nIn the EU, Germany is home to nearly 40 % \n(or 17) of all unicorns.

Taking into consideration \nboth private and exited unicorns, Figure 3.3-20 \n\nindicates that not all EU Member States have \ngenerated at least one unicorn; in fact, that has \nonly happened in half of them. Nevertheless, as \nis highlighted later in this chapter, there is a group \nof \u2018EU DNA\u2019 unicorns which, even though they \ncurrently have their main headquarters in the \nUnited States or the United Kingdom, the (co)-\nfounders have EU nationality and, in some cases, \neven started the company in a EU Member State.\n\nGermany leads in the creation of unicorns with \n5 exited unicorns (HelloFresh, Delivery Hero, \nGanymed Pharmaceuticals, Rocket Internet \nand Zalando) and 12 private unicorns (Auto1 \nGroup, Otto Bock Healthcare, CureVac, N26, \nNuCom Group, Celonis, About You, Omio, \nFlixBus, GetYourGuide, Deposit Solutions and \nwefox Group).

More \ngenerally, the European Commission (2017) \ninvestigated the growing phenomenon of dual \ncompanies (Onetti and Pisoni, 2016), i.e. high-\ntech startup companies founded in European \ncountries before relocating their headquarters \nto outside of the EU, notably the United States. \nHowever, they typically maintain a presence \n(such as R&D labs) in their home country which \nbenefits from positive externalities such as new \njob creation. The study concluded that 13 % of \nEuropean scaleups follow this \u2018dual model\u2019, \nand that for 83 % of them the United States \n(in particular Silicon Valley) is the destination, \na trend already mentioned in this chapter. For \nthose that relocate within Europe, the United \nKingdom is the top choice.\n\nAlthough there are different reasons \nfor relocating headquarters to the \nUnited States or United Kingdom, the \nmost commonly identified are closer \nproximity to capital markets, an intense \nand experienced network of investors, \nand a larger market (see Chapter 8 - \nFramework conditions). Moreover, the authors\u2019 \n\nfindings suggest that the more mature startup \necosystems (such as Germany, France, Sweden \nand the UK) show below-average numbers of \ndual companies (in the 11 % to 13 % range).\n\nIn this context, there are positive \nexternalities to the \u2018home country\u2019 even \nwhen headquarters are relocated. This \nhypothesis holds true in the cases listed \nbelow (Figure 3.3-22). Benefits to the country \nof origin can include employing highly skilled \nprofessionals, as in the Tradeshift Frontiers \nInnovation Lab in Copenhagen or Stripe\u2019s new \nengineering hub in Dublin, participating as \nangels or seed investors in new startups, such \nas the founders of Talkdesk and TransferWise, \nor sponsoring digital education in less-\ndeveloped regions, like UiPath in Romania, etc.\n\nSome unicorns are highly R&D-intensive \nand have made it to the top global R&D \ninvestors, some despite their young age. \nTheir presence is mainly in software and \ncomputer services and on average they \nhave higher market capitalisation than \nthe other top R&D-intensive companies \nin the sector. They are also less labour-\nintensive.

Radical innovators are \ntypically seen as important for shaping the \ndirection of technological change and for job \ncreation (Pianta, 2003; Lucchese and Pianta, \n2012). While there is a rich body of literature \non the innovative and economic performance \nof large corporations that account for the \nbulk of business R&D expenditure (Montresor \nand Vezzani, 2015; Bogliacino, 2014; Ortega-\nArgil\u00e9s et al., 2009), evidence on small- or \nmedium-sized radical innovator enterprises in \nEurope remains limited.\n\nYet, analysing European Innovation Survey data \nshows that about half of the European GICs \nare small- or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \nthat are not part of a corporate group. This \nsuggests a similarity with \u2018hidden champions\u2019, \na term introduced by Simon (1996) to describe \nhighly specialised SME world leaders in \na niche market, which have been the subject \nof substantial research (e.g. Audretsch et al., \n2018; Witt and Carr, 2013; Simon, 2009; Fryges, \n2006). In particular, analogously to hidden \nchampions, GICs might have specific strategies \nand behaviour that may easily fall under the \nradar in spite of their relevance for policy.\n\nBased on Community Innovation Survey (CIS \n2014) data, 1 710 companies were identified as \nGICs across 12 EU Member States and Norway. \nThis implies that, on average, GICs constitute \n3 % of all enterprises, 8 % of active innovators \n(companies that have introduced or have an \n\nongoing product and/or process innovation) and \n13 % of product innovators.\n\nFigure 3.3-27 shows that the share of GICs \nis particularly high in Germany (4.4 %), and \ngenerally quite limited in eastern and Baltic \nMember States.\n\nOther findings of the analysis:\n\n \u00dd GICs have stronger export performance \nthan other types of innovators: analo-\ngously to the high correlation with product \ninnovations, this is due to the definition of \nGICs which requires a company to export, \nbesides having introduced a world-first \nproduct innovation.\n\n \u00dd Although the share of GICs over the population \nof general and innovative companies is larger \nfor large ones than for SMEs, the majority \n(55 %) of GICs are SMEs.\n\n \u00dd GICs outperform active innovators in \nmost IPR-related activities and MSs, \nsupporting the idea that the GICs definition \nidentifies technologically intensive radical \ninnovators.\n\n\n\n176\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Figure 14 in V\u00e9rtesy and Damioli (2020)\nNotes: (1)EU was estimated by DG JRC based on data availability for EU Member States.

Lass\u00e9bie et al.

Talent refers to the access, cost and quality of talent. Finally, startup experience refers \nto the team and ecosystem experience in terms of knowledge and networks available from which startups can develop.\n\nThe EU has seven ecosystems in the world \ntop 30 startup ecosystems, compared to \n12 in the United States and only three in \nChina. Startup Genome (2019) uses data from \nover 1 million companies across 150 cities \nto rank startup ecosystems in terms of \nperformance, funding, market reach, talent and \nstartup experience12. Figure 3.3-34 shows that \nthe United States leads in the number of quality \nstartup ecosystems, with 12 in the top 30 world \nstartup ecosystems. The EU comes next, with \nseven ecosystems, then China with three. \n\nThe EU\u2019s top ecosystems are Paris, Berlin, \nStockholm, Amsterdam-StartupDelta, Bar-\ncelona, Dublin and Munich (Figure 3.3-35). \nParis ranks high in terms of access to funding and \nquality, global connectedness, quality of the tech \n\ntalent, and access to talent in life sciences. Berlin\u2019s \nrelative strengths seem to be in global reach \nand in the quality of its tech talent. Stockholm \nalso stands out for its global connectedness \nand quality of its talent. The quality of the tech \ntalent and access to life sciences talent are key \nstrengths found in Amsterdam-StartupDelta.\n\nIn the top 3 global startup ecosystems \nare two US ecosystems \u2013 Silicon Valley \nand New York \u2013 and London. As mentioned \nabove, the high quality of these ecosystems \nacross most dimensions assessed below \njustifies the move or relocation of unicorns \noriginating in the EU to the United States and \nthe United Kingdom for a greater market reach, \naccess to funding and often to tech and life \nsciences talent.\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: STARTUP GENOME (2019), Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2019\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter33/figure-33-34.xlsx\n\nFigure 3.3-34 Number of startup ecosystems in the top 30 by region, 2019\n\n12\n\n7\n\n3\n\n8\n\nUnited States EU China Other\n\n\n\n184\n\nFi\ngu\n\nre\n 3\n\n.3\n-3\n\n5 \n20\n\n19\n G\n\nlo\nba\n\nl S\nta\n\nrt\nup\n\n E\nco\n\nsy\nst\n\nem\n R\n\nan\nki\n\nng\n, b\n\ny \nca\n\nte\ngo\n\nry\n\nSc\nie\n\nnc\ne,\n\n re\nse\n\nar\nch\n\n a\nnd\n\n in\nno\n\nva\ntio\n\nn \npe\n\nrfo\nrm\n\nan\nce\n\n o\nf \n\nth\ne \n\nEU\n 2\n\n02\n0\n\nSt\nat\n\n. l\nin\n\nk: \nht\n\ntp\ns:/\n\n/e\nc.e\n\nur\nop\n\na.\neu\n\n/in\nfo\n\n/s\nite\n\ns/\nin\n\nfo\n/fi\n\nle\ns/\n\nsr\nip\n\n/2\n02\n\n0/\npa\n\nrti\n/c\n\nha\npt\n\ner\n33\n\n/fi\ngu\n\nre\n-3\n\n3-\n35\n\n.xl\nsx\n\nEc\nos\n\nys\nte\n\nm\nva\n\nlu\ne\n\nEx\nits\n\nSt\nar\n\ntu\np \n\nou\ntp\n\nut\nSt\n\nar\ntu\n\np \nsu\n\ncc\nes\n\ns\nAc\n\nce\nss\n\nQu\nal\n\nity\nGl\n\nob\nal\n\n \nre\n\nac\nh\n\nLo\nca\n\nl \nre\n\nac\nh\n\nIP\n C\n\nom\nm\n\nGl\nob\n\nal\nLo\n\nca\nl\n\nIn\nfr\n\na-\nst\n\nru\nct\n\nur\ne\n\nTe\nch\n\n: \nAc\n\nce\nss\n\nTe\nch\n\n: \nQu\n\nal\nity\n\nLi\nfe\n\n \nsc\n\nie\nnc\n\nes\n: \n\nac\nce\n\nss\n\nLi\nfe\n\n \nsc\n\nie\nnc\n\nes\n: \n\nqu\nal\n\nity\n1\n\nSi\nlic\n\non\n V\n\nal\nle\n\ny\n2\n\nN\new\n\n Y\nor\n\nk \nCi\n\nty\nLo\n\nnd\non\n\nBe\niji\n\nng\n5\n\nBo\nst\n\non\nTe\n\nl A\nvi\n\nv\nLo\n\ns \nAn\n\nge\nle\n\ns\n8\n\nSh\nan\n\ngh\nai\n\n9\nPa\n\nri\ns\n\n10\nBe\n\nrl\nin\n\n11\nSt\n\noc\nkh\n\nol\nm\n\n12\nSe\n\nat\ntl\n\ne\n13\n\nTo\nro\n\nnt\no-\n\nW\nat\n\ner\nlo\n\no\n14\n\nSi\nng\n\nap\nor\n\ne\n15\n\nAm\nst\n\ner\nda\n\nm\n-S\n\nta\nrt\n\nup\nD\n\nel\nta\n\n16\nAu\n\nst\nin\n\n17\nCh\n\nic\nag\n\no\n18\n\nBa\nng\n\nal\nor\n\ne\n19\n\nW\nas\n\nhi\nng\n\nto\nn \n\nD\nC\n\n20\nSa\n\nn \nD\n\nie\ngo\n\n21\nD\n\nen\nve\n\nr-\nBo\n\nul\nde\n\nr\n22\n\nLa\nus\n\nan\nne\n\n-B\ner\n\nn-\nG\n\nen\nev\n\na\n23\n\nSy\ndn\n\ney\n24\n\nVa\nnc\n\nou\nve\n\nr\n25\n\nH\non\n\ng \nKo\n\nng\nAt\n\nla\nnt\n\na\nBa\n\nrc\nel\n\non\na\n\nD\nub\n\nlin\nM\n\nia\nm\n\ni\nM\n\nun\nic\n\nh\n\nTA\nLE\n\nNT\n\n6 \n&\n\n 7\n\n26\n-\n\n30\n\nPE\nRF\n\nOR\nM\n\nAN\nCE\n\nFU\nND\n\nIN\nG\n\nM\nAR\n\nKE\nT \n\nRE\nAC\n\nH\nCO\n\nNN\nEC\n\nTE\nDN\n\nES\nS\n\nRu\nnn\n\ner\ns-\n\nup\n\n\n\n185\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\nFour of the 20 most developed startup \nlife sciences ecosystems can be found in \nthe EU.

Presence of zombie firms is still problematic \nin some Member States, while others have \nundertaken a de-leveraging process\n\n14 See Bauer et al. (2020).\n15 Source: Hallak et al. (2018).\n\nRigidities in the market limiting their \nwell-functioning may lead to capital \nand resources locked in so-called \n\u2018zombie firms\u2019. This means that these \nresources could have improved economic \nperformance had they been redirected \ntowards higher-productivity firms. Overall, \nthe shares of zombie firms have increased \nin the aftermath of the crisis and while \nthere has been progress in some countries \nin recent years via, for example, a more \neffective deleveraging process, in others \nzombie firms continue to rise, especially \nin the services sector. Zombie firms are \ncompanies that survive in the market without \nbeing profitable in the long run because of \nexternal support that \u2018keeps them artificially \nalive\u2019 (European Commission, 2018). The \nconsequence is the use of resources by non-\nproductive firms that might otherwise have \nbeen used by more-productive companies, \nultimately leading to productivity growth.\n\nFigure 3.3-39 shows the evolution of \nthe average shares of zombie firms \nduring three different periods, both in \nmanufacturing and services14. Right in the \naftermath of the crisis (i.e. 2008-2010) the \nshares of zombies in the manufacturing sector \nwere highest in Portugal, Italy and Spain, and \nzombie firms were mostly prevalent in the \nservices sector in Portugal, Sweden and Spain. \nLooking at their evolution over time, overall \nshares have continued to rise, particularly in the \nservices sector; exceptions include Portugal, for \nexample. Even though the incidence of zombie \n\nfirms is typically higher in manufacturing, the \ngap with services is limited apart from Finland.\n\nThe EU Member States with the highest \nincidence of zombie firms in the period \n2011-2013, namely Spain, Italy and \nPortugal, have more recently experienced \na decline in their share across sectors, the \nlargest drop being reported by Portugal. \nThis phenomenon was accompanied by an \nincrease in the firms\u2019 profitability as well \nas the de-leveraging of zombie firms15. \nSince 2013, the weight of zombie firms has \nbeen on the decline in Spain, Italy and Portugal, \nfor all the sectors covered by Figure 3.3-39. \nThese EU Member States had the highest \nshares in 2008-2010. \n\nZombie firms were found mainly in the \nconstruction \u2013 real estate sector but \nwere less common in the information \nand communication sector. Portugal, in \nparticular, saw the largest drop in zombie firms \nafter 2013. \n\n\n\n190\n\nFigure 3.3-39 Evolution over time of the share of zombie firms(1) in total firms  \nin the manufacturing and services sectors(2), 2008-2016\n\n%\n%\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n2008-2010 2011-2013 2014-2016\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nIta\nly\n\nSp\nain\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nServices\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n2008-2010 2011-2013 2014-2016\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nIta\nly\n\nSp\nain\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nManufacturing\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: JRC estimations based on Orbis data\nNotes: (1)A zombie firm is a firm that is at least 10 years old and has an interest coverage ratio below 1.

Incomes have risen and technology \nhas also \u2018freed\u2019 workers from certain routine \nand/or dangerous tasks, thereby providing \nmore leisure time16. But living longer also \nmeans that there is a greater concern about \nliving healthier lives and improved well-being. \nEconomic growth has also benefitted strongly \nfrom technologies that have boosted resource \nefficiency and productivity across all sectors \n(see Chapter 3.1 - Productivity puzzle and \ninnovation diffusion).\n\nWhile innovation has resulted in greater \nchoice from the growth in products and \nservices, there is an ongoing debate as to \nwhether all innovation has created value \n(and proven its relevance) for society. Kalff \nand Renda (2020) revised academic literature \non the role of innovation and noted that \u2018not \nall innovation is equally relevant for society\u2019, \narguing that entrepreneurship and innovation \nshould be the means to address the most \npressing challenges of our time (see Chapter \n1 - Megatrends and sustainability). \n\nMoreover, tech with a social purpose \ncan also drive profit as consumers are \nnow demanding a shift in the mission \nof businesses towards social good17. As \nhighlighted in Chapter 2 - Changing innovation \ndynamics in the age of digital transformation, \nconsumers increasingly want social impact \n\nto be integrated into companies\u2019 missions so \nas to achieve \u2018economic value that is inclusive \nand sustainable\u201918. Putting the emphasis on \nresponsible and ethical tech does not mean that \nproducts and services will not be scalable. On the \ncontrary, it provides a business model in which \nconsumers will have more trust. As a result, it \nalso creates new opportunities for profit that can \nmaximise social value, too.\n\nActivating a global mindset which directs \ninnovation activities towards solutions \nthat effectively address societal challenges \nis challenging but certainly necessary and \ncollectively achievable. The World Economic \nForum (2020) refers to a set of enablers which \ninclude: responsible technology governance, \nleadership to mobilise commitment and \nstandards, partnerships for collaboration and \ncollective action, public policy and regulation \nfor the Fourth Industrial Revolution, finance \nmechanisms to stimulate market solutions, \nbreakthrough innovation, including collaborative \nR&D agendas, managing data and tools, and \ncapacity development and skills. The EU is \nwell-positioned to lead in this \u2018tech-with-a-\npurpose\u2019 approach thanks to its new growth \nstrategy \u2013 the EU Green Deal \u2013 the prominence \nof the partnership approach in its Framework \nProgrammes, the support of market-creating \ninnovation with the European Innovation Council \n(EIC), etc.\n\n\n\n193\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\n7. Conclusions\n\n19 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_416\n\nBusiness dynamism plays an important role in \npromoting creative destruction in the economy, \nwhich may ultimately raise productivity growth. \nFor this reason, the decline of business \ndynamism (notably in terms of entry rates) \nin Europe and other parts of the globe may \nhamper current and future productivity \ngrowth, although the reasons for such a decline \ncan be multiple. Moreover, most jobs created \nby new firms emerged in less-productive \nsectors of the economy and hence were, in \nprinciple, lower-paid jobs. However, in some \ncountries there has been progress towards new \njob creation in more-productive sectors. \n\nEurope\u00b4s scaling-up performance needs to \nbe revamped. While the share of high-growth \nenterprises has increased over time in most EU \nMember States, there is only  a small share in \nhigh-tech, medium-high-tech manufacturing and \nhigh-tech knowledge-intensive services, although \nthis has increased in recent years. Furthermore, \nour analysis shows that when it comes to \ntech scaleups and unicorn companies, \na pronounced scaling-up gap remains \nwhen compared to the United States and \n(sometimes) China. In particular, 1.3 scaleups \nper 100 000 inhabitants in the EU compares with \n7 scaleups in the United States. Moreover, for each \nprivate unicorn in the EU, there are seven in the \nUnited States and four in China. In other words, \nthe EU only accounts for around 7 % of all private \nunicorns worldwide. The EIC in Horizon 2020 and \nHorizon Europe, the VentureEU programme, and \nthe different financial instruments available via \nthe European Investment Bank aim to tackle the \nscaling-up needs in terms of capital among EU \nstartups. Europe should capitalise on its strong \nscience and richness of ideas for innovation to \nplay a role on the global scene reflecting the \n\nEU\u2019s values and ambitions to lead in the fight \nagainst climate change, healthy societies, \nand in the digital age, to name but a few. \nIndeed, a tech-with-a-purpose approach \ncould integrate social and environmental \nconcerns in businesses\u2019 missions to ensure \nthat new products and services bring both \neconomic and societal value.\n\nThe New Industrial Strategy for Europe19 \nstresses that 'relevant players should work \ntogether to create lead markets in clean \ntechnologies and ensure our industry is a global \nfrontrunner'. This includes regulation, public \nprocurement, rules for fair competition and \ninvolving SMEs, too. In addition, the Strategy \nalso encourages place-based innovation and \nexperimentation so that regions can develop and \ntest new solutions with the involvement of both \nSMEs and consumers, capitalising on their local \nstrengths and specificities.\n\nOur research also identifies a group of 'EU \nDNA' unicorns that have started or moved \ntheir operations to the United States and \nthe United Kingdom because of the greater \navailability of capital, the intense network, \nmarket size and other benefits. However, EU \nDNA unicorns tend to keep strong connections \n\u2018back home\u2019. Although this could be seen as a  \nnormal consequence of globalisation and the \nnew phenomenon of \u2018dual companies\u2019, at the \nsame time it reflects the lower availability of risk \ncapital in the EU and barriers to scaling up related \nto the yet to be fully completed Single Market. In \naddition, in the digital age, digital infrastructure, \nnotably 5G, will also be a determinant in shaping \ninnovation and its speed in the future. Research \nand other physical infrastructure also play an \nimportant role.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_416\n\n\n194\n\nAlthough there are resilient, high-quality \nand interconnected ecosystems in the EU, \nthe United States still appears to lead \nglobally. The EU has fewer startup ecosystems \nin the top world ecosystems, including in the \nlife sciences. However, Europe appears to score \nwell in fintech, cleantech, agritech and advanced \nmanufacturing and robotics. By incentivising \nscience-business collaboration, creating and \nattracting talent, pooling public and private \nresources, promoting strategic public-private \npartnerships, etc. the EU can reach greater \ncritical mass and lead the way.\n\nThere is substantial cross-country \nvariation in entrepreneurial attitudes \nin the EU. This calls for a culture of more \ntolerance towards startup failure, widespread \nentrepreneurship education, and improving \nthe business environment in aspects including \nthe ease of starting a business, availability \nof capital, innovation-friendly regulations, \netc. The European Institute of Technology \nand the different Knowledge and Innovation \nCommunities have also played an important \nrole in this respect.\n\nA pronounced startup gender gap remains \nin the creation of innovative enterprises \nworldwide, including in Europe. The share \nof female (co)-founders is still low, despite \nsome progress over time. This calls for policies \npromoting the wider involvement of women in \nentrepreneurial activities, starting at an early \nage at school, the promotion of \u2018female role-\nmodels\u2019, a better work-life balance, greater \nfemale participation in STEM activities, and \ntackling the documented gender bias in \nthe attribution of private funding, among \nother aspects.\n\nZombie firms remain prevalent in some \nMember States, especially in services. \nAlthough there has been a delivering process \nin some countries since the crisis, in others the \npresence of zombies has been aggravated. This \nrequires careful consideration of the economic \nand financial conditions in each country.\n\n\n\n195\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 3\n\n8. References\n\nAcemoglu, D.

Rise in inequality and its perception related to \ntechnological developments\n\n1 Globalisation, demographic developments and household composition rank among other factors.\n\nInequality has been growing in most advanced \neconomies in recent years, as indicated by the \nGini coefficient of market income inequality \n(Figure 4.1-1). The index shows that inequality in \nmarket income has grown with the EU currently \nfacing similar levels of market income inequality as \nin the United States. Nevertheless, Europe remains \na more equal place to live compared to other \ncountries because the national tax and welfare \nsystems reduce the relatively high market income \ninequality. Although a substantial mitigation of \na general rise in income inequality can be observed \nin Europe, there are certain age groups or places \nof residence that face increased income inequality \n(OECD, 2019). Furthermore, phenomena such as \n\nyouth unemployment and inequality of opportunity \ncan have long-lasting effects on young people in \nmany European regions.\n\nWhile fiscal policy has a direct impact \non disposable income (i.e. after taxes and \nsocial benefits), other policies enhancing \nproductivity and real wages, or upgrading \nskills and providing equal opportunities can \nbe equally important. Technological change \nranks among the most important factors1 \naffecting income distribution as an increase \nin the demand for high-skilled employees \nleads to increases in their wage premiums and \namplifies wage dispersion (EC, 2017). \n\nFigure 4.1-1 Gini index of inequality - household market income  \n(pre-tax, pre-transfer), 1995-2016\n\nG\nin\n\ni i\nnd\n\nex\n o\n\nf \nin\n\neq\nua\n\nlit\ny\n\nJapan\n\nSouth Korea\n\nUnited States\n\nEU(1)\n\nChina\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n19\n95\n\n19\n96\n\n19\n97\n\n19\n98\n\n19\n99\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n01\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n03\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n06\n\n20\n07\n\n20\n08\n\n20\n09\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n11\n\n20\n12\n\n20\n13\n\n20\n14\n\n20\n15\n\n20\n16\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat data\nNote: (1)EU is the weighted average of the values for the EU Member States.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-1.xlsx \n\n\n\n202\n\nThis growing inequality is closely related \nto technological change that has affected \nthe distribution of production factors \ntowards higher shares of capital and \ntechnology (Figure 4.1-2). With the increasing \nability of machines \u2013 potentially reinforced \nwith contributions from artificial intelligence \n\u2013 to automate a greater number of job tasks \nperformed by humans, the distributional \nimplications increase inequality. As automation \nincreases productivity and decreases the cost of \nproduction, it can lead to deeper automation \u2013 \ni.e. further improvements to existing machinery \nin tasks that have already been automated.\n\n2 Evolution of the labour income share in the EU28 reveals a declining trend from 72 % in 1995 to around 60 % in 2015.\n\nAlthough both effects further increase demand \nfor labour, automation contributes to a higher \nincrease in outputs per worker than their wages \nand therefore the labour share in national income \ncould shrink. This would mean that the rise in real \nincomes2 resulting from automation is skewed \ntowards a narrow segment of the population \nwith much lower marginal propensity to consume \nthan those losing incomes and possibly their \njobs (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018). Such a \ntechnologically accelerated substitution of labour \nwith capital could introduce productivity gains \nwhile also reducing the labour share of income  \nand contributing to future inequalities affecting \nmostly lower-skilled workers.

As there is a gap \nbetween capital income and labour income \ntaxation, higher labour taxation could dampen \nemployment levels  and contribute to higher \ncapital accumulation. Therefore, the suggestion \nis that shifting taxes away from labour towards \ncapital could increase the labour share and lead \nto stronger overall productivity growth (JRC, \n2019a). Important policy questions relate to how \nand where to tax capital income and what might \nbe the broader economic effects of such taxation \n(Math\u00e9 et. al., 2015). \n\n2.  Broad technological uptake would have \nrepercussions for the quantity and quality of jobs\n\nWhile employment rates are at record \nhigh numbers since the crisis in many \nEuropean countries and in the United \nStates3, polarisation has appeared in \nthe job market with a significant shrinking \nof medium-skilled routine jobs and an \nincrease in high- and low-skilled jobs. With \nalmost 236 million people in employment \nin 2017, EU employment is at an all-time \nhigh and means an increase of 19.5 million \nsince 2002 (EC, 2018). This is mainly due \nto a strong increase in female employment \nas well as a higher employment rate among \nolder workers. As labour market conditions \nhave continued to improve, many countries \nhave reached values above their pre-crisis \nlevel (Figure 4.1-3). The same applies to \nunemployment rates which have continued \nto fall across the EU. In April 2019, the \nunemployment rate had dropped to 6.8 % in \nthe EU, which is the lowest level since 20084.\n\nAvailable evidence concerning the impact \nof new technological development on the \nlabour market is inconclusive5. A high level \nof uncertainty accompanies different estimates, \nas they are highly sensitive to the choice of data \nsources and the methods used to categorise \ntasks. Implications for the net displacement of \njobs will depend on the new models of work \norganisation and management of workplaces, \nincluding platform work and new unconventional \nworking arrangements. Figure 4.1-4 shows \nvarious assessments of automatable job shares, \nbut also more balanced employment effects \nwhen job-creation effects are included (Wolter et \nal. 2015; Arntz et al. 2018). \n\nWhile estimates identified a broad range \nof job shares with routine tasks, it seems \nthat automation and digitalisation are \nless likely to destroy large numbers \nof jobs in the short term. A greater \n\n\n\n204\n\ndegree of automation and data exchange in \nmanufacturing technologies will inevitably \naffect firms\u2019 strategic approaches and \norganisational models in their production and \ninnovation systems. Low-qualified and low-\nskilled workers are likely to bear the burden of \nthe adjustment costs as trends in the labour \nmarket seem to work against them. Therefore, \nthe likely challenge for the future lies in coping \nwith rising inequality and ensuring sufficient \ntraining, especially for low-qualified workers. \nTo understand the magnitude of the challenge, \nvarious attempts have been made to assess \nthe share of automatable jobs (Figure 4.1-4). \nA full understanding of broader impacts and \nreskilling needs demands factoring in issues \nsuch as adjustments in learning systems, \n\nindividual motivation, and financing schemes, \nwhich represent additional layers of complexity. \n\nWhile many of the current jobs will become \nobsolete through technology, many others \nwill change the set of performed tasks \nand new jobs will be created. The changing \ntask content of occupations introduced \nby technological innovations ranges from \ngenerally reducing the importance of physical \ntasks to higher safety standards and better-\nquality jobs (see Box 4.1-1).\n\nFigure 4.1-3 Labour force participation rate, 15-64 year-olds,  \nas % in same age group, 2006 and 2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat (online data code: \nlfsi_emp_a) and OECD data\nNote: Employment by activity - total active population as percentage of total population.

In recent decades, automation \ntechnologies have helped to significantly \nimprove health and safety across industries. \nThe quality of jobs can be broadly \n\nunderstood as a measure of the richness \nof work and creative human activity. It is \nimproved by more intellectual tasks which \nincrease the variety and stimulation. a shift \nto more work in teams along assembly \nlines helps to boost social interaction in the \nworkplace (Eurofound, 2019).\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-4.xlsx\n\n\n206\n\nNew jobs are not centred on the automation \nprocess with humans plainly assisting \nmachines or algorithms in the production \nprocess. Although many new occupations \nwill be enabled through technology, they \nwill not be technology- or machine-specific. \nNew jobs will respond to human needs and \nsocietal challenges, such as global warming or \nfood production6. The downside of this is that \neducators are often tasked with tackling the \nproblems of preparing people during education \nfor jobs that do not yet exist, eventually using \ntechnologies that have not yet been invented \nand solving problems that we have yet to \ndefine clearly (Penaluna and Rae, 2018). Any \nforecasts about the number of newly created \njobs or predictions on the net destruction of \njobs must be taken with caution (Chapter 11 \n- The consequences of AI-based technologies \nfor jobs). Replacing labour with technology is \naccompanied by countervailing mechanisms \nthat are difficult to quantify. Dedicated studies, \nsuch as that by Bruegel on the impact of \nindustrial robots on employment conclude with \ndisplacement effects, particularly significant \nfor medium-skilled workers, for example7. \nA later study by Autor and Salomons (2018) \nshows that although automation leads to job \ndisplacement in industries, it facilitates indirect \nemployment gains in customer industries and \ncontributes increasing aggregate demand, \nultimately leading to net employment growth. \nGiven the human imagination and ingenuity, \nother estimations are oriented towards more \nqualitative approaches categorising new roles \nand jobs according to their technological \nproximity, time horizon or emerging sectors of \nthe economy (Figure 4.1-5). \n\n6 Experts list jobs such as \u2018vertical farm consultant\u2019 or \u2018tidewater architect\u2019; Cognizant (2018). 42 Jobs: The Road to 2028-2029.\n7 The study examined the impact of industrial robots on employment and wages in six EU countries that account for 85.5 % \n\nof the EU market for industrial robots. The assessment was that one additional robot per thousand workers would reduce \nthe employment rate by 0.16-0.20 percentage points. The study also found a particularly strong displacement effect for \nmedium-skilled workers and for young cohorts. Chiacchio, F., Petropoulos, G. and Pichler, D. (2018), The Impact of Industrial \nRobots on EU Employment and Wages: a Local Labour Market Approach, Bruegel Working Papers, Issue 2.\n\n8 More details in the Commission report \u2018The Future of Work? Work of the Future!\u2019, a report by Michel Servoz.\n\nThe effects of an increasingly digital \neconomy, including many jobs created \nthrough the platform economy and new \nunconventional working arrangements, \nstart to emerge for a growing number of \nworkers. Permanent full-time employment \nconstitutes the largest share of employment by \nfar, although a growing incidence of less standard \nforms of employment may bring structural \nchange. Contractual stability and employment \nquality still greatly depend on industrial relations \nand coverage by collective agreements. The \nevidence shows that one in ten adults have some \nexperience of supplying goods or services on \ninternet platforms (Figure 4.1-6). The majority of \nplatform workers provide professional services \n(such as software development, translation \nservices, or writing) which demand high skill \nlevels (Gonzalez Vazquez et al., 2019).\n\nNew technologies could provide workers \nwith greater job satisfaction, but they \ncan also demand more flexibility, creating \nnew jobs that are less stable. New ways \nof working emerge on digital platforms and \nin the collaborative economy, with more part-\ntime and freelance work and self-employment. \nThe new features, such as higher degree \nof flexibility, a better work-life balance, and \nsupplementary income inevitably bring the \ntraditional employer-employee relationship \ninto question. Online platforms acting as \nintermediaries between service users and \nproviders revoke the temporary work agency \nmodel. Service providers working for the \nplatforms are considered self-employed by the \nplatform, even though the relationship between \nthem often has features of an employment \nrelationship based largely on subordination8. \n\n\n\n207\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\nWhile embracing the benefits of flexibility \nenabled by technologies, the future employee-\nemployer relationship will have to deal with \nchallenges such as rules on working time, equal \naccess to training, and other benefits. Due to \nthe slowly evolving nature of these challenges \nand a lack of robust evidence sometimes, \n\nmany national governments are responding via \npolicy experimentation. The Dutch government \nproposed to regulate self-employment with \na minimum hourly rate for self-employed \npeople, while French independent workers \nenjoy full rights to set up or participate in trade \nunions (JRC, 2019a; SZW, 2019).\n\nFigure 4.1-5 Jobs of the future along expected time horizon and tech-centricity\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Cognizant forecast based on the report 21 More Jobs of the Future (2018) \nNote: Cognizant presented 21 jobs of the future in the order they expect them to appear.

Changes in the labour market require new skills  \n\nAlthough we observe only mild symptoms \nof unemployment, further progress in ground-\nbreaking digital transformation that has \nbrought more efficient production and business \nprocesses can have a disruptive impact on \nworkers. In particular, the rise of automation \nand digital technologies is already affecting \nlabour markets, with high rates of job \npolarisation and a hollowing of medium-\nroutine tasks jobs. This trend is expected to \n\naccelerate as digital technologies become more \npervasive. At the same time, the quality of jobs \ndone by the least skilled is likely to decline, as \nis their income share. This trend appears less \npronounced in many of the new Member States \nwhere labour costs are relatively low and the \nincentives for automation are supposedly lower \n(OECD, 2017).\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-6.xlsx\n\n\n209\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\nFigure 4.1-7 Percentage point change among shares of occupational groups(1), \n1995-2018(2)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat \n(online data code: lfsa_egised) and OECD data\nNote: (1)High-skilled occupations include jobs classified under the ISCO-88 major groups 1, 2, and 3.

This \ndevelopment seems to be primarily driven by \nvery low wage growth among workers in high-\nskilled occupations in last decade or so (OECD, \n2019). The overall effect on income distribution \nis still uncertain a priori since the emergence \nof new tasks and jobs may reward workers \ndifferently across the skills spectrum. Further \nevidence suggests that workers with less than \ntertiary education have shifted towards low-\nskill occupations, including mid-skilled workers, \n\nand face a higher risk of unemployment. \nThe share of low-paid jobs is declining due \nto job polarisation and occupational shift. \nJob polarisation explains why the number of \nhighly skilled occupations grew faster than \nother occupations, while the rest of the shift \nis explained by occupational shift whereby \nseveral occupations tend to pay lower wages. \nThe overall trend in rising skill needs at lower \nlevels creates further questions about changing \nmid-level occupations and future skills defining \nthese occupations (Chatzichristou, 2018).\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-7.xlsx\n\n\n210\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nta\n\nge\n p\n\noi\nnt\n\ns\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n-10\n\nJob polarisation effect Occupational shi\ufffd Total\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns\n\nSo\nut\n\nh K\nor\n\nea\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\nIta\n\nly\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\nSp\n\nain\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nIce\nlan\n\nd\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\nFigure 4.1-8 Percentage point changes in the share of low-paid(1) jobs  \nby type of effect, 2006-2016(2)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: OECD Employment Outlook 2019\nNotes: (1)Low-paid jobs are those paying less than two thirds of the median wage, while high-paid jobs are those paying more \nthan 1.5 times the median wage.

Until recently, \nand despite massive expansion, in many countries \nthe returns for university graduates remained \nhigh. Education belongs at the core of the \ninequality debate as differences in educational \nattainment and status are important markers \nof inequalities. In turn, unequal educational \nopportunities have repercussions on social \ncohesion and mobility (EC, 2017a).\n\nWhile ICT skills seem to be slowly improv-\ning among the EU population, there is \na growing need for highly skilled IT profes-\nsionals. The best-known skills gap is perhaps \nthe digital one where the lack of IT specialists \nis growing (according to IDC and Empirica, the \nshortage is expected to reach over 749 000 by \n2020). Most jobs in the EU already require at \nleast basic digital skills (Cedefop, 2018) and \nthere is growing share of individuals with  tertiary \n education working as ICT specialists in the EU \nlabour  market (Figure 4.1-9). On the other hand, \n35 % within the overall EU labour force do not \nhave at least basic digital skills (Eurostat, 2019).\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-8.xlsx\n\n\n211\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\nFigure 4.1-9 Share of employed ICT specialists by educational attainment level (%), EU\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat (online data code: \nisoc_sks_itspe)\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-9.xlsx\n\n52 61.9\n\n48 38\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n2005 2017\n\nLess than primary, primary, secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education\n\nTertiary education\n\nThe changing content and nature of jobs \nrequire new knowledge, skills and mind -\nsets. Soft skills9 are increasingly import-\nant for all types of jobs, including those \nin the digital sector. While job- and sector-\nspecific skills remain essential to support \ncompetitiveness and innovation, transversal \nskills10, including digital skills, are increasingly \ndetermining our ability to adapt, progress \nand succeed in a fast-moving labour market. \nThe latest evidence suggests a broader set \nof skills being demanded for the digital age, \nincluding not just digital skills but softer ones \nsuch as adaptability, entrepreneurship and \nmultidisciplinarity (EPSC, 2019). This points \n\n9 Personal skills not thought to be measured by IQ or achievement tests. Their attributes receive various labels in the litera-\nture, including non-cognitive, personality traits, non-cognitive abilities, etc.\n\n10 In general, skills which have been learned in one context or to master a special situation/problem and can be transferred to \nanother context are relevant to jobs and occupations other than those they currently have or have recently had (as broadly \ndefined by Cedefop).\n\nto a solid base of social skills facilitating \ninteraction and communication with others \nas a favourable complementary asset for \nemployees in the future.\n\nMoreover, the EU labour market is already \ndemanding more soft and digital skills, and \nspecifically a combination of both. The JRC \nreport (Gonzalez Vazquez et al., 2019) showed \nthat the vast majority of occupations which \nhave expanded in recent years are in the groups \nof professionals or service and commercial \nmanagers who require a combination of ICT \nuse and soft skills, e.g. to deal with customers \nand teams.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-9.xlsx\n\n\n212\n\nFigure 4.1-10 Most-sought-after skills 2018-2019\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Cedefop\u2019s Skills-OVATE 2019\nNote: Based on analysis of online job-vacancy data in 18 EU Member States.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-10-11.xlsx\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nAdapt to changing situations\n\nCreate solutions to problems\n\nForeign languages for international careers\n\nUse Microso\ufffd Office\n\nAssist customers\n\nTeamwork principle\n\nEnglish\n\nUse a computer\n\nWork as a team\n\nAdapt to change\n\nin millions\n\nFigure 4.1-11 Share of most-sought-after skills, 2018-2019, for ICT professionals(1)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Cedefop\u2019s Skills-OVATE 2019\nNote:  (1)Shares for skills when mentioned in vacancies at the 2 digit ISCO occupation for  ICT professionals.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-10-11.xlsx\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\n\nThink creatively\n\nBusiness ICT systems\n\nTeam building\n\nForeign languages for international careers\n\nComputer programming\n\nWork as a team\n\nTeamwork principles\n\nUse a computer\n\nProject management\n\nAdapt to change\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-10-11.xlsx\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-10-11.xlsx\n\n\n213\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\n4.

If the expansion in the share \nof adults with high-level qualifications continues \nto exceed the speed of expansion in jobs \nrequiring such qualifications, tertiary graduates\u2019 \n\nprospects may deteriorate. In some countries, \nit is already evident that tertiary graduates are \nmore frequently undertaking jobs that do not \nrequire a high level of education, which also \nimplies income and career prospects that fall \nbelow the expectations for someone holding \na tertiary qualification and, on an aggregated \nlevel, leads to skill mismatch. In that context, the \nhigh numbers of highly educated people among \nplatform workers (more than 50 % of European \nplatform workers have tertiary education) are \nremarkable given that the tasks performed by \nplatform workers often do not require a high \nlevel of education (EC, 2018).\n\nFigure 4.1-12 Evolution of median equivalised net income  \nby educational attainment, EU(1)(2), 2005-2017\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat (online data code: ilc_di08)\nNotes: (1)The calculation is based on the EU 2007-2013 composition with the UK before accession of Croatia.

Therefore, developing a high-\nquality vocational learning experience \nis necessary to equip young people with \nstrong foundation skills and job-specific \nskills which are in high demand in the \nlabour market.

The gender gap is largest in the \narea of ICT specialist skills and employment: \n\nhigher qualified \u2013 around 55 % for low qualified \ncompared to 75 % for medium qualified and \n85 % for high-qualified people. It is important \nthat adult-learning systems are inclusive \nand aligned with skills needs in order to \nreach out to workers at most risk of job \nloss or displacement. More can be done in \n\nthis area as workers with jobs at significant risk \nof automation show lower participation rates \nin training (especially non-formal training) \ncompared to workers at low risk of automation \n(Figure 4.1-15). These gaps in training \nparticipation and demands of the future labour \nmarket demand coordinated policy actions.   \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-15.xlsx\n\n\n217\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\n82 % for ICT specialists and 65 % for science, \ntechnology, engineering, mathematics and ICT \ngraduates (Figure 4.1-16).\n\nWomen account for 52 % of the European \npopulation but only around 17 % of \nwomen work in ICT-related jobs. Women\u2019s \nparticipation in the development and deployment \nof AI technology, such as machine-learning \nresearchers, and in platform work is unbalanced. \na review of participants attending AI academic \nconferences reveals an under-representation \nof women in academia (19 % of conference \nauthors) as well as industry researchers (16 % of \nconference authors; Mantha and Kiser, 2019). \nOECD came to the same conclusion that software \n\ndevelopment is male dominated, especially in \ncompanies (OECD, 2018a). As regards platform \nwork in Europe, these jobs are mainly dominated \nby men and the gender gap widens with the \nimportance of platform work relative to total \nincome (Figure 4.1-17). Irrespective of the \nconcerns about job quality, more work flexibility \ncan boost employment and help parents combine \nwork with family life. The flexibility to choose \nwhere and when to work is one of the major \nadvantages of digital platforms and offers women \nthe possibility to better combine motherhood \nwith pursuing a career (OECD, 2018a).

While acknowledging the \nsize and pervasiveness of these discussions, \nthe article discusses the core argument \nrelated to the impact of information \ntechnology on the way businesses \nand organisations operate, how these \nchanges could translate to the labour \nmarket, and other potential outcomes such \nas lower wages or unemployment.\n\nThe argument begins with an introduction to \nthe two ways in which people tend to antici-\npate future developments. This either happens \nthrough estimates based on prior experience \n(commonly known as forecasting) or through \na belief in a real uncertainty of future develop-\nments and reliance on other kinds of evidence \nbesides traditional forecasts. The article maps \nthe projected impact of technological uptake \non the labour markets and reviews the em-\npirical evidence. It touches upon many of the \nabove-discussed trends, such as skill-biased \ntechnological change or routine-biased techno-\nlogical change and their implications for skills \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter41/figure-41-18.xlsx\n\n\n220\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nTechnological developments accompanied \nby growing computing power and the greater \navailability of big data are shifting the \nboundaries of what can be automated by \nmachines and could further reduce the costs \nof automation, in particular of so-called routine \ntasks. Although employment levels have not \ndeclined, other trends, such as the polarisation \nof labour markets with a declining share \nof medium-skilled occupations, have \nemerged across advanced economies. This \nsuggests that the technological potential \nshould not be equated with the actual impact \non employment as this depends on specific \ncircumstances. For example, a wider diffusion \nof technology is a necessary precondition for \nany broader occurrence of technology-driven \nemployment effects. Furthermore, the evolving \nset of tasks within occupations can reshuffle \nthe existing pool of jobs and the expected \njob-creation effects are currently difficult to \nquantify. In general, many of the developments \nin employment between occupations or \nwhole industries introduced by cutting-edge \ntechnologies are related to structural \nchange within economies towards more \nproductive and innovative activities.\n\nThe various challenges in the field of education \nand training require actions from multiple \nstakeholders. Better labour market intelli-\ngence that helps anticipate change and \npromotes innovation, new angles to \nlifelong learning and adult education that \nemphasise inclusiveness, or contributions \nby technologies to the training process \nrank among the priorities. More focused \ntraining and qualification measures may help \nworkers to target expanding occupations in \na technology-rich environment and reduce the \npotential losses of those working in shrinking \noccupations, although this will depend on \nthe accuracy and level (sectoral or company \nspecific) of forecasts. \n\nExploring how to better align innovation and \nskills policy is increasingly relevant and some \ninitial efforts have taken place, for example \nthrough the Skills Agenda, Sectoral Skills \nAlliances projects and, more recently, through the \nVocational Excellence initiative. The definition \nand diffusion of skills, along with new high-\nquality knowledge and technologies, could \nsupport structural change and provide solutions \nto global challenges. However, this would \nrequire that policies supporting innovation and \nskills, both at the EU and national level, become \nincreasingly more synergetic.\n\ndemand. With an historic perspective, the art-\nicle argues that predictions based on the past \nmay be less relevant in the current context. \nAlthough new equipment and practices could \neliminate certain jobs, on balance they do not \nnecessarily destroy jobs because their overall \neffects on improving productivity and overall \nwealth create jobs elsewhere. \n\nTo understand why assumptions claiming \nthat the future is like the past are not correct \nand extrapolations from prior experiences \nare unlikely to be accurate predictors of the \nfuture, read Chapter 11 - The consequences \nof AI-based technologies for jobs.\n\n\n\n221\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\n7.

While \nmany of the capital regions witnessed fast \nconvergence, other regions have shown lit-\ntle progress and their labour productivity \nis slowing down. This suggests the import-\nance of R&I as a new growth engine for \n innovation-driven productivity growth in \nless-developed and transition regions.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Negative economic developments paired with \nthe impact of globalisation and technological \nchange on disadvantaged groups, i.e. the \nolder and less educated, living in industrial \nor decaying areas, have led to a set of local \neconomic conditions known as the geography \nof discontent.\n\n What does it mean for policy?\n\n\u00dd\u00dd European innovation policy must place \na greater emphasis on promoting innov-\nation in less-developed and transition \nregions to trigger economic dynamism \nthat would increase the competitiveness of \nthe EU as a whole and close the innovation \ndivide.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Policymakers need to align policies targeted \nat improving R&I capacities and territorial \ninequalities with greater coordination \nat all levels. These include aligned R&I \npolicies and Cohesion Policy, together with \neducation and training.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd With substantial variation across EU \nregions in terms of institutional quality, \nimprovements in institutional quality \nand integration of smart specialisation \nstrategies into regional development \nstrategies would improve the efficiency of \nR&I programmes, combat corruption and \npromote innovation.\n\n\n\n227\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\n1.  Regional research and innovation systems show \nsigns of convergence\n\n1 Data on sectoral R&D expenditure based on sector of performance, hence business spending also includes money coming \nfrom public budgets and vice versa.\n\nR&D-intensive regions\n\nIn general, R&D intensity is high in west-\nern and northern Europe with some \nwell-performing regions in other parts \nof Europe, too. A closer look at the type of \nexpenditure and the spending dynamism \nreveals specific patterns. As economies become \nmore knowledge-based and dependent on \nintangible assets, economies and firms achieve \nlarge returns on R&D investments which also \nhelp to create new and better jobs. However, \nthe latest literature concludes that R&D \ninvestment does not trigger the same returns \neverywhere. The reasons for this include the \ndistance to the technological frontier and \nthe related creation and distribution of new \nknowledge. The following maps show to what \ndegree the core R&D-performing areas attract \nand concentrate resources. \n\nR&D investment shows a high concentration \nof spending in regions with high R&D \nintensity. Within countries, there is strong \nconcentration (in absolute terms) of R&D \nexpenditure in a few regions, typically \ncapital regions or those with large urban \nagglomerations. The R&D-to-GDP ratio provides \nan insight into contributions from public budgets1 \nand private actors during the economic cycle. \nWhile business R&D trends traditionally depend \non business expectations, public R&D is expected \n\nto be more counter-cyclical, buffering the effects \nof economic downturns (OECD, 2014). Currently, \nthe intensity of R&D spending across EU regions \nvaries considerably with highly intensive regions \nin the west and north of Europe, often as a result \nof being endowed with headquarters of large tech \ncompanies (Figure 4.2-1). As these indicators \nare related to GDP, eastern European countries \nshowed strong economic growth and many \nregions also experienced growth in R&D intensity. \nThe absolute amount of R&D expenditure (as \nwell as the number of patents in the region) in \neastern Europe as a whole and in many of its \nregions has clearly increased (Figure 4.2-2). On \nthe other hand, some of the regions with high \nR&D intensity have continued to expand their \nR&D expenditure which means the distance to \nthe top-performing regions has not decreased \nsignificantly. There are some noticeable \nexceptions of regions with high absolute amounts \nof R&D and lower R&D intensity, representing \nrelatively large regions, including, for example \nCatalunya (ES51), Lazio (ITI4), Lombardia (ITC4), \nor mid-sized regions with a high GDP per capita \n(e.g. Southern and Eastern Ireland (IE02). On the \nother hand, there are (smaller) regions with small \nabsolute amounts of R&D expenditure that are \nactually very R&D intensive, e.g. \u00d6vre Norrland \n(SE33) and K\u00e4rnten (AT21). \n\n\n\n228\n\nFigure 4.2-1 R&D intensity (2017 or latest available)2\n\n2 The maps across this chapter divide regional values of selected indicator into five quintiles according to their performance \n(0-20% the lowest quintile).\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat (online data code: rd_e_gerdreg)\nNote: R&D intensity of UK, IS, NO:2016; BE, IE, LT: 2015; FR: 2013.

Business-driven R&D ex-\npenditure is expected to play an important role \nin higher EU competitiveness and job creation \n(EC, 2014) and to reduce the EU\u2019s innovation gap \n(EC, 2017). Furthermore, the ultimate objective \nis to accompany the transition of those regions \nand workers most affected by globalisation and \nindustrial developments and to facilitate their \ntransition to a low-carbon and circular economy \n(JRC, 2018). Despite certain convergence trends \nin regions\u2019 business R&D intensity, the latest data \n\n3 Among the sample of 1 000 EU top spenders, 899 companies are based in the top 10 Member States, accounting for 97.1 % \nof total R&D. Moreover, the overall performance of the EU 1 000 group is largely driven by the results of companies based in \nGermany, France and the UK, accounting for 61 % of companies, 68 % of the total R&D, and 68 % of total net sales.\n\n4 The main NUTS2 reference region is Stuttgart DE11 (share of the EU, 2017).\n\nsuggest a persisting concentration of R&D \nexpenditure in more-developed central lo-\ncations. Business R&D expenditure is even more \nconcentrated in more-developed regions with \na strong concentration in relatively few inter-\nnationally active technology companies. Germany, \nthe UK and France contribute to two thirds of total \nEU28 business R&D with a strong contribution \nfrom the automotive sector in Germany, pharma-\nceuticals in the UK, whilst France has a relatively \n balanced sector composition (JRC, 2018)3. Cur-\nrently, more-developed regions represent about \n85 % of R&D expenditure in the EU, transition \nregions about 10 % and less-developed regions \nabout 5 %. One example is Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, \nwhich has about 2 % of the EU population but an \n8 % concentration of the EU\u2019s business R&D4. \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter42/figure-42-3.xlsx\n\n\n231\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\nSome upward convergence in R&D ex-\npenditure can be observed in many regions \nin central, eastern and south-eastern \nEuropean countries (CESEE). Notably, regions \nsuch in Czechia, Hungary and Slovakia show \nan increase in business R&D intensity which \nseems to be driven by business R&D spending \nin the automotive and ICT sectors5 (Figure \n4.2-4.). Business R&D intensity in several \nregions in Greece \u2013 where recovery from the \nsevere crisis has set in \u2013 is also increasing. In \nmany regions of eastern and southern Europe, \n\n5 Expenditure in the areas of manufacturing motor vehicles and information technologies represents 36 % of overall business \nR&D expenditure in Czechia and 33 % in Slovakia.\n\nR&D expenditure has risen steadily in recent \nyears, linked to a structural shift to more \nknowledge-intensive activities and expected \nreturns on R&D investment. Although many \nless-developed regions began to grow from \n(and were facilitated by) low starting levels, \nhigh growth rates brought several regions closer \nto the performance of frontier regions.

This pattern of innovation-\nlagging regions that invest less in R&D and of \ninnovation-leaders forging ahead with public \nR&D spending resembles the earlier observed \npatterns at the national level (Veugelers, 2014). \nIn particular, Sweden, Germany and Denmark \nincreased their public expenditure on R&D during \nthe financial crisis by a higher degree than in \n\nthe case of other public expenditures, and this \ntrend seems to persist since then (Figure 4.2-5). \nIn regions that are seemingly too far from the \ntechnological frontier and that may have a weak \nindustrial fabric, increasing the R&D effort alone \ndoes not always yield greater economic growth. \nAn earlier work identified regions, which failed \nto achieve economic growth that would be at all \nproportional to the regions\u2019 increases in public \nR&D investment (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2014).\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter42/figure-42-5.xlsx\n\n\n233\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\nScientific publications\n\nMany of the lagging regions, mostly in east-\nern and southern Europe, have observed \nan improvement of their performance in \nscientific output, which indicates improved \nreturns on R&D investment.

Better performance in \ndesigns can be found, for example, in the \nPolish regions of Ma\u0142opolskie (PL21) and \nWielkopolskie (PL41), while trademarks play \na prominent role in Andalucia (ES61) and in \nmany Bulgarian regions (Figures 4.2-11 and \n4.2-12). Bulgaria already outperforms the EU \naverage as regards trademarks and design \napplications per unit of GDP. The changes in \ndesign and trademark applications over time \nshow high growth rates in many regions \nof eastern and southern Europe and imply \na catching-up process by some regions. \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter42/figure-42-11.xlsx\n\n\n239\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit\nNote: Data produced by Science-Metrix using data from the EUIPO database.

Nevertheless, \nslower productivity growth over the last 10 \nyears, notably in some less-developed and \ntransition regions, explains the slowdown \nin the convergence process (Figure 4.2-\n18). Within the less-developed regions, there is \na tendency for stronger growth rates in regions \nthat started from lower levels, reflecting the \nconvergence process. Nevertheless, despite \ntheir strong growth rates, all less-developed \nregions show levels of labour productivity that \nremain below the EU average (except Basilicata \nregion in Italy)10. Over the last two decades, \nlabour productivity growth rate has been higher \nin the low-developed regions (mainly CESEE) \nthan in the EU. However, since the onset of the \nglobal financial and economic crises, several \ncountries in the region have experienced low \nlevels of labour productivity growth \u2013 in some \ncases, such as Slovenia and Hungary, labour \nproductivity growth was even lower than \nthe EU average. Regional productivity went \nthrough the same development and, after \na convergence period, notably in the period \n2000-2009, progress came to a halt after the \ncrisis and there has only been a slight increase \nin divergence since 2013.\n\n10 The region of Basilicata has 0.57 million inhabitants but is home to a plant in Melfi where Fiat invested EUR 1 billion to \nboost production. This plant, with 8 000 employees, plays a big part in Basilicata\u2019s economy and is responsible for the recent \nboost in the region\u2019s economic output.\n\n11 Labour productivity calculations based on output-weighted average Eurostat data for capital regions and other regions with \ncities with over 0.5 million inhabitants, for the period 2010-2017.\n\n12 Metropolitan regions are NUTS3 regions or a combination of NUTS3 regions which represent all agglomerations of at least \n250 000 inhabitants.\n\nThere is a mixed evidence on productivity \ngrowth in the European metropolitan and \ncapital regions11,12. Capital regions in the east \nof the EU show the fastest productivity growth, \nwhile productivity has been shrinking in capital \ncities across the centre and south of the EU. \nProductivity growth in capital regions was \nnotably slow in southern Europe (EL, PT, IT, ES) \nand in centrally located EU countries (AT, DE), \nwhere it fell between 2010 and 2017. \n\nThe potential of leading (superstar) \ncities and regions that benefit from \nagglomeration economies and have access \nto the intangible assets and human capital \nrequired by the increasing complexity of \ninnovation is likely to gain in importance. \nThe overall productivity growth in the United \nStates has slowed considerably, accompanied \nby a stark gap between the high productivity \nof the relatively few metropolitan areas with \nvery high shares of innovation industries and \nthose without them (Atkinson et al., 2019). The \nEuropean mapping of most specialised areas \nin innovation industries and the presence of \nlarge local innovation sectors that spur metro-\nwide productivity requires closer examination. \nFrom the initial observations, low and declining \nproductivity growth in the service sector and \na shift from industry to services contribute \nmainly to dampening down productivity growth \nin capital regions and other regions with \nlarge cities.\n\n\n\n247\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\nFigure 4.2-18 Labour productivity (GVA per person worked), 2017 and compound \nannual growth 2010-2017(1)(2)(3)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on DG for Regional and Urban Policy data\nNotes: (1)EL+PL regions labour productivity value 2016 and growth 2010-2016.

Although there are many \nfactors  explaining TFP growth, ranging \nfrom how institutions function and the rule \nof law (see more on institutional quality in \nChapter 8 - Framework Conditions) to better \ninfrastructure or high levels of education, \nTFP growth in high-income countries and \nregions is typically supported by a high level \nof technological advancement and innovation. \n\n13 According to Regulation 1303/2013, the classification of regions into three categories shall be determined on the basis \nof how the GDP per capita of each region, measured in purchasing power parities (PPS) and calculated on the basis of EU \nfigures for the period 2007-2009, relates to the average GDP of the EU for the same reference period.\n\nBusiness enterprise R&D (BERD), as a proxy for \ninnovation capacity, is highly correlated with \nTFP for high-income regions, whose prosperity \nrely on the ability to innovate (Figure 4.2-21). \n\nMore focus on R&I-driven growth and \ninnovation diffusion would support \nproductivity growth.

This growth \nmodel will need to be based on new innovation \nactivities that move beyond the traditional \ndrivers of economic growth in the regions. The \nemigration of skilled labour and insufficient \nhome-produced innovation create risks for \nthe sustainability of the convergence process \nin less-developed regions, making the case \nfor building up innovation capacity. Without \ncounteraction, the underdeveloped regional \ninnovation systems, skills gap and poor \ninstitutional quality will undermine the growth \npotential of these lagging regions (EC, 2017b). \n\n14 As the classification of regional income groups differs, the \u2018Seventh report on economic, social and territorial cohesion\u2019 refers \nto the medium-income group of regions with a GDP per head of 75-120 % of the EU average.\n\nThe group of some less-developed and mainly \ntransition regions is immediately associated \nwith the risk of falling into a \u2018middle-income \ntrap\u2019. With higher productivity and wages, they \nbecome less attractive for labour-intensive or \nlow-skilled activities. These regions show the \nlowest GDP growth, mainly because they are \nneither very low cost nor particularly innovative \nor productive. This implies that the transition \nregions14 are not innovative enough to compete \nwith the most-productive and developed \nregions of Europe and the world, while their \ncost levels are too high to compete with low-\ncost, less-developed regions (EC, 2017a). \n\nFigure 4.2-21 Total factor productivity - compound annual growth,  \n2004-2014 business R&D intensity, 2005(1)(2)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on DG EMPL and Eurostat\nNotes: (1)Based on data for 243 European NUTS2 regions.

This is mainly driven by the \ndissatisfaction of those who are most affected \nby the negative impact of technological \nchange, i.e. the older and less educated, living \nin industrial or decaying areas (Iammarino et \nal., 2018). The perceived risks are of concern \nas technological developments can contribute \nto the displacement of some current jobs, while \nmany of the emerging and future jobs require \na special set of conditions, as described above.\n\nFigure 4.2-22 Share of jobs at high risk of automation across regions, 2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: OECD - Job Creation and Local Economic Development 2018, based on Nedelkoska and Quintini (2018) and national Labour Force \nSurveys (2016)\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter42/figure-42-22.xlsx\n\nHelsinki-Uusimaa\nStockholm\n\nD\nel\n\naw\nar\n\ne\n\nLo\nnd\n\non\n\nPr\nag\n\nue\n\nCa\npi\n\nta\nl R\n\n.\n\n\u00cele\n-d\n\ne-\nFr\n\nan\nce\n\nFl\nem\n\nis\nh \n\nBr\nab\n\nan\nt\n\nLa\nzi\n\no\n\nCa\nst\n\nill\na-\n\nLa\n M\n\nan\nch\n\na\n\nSo\nut\n\nhe\nrn\n\n a\nnd\n\n E\nas\n\nte\nrn\n\nEa\nst\n\n A\nus\n\ntr\nia\n\nM\naz\n\nov\nia At\n\ntic\na\n\nW\nes\n\nte\nrn\n\n S\nlo\n\nve\nni\n\na\n\nBr\nat\n\nis\nla\n\nva\n R\n\neg\nio\n\nn\n\nEa\nst\n\ner\nn \n\nan\nd \n\nN\nor\n\nth\ner\n\nn \nFi\n\nnl\nan\n\nd\n\nSm\nal\n\nan\nd \n\nw\nith\n\n Is\nla\n\nnd\ns\n\nN\nev\n\nad\na\n\nN\nor\n\nth\ner\n\nn \nIre\n\nla\nnd\n\nCe\nnt\n\nra\nl M\n\nor\nav\n\nia\n\nSo\nut\n\nhe\nrn\n\n D\nen\n\nm\nar\n\nk\n\nCh\nam\n\npa\ngn\n\ne-\nAr\n\nde\nnn\n\ne\n\nW\nes\n\nt \nFl\n\nan\nde\n\nrs\n\nM\nar\n\nch\ne\n\nM\nur\n\nci\na\n\nBo\nrd\n\ner\n, M\n\nid\nla\n\nnd\n a\n\nnd\n W\n\nes\nte\n\nrn\n\nW\nes\n\nt \nAu\n\nst\nria\n\nSw\nie\n\nto\nkr\n\nzy\nsk\n\nie\n\nCe\nnt\n\nra\nl G\n\nre\nec\n\ne\n\nEa\nst\n\ner\nn \n\nSl\nov\n\nen\nia\n\nW\nes\n\nt \nSl\n\nov\nak\n\nia\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nFla\nnd\n\ner\ns (\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n)\n\n  It\naly\n\nSp\nain\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nLowest-performing region Highest-performing region\n\n%\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter42/figure-42-22.xlsx\n\n\n252\n\nJobs are increasingly becoming concen-\ntrated in a smaller number of capital or \nmetropolitan regions. The large regional \ndifferences and concentration of new jobs in \ncapital regions favour imbalances in employment \ndevelopments. In Finland, Denmark and Ireland, \nmore than 80 % of net job creation between \n2006 and 2016 took place in the capital region \n(OECD, 2018). Many of the new jobs were created \nin new industries, e.g. the number of jobs in the \nICT sector for the period 2010-2017 increased \nby 72 % in Bucharest, 31 % in Berlin and 27 % \nin Stockholm15. Although the 6 % share of ICT \nemployment across EU capital regions remains \n\n15 Employment by economic activity in NUTS2 regions. Estonia and Malta show even higher increases in ICT jobs.\n16 Wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food service activities.\n\nsmall compared to approximately 25 % in retail \nand services16, there are structural changes \nthat will require targeted efforts to create an \nattractive environment for highly skilled jobs \nand growing industries across the regions. The \ntransfer of skills and knowledge from mature \nindustries often enables the emergence of \nnew industries, but in cases of more radical \ntechnological change, the new industries draw \ndirectly from R&D (Storper et al., 2015).  \n\nTo find out more, see Chapter 12 - The research \nand innovation divide in the EU and its economic \nconsequences.\n\nSummary of Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez-Pose\u2019s Chapter 12 - The research \nand innovation divide in the EU and its economic consequences  \n\nThis contribution looks at the economic \nconsequences of the R&I divide \nacross EU regions and highlights the \npolicy challenge they represent. It reviews \nthe theoretical factors behind current \nlevels of territorial polarisation, maps the \ncurrent state of this divide and presents \nan econometric approach to identifying \nthe effects. \n\nThe core of the argument is that R&D in -\nvestment alone does not trigger the \nsame returns on investment every-\nwhere because of several factors. \nThese are linked to the cost of technology \naccessibility in different places, the distance \nto the technological frontier, positive \nexternalities from larger and denser \nregions, the quality of local institutions, and \nhampered knowledge sharing. \n\nMany of these factors disadvantage the \nless-developed regions in their efforts to \n\nbroaden their innovation capacities with \nthe aim of unleashing greater economic \nactivity and growth. Nevertheless, most of \nthe R&D growth in less-developed regions \nhas been in the higher education sector, \nwhich has led to a substantial improvement \nin scientific output. The chapter discusses \nhow to improve the efficiency of investment \nin R&I systems and strengthen innovation-\ndriven economic growth. \n\nIn its conclusions, the chapter not only \ndiagnoses the situation but also suggests \nelements of innovation policy for less-\ndeveloped regions. These aim at closing \nthe innovation divide between \nmore- and less-developed areas \nin the EU and increasing the EU\u2019s \ncompetitiveness through a stronger role \nfor innovation as a trigger of economic \ndynamism.\n\n\n\n253\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 4\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nEconomic dynamism and productivity growth \noften depend on the implementation of struc-\ntural policies, which do not take regional \nconditions into account. This implies an import-\nant role for further place-based policies to \nboost underutilised regional potential and \nstrengthen regional innovation systems. \nTo deliver on this ambitious innovation agenda, \npolicymakers must align policies targeted \nat improving R&I capacities and territorial \ninequalities with greater coordination at \nall levels. These include R&I policies and \nCohesion Policy, together with education and \ntraining implemented through a broad range of \ninstruments. \n\nEuropean policies must put greater emphasis \non promoting innovation combined with \nmore focus on the local context to trigger \neconomic dynamism in less-developed regions. \nAn ambitious innovation agenda at the regional \nlevel should not focus solely on comparing \nperformance with more-advanced regions but \nmust embed local issues. Place-based approach \nin promoting innovation, especially the diffusion \nand commercialisation of existing innovation \nin lagging regions, is essential and should be \nsupported in line with the specificities of each \n\nregion and its current or possible comparative \nadvantages as mapped in \u2018smart specialisation \nstrategies\u2019. Effective public support for inno-\nvation must understand the specificities of \nboth the national and regional innovation \nsystems and build on these. Furthermore, \nthe substantial variation across EU regions in \nterms of institutional performance calls for \nimprovements in institutional quality. \nThe local authorities play a major role in well-\ntailored innovation strategies as well as in \nthe efficiency of R&I programmes, combating \ncorruption and tackling market failures such as \nthe weak take-up of technology.\n\nPolicy in lagging regions can contribute \nto improving economic competences, \nespecially managerial competences in firms, \nincluding internal processes and organisational \nstructure, and building technological \ncapacities, for example, by supporting \ntechnology transfer. The reinforcement \nof local R&D capacities and pursuit of \nradical innovation can be targeted by a mix \nof initiatives, such as public procurement for \ninnovation on the demand side or dedicated \nsupply-side measures.  \n\n\n\n254\n\n5.

The EU\u2019s target \nof devoting 3 % of its GDP to R&D activities \nand further national targets have mobilised \nincreasing resources for R&D in the last two \ndecades. In addition, R&D intensity targets have \nled to the portfolio of R&I support instruments \nbecoming more complex, experimentation with \nnew policies, and greater attention to impact \nassessment and evaluation (Box 5.1-1). \n\n2 The R&D objective set at the EU level is expressed in terms of R&D intensity which measures the share of GDP invested in R&D.\n3 At the 2002 Barcelona Summit, the European Council agreed that the EU should set the objective of devoting 3 % of its \n\nGDP to R&D activities by 2010. In 2010, this target became one of five headline targets in the Europe 2020 Strategy to be \nachieved by 2020 (European Commission, 2010).\n\nAlthough R&D expenditure in the EU has \nbeen increasing annually by 1 % since 2000, \nit remains lower than the 3 % Europe 2020 \ntarget, and visibly below the performance of \nmost of its main competitors. At the EU level, \nR&D intensity increased from 1.81 % in 2000 to \n2.19 % in 2018. However, to meet the 3 % target \nby 2020, its R&D intensity would have to increase \nby more than 10 % per year. R&D as a share of \nGDP in the EU is smaller than in South Korea \n(4.53 %), Japan (3.26 %) and the United States \n(2.83 %). China has more than doubled its R&D \nintensity since 2000 and in 2018 its R&D-to-GDP \nratio was equal to the EU's (Figure 5.1-2).\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n01\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n03\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n06\n\n20\n07\n\n20\n08\n\n20\n09\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n11\n\n20\n12\n\n20\n13\n\n20\n14\n\n20\n15\n\n20\n16\n\n20\n17\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nG\n\nD\nP\n\nEU\nUnited States(3)\n\nChina(4)\n\nJapan(2)\n\nSouth Korea(1)\n\n20\n18\n\nFigure 5.1-2 Evolution of R&D intensity, 2000-2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat (online data code: rd_e_gerdtot), OECD (Research and Development Statistics)\nNotes: (1)South Korea: There is a break in series between 2007 and the previous years.

The objective of investing \n3 % of GDP in R&D was first set at the 2002 \nBarcelona European Council with the aim of \nturning the EU into the most competitive and \ndynamic knowledge-based economy in the \nworld by 2010. The ambition was reset in the \nEurope 2020 Strategy with a focus to \u2018increase \ncombined public and private investment in R&D \nto 3 % of GDP\u2019 by 2020. \n\nThe Commission has monitored Member \nStates\u2019 progress through the yearly European \nSemester cycle. At the beginning of 2020, the \nEU is still a long way from meeting its target. \nAlthough it has made progress over the past \ndecade, the United States and key competitors \nin Asia invest in R&D at a higher rate than the \n\nEU. In order to reach an investment in R&D \ncorresponding to 3 % of its GDP, the EU would \nneed to invest an additional EUR 110 billion per \nyear (Figure 5.1-3).\n\nAlthough the EU has not fulfilled its R&D \ninvestment ambition, the 3 % target has \nproven to have had a clear mobilising effect \nas all Member States have set their own \nnational targets. It has also stimulated \nreflections across Member States on their \neconomic model and policy mix. It is a strong \nindicator within the European Semester that \nhas provided a stimulus to the EU\u2019s R&I, \ngrowth and competitiveness policy. It is also \nan essential compass that can help accelerate \nthe transition towards an environmentally, \nsocially and economically sustainable Europe. \n\nFigure 5.1-3 R&D investment gap in EU\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat  \n(online data code: rd_e_gerdtot)\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter51/figure-51-3.xlsx\n\n113 111\n105 106 106\n\n108 112\n111\n\n109\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nEU\nR \n\nbi\nlli\n\non\n \n\nR&D investment gap Total EU R&D Target: 3% of GDP\n\n\n\n262\n\nEU R&D intensity is largely influenced by \na limited number of big countries4: namely, \n61 % of the EU\u2019s R&D expenditure in \n2018 was performed in Germany, France \nand Italy. R&D expenditure in the other EU \ncountries together has increased by 5 % since \n2000 (Figure 5.1-4). However, Germany alone \nstill accounts for almost the same amount \nof R&D spending as other 24 Member States \ncombined. Hence, to a large extent, the overall \nEU R&D intensity is determined by its value in \nthese three countries. If they do not set more \nambitious targets and move forward, EU R&D \nintensity will not change drastically. \n\nR&D intensity increased over the 2000-\n2018 period in 24 Member States. Despite \nthis obvious progress, most Member \nStates remained far from their national \n2020 targets. The intensity of R&D spending \n\n4 The levels of R&D expenditure in Germany, France and Italy play an important part in aggregate EU R&D intensity.\n5 van Pottelsberghe, 2008.\n6 In 2000, the R&D intensity in Cyprus was 0.23 %, Greece 0.56 %, Estonia 0.6 %, Hungary 0.79 % and Poland 0.64 %.\n7 In 2000, the R&D intensity in Sweden was 3.91 % and Finland 3.25 %.\n\nacross EU Member States varies considerably, \nwith national R&D intensity ranging from \n0.5 % in Romania to 3.3 % in Sweden. To \na large extent, these big differences can be \nexplained by their industrial specialisations, \nquality of academic research environment, \nand access to a large integrated technology \nmarket5.

Conversely, in the most-\nresearch-intensive countries, the business \nsector is the predominant source of funds. \nBusinesses will invest where public policies are \nbest, and where there are sufficient human \nresources and good research capacities. \nHence, how much the private sector invests in \na particular country relies largely on the return \nit can expect and therefore to the framework \nconditions in place.  \n\nFigure 5.1-18 shows the sources of R&D \nfunding broken down into business enterprise, \n\ndomestic government, rest of the world, and \nother national sources, while Figure 5.1-19 \npresents the European Commission\u2019s share of \nR&D funding from the rest of the world. Adding \nup investments from domestic governments \nand the EC, we find exceptionally high shares \nof publicly funded R&D in Latvia, Cyprus \nand Lithuania. The public sector is also the \npredominant investor in Greece, Luxembourg, \nRomania, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain. \n\nIn the most-research-intensive Member \nStates (Germany, Sweden, Belgium, \nDenmark, Finland and Slovenia), the \nbusiness sector is the predominant source \nof funds. In those countries, the R&I funding \nfrom the business sector is comparable to \nthat in the United States (62 %), although \nsignificantly lower than in South Korea, China \nand Japan, where businesses finance more \nthan 75 % of R&D. \n\n\n\n274\n\nFigure 5.1-18 Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) financed by sector (%), 2017(1)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat (online data code: \nrd_e_gerdfund) and OECD\nNotes: (1)UK, IL : 2016.

The level of the forgone tax \nrevenues in EU almost tripled since 2007, \nfrom 0.04 % of GDP in 2007 to 0.11 % in \n2017 (Figure 5.1-23). In comparison to the EU, \nthe use of tax incentives is traditionally high \nand rather stable in South Korea and Japan. \nChina has slightly increased indirect support to \n\nbusiness R&D  but it is still below the EU level. \nIn the EU, the number of countries offering R&D \ntax relief increased from 12 in 2000 to 21 in \n2018 (Appelt et al., 2019). Trends in forgone \ntax revenues are very diverse among the \nMember States. There is an exceptionally high \nshare of tax incentives in total public support \nfor business R&D in the Netherlands, Belgium, \nIreland and Italy.\n\n\n\n279\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\nGiven that coordinated transformation \nneeds coordinated and strategic invest-\nment, the question arises as to whether \nthe above-mentioned increased use of \nR&D tax incentives among the Member \nStates provides the right tools to achieve \nthis goal. Direct measures, such as grants \nand loans, are  effective in provoking certain \ndesired R&D outcomes (Appelt et al., 2019; \nOgnyanova, 2017) such as innovation that \nsupports a sustainable transition. The downside, \nhowever, is the higher administrative burden put \non companies. Some countries are considering \nthe possibility to use tax incentives to incentivise \nprivate actors\u2019 behaviour towards SDGs. This is \nthe case for instance in Belgium14, where a tax \ncredit granted for environmentally friendly R&D \ninvestments was introduced. However, more \ngenerally speaking, the tax incentives regime \u2013 \nexactly because of its lack of directionality \u2013 may \n\n14 https://www.oecd.org/sti/rd-tax-stats-belgium.pdf\n15 Moreover, while its effect of increasing R&D efforts is undeniable, recent analysis of existing evidence on the impact of tax \n\nincentives points to its limited impact on innovation (Mitchell et al. 2020).\n\nmake it difficult for governments to have enough \nimpact on steering private investment towards \nsustainability and systemic change15. Therefore, \nin order to establish consistency among national \nreforms and EU policies, a discussion is needed \non the best policy mix to provide public support \nto business R&D expenditure. \n\nBecause of the scope, scale and urgency \nof the societal challenges facing Europe, \npolicy is required to pay more attention \nnot just to the rate (quantity and quality) \nof R&I investments but also to the overall \ndirection of such investments. This can \nsupport the coordinated transformation of \na broad range of interconnected systems that \nare crucial to our economy and society. Systems \nsuch as energy, agro-food, health, mobility, \nproduction and consumption all include \na number of actors that must act together. \n\nhttps://www.oecd.org/sti/rd-tax-stats-belgium.pdf\n\n\n280\n\n3. Conclusions \n\n16 In the same vein, the 2018 update of the Bioeconomy Strategy aims to accelerate the deployment of a sustainable Europe-\nan bioeconomy in order to maximise its contribution towards the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs, as well as the Paris Agreement \n(see European Commission, 2018).\n\nWith just over 2 % of its GDP in R&D, the \nEU is still a long way from its 3 % target. \nIt is underinvesting in R&D compared to its \nmain competitors, especially in terms of private \ninvestments, while Asian countries, in particular \nChina and South Korea, are investing at a rate \nthat is eclipsing both the EU and the United \nStates. If this continues, Europe risks being \noutpaced irreversibly. \n\nThe Commission is committed to focusing \nR&I investments on delivering the \u2018Euro-\npean Green Deal\u2019, its new strategy for \ngrowth (European Commission, 2019). R&I are \ncalled upon to play a strong role to support this \ninitiative. Given the size of the challenge and \nits costly nature, with EUR 1 trillion mobilised \nfor the Green Deal over the next decade, \nthis demands investing record amounts in \nR&D if Europe is to become the world\u2019s first \nclimate-neutral continent and can achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals.\n\nFor R&I to deliver on Europe\u2019s ambitions, \nincluding becoming the world\u2019s first \n\nclimate-neutral continent, R&I must also \nbe given a clear sense of directionality16. \nPublic investments in R&D can play an essential \nrole in this. Bloomberg data show that, while \nthe United States leads in climate-related R&D \nspending, China has recently quadrupled its \nspending, slightly overtaking the EU (Figure 5.1-\n24). Member States should reinforce their \nperformance in climate-related R&D in order \nto boost their competitiveness in the novel \ntechnologies which are required for transition.\n\nOne of the main public investment \ninstruments in Europe is the EU\u2019s R&I \nFramework Programme. The next one, \nHorizon Europe, will cover 2021-2027 and \nwill continue to create new knowledge and \nsolutions to attain the SDGs. It will provide \neven greater directionality through its mission-\noriented approach (on, for example, climate \nchange, healthy oceans, climate-neutral and \nsmart cities, and soil health and food) and \nEuropean partnerships. In addition, it has set \na 35 % spending target for the climate.\n\nFigure 5.1-24 Investment in climate-related R&D, 2011-2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Investment Bank based on data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF)\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter51/figure-51-24.xlsx\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nEU\nR \n\nbi\nlli\n\non\n\nEU\n\nUnited States\n\nChina\n\n\n\n281\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\n4.

Acquisition of skills relevant to future \nlabour markets\n\nThe growing knowledge orientation of \nthe economy and society, together with \nchanges in the labour market and current \ndemographic trends in Europe, make \ninvestment in skills and their lifelong \nupgrading increasingly important. Skilled \nhuman capital for research, innovation and \neconomic development is crucial to sustain \nthe needs of a knowledge economy. The EU \nis facing a growing demand for skilled labour, \nincluding researchers, whilst at the same time, \nlabour related to routine activities appears to \nbe increasingly automated.\n\nAn additional challenge comes from \nongoing demographic developments, such \nas the declining number of young people \nentering the labour market expected in \nmany Member States in the coming years, \nwhile the baby boomer generation is set to \nretire within the next decade. The EU's working \nage population (15-64) peaked in 2009 at \n336 million but has shrunk by 5 million since \nthen. The shrinking labour force trend has been \npredominantly visible in southern, central and \neastern European (CESEE) countries. At the \nsame time, life expectancy continues to rise by \nabout 2 years per decade: the population of 65 \nyears and older in the EU is growing annually \nby about 2 million, rising from 90 million in \n2012 to 101 million in 2018. Consequently, the \nold-age dependency ratio is growing, directly \naffecting employment in the healthcare sector \nand indirectly (longer working life) impacting \nthe labour market. \n\nOther factors are migration and \ndevelopments outside Europe. While \nthe EU\u2019s natural population change in 2017 \n(births minus deaths) was negative, at -0.3 \n\nmillion, this was more than compensated for \nby a net migration to the EU of 0.9 million. \nThe demographic shift towards lower shares \nof young people and larger shares of elderly \npeople is posing important challenges for \nEurope. Given a global massification in tertiary \neducation, a more favourable demography \noutside Europe and strong investment in \nexcellence in other world regions such as \nChina and the United States, the EU is facing \ngrowing challenges in competitiveness. Any \ngaps in terms of the quality and quantity of \nEurope\u2019s human capital could endanger its \ntraditional comparative advantage as regards \nskilled labour. Further investment in skills and \ntheir lifelong upgrading will also be necessary \nto bridge the productivity growth gap between \nthe EU and the United States and South Korea.\n\nStrong growth in employment with high \nlevels of qualification and an increase in \nlow qualifications is expected within the \ncoming decade while, at the same time, the \nnumber of jobs at medium levels is likely \nto shrink. According to the 2018 Cedefop \nskills forecast (Figure 5.2-1), the labour force \n(15-64+) will stagnate between 2021 and \n2030. At the same time, total EU employment \nis projected to grow at a rate of 0.4 % per year. \nHowever, trends will differ significantly across \nthe Member States, with employment \u2013 mainly \nfor demographic reasons \u2013 shrinking annually \nduring that period in Lithuania (-0.4 %), Latvia \n(-0.2 %) and Estonia (-0.2 %). Germany, the EU's \nlargest Member State, will face a decline of \n0.2 % per year. The majority of Member States \nwill generate positive employment figures with \nIreland and Cyprus (1.4 %), Luxembourg (0.9 %) \nand Spain (0.8 %) expected to show the highest \ngrowth rate. \n\n\n\n286\n\nThe European employment outlook follows \nthe job polarisation trend with a strong \nincrease in highly qualified occupations \n(0.9 % annually within the EU) followed by rises \nin low qualification levels (0.4 %). It has been \nforecast that jobs revolving around medium-\nqualification levels will witness a decline in \nemployment of 0.2 %1,2.\n\nIn the EU, employment growth plus the \nneed to replace people leaving workplaces \n(retirement, migration and other rea-\nsons) will lead to over 100 million job \nopportunities over the next decade, \nover 45 million of which will require high \nqualifications. The highest absolute number of \njob openings will be in Germany (17.6 million), \nFrance (12.4 million) and Italy (11.5 million). The \ntrends shown may contribute to sustaining the \ngap in unemployment rates between different \nqualification levels. In 2017, according to Eurostat \ndata, while the EU\u2019s overall unemployment rate \n\n1 Jobs classified under the ISCO-88 major groups, based on Cedefop Skills Forecast 2021-2030, EU28, annual percentage rate.\n2 According to Cedefop, medium-skill occupations are projected to see slow growth or even a decline in the number of jobs \n\nas automation and offshoring take their toll. But new workers will still be needed in these occupations to replace those who \nleave or retire.\n\n3 Cedefop project Skills-OVATE gathers data for online vacancies in Europe. It navigates through data for 18 countries: Austria, \nBelgium, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, \nPortugal, Sweden, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. Data were gathered between 1 July 2018 and 31 March 2019.\n\n4 The share includes 2-digit ISCO categories research & engineers professionals and technicians.\n\nstood at 7.6 %, it was nearly twice as high \nfor those with low-qualification levels (lower \nsecondary education or less), reaching 14.7 %, \nwhile highly skilled people (with at least tertiary \neducation) in the EU reported an unemployment \nrate of only 4.5 %.\n\nThe employment of researchers and \nengineers will see strong growth, followed \nby ICT professionals. The forecast growth of \nboth science and engineering as well as ICT \nprofessionals is expected to outpace the overall \ngrowth rate (Figure 5.2-1). These two groups \nare also the occupations most demanded \nby the current labour market with a share \nof 14 % among the majority of EU Member \nStates3. Science and engineering professionals \ntogether with technicians, which a somewhat \nbroader term referring to employment in the \nsector, shows a 12 % share of vacancies across \nthe EU (Figure 5.2-2)4.  \n\n\n\n287\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\nFigure 5.2-1 Employment change for selected qualifications (%), 2021 - 2030\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Cedefop Skills - Forecast\nNote: Skills forecast accounting for economic developments until May 2017.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter52/figure-52-1.xlsx\n\n0.0% 0.5% 1.0% 1.5%\n\nAll\n\nICT professionals\n\nScience and engineering\nprofessionals\n\nScience and engineering\nassociate professionals\n\nFigure 5.2-2 Top job openings by occupations group, EU28 2021-2030\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Cedefop Skills - Forecast\nNotes: Skills forecast accounting for economic developments until May 2017.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter52/figure-52-2.xlsx\n\nBusiness and \nadministration \nassociate \nprofessionals,\n8 072 496\n\nCleaners and helpers,\n5 744 265\n\nPersonal service \nworkers,\n4 614 457\n\nBusiness and \nadministration \nprofessionals,\n4 175 289\n\nSales workers,\n6 063 314\n\nTeaching \nprofessionals,\n4 055 201\n\nDrivers and \nmobile plant \noperators,\n3 992 462\n\nLegal, social, \ncultural and \nrelated associate \nprofessionals,\n3 964 119\n\nBuilding and \nrelated trades \nworkers, \nexcluding \nelectricians,\n3 595 538\n\nCustomer \nservices clerks,\n3 692 614\n\nMarket-oriented \nskilled \nagricultural \nworkers,\n3 946 424\n\nLegal, social \nand cultural \nprofessionals,\n3 575 131\n\nPersonal care \nworkers,\n3 551 898\n\nScience and \nengineering \nprofessionals,\n3 383 415\n\nScience and \nengineering \nassociate\nprofessionals,\n3 310 755\n\nHealth \nprofessionals,\n3 000 576\n\nProduction and \nspecialised \nservices \nmanagers,\n2 768 090\n\nHealth associate \nprofessionals,\n2 677 268\n\nMetal, \nmachinery and \nrelated trades \nworkers,\n2 091 667\nAdministrative \nand \ncommercial \nmanagers,\n2 077 049\n\nHospitality, retail \nand other services \nmanagers,\n2 364 302\n\nLabourers\nin mining, \nconstruction, \nmanufacturing \nand transport,\n3 303 474\n\n\n\n288\n\nThe manufacturing sector is characterised \nby a growing use of industrial robots. \nEuropean countries with a large car \nindustry tend to have high numbers of \nindustrial robots per person employed. \nThe ongoing debate on the impact of technical \nprogress on employment concentrates on \nthe levels of robots in the manufacturing \nsector, which supposedly is affected more \nby automation and rationalisation than the \nservice sector. Yet it remains to be seen \nwhether the effect of robots on employment \nin manufacturing will be disruptive (Klenert \net. al, 2020). The replacement of workers by \nmachines is ongoing with even more complex \nmanual tasks being increasingly taken over \nby robots now. However, it is not only routine \nmanual tasks that are being replaced. Future \nadvances in artificial intelligence could have \nrepercussions in the service sector, where \njobs are not facilitating worker autonomy but \nare demanding a higher degree of planning, \nteamwork and customer-service skills \n(Pouliakas, 2019). \n\nCurrently, over 0.3 million industrial ro-\nbots (of a worldwide stock of 2.1 million) \nare deployed in EU Member States, \na number which is increasing by about 40 000 \nper year. The degree of robotisation varies \nsignificantly across Member States \u2013 for \nexample, Germany\u2019s automotive industry \nis about twice as robot intensive as that in \nCzechia and Portugal5. Germany also has \nthe highest number of industrial robots per \n10 000 people employed in the manufacturing \nindustry, followed by Sweden and Denmark. \nThe EU has a similar density as the United \nStates, but lags behind Japan and South Korea \n(Figure 5.2-3). Although China is catching up \nquickly, it still has a much lower density than \nthe EU. The 138 000 industrial robots installed \nin China in 2017 represent an increase of \n59 % compared to the previous year. This was \n\n5 Estimated number of multipurpose industrial robots per 10 000 people employed in the automotive industry (ISIC rev.4: 29).\n\nconsiderably more than the total volume of \nrobots installed in Europe and the United States \ntogether (91 000 units). Such a leap has helped \nChina to compensate for its initially low levels. \nWith the current number of 539 multipurpose \nindustrial robots per 10 000 people employed \nin the automotive industry, China ranks among \ncountries such as Portugal (613), Czechia \n(483) and Malaysia (427). Find out more on \nrobotics in Chapter 7 - R&I enabling artificial \nintelligence.\n\nAs regards the increasingly important \ndigital skills, although the EU is \nprogressing, there is a divide between \nMember States in internet user skills and \nmore advanced digital skills. Eurostat\u2019s ICT \nhousehold survey (Figure 5.2-4) shows big \ndifferences among Member States in shares of \nthe population aged 16-74 with above-average \ndigital skills. The Nordic countries, Luxembourg, \nthe Netherlands and the UK perform best in this \narea. Nearly all their households have internet \naccess (Figure 5.2-5) and these countries tend \nto have relatively high shares of ICT start-ups. \nThe lowest performers in the EU as regards \ntheir populations\u2019 digital skills are Romania \nand Bulgaria. European Commissions\u2019 Digital \nEconomy and Society Index monitors human \ncapital, which consists of internet user skills and \nadvanced skills with development.

In many European countries, almost \nthe entire population is active on the internet. \nHowever, the data show that there is a wide \ngap between basic internet usage and the \ndevelopment of advanced digital skills. While \n70 % of Europeans go online for information \nabout goods and services, only 7 % have used \nthe internet to follow an online course. The \nshare of individuals with digital skills in the \nEU population is growing slowly. As regards \nindividuals with more than the basic overall \ndigital or software skills, Europeans have \n\n6 Cedefop project Skills-OVATE - skills sorted by their frequency across all online job vacancies.\n\nrecently improved to reach population shares \nof about 30 % and 40 %, respectively. Greece \nand Sweden have shown the greatest progress \nin digital skills over the last three years. On the \nother hand, the lack of at least basic digital \nskills appears on the labour market in several \nmember states and the \u2018use of computer\u2019 ranks \nas a number one demanded skill on the job \nmarket in Poland and Slovakia6. The increasing \nlevels of digital skills is important to ensure \na broad range of opportunities to enter and \nremain in the labour market. At the same time, \nwith the rise in e-government, online shopping, \nbanking and smart mobility, acquisition of \nthese skills will prevent individuals not only \nfrom being locked out of work but also out of \nsociety (EPSC, 2019).\n\n\n\n291\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\nIn the period 2014-2017, the number of \nICT graduates in the EU rose on average \nby about 4 % per year. However, much \nlower growth in previous years and stagnation \nor even decline in several Member States \nresulted in a gap in the labour market (Figure \n5.2-6). Member States with a high number of \ncomputing graduates per 1 000 population aged \n25-34 include Ireland (where many US digital \ngiants have their European headquarters), \nMalta (where an online gaming cluster has \n\ndeveloped), Finland (with its important video-\ngame sector) and Denmark.

While \nthe population\u2019s basic ICT skills are improving, \nthere is a growing need for practitioners with \na solid base in ICT skills. In 2018, the share of \nsuch professionals was 3.9 % of total European \nemployment, and their total number has been \nincreasing by more than 3 % annually over the \nlast decade (Figure 5.2-7). Sweden, Finland, \nEstonia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \nmaintain the highest shares. Growth in these \njobs is fuelled by new developments such as \nbig data, the Internet of Things, the cloud, \nand the expanding app economy. In Bulgaria \nin particular, together with Belgium Cyprus \nand Ireland, the number of such jobs has \nincreased significantly in the last ten years. \nLooking at the performance over the last five \nyears, strong growth in Bulgaria is followed \nby Lithuania, Estonia, Romania and Greece. \nThe lack of graduates to fill such vacancies \nis, to a certain extent, reflected by 56.8 % of \ncompanies facing difficulties when trying to \nrecruit ICT specialists \u2013 and there are already \nover 1 million vacancies for ICT specialists in \nthe EU7.\n\nAligning the provision of education and \ntraining with changing labour market and \nsocial needs is a persistent issue facing \nevery country, in particular as regards \ncoordinating investment strategies with the \nprivate sector. It is well accepted that general \ninvestment in education and training together \n\n7 An assessment by IDC and Empirica estimated a shortage of 749 000 by 2020 (2018); the estimation, based on the Euro-\npean Commission\u2019s VICTORY project (2019), refers to currently available vacancies.\n\nwith investment in R&D are complementary \n(Cedefop, 2012; OECD, 2013) and that investment \nin human capital leads to more innovation at \nthe firm level, including on-the-job training \n(Dostie, B., 2018). However, challenges persist \nin aligning the role and actions of public-sector \nactors with the actions of the private sector. This \nis difficult enough even in a single sector \u2013 as \ntestified by challenges faced in aligning public \ninvestment priorities and fundamental research \nwith the needs and applied research carried out \nby enterprises. At the European level, despite \nevolving statistical instruments, actually tracking \ninvestment levels (particularly as regards skills \ninvestment) faces significant barriers due to \nthe misalignment of available data sources in \ntheir timing, scope and definitions. Nevertheless, \nrecent assessments by the Commission (EC, \n2019a) enables a more comprehensive picture \nto be drawn. Total investment in skills for labour \nmarket and social purposes \u2013 which would \nprobably have the most direct link to companies\u2019 \nskills needs and innovation performance in the EU \nin reference year 2015 \u2013 totalled EUR 203 billion, \nwhich is less than the total investment in R&D at \nEUR 259 billion that same year. The private share \nin this expenditure varies significantly from 72 % \nin Slovenia to 22 % in Finland. Only about 20 % \nof these investments at the EU level represent \npublicly funded formal adult education, which \ndepicts the complex nature of adult learning \nand its funding sources.

Education will face demographic change \nand other challenges\n\nInvestment in tertiary education in the \nEU lags behind that of the United States \nand South Korea, despite significant \npublic efforts. With only a marginal share \nof private investment and the bulk of \npublic expenditure centred on school \neducation, the EU invests much less in \ntertiary education than its competitors. \na closer look at EU demographic \npredictions reveals that public funding \nof education must equip students for the \nfuture. Although we can assume that low \nlevels of spending on school education are \nsomewhat reflected in educational outputs, \nas evidenced by an international skills test in \ncompulsory education, non-financial factors \nplay an important role, too. High levels of \nspending per pupil do not necessarily translate \n\ninto corresponding educational outcomes, \nalthough there is a consensus that investment \nin higher participation rates (a higher number \nof learners) has both social and economic \nbenefits. Thus, any assessment of education \nexpenditure must consider the main features \nof the funding system and demographic \ndevelopments which affect the number of \nstudents in the system and the expenditure \nper student. As we can see in Figure 5.2-9, the \nsize of school-age population is expected to \ndecline in most Member States in the next two \ndecades. Such a development will force many \ngovernments to reassess how to handle the \nteaching staff mismatch, ensure an adequate \nschool network with a proper infrastructure \nand deploy new technologies for educational \npurposes.  \n\nFigure 5.2-9 School-age population predictions, 3 to 18-year-olds (index 2020 = 100)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat \n(online data code: proj_18np)\nNote: Baseline projections.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter52/figure-52-9.xlsx\n\nSo\nut\n\nh K\nor\n\nea\nJa\n\npa\nn\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns EU\n\nCh\nina\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num Ita\nly\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\nSp\n\nain\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\nIsr\n\nae\nl\n\nTu\nrke\n\ny\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\nSc\nho\n\nol\n a\n\nge\n p\n\nop\nul\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(2\n\n02\n0=\n\n10\n0)\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\nIta\n\nly\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\nSp\n\nain\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia EU\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\nMa\n\nlta\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n\n2030 2040\n\n\n\n295\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\nFigure 5.2-10 Share of public expenditure on education by level (%), 2017\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat (online data code: gov_10a_exp)\nNote: (1)EU was calculated by DG Research and Innovation.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter52/figure-52-10.xlsx\n\nSo\nut\n\nh K\nor\n\nea\nJa\n\npa\nn\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns EU\n\nCh\nina\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num Ita\nly\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\nSp\n\nain\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\nIsr\n\nae\nl\n\nTu\nrke\n\ny\n\n0%\n\n10%\n\n20%\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\n50%\n\n60%\n\n70%\n\n80%\n\n90%\n\n100%\n\nPre-primary and primary education Secondary education\n\nTertiary education Other\n\nEU\n(1\n\n)\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\nMa\n\nlta\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\nGr\n\nee\nce\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\nIta\n\nly\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\nSp\n\nain\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\nIce\nlan\n\nd\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\n\nTotal investment in education in the EU \nis at a similar level to that in the United \nStates and South Korea but higher \nthan in Japan. However, there are large \ndifferences in spending levels between EU \nMember States, reflected both in primary/\nsecondary education and in tertiary \neducation. European public investment in \neducation is driven by two major trends. First, \n\nnon-tertiary education (mostly pre-primary, \nprimary and secondary) absorbs the bulk of \nexpenditure on education across the EU (Figure \n5.2-10). The second point is that public funding \nis shaped by expenditure on teaching staff \nwhich accounts for 60 % of total expenditure in \nthe EU and exceeds 70 % in countries such as \nGreece, Belgium, Italy and Bulgaria. \n\nThere is general consensus among \neducation economists that early invest-\nment in education gives the highest returns, \nsince outcomes from the earlier stages of \neducation also determine results at later \nstages. For example, high levels of numeracy \n\nat lower secondary level are important for the \noutcomes of learning at upper secondary level \nand have an impact on the take-up of science \nand technology studies at the tertiary level \u2013 \nfields of study where there is a potential gap in \nthe future supply of graduates.\n\n\n\n296\n\nWhile spending on school education in \nthe EU is comparable to the levels found \nin North America and East Asia, there is \na remarkable gap in tertiary education. \nThe EU is spending less on tertiary education \ncompared to all of its competitors and the \ngap is not closing over time. The spending gap \ncompared to international competitors seems \nto be driven primarily by private sources of \nfunding. With the exception of a few European \ncountries (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Hungary and \n\nLatvia), public expenditure constitutes most \ntertiary education expenses (Figure 5.2-11). \n\nGiven the fact that European countries invest \npredominantly in earlier levels of education \n(pre-primary, primary and secondary, see \nFigure 5.2-10) and demographic developments \nin many states suggest lower numbers of \nchildren entering early levels of education, \ncertain countries may have to reassess the \nstructure of their expenditure on education.\n\nFigure 5.2-11 Total educational expenditure on tertiary education(1) from public and \nprivate sources as % of GDP, 2016(2)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat (online data code: educ_uoe_fine01) and OECD (Educational expenditure by source and destination)  \nNotes: (1)ISCED 2011 levels 5-8.

This anticipates a decline \nin the number of tertiary graduates in the \nmedium term, especially in central and \neastern European countries. As tertiary \nparticipation rates have increased in Member \nStates and the size of younger cohorts has \nshrunk, the number of tertiary students in the \nEU started to decline in 2014 and could continue \nto do so due to demographic developments in \nthe near future. The decline in tertiary students \nis strongest in central and eastern European \ncountries where the small cohorts of the post-\n1990 demographic crisis have now reached \ntertiary student age. In addition, other Member \nStates in southern Europe have observed \na declining share of the young population (Figure \n5.2-12), although these have not translated into \nfewer tertiary students since there participation \nin tertiary education has increased. Based on \nfavourable participation rates combined with \na reduction in early leavers, in 2018, Member \nStates hit the 40.7 % share, thereby exceeding \nthe Europe 2020 target (Figure 5.2-13 with EU \nheadline target).\n\nWhile a scientific debate continues \nabout the optimal number and share of \nuniversity graduates in the population \nand their relevance for balanced R&I \nsystems, available statistical data show \nthat returns from tertiary education \nin terms of average earnings and the \nrisk of unemployment are high. Various \nexplanations are possible, such as mismatches \nin the fields of expertise being demanded, or \na general oversupply of tertiary graduates, etc. \nHowever, manufacturing-oriented economies, \n\nlike Germany and Austria, traditionally also \nrely on a strong supply of graduates from \nvocational education and training, most of \nthem at an upper-secondary levell.\n\nThe latest statistics reveal that the number of \nstudents is shrinking faster in Estonia (-26.3 %), \nSlovakia (-25.5 %), Lithuania (-21.2 %), Hungary \n(-20.1 %), Slovenia (-18.6 %), Poland (-18.5 %), \nCzechia (-17.4 %), Romania (-14 %), Latvia \n(-12.2 %) and Bulgaria (-12 %). In the EU15, \nsince 2013, the decline has been strongest \nin Finland (-4.4 %) and Portugal (-3.8 %). \nThe number of tertiary students continues to \nincrease in the majority of the EU15 Member \nStates and in Cyprus (+41.6 %) and Malta \n(+14.7 %). In both these countries, the relatively \nnew higher education systems are still in the \nexpansion phase. Despite an unfavourable \ndemography, student numbers are still rising in \nGermany (+11.2 %) as the result of a growing \nnumber of foreign students and an ongoing \nincrease in participation rates.\n\n\n\n298\n\nFigure 5.2-13 % change in the number of tertiary students between 2013 and 2017(1)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat \n(online data code: educ_uoe_enrt02) and UNESCO data\nNote: (1)US, JP: 2013-2016; IE: 2014-2017. \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter52/figure-52-13.xlsx\n\nSo\nut\n\nh K\nor\n\nea\nJa\n\npa\nn\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns EU\n\nCh\nina\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num Ita\nly\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\nSp\n\nain\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\nIsr\n\nae\nl\n\nTu\nrke\n\ny\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n%\n c\n\nha\nng\n\ne\n\nCh\nina EU\n\nJa\npa\n\nn\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\nMa\n\nlta\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\nSp\n\nain\n\nCr\noa\n\ntiaIta\nly\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nTu\nrke\n\ny\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\n\nSe\nrb\n\nia\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\nNo\nrth\n\n M\nac\n\ned\non\n\nia\n\nIce\nlan\n\nd\n\nFigure 5.2-12 Proportion of population aged 15-24 years old (%), 1995 and 2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat (online data code: demo_pjanind)\nNote: (1)EU27 includes UK, but excludes Croatia.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter52/figure-52-12.xlsx\n\nSo\nut\n\nh K\nor\n\nea\nJa\n\npa\nn\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns EU\n\nCh\nina\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num Ita\nly\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\nSp\n\nain\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\nIsr\n\nae\nl\n\nTu\nrke\n\ny\n\n0.0\n\n4.0\n\n8.0\n\n12.0\n\n16.0\n\n20.0\n\n%\n\nEU\n27\n\n(1\n)\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\nMa\n\nlta\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\nSp\n\nain Ita\nly\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\n19952018\n\n\n\n299\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\nRecently, in terms of the absolute number \nof tertiary students, the EU and the \nUnited States have shown similar levels \nof participation in tertiary education.

While the EU had 16 % \nof the world\u2019s tertiary student population at the \nbeginning of the millennium, the share dropped \nto 9 % in 2017. In the period 2000 to 2016, the \nshares of China and India increased by 6 and \n13 percentage points, respectively, to reach \n15 % for India and 20 % for China.

With \nmore attention being given to the role of design \nin product marketing and product innovation, \narts and design students are becoming an \nimportant asset in modern economies as \nthese are contributing to the emergence of \n\u2018creative industries\u2019.

The \nenhanced STEAM approach to STEM education \nalso raised expectations that graduates utilise \ntheir artistic talents to generate innovative \nthinking, while the definition of \u2018art\u2019 education \nin STEAM often spreads across visual arts to \nliberal arts and humanities. Ongoing research \nis seeking more conceptual clarity in STEAM \nterminology (Colluci-Gray et al., 2017) and \ninvestigating different methods for merging \nSTEAM methodologies (Perignat and Katz-\nBuonincontro, 2019).\n\n\n\n301\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\nThe shares of new graduates among \nyoung populations only increased be-\ncause of the shrinking EU population \nof 20- to 29-year-olds.

As regards new tertiary graduates \nper thousand population (Figure 5.2-16), the \nEU performs at a similar level to Japan, but \nbelow the United States and South Korea. \nWhile figures in China and the United States \ncontinue to increase, in the EU, the number \nof new tertiary graduates per population has \nhardly grown over the last decade and has \nfallen in South Korea and Japan.

In 2017, there were remarkable \ndifferences within the main STEM areas with \na higher share of female graduates (53 %) in \nnatural sciences, mathematics and statistics, \nbut a significantly lower share (19 %) in \ninformation and communication technologies. \n\n11 PISA is the OECD\u2019s Programme for International Students Assessment.\n\nThe European share of female science and \ntechnology graduates reaches comparable \nvalues in Canada (32 %) and the United States \n(37 %), while South Korea only achieved 26 % \nof female graduates. \n\nThe under-representation of women in \ncertain STEM occupations as well as in \nrelated study areas has persisted over \ntime. The proportion of males interested in STEM \ngrew from 2006 to 2015, but not of females. \nDedicated studies in STEM-related vocational \nplans demonstrate that adolescent plans are \nbroadly segregated by gender. Earlier data from \nPISA-participating countries11 show that, across \nall the OECD and partner countries, a much \nhigher proportion of males express an interest \nin engineering and computing occupations than \nfemales, whereas the opposite trend exists in \nthe preference for health careers (Han, 2017). \nThe low participation of women observed \nacross STEM occupations contributes to talent \nloss and limits the beneficial effects of social \ndiversity. The persistence of women\u2019s under-\nrepresentation in particular fields of STEM also \ncontributes to reproducing economic gender \ninequalities, as STEM occupations represent \nsome of the best paid and most prestigious jobs \nin the labour market (Blasko et al., 2018\n\n\n\n303\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\nFigure 5.2-17 Share of tertiary graduates by sex (%), 2017\n58\n\n%\n\n51\n%\n\n53\n%\n\n54\n%\n\n55\n%\n\n55\n%\n\n56\n%\n\n56\n%\n\n56\n%\n\n56\n%\n\n58\n%\n\n58\n%\n\n58\n%\n\n59\n%\n\n60\n%\n\n60\n%\n\n60\n%\n\n61\n%\n\n61\n%\n\n61\n%\n\n61\n%\n\n62\n%\n\n62\n%\n\n63\n%\n\n63\n%\n\n63\n%\n\n64\n%\n\n65\n%\n\n49\n%\n\n52\n% 58\n\n%\n58\n\n%\n58\n\n%\n58\n\n%\n58\n\n%\n\n42\n%\n\n49\n%\n\n47\n%\n\n46\n%\n\n45\n%\n\n45\n%\n\n44\n%\n\n44\n%\n\n44\n%\n\n44\n%\n\n42\n%\n\n42\n%\n\n42\n%\n\n41\n%\n\n40\n%\n\n40\n%\n\n40\n%\n\n39\n%\n\n39\n%\n\n39\n%\n\n39\n%\n\n38\n%\n\n38\n%\n\n37\n%\n\n37\n%\n\n37\n%\n\n36\n%\n\n35\n%\n\n51\n%\n\n48\n% 42\n\n%\n42\n\n%\n42\n\n%\n42\n\n%\n42\n\n%\n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n80%\n\n100%\n\nEU\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\nMa\n\nlta\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\nSp\n\nain\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\nIta\n\nly\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nTu\nrke\n\ny\n\nNo\nrth\n\n M\nac\n\ned\non\n\nia\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\n\nSe\nrb\n\nia\n\nMo\nnt\n\nen\neg\n\nro\n\nMaleFemale\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat (online data code: \neduc_uoe_grad01)\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter52/figure-52-17.xlsx\n\nThe numbers of tertiary graduates are very \nsimilar in the EU and the United States, \nwhile China is reinforcing its position as \nthe world\u2019s largest producer of tertiary \ngraduates (Figure 5.2-18).\n\nThe EU has a worse performance in the \nshare of science and technology (S&T) \ngraduates than several years ago, \nremaining roughly at 2005 levels.

Progress in the number of \ntertiary graduates (with some time lags) \ncontributed to achieving the EU\u2019s headline \ntarget for tertiary attainment (Figure 5.2-21). \nThe Europe 2020 strategy's target demands \nthat at least 40 % of 30- to 34-year-olds in the \nEU should have completed tertiary education \nby 2020 (EC, 2019c). Reaching the level of \n40.7 %, the EU crossed this threshold in 2018. \nWith the initial level at 23.6 % in 2002, there \nwas a steady increase to 32.3 % in 2009 and \nbeyond. This growth pattern was even more \nsignificant for women (from 24.5 % in 2002 to \n45.8 % in 2018) than for men (from 22.6 % to \n35.7 %), meaning that there is a gender gap \nwith women above and men still below the \noverall Europe 2020 target.\n\nLithuania, Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg \nand Sweden already have tertiary \neducation attainment rates of over 50 %. \nItaly and Romania still show relatively low \ntertiary attainment rates. After Mexico, Italy \nhas the lowest tertiary attainment rate among \nOECD countries (based on the population of \n25- to 34-year-olds from 2017). Despite the \nprogress achieved, the EU still lags behind the \ntertiary attainment levels of the United States \n(48 %), Japan (60 %), Canada (61 %) and South \nKorea (70 %). \n\n13 Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) is an OECD programme of assessment and \nanalysis of adult skills based on international survey conducted in over 40 countries/economies.\n\nAlthough tertiary attainment has become \nmore accessible, some challenges remain \nrelevant. Studies, such as the OECD PIAAC \nsurvey13, show big differences between the skill \nlevels of tertiary graduates in EU countries and \nhence the need to focus more on the quality \nof education in some countries. Although \nthe EU reached its target for educational \nattainment rates at the tertiary level, other \nchallenges, such as the quality of education \nand the acquisition of skills relevant to the \nlabour market, remain relevant. Furthermore, \nreducing dropout rates from education and \ntraining would help to mitigate difficulties early \nleavers have in joining the labour market and \nimprove the efficiency of public investment in \neducation. As set out by the EU 2020 strategy, \nthe share of early leavers from education and \ntraining in the EU should not exceed 10 %. \nWith 10.6 % reported in 2018, the EU was 0.6 \npercentage points away from its target. \n\n\n\n307\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\n3.

However, rapid technological progress \nand a change in workplace requirements, \ngrowing interdisciplinarity and the resulting \nlow predictability of future skills needs in \ncombination with fluctuating migration levels \nmake planning and foresight difficult. To better \ngrasp and capitalise on the latest developments, \nthe European Institute of Innovation and \nTechnology plays an important bridging role \nbetween the European R&I framework and \neducation policies and programmes. The \nInstitute contributes to reshaping innovative \nand entrepreneurial education at both master \n\nand doctoral levels, although its Skills for the \nFuture initiative intends to rethink approaches \nto education programmes at lower educational \nlevels, too. Their higher-education partners \nfocus on developing innovative curricula \nthat provide students, entrepreneurs and \nbusiness innovators with the knowledge \nand skills anticipated for a knowledge and \nentrepreneurial society. Any broader response \nis limited by interacting forces of growing \ninternationalisation of the labour markets \nand greater competition for highly skilled \npeople. While the first tends to make regional \nor national skill gaps less severe, the growing \ninternational and intersectoral demand for \nhighly trained professionals, including scientists \nand researchers, lacks regions or countries that \nare further developing their R&I systems.\n\n\n\n309\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\nFigure 5.2-22 Key data on human resources in science and technology in the EU\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat (online data code: \nhrst_st_ncat and rd_p_persocc)\nNote:  (1)Breaks in series occur between 2014 and the previous years and between 2011 and the previous years for HRST data.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter52/figure-52-22.xlsx\n\nTotal (000s) \n2018\n\nAs % of total \nemployment \n\n2018\n\nCompound annual \ngrowth (%) \n\n2007-2018(1)\n\n Active population 213 624 108 0.32\n\nTotal employment (LFS) 198 032 100 0.34\n\nHRST - Human Resources in Science \nand Technology\n\n110 473 55.8 2.23\n\nHRSTE - Human Resources in Science \nand Technology - Education\n\n85 764 43.3 3.10\n\nHRSTO - Human Resources in Science \nand Technology - Occupation\n\n69 959 35.3 1.68\n\nHRSTC - Human Resources in Science \nand Technology - Core\n\n45 250 22.8 2.94\n\nSE - Scientists and engineers 14 759 7.5 2.52\n\nTotal R&D personnel (FTE) 2 795 1.4 2.97\n\nResearchers (FTE) 1 773 0.9 3.57\n\n\n\n310\n\nHuman resources in science and techno-\nlogy have grown faster than total \nemployment in the past and jobs in this \narea were more resilient during the \ncrisis.

The share of \nfemale researchers is still far from balanced, \ndepending to a large extent on the sector \nof activity, with relatively higher shares of \nfemale researchers in education \u2013 46 % in \n2016 \u2013 while the business enterprise sector \nis performing worse with female researchers \nstill severely under-represented with a share \nof about a fifth of researchers. Previously, as \nthe number of women researchers in the EU \nincreased at a higher rate on average than \nmen, the situation improved slightly, although \nthis was not the case for all Member States. \nCzechia has one of the lowest numbers of \nfemale researchers in the EU with their share \nin 2017 (23.1 %) reaching 2 percentage points \nlower than in 2007 (25.4 %). The best EU \nperformers, such as Latvia and Bulgaria, show \nvalues for equal gender splits in the research \npopulation.  \n\n\n\n312\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat (online data code: \nrd_p_persocc and rd_p_femres), OECD and Statista based on National Bureau of Statistics of China  \nNotes: (1)US: 2016; JP, KR, CN, CH, TR: 2017.

Across the EU, the \nproportion of women among heads of institutions \nin the higher-education sector rose from 20.2 % \nin 2014 to 21.7 % in 2017 although, at the same \ntime, several countries experienced a fall in the \nnumber of women heading up institutions (Figure \n5.2-25). The under-representation of women in \nleadership positions has wide implications for \nboth scientific advancement and for industries \nwith a strong need for a technologically educated \nworkforce (EC, 2018). In recent years, growing \nnumbers of scientific institutions have adopted \na variety of measures to make improvements, \n\nsuch as leadership training, implicit bias training, \nand broader gender equality plans (Cameron et \nal., 2015).\n\nIn recent decades, the ratios of women to \nmen in senior academic and decision-making \npositions have fallen below expectations given \nthe growing number of women among higher-\neducation graduates. For example, in the life \nsciences at the EU level, women make up the \nmajority of graduates up to doctoral level \nbut are less successful than men in securing \nresearch grants (ERC, 2018), and their numbers \nprogressively decline at each progressive \ncareer stage (Helmer, 2017).\n\nFigure 5.2-25 Share of females as heads of institutions in the higher \neducation sector (HES)(1), 2014 and 2017\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource:  DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Women in Science database\nNotes: (1)Data are in headcounts (HC).

Conclusions\n\nInvestment into human capital is import-\nant as it is one of the main factors \ninfluencing the competitiveness of Euro-\npean R&I systems. R&I are systemically linked \nprocesses within the framework of a larger, \nknowledge-driven socio-economic system (EC, \n2009). The accumulation and transformation \nof knowledge provides input for R&I activities \nand, within that context, it is of key importance \nthat R&I are well connected to a number of \nother areas, such as the education system. \n\nThe education system provides the know-\nledge base and can foster creativity, both \nof which support the ability to perform high-\nquality research. It is the interpretation, the \ncombination and recombination of information \ninto new knowledge, and the upgrading of the \nexisting knowledge base that make our R&I \nsystems competitive. In addition to scientific \nexcellence, education is an important way \nto transfer knowledge derived from R&I to \nsociety and equip young people with the right \nskills for their future professional development.\n\nThe supply of human resources in science and \ntechnology ranks among the most important \nfactors determining the competitiveness of \nthe EU in the long term. The demand can vary \ndepending on concrete industry or technology \nsectors and thus the focus on \u2018R&D expenditure\u2019 \nmust be complemented by indicators such \nas \u2018R&D personnel\u2019 and \u2018researchers\u2019 to fully \nunderstand the EU\u2019s comparative advantage. \nIn that context, the under-representation \nof women in both public and private research \npresents an unused potential of talents and \ndeprives women of the opportunity to contribute \ntowards R&I on an equal footing. Given the \nnegative effects of gender imbalance in all \nscientific fields and the necessity to accelerate \nthe progress towards gender equality in R&I, \nthere must be more tangible role models for \npotential women scientists to encourage more \nwomen to pursue a scientific career and \npresence in scientific decision-making bodies.\n\n\n\n315\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\n5.

As highlighted \nin Chapter 2 - Changing innovation dynamics \nin the age of digital transformation, because \nof digitalisation, innovation is moving at an \nunprecedented speed. In such a fast-changing \nworld, organisations need to increasingly adapt \nand create structures that are flexible enough \nto accommodate new market and technology \ntrends that could put them in the lead in the \nnew era. This includes building a company \nculture that promotes \u2018resilience in discomfort\u2019, \nallowing for experimentation, collaboration, \ncreativity and critical thinking and, if necessary, \nacquiring new competences to cope with \nchange. Managers play a key role in shaping \njust how strategic and agile an organisation \nis. In other words, good management provides \na vision for the company, defines strategic \nobjectives and the right incentive structure \nto guide and motivate the workforce. In this \ncontext, higher management quality has been \ndocumented to be productivity-enhancing \nfor a company (see, for example, Bloom, \nSadun and Van Reenen, 2016). In addition, \nmanagement quality correlates positively with \nboth larger ICT adoption rates and productivity \nresulting from using ICT capital (see, for \nexample, Andrews et al. (2018)). Furthermore, \n\nthe uptake of advanced technologies affects \nthe production process workflow and the \nrelative costs of acquiring or communicating \ninformation, which implies that implementing \nsuch technologies often needs organisational \ninnovations that match technological \ninnovation (OECD, forthcoming). In this respect, \nskills and competences should be aligned with \nthe production process and the changes it may \nbe subject to. Thus, training and preparing the \nworkforce is essential.\n\nThe so-called \u2018economic competencies\u2019 \ninclude brand aspects (advertising and \nmarket research), knowledge embedded \nfirm-specific human capital and organisa-\ntional capital following the framework in \nCorrado et al. (2005), as represented in Figure \n5.3-1. This chapter highlights the importance \nof exploring complementarities between \neconomic competencies and other intangible \nand tangible assets for firm performance \nand productivity. These competencies relate \nto the resilience and agility of teams and \ncompanies to recognise and embrace the \nopportunities brought by new technologies. \nStehrer et al. (2019) analysed the role of these \nsupplementary intangibles and found that \neconomic competencies (which are outside \nthe boundaries of national accounts) have \na statistically significant impact on growth, \nwhich is robust both before and after the crisis \nand more visible in business services than in \nmanufacturing.\n\n\n\n322\n\nFigure 5.3-1 Visual representation of different economic competencies\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Corrado et al.

Europe appears to underinvest in economic \ncompetencies relative to the United States \ndespite the positive contribution of these \nintangibles for growth\n\nThe United States appears to outperform \nthe EU in investing in economic compe-\ntencies. Moreover, intra-EU differences \npersist which may hinder future producti-\nvity developments and exacerbate \ninnovation inequalities. Figure 5.3-2 \ncompares countries in terms of gross fixed \ncapital formation in economic competencies \n\u2013 purchased and own-account organisational \ncapital, brand aspects (advertising and market \nresearch) and (vocational) training \u2013 as a per-\ncentage of GDP over the periods 2000-2008 \nand 2009-2017. Overall, relative investments \nin these supplementary intangibles seem to \nhave slightly increased in the EU as a whole, \nalthough this only appears to be the case in half \n\nof the EU Member States. Despite this increase, \nthe United States still outperforms the EU \nwith aggregate investments in advertising and \nmarket research and organisational capital of \n2.8 % of GDP compared to only 2.1 % in the EU \nin the period 2009-2018. Heavier investments \nin relative terms by US companies  to promote \ntheir brands contribute to this gap.\n\nWithin the EU, the highest shares of \ninvestments in economic competencies \nare in the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, \nMalta and Poland where investments \nwere higher than 3 % of GDP between \n2009 and 2017.

Bloom et al. \n(2019) investigated management practices \nin US manufacturing plants and found a large \ndispersion of management across plants. \nIn addition, the authors concluded that these \nmanagement practices explained more than \n20 % of the variation in productivity, a similar, \nor greater, percentage than that accounted for \nby R&D, ICT, or human capital. Finally, right-\nto-work laws and learning spillovers were \nfound to improve management scores.\n\nOverall, management quality in the \nmanufacturing sector was found to \nbe higher in the United States, Japan, \nCanada, Germany and Sweden.

This major discovery \nprovides visual evidence for the existence of \nblack holes and pushes the boundaries of \nmodern science.\n\nBlack holes are extremely compressed cosmic \nobjects, containing incredible amounts of mass \nwithin a tiny region. Their presence affects \ntheir surroundings in extreme ways, by warping \nspacetime and super-heating any material falling \ninto it. The captured image reveals the black hole \nat the centre of Messier 87, a massive galaxy \nin the constellation of Virgo. This black hole is \nlocated 55 million light-years from Earth and has \na mass 6.5-billion times larger than our sun.\n\nThis major scientific achievement marks \na paradigm shift in our understanding of \nblack holes, confirms the predictions of Albert \nEinstein's General Theory of Relativity and \nopens up new lines of enquiry into our universe. \nThe first image of a black hole successfully \ncaptured was unveiled in six simultaneous \npress conferences across the globe today.\n\nEU funding through the European Research \nCouncil (ERC) has provided crucial support \nto the EHT.

Various companies have \nalso helped not only with the development \nof the kernels, but also with the writing \nof the body of auxiliary software, which is \ndistributed with Linux.

Initially, it was designed as \na response to the ABC programming language \nthat was also foregrounded in the Netherlands. \nThe language was released in 1991. Rather \nthan having all of its functionality built into \nits core, Python was designed to be highly \nextensible. This compact modularity has \nmade it particularly popular as a means of \nadding programmable interfaces to existing \napplications. \n\nSince 2003, Python has consistently ranked \nin the top ten most popular programming \n\nlanguages in the TIOBE Programming \nCommunity Index where, as of December \n2018, it is the third most popular language. \nIt was selected Programming Language \nof the Year in 2007, 2010, and 2018. An \nempirical study found that scripting languages, \nsuch as Python, are more productive than \nconventional languages, such as C and Java, \nfor programming problems involving string \nmanipulation and search in a dictionary.\n\nLarge organisations that use Python \ninclude Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, \nNASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, \nSpotify.

Conclusions\n\nEconomic competencies are important \ncomplementary intangible assets to other \nintangibles, such as R&D, and to tangible assets \nlike investments in machinery. For example, \nstrategic management can lead to the uptake \nof novel technologies that can make a company \nlead in the future. Moreover, investing in the \nworkforce\u2019s cognitive and soft skills makes \norganisations more resilient when coping with \nchange. At the macro level, evidence shows \nthat economic competencies are indeed \ncontributing to both labour productivity \nand economic growth. As regards that \ngrowth-enabling role, the fact that the EU \nunderinvests in economic competencies \nrelative to the United States may limit its \nproductivity growth.\n\nFurthermore, the era of globalisation and \ndigitalisation means fiercer competition \nthan ever. Hence, companies better at \nboosting their reputation and marketing their \nproducts, services and business models are \nlikely to attract a larger market share. For this \nreason, the United States\u2019 clear leadership \nposition in brand value, particularly in \ntechnology companies, means that the \nEU needs to step up its game and become \nbetter at promoting its brands on the \nglobal scene. At the same time, it needs to \nreinforce its technology and digital leadership \nby enabling the right business environment for \nEU digital companies to flourish, which are also \nvery R&D-intensive.\n\n\n\n335\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\n4.

ICTs can also provide \nsolutions for sustainable growth. At the \nsame time, there is still room to improve \nICT diffusion across sectors, firms and \nindividuals in an inclusive way. Information \nand communication technologies (ICTs) play \nan important role in economic growth and in \ntransforming societies by connecting ideas \nand people all over the world. ICT boosts firms\u2019 \nproductivity by improving communication, \nenabling knowledge management and reducing \nproduction costs. Moreover, the use of ICT may \ncreate network effects across sectors, lower \ntransaction costs and increase the speed of \ninnovation, which can boost overall economic \nefficiency and thus total factor productivity \n(Pilat, 2004). In addition, technological progress \nleading to new ICT goods and services can also \nenhance productivity growth in the ICT sector. \nFurthermore, ICT can bring social benefits by \nallowing generalised access to information and \nknowledge, while bringing people together even \nif they are geographically apart. The use of \nICTs can also be determinant for achieving the \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in areas \nsuch as energy efficiency, water management \nand in supporting the overall transition to \na low-carbon economy. ICT-related projects \nare also an important part of EU Framework \nProgrammes to spur R&I in ICT1 in Europe.\n\n1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/research-development-scoreboard\n\nHowever, ICT diffusion has not happened \nat the same pace across firms and \nindividuals. The gap between frontier and \nlaggard companies remains large (although \nthere is some catching-up), which is partly \nexplained by the insufficient diffusion of \ninnovation, notably digital technologies \n(see Chapter 3.1- Productivity puzzle and \ninnovation diffusion). At the same time, \nthe access, adoption and uptake of digital \ntechnologies has yet to become widespread \nacross individuals which illustrates the need to \ncontinue the efforts to make the access to ICT \nmore inclusive. Skills and, in particular, digital \nskills are crucial to navigate this new paradigm. \nChapter 5.2 - Investment in education, human \ncapital and skills analyses differences across \nthe EU in this respect.\n\nIn this chapter, we look at trends in \nICT investment and its contribution to \ngrowth. Moreover, an analysis of the evolution \nof the ICT-producing sector, notably its value-\nadded contribution, employment, innovation \nand R&D intensity, is provided alongside some \nreflections for policy.\n\n\n\n340\n\nFigure 5.4-1 Contribution of ICT capital(1) to GDP growth (percentage points), \naverage over 2000-2008 and 2009-2017\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: OECD Productivity Database\nNote: (1)ICT capital includes computer hardware, telecommunications equipment, and computer and software databases.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter54/figure-54-1.xlsx\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nta\n\nge\n p\n\noi\nnt\n\ns\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\ntes\n\nSo\nuth\n\n Ko\nrea\n\nCa\nna\n\nda\nJa\n\npa\nn\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nNe\nthe\n\nrla\nnd\n\ns\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\nFra\n\nnc\ne\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\nSp\n\nain\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nIta\nly\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nSw\nitz\n\nerl\nan\n\nd\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\n2000-20082009-2017\n\n1. Europe underinvests in ICT\n\nICT capital deepening contributes to \neconomic growth, although its contribution \nseems to have decreased in the last \ndecade. The OECD (2016) points to the drop \nin ICT price relative to GDP price. Moreover, \nresearch shows a significant contribution from \nICT to growth; the major impact on productivity \noccurred between 1995 and 2005 but the \ndiffusion of ICT seems to have stabilised now. \nvan Ark (2016) put forward the idea that we \ncurrently live in the \u2018installation phase\u2019 of the \nnew digitalisation wave, which may imply that \nits impact on productivity may be \u2018on hold\u2019 until \nwe effectively enter the \u2018deployment phase\u2019 of \nthese digital technologies. Figure 5.4-1 provides \na comparison between the contribution of ICT \ncapital-deepening to GDP growth between 2000 \nand 2008, and 2009 and 2017. Overall, its \n\ncontribution has declined worldwide. Similarly, \nAdarov and Stehrer (2019) found a declining \nrole of ICT assets in growth across Japan, the \nUnited States and the EU15 as a whole.\n\nIn the EU, over the period 2009-2017, the \ncontribution was the highest in Sweden, \nthe Netherlands and Austria, and the low-\nest in Italy, Finland and Greece (of those \nMember States with available data). Ireland \nwas the only EU Member State where the \ncontribution from ICT capital has actually \nincreased in recent years. Within the major \neconomies listed below, the United States \nseems to be the economy where the slowdown \nwas least pronounced, which could be evidence \nof greater ICT diffusion in the country in line \nwith the OECD (2016).\n\n\n\n341\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 5\n\nHowever, new research shows that Europe \nappears to have an advantage compared \nto the United States in the most-intensive \nICT-using sector, which accounts for the \nlargest contribution to labour-productivity \ngrowth in recent years. van Ark et al. (2019) \nlook at the contributions of ICT-using and \nICT-producing sectors to labour-productivity \ngrowth over time in 19 EU Member States \nand in the United States. Overall, the authors \nfound that the contribution from the digital-\nproducing sector to productivity growth has \ndeclined in the EU and, to a lesser extent, in the \nUnited States (Figure 5.4-2). However, in recent \nyears in the EU, the contribution to growth in \nlabour productivity in ICT-using sectors seems \n\nto have picked up, notably over the period \n2013-2017. In fact, the most-intensive digital-\nusing sectors make the largest contribution to \nlabour-productivity growth in the EU. On the \ncontrary, in the United States, the role of ICT-\nusing sectors for productivity has declined in \na very pronounced way, while the ICT-producing \nsector has not seen a marked decline (as is the \ncase in the EU). Thus, the authors suggest that \nEurope has an opportunity from its ICT-using \nsectors to boost productivity growth while, in \nthe United States, the ICT-producing sector, \nincluding the big \u2018tech\u2019 companies, may be \nmaking use of many of the available resources \nthat could be limiting extending productivity \nbenefits to the ICT-using sectors in the country.\n\nFigure 5.4-2 Labour productivity growth and contributions from digital-producing \nand most- and least-intensive-using sectors, in %\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: van Ark et al.

In Japan, R&D intensity has \n\nbeen on the decline since 2000, although it \nwas still above that of the EU in 2018.\n\nIn the EU, the R&D intensity of the ICT sector \nwas the highest in Finland, Austria and \nSweden. \u2018Innovation leaders\u2019, namely  Finland, \nSweden and Denmark, and \u2018strong innovators\u2019, \nsuch as Austria and France, rank highest in \nterms of their ICT industries\u2019 R&D intensity in \n2018.

At \nthe same time, the digital divide between \nthe most-advanced and least-digitally-\nadvanced nations seems to be closing. Since \n2014, the European Commission has issued \nthe Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) to \nmonitor and benchmark the evolution of digital \ncompetitiveness in EU Member States across \ndifferent digitalisation pillars. These include the \ndimensions of connectivity, human capital, use \nof internet, integration of digital technology, and \ndigital public services.\n\nThe results of DESI 2019 show that the EU\u2019s \n\u2018digital leaders\u2019 are Finland, Sweden and the \nNetherlands (Figure 5.4-13). On the other hand, \nBulgaria, Romania and Greece are the least-\ndigitally-advanced Member States. Nevertheless, \nall EU Member States seem to have increased \ntheir digital performance between 2014 and \n2019. More importantly, some catching-up from \nthe laggards seems to have taken place, as shown \nby growth rates higher than the EU average. \nHence, all EU Member States are improving \ntheir digital capacities and the digital divide has \nbecome less nuanced, although further efforts \nare needed to continue in this positive path \ntowards digital convergence2.\n\nFigure 5.4-13 Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)(1),  \n2019 and growth rate 2014-2019\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on European Commission, DG CNECT \n(Digital Economy and Society Index 2019)\nNote: (1)The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) is a composite index that tracks the evolution of digital competitiveness.

At the same time, there \nis a need to reduce the global footprint of \nICT which is being fostered by the digital \ntransformation of the economy. In its 2009 \nRecommendation3, the European Commission \noutlines a framework to \u2018mobilise ICTs to \nfacilitate the transition to an energy-efficient, \nlow-carbon economy\u2019, considering the potential \nof ICT to enhance energy efficiency. Indeed, ICTs \ncan act as enablers of a low- (or even zero-) \n\ncarbon economy. The Global e-Sustainability \nInitiative (2015) argues that ICT has the \npotential to cut global carbon emissions by \napproximately 15 % by promoting the efficiency \nof processes and energy use. As a result, ICTs \ncan enable the \u2018smartification\u2019 of many aspects \nof our economies \u2013 i.e. smart cities, smart grids, \nsmart mobility, smart governments, smart \nbusinesses, smart buildings, etc. \u2013 which reduce \nthe environmental impact across sectors.\n\n\n\n354\n\nHowever, with the exponential growth \nof data, more storage and computing \ncapacity is needed. Moreover, the use \nof sophisticated telecoms equipment, \ninfrastructure and mobile devices is also \nconsuming increasing amounts of energy. The \nnew EU Digital Strategy4 explains that today \nthe ICT sector accounts for 5-9 % of electricity \nuse and more than 2 % of global greenhouse \ngas emissions (as much as all air traffic). \nIf unchecked, the footprint could increase to \n14 % of global emissions by 2040. R&I can \nbe fundamental in the move towards \u2018green \nICT\u2019 \u2013 i.e. by exploring and creating new ways \n\n4 EU Digital Strategy: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_281\n\nof making cloud computing and data centres \nenergy efficient, telecom operations powered by \nrenewables, and by generating smart devices. \nFigure 5.4-16 is a simplified representation \nof ICT\u2019s potential impact on greenhouse gas \nemissions. While ICT is an important enabler \nof green growth (left-hand side), there is also \nsubstantial energy consumption by using ICTs \nand the need to increase computing capacity. \nNevertheless, R&I solutions could address \nsome of the pitfalls of digital technologies in \nterms of environmental impact.

Conclusions\n\n5 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_13_94\n\nInvestments in ICT capital remain import-\nant within the range of intangible assets \nfor economic growth, despite a decline in \nrecent years in its contribution to GDP growth. \nThe EU appears to underinvest in ICT compared \nto the United States, so boosting the levels of \ninvestment in ICT equipment and software in \nEurope seems fundamental to ride the next \ninnovation wave.\n\nWhen it comes to the ICT sector, our \nanalysis shows that ICT services in the EU \nare clearly the largest component within \nthe sector. Moreover, the role of the ICT \nsector has remained relatively stable \nover time in the EU, at around 4 % of GDP. \nThe share of employment in the EU\u2019s ICT sector \nhas also risen over the last decade. However, \nthe sector appears  less R&D intensive, less \nproductive and less active in ICT patenting than \nother major economies.\n\nAt the same time, this chapter shows \nthat ICT diffusion is not happening at an \nappropriate rate. Some countries are still \nlagging behind in providing their workforces \nwith the right digital skills, or in the uptake of \ndigital technologies by companies of all sizes, \nand governments. This calls for further \naccumulation and diffusion of ICT capital \nthroughout Europe to ensure the adoption \n\nof digital technologies that will bring \nproductivity gains across the economy.\n\nAnother important consideration relates \nto securing network and information \nsystems. In fact, securing ICT products and \nservices may probably contribute to fostering \ntheir uptake by the market,  society which, \nultimately, could help the ICT sector in the \nEU. The EU Cybersecurity plan focuses on five \npriorities, including achieving cyber- resilience, \ndrastically reducing cybercrime, developing \ncyberdefence policies and capabilities related \nto the Common Security and Defence Policy \n(CSDP),  developing industrial and technological \nresources for cybersecurity, and establishing a \ncoherent international cyberspace policy for \nthe EU and promoting the EU's core values5.\n\nFinally, while on the one hand ICTs can \nprovide solutions to address climate change \nby leading to smart grids, smart buildings \nand smart cities (to name but a few), on the \nother hand, there is a need to reduce ICT\u2019s \nglobal footprint from the energy-intensive \nuse of data centres as well as infrastructure \nfor telecommunications. In this context, \ninvesting in R&I to generate solutions for \nenergy-efficient cloud computing, or the \noptimisation of energy consumption in \ndata centres, can lead to green ICT.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_13_94\n\n\n356\n\n6.

The EU and China are global leaders in terms of \nscientific output, while the United States retains \nthe lead in scientific quality\n\n1 One way to analyse the scientific performance of countries and regions is to look at the number of scientific publications \npublished by the researchers based there. However, the rise of international collaboration over the last 20 years needs to \nbe taken into account as a high proportion of scientific publications now have authors in more than one country.\n\nJointly with China, the EU remains in the \nleading position in terms of the share of \nscientific output worldwide, while the US\u2019 \nshare has continued to shrink. With 7 % of \nthe world population, the EU is responsible for \n20 % of global R&D expenditure and 21 % of \nscientific publications worldwide. However, with \nthe United Kingdom leaving the EU, the EU\u2019s \nshare  declined from 30 % in 2000 to 21 % in \n2018 (see Figure 6.1-1)1.\n\nChina has established itself as a major scientific \nplayer and a competitor in high-tech sectors. The \ncountry\u2019s world share of scientific publications \nrose exponentially from 5.8 % in 2000 to 20.9 % \nin 2018 (see Figure 6.1.2), showing China's \nleadership in the global ranking, jointly with the \nEU (without the UK). Moreover, China\u2019s share of \nworld R&D expenditure has increased from 5 % \nin 2000 to more than 20 % today, which means \nthat its R&D intensity has already overtaken that \nof the EU (European Commission, 2019a: 59).\n\nFigure 6.1-1 World share of scientific publications(1), 2000 and 2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit   \nNotes: (1)Data produced by Science-Metrix based on Scopus database.

However, \nthe 2018 ERA Progress Report found that \n\u2018the balance between competitive funding \nand block funding still varies greatly between \ncountries. In some countries with less-\ndeveloped R&I systems, less competitive \nresearch-performing organisations rely mainly \non block funding; this often affects their ability \nto attract the best talent and to develop and \nmaintain research infrastructures\u2019 (European \nCommission, 2019b: 3). The Horizon 2020 PSF \nMutual Learning Exercise on Performance-\nBased Funding11 recommended Member \nStates to carefully consider the proportion of \ninstitutional funding governed by performance-\nbased criteria as a means of enhancing the \neffectiveness and performance of their public-\nsector research systems.\n\n3.

Natural language processing techniques are used on text corpus (i.e. abstracts of scientific documents) for the \nidentification of deep-learning-related terms (e.g. deep neural networks). Then a selected list of terms is used to identify \nthose WoS documents that involve deep learning. These documents can either contribute methodologically to deep learning \nor use deep-learning-based tools to address disparate research questions. The WoS subject categories assigned to each \ndocument and authors\u2019 affiliations are used to map the diffusion of deep learning across the scientific system.\n\nMuch of the recent success of AI has been \nspurred by impressive achievements within \na broader family of machine-learning \nmethods, commonly referred to as deep \nlearning. Deep learning enables computational \nmodels to learn representations of data with \n\nmultiple levels of abstraction. Deep learning can \nbe viewed as an \u2018invention in the methods of \ninvention\u2019 \u2013 i.e. A technology that transforms the \nprocess of knowledge creation and improves the \npotential for discoveries in combinatorial-type \nresearch problems.\n\nFigure 6.1-13 Publication activity related to deep learning\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Stefano Bianchini, Moritz Muller and Pierre Pelletier, BETA \u2013 Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg\nNote: This figure represents the annual trends in deep-learning documents divided into five WoS subject categories.

However, the important \n\ngeographical dimension inherent in the process \nof creating and disseminating deep-learning-\nrelated knowledge suggests that countries \nare likely to exhibit heterogeneous patterns of \nspecialisation. The performance of any deep-\nlearning system relies heavily on good data.

In addition, to achieve the \nfull potential of deep learning, complementary \nresources are necessary. Among these assets, \nhuman resources (i.e. talented AI researchers) \nare the most important. Deep learning also \nimplies organisational changes in the \nscientific system, such as team structure, \npublic-private interaction, data sharing, etc.\n\nFigure 6.1-14 Geography of deep-learning activity\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Stefano Bianchini, Moritz Muller and Pierre Pelletier, BETA \u2013 Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg\nNote: This figure represents the geography of deep-learning activity by regions in the period 1990-2018.

Promoting digitalisation of public \nresearch has become a priority for almost all EU \nMember States. In addition to open science13, \nMember States are supporting various other \nmeasures, including strengthening researchers\u2019 \ndigital skills by reinforcing interdisciplinarity (i.e. \ncombining computer science with traditional \ndisciplines) or offering specific trainings to \nmaster digital tools.\n\n13 See Chapter 6.2 - Knowledge flows.\n14 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eurohpc-joint-undertaking#Budget, accessed 9 October 2019.\n15 See Chapter 6.2 - Knowledge flows.\n\nMoreover, Member States are investing in \ndigital infrastructures that are critical for \nresearch (for example, platforms for sharing \ndata and supercomputing facilities for AI). In \n2018, the EU launched the European High-\nPerformance Computing Joint Undertaking \n(EuroHPC JU) with a budget of around \nEUR 1 billion to develop top-of-the-range \nexascale supercomputers for processing \nbig data, based on competitive European \ntechnology (see Chapter 7 - R&I enabling \nartificial intelligence)14.\n\nThe digital transformation is also likely to \nchange the accessibility of publications and \ndata which has been limited to date15.

Access to data must \nconsider legal and ethical constraints as well \nas normative attitudes and the availability of \ninfrastructures (OECD, 2019a: 73).\n\n4.

Conclusions\n\nThe EU\u2019s scientific performance is framed \nby several grave developments, including \nthe UK\u2019s exit from the EU, the rise of China, \ndigitalisation, and a new focus on the SDGs. \nThis chapter has shown that the EU and \nChina are the global leaders in terms of \nscientific output, while the United States \nretains the lead in scientific quality. \nNotably, output by Chinese researchers has \nrisen exponentially over the last two decades \nto nearly match the EU.\n\nWithin the EU, there is a diversity of \nresearch intensities among the Member \nStates and a positive correlation between \nscientific quality and R&I investments \nin most countries. Although several EU \nMember States are making numerous efforts \nto enhance the effectiveness and performance \nof their public-sector research systems, further \nefforts are needed to introduce the necessary \npolicy reforms.\n\nDigitalisation has the potential to increase \nscience productivity, enable novel forms \nof discovery and enhance reproducibility. \nIt is transforming science. This chapter has \nillustrated that all areas of research are \nbecoming data-intensive, increasingly relying \nupon and generating big data.\n\nLast but not least, this chapter points \nout that science is key in addressing \nsocietal challenges. The EU leads high-\nquality scientific publications in the food/\nbioeconomy and climate/environment sectors, \nwhile China\u2019s output is increasing exponentially \nacross sectors and the United States has lost \nits overall leadership.\n\nThese findings trigger certain policy implications. \nFirst, to remain a leading global scientific player, \nthe EU and its Member States must strengthen \ntheir efforts to enhance the effectiveness \nand performance of their public research \nsystems through stronger R&I investments \nand policy reforms. Second, to exploit the full \npotential science digitalisation, policies must \nbe adapted to reinforce researcher\u2019s digital \nskills, promote open science as well as ensure \nthe necessary investments in high-quality data \ninfrastructures. And third, as science is key to \naddressing societal challenges, the EU must not \nonly ensure scientific leadership in key areas \nbut must also foster interdisciplinarity \nresearch which is necessary to successfully \ndeliver on the SDGs.\n\n\n\n387\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 6\n\n6.

Yet, mobility \npatterns diverge between Member States in \nterms of mobile human resources in science \nand technology (HRST), international mobility of \nresearchers as well as intersectoral mobility1. \nGreater asymmetric mobility of high-skilled \nprofessionals and academics may exacerbate \nexisting inequalities, thereby further weakening \nthe economy of post-industrial and/or peripheral \nregions and countries (Iammarino et al., 2019). \nIt may also undermine efforts to raise the \nquality and efficiency of all European national \nR&I systems. This calls for a strengthened \nrole of place-based innovation based on the \npartnership of enterprises, universities and \ngovernment, as well as a better understanding \nof drivers of and barriers to international and \nintersectoral mobility.  \n\nWhile mobile human resources in science \nand technology have increased only \nslightly at the EU level in the last 10 years, \nthey remain a small share of the total R&I \nworkers, with differences between the \nMember States. Between 2007 and 2018, \nthe mobility of human resources in science \nand technology (HRST) increased only slightly \nin the EU to reach 7.8 %, with the majority \nof countries oscillating between 10 % and \n5 % of the mobile HRST workforce. However, \nthe overall trend remains disappointing and \nshows a very mixed pattern, as can be seen \nin Figure 6.2-1. A decline in mobility occurs \nboth in northern countries (Denmark, Finland, \nSweden, Iceland and Norway), which were \ncharacterised by higher mobility, and eastern \nand southern countries (Spain, Italy, Latvia, \nBulgaria and Romania) that showed lower \nmobility.

Yet, France, Germany, \nSpain, Italy and Finland report degrees of \nmobility that are lower than the EU average. \nThe size of the national research system also \nhas an impact on researchers\u2019 mobility.

In 2017 51 % of EU researchers \nworked in the private sector, only 20 % of \nthose researchers were female. Intersectoral \nmobility, understood as the mobility of \nresearchers from academia to industry (and vice \nversa), is an important mechanism for fostering \nknowledge transfer and valorisation (in addition \nto graduates working in industry, collaborative \nand contract R&D, and (informal) consulting). \n\nBased on Eurostat data4, 51 % of EU \nresearchers worked in the private sector \nin 2017 (not including not-for-profit \norganisations) compared to 45 % in 2010. \nIn terms of gender, only one fifth (20 %) of \nresearchers in the private sector are female \n(She Figures 2018). More specifically, women \nresearchers were under-represented in 35 of \nthe 39 countries examined by the report. In \nthe majority of European countries, women \nresearchers are more likely to work in the higher \neducation sector or in government. However, \nbetween 2008 and 2015, in the business \nenterprise sector, the annual growth rate among \nwomen researchers was higher than that of men \n(6.5 % for women and 5.6 % for men in the EU28). \nThe proportion of women researchers was within \nthe 40 % to 60 % range in only four countries \n(North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nCroatia and Latvia), while all the other countries \nfailed to reach the 40 % threshold. \n\n4 Based on Eurostat, total R&D personnel (researchers) by sectors of performance, occupation and sex (rd_p_persocc); cf. \nindicator 1.6 in the MORE3 Indicator report on researchers.\n\nFigure 6.2-5 presents the intersectoral mobility \nof researchers currently working for a higher \neducation institution and shows the share of \nresearchers moving to another sector at some \npoint in their research careers. The highest \nlevels of mobility are observed in the eastern \nand southern Member States, with Poland, \nBulgaria, Greece, Czechia and Latvia, while the \nlowest levels of mobility are seen in the northern \nand western Member States. Therefore, there is \na clear pattern of higher intersectoral mobility \nin the lower-performing countries that may \nbe due to poorer prospects for the exclusively \nacademic path. Interestingly, Norway, Croatia \nand Romania are all outliers to this trend. \nMore granular data from the MORE3 study \nshow that later-career-stage researchers are \nmore inclined to take positions in government \norganisations, postdoctoral researchers tend \nto move to private industry and, in particular, \nto small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \nand start-ups, while established researchers are \nmore likely to move to the not-for-profit sector. \n\nThe EU Framework Programme\u2019s Marie \nSk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) support \nintersectoral mobility via co-funding \nof doctoral programmes and the MSCA \nResearch and Innovation Staff Exchange \n(RISE), which are based on flexible intersector \n(within Europe) and international (with third \ncountries) exchanges of highly skilled R&I staff.\n\n\n\n396\n\nFigure 6.2-5 Evolution of intersectoral mobility, 2012 and 2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Commission (2017), MORE3 study  \nNote: Data from MORE3 EU HE survey (2016) and MORE2 EU HE survey (2012). \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter62/figure-62-5.xlsx \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n60\n\n40\n\n50\n\nEU\n28\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\nMa\n\nlta\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nSlo\nve\n\nniaIta\nly\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\nSp\n\nain\n\nIce\nlan\n\nd\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\n%\n\n2016 2012\n\n2.

While open access policies are already \nmature within existing European, national and \ninstitutional policies, advances in data sharing \nface many obstacles, given the lack of data-\nsharing valorisation (journal impact factors and \ncitations; Scheliga and Friesike, 2014). Changing \nthe reward and incentive system for researchers \nis key to ensuring higher take-up and demands \nthe involvement of major stakeholders (higher \neducation institutions, funding agencies, \nministries of science and higher education). The \nCommission has already made provisions for \ncost eligibility for open science activities in its \nnext Framework Programme. \n\nSeveral EU Member States and associated \ncountries are ahead of the United States, \nleading the transition to the open access \nof research outputs, while China and \nSouth Korea are lagging behind.

If relevant data was findable, \naccessible and interoperable for scientists, \nthese combinations would lead to (unforeseen) \nreuse and to faster developments in science. \nThis is the aim of the European Open Science \nCloud (EOSC). \n\nThe EOSC will enable data sharing \nand offer Europe a trusted and open \nenvironment for the scientific community, \nprovide seamless access to data and \ninteroperable services addressing the \nwhole research data life cycle. The \ndevelopment of the EOSC achieves EU policy \nobjectives such as Open Science, FAIR data \nimplementation and the Digital Single Market.\n\nThe EOSC will be a virtual commons \n(resources accessible to all researchers) \nwhere science producers and science \nconsumers come together for greater \ninsights, new ideas and more innovation. \nBy federating research data and services, the \nEOSC adds value. The EOSC uses information \ntechnologies to change the way scientists \nconduct research, and how collective scientific \nknowledge is created across disciplines and \nborders. The EOSC will evolve into a system \nthat is flexible by design and can adapt to \n\nthe changing landscape and technological \nadvances.\n\nA minimal viable EOSC environment is planned \nfor the end of 2020, including agreed rules \nof participation, supporting services for the \nEOSC federation, an initial set of data services \nfor researchers, a persistent identifier policy, \nmetrics for FAIR data and certified services, \nand strategic orientations for financing \nmodels, the legal set-up and governance of \nthe EOSC after 2020.\n\nThe resulting EOSC environment will then be \nprogressively extended and scaled up while \nbuilding on the following common values: \n\n\u00dd\u00dd Focus on research and innovation needs\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Community-driven\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Inclusive and respectful of diversity\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Accessible to all from large equipment, \nlarge computers and \u2018big data\u2019 to \u2018small \ndata\u2019 and long-tail research\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Open by default \u2013 closed where necessary\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Hands-on and participatory \n\n\u00dd\u00dd Transparent and trustworthy.\n\nTwo thirds of researchers in the EU \nhave collaborated or worked in more \nthan one discipline, which is key to \naddressing the economic, social and \nenvironmental transitions required for \na more sustainable Europe. Interdisciplinary \ncollaboration, understood as collaboration \nbetween researchers working in different \n\ndisciplines, is key to fostering knowledge and \ntechnology circulation across Europe. In addition, \ninterdisciplinary research is needed to address \nthe SDGs, enhance the ability to understand the \ncomplex challenges the world currently faces \n(Eagan, Cook and Joeres, 2002) as well as bring \ndiverse perspectives together to find solutions \nand establish and exploit synergies. \n\n\n\n407\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 6\n\nThe MORE3 survey shows that 73.5 % \nof researchers have collaborated with \nresearchers in other fields. In the EU, \n60 % of researchers collaborate with other \nresearchers working in other disciplines but \nwithin the same institute, and 57 % in other \nuniversities or research institutes. However, \nonly 31 % have collaborated with the non-\nacademic sector. This limited knowledge flow \noutside of academia is one of the key issues to \ntackle in order to strengthen the valorisation of \nknowledge in Europe. More efforts are needed to \n\nembed a \u2018valorisation culture\u2019 in publicly funded \nresearch. The same study shows that 34 % of \nresearchers working in the EU have switched \nto another (sub-)field of science during their \nresearch career. Overall, researchers tend to \nhave a positive view on this type of mobility \nin spite of the debates on the caveats of \ninterdisciplinarity \u2013 e.g. difficulties in publishing \narticles based on interdisciplinary approaches, \nlimitations over the peer-review process and \nscientific standards. \n\nFigure 6.2-13 Share of researchers who have collaborated with or worked in more \nthan one field in their current position \n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on MORE3 study\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter62/figure-62-13.xlsx\n\nOf all researchers (n=9,412)\n\nEU28 total Per career stage Per FOS Per gender\n\n2016\n\n73.5 % R1: 66.2 % NAT: 74.4 % F: 74.0 %\n\nR2: 73.7 % ENG: 75.5 % M: 73.2 %\n\nR3: 73.2 % MED: 76.2 %\n\nR4: 77.5 % AGR: 84.7 %\n\nSOC: 67.7 %\n\nHUM: 71.6 %\n\nThe EU has secured its leading position \nin international scientific collaboration, \nwhich has seen sharp increases both in \nthe EU and in the United States and Japan. \nThe EU28\u2019s share of international scientific \nco-publication almost doubled between 2000 \nand 2018 (from 24.6 % to 43.7 %, including \nintra-EU collaborations), with an even more \nsignificant rate of growth observed in the United \nStates (from 18.7 % to 38.3 %) and Japan \n(from 15 % to 30.3 %). South Korea and China \nalso increased their shares of international \nco-publications (from 21.2 % to 28.9 % and \n\n14.8 % to 22 %, respectively). This trend leads \nto improved scientific quality since scientists \nachieve greater impact from their international \ncollaborations. This is actively supported at the \nEuropean level through specific Framework \nProgramme funding and initiatives such as \nMarie-Curie Sk\u0142odowska Actions (MSCA). \nHowever, granular data on EU Member State \ncollaboration shows that several eastern \nEuropean countries (Romania, Bulgaria, \nPoland) still report lower levels of international \nexposure and collaboration (Figure 6.2-14).\n\n\n\n408\n\nFigure 6.2-14 International scientific co-publications as % of total scientific \npublications, 2000 and 2018(1)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit\nData: Science-Metrix based on Scopus database\nNote: (1)EU average includes intra-EU collaborations.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter62/figure-62-14.xlsx\n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\nEU(1) United States Japan South Korea China \n\n%\n \n\n2000 2018 \n\nHorizon 2020 demonstrates broad \ninternational outreach attracting talent \nfrom around the world.

Countries with strong R&I \nperformances, such as Switzerland, Norway and \nIsrael, are the most active associated countries, \nwhile almost one third of participations from non-\nassociated third countries come from the United \nStates (partly due to its significant participation in \nMSCA schemes).\n\nInterestingly, an analysis of the EU\u2019s \nR&I Framework Programme participation \npatterns shows specific preferences for \ncross-country collaborations. Geographical \nand cultural proximities among participants \nseem to play an important role in shaping the \nstructure of collaboration networks, at least \nin the case of the EU Framework Programme \n(Balland et al., 2019).  \n\n\n\n411\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 6\n\n5. Conclusions \n\nAlthough researchers\u2019 mobility remains key \nto knowledge diffusion, stark disparities \nremain between countries in international \nand intersectoral mobility patterns in \nthe EU. In general, countries with a higher \nR&I performance tend to have higher inflows \nand outflows of researchers and the size \nof the R&I system also plays an important \nrole. Those divergences call for a better \nunderstanding of drivers of and barriers to \ninternational and intersectoral mobility as well \nas the implementation of policies to foster brain \ncirculation. \n\nThe EU is catching up with South Korea and \nthe United States in terms of public-private \nco-publications. However, private financing of \npublic research remains stagnated at the global \nlevel, with large disparities between EU countries. \nCollaboration patterns show that a few large \ninnovative companies are making the most of \ninternational and intersectoral cooperation. In \norder to raise the competitiveness of European \nSMEs, the capacity of small firms must be \nstrengthened to enable them to engage in R&I \ncollaborations. As the geographical proximity \nof academia is still paramount for industry\u2019s \ninnovative activities \u2013 in spite of the importance \nof digitalisation policies \u2013 the interaction between \nindustry and academia must continue to be \nfacilitated and strengthened. \n\nThe United States and the EU are leading \nin international technological cooperation, \nwhile China and Japan have taken a step \nback. In some EU countries, as well as in globally \ncatching-up economies, knowledge diffusion \nand technological transformation continues to \nbe stimulated through foreign direct investment \nand foreign business research investment. \nInternational technological cooperation data \npoints to an active policy in China which is trying \nto reduce its need for foreign-based technology \nthrough domestic competitiveness and to \nfurther facilitate Chinese companies\u2019 access to \ninternational markets. This places international \ntechnological cooperation policies in a wider \nperspective of changing global approaches to \ntrade and technological sovereignty. \n\nThe EU continues to lead in open science \npolicy. Among the global trend for intensification \nof international scientific collaboration, the EU has \nsecured its leading position with its Framework \nProgramme playing an important role by \ninvolving participants from third countries. While \nthe EU\u2019s open access policy is well advanced, \nthere is a need to step up efforts to implement \nEurope\u2019s ambitious open and FAIR data policy. \n\n\n\n412\n\n6.

In relative terms, \nthe EU lags behind South Korea, Japan \nand the United States.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In PCT patent applications, there is \nstill an innovation divide in the EU, with \nnorth-western Europe performing well and \nsouth-eastern Europe performing poorly. \n\n\u00dd\u00dd The EU is leading technological progress \nin the fields of energy, climate and \nenvironment and food and bioeconomy. \n\n\u00dd\u00dd Nearly half of the enterprises in the \nEU were considered innovative, with \nhigher shares for product and/or process \ninnovation.\n\n What does it mean for policy?\n\n\u00dd\u00dd The EU needs to support European IP \npolicy and culture, foster science-\nindustry interaction and engage citizens, \nlocal communities and policymakers \nin a knowledge-valorisation policy \nfor societal, environmental and economic \nimpact. In addition to improving innovation \nsystems, the EU must encourage \nstructural reforms that upgrade Member \nStates\u2019 technology profiles.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd To tackle the current innovation divide, \nthe EU needs to support poorly \nperforming countries to improve their \ninnovation systems, facilitate knowledge \ncirculation among EU countries and \nincentivise the creation of innovation-\nintensive sectors in the economy.\n\n\n\n417\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 6\n\n1. Innovation output in Europe is lagging\n\n2 For the last release of the Innovation Output Indicator see Vertesy and Damioli (2020).\n3 Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO (2019); The Global Innovation Index 2019.\n\nAccording to the European Commission\u2019s \nInnovation Output Indicator (IOI), the EU \nlags behind Japan and the United States \nin terms of innovation output, mainly due \nto its poor performance in PCT patent \napplications, with very slow progress \nin recent years2. The composite indicator \naggregates four components to measure \ninnovation output (patents, employment \nin knowledge-intensive activities, trade in \nknowledge-based goods and services, and \ninnovativeness of high-growth enterprises). \nThese figures differ from the latest results \nfrom the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) \nin which the EU surpasses the United States \nfor the first time. However, in addition to these \nfour components, the EIS includes several \nother dimensions such as investments and \nframework conditions. Even though the EU is not \nperforming well as a whole, some EU Member \nStates, such as Sweden, the Netherlands \nand Denmark, show identical or better \nperformances than international competitors \nin several innovation indexes. For instance, the \ntop 10 in the latest Global Innovation Index3 \nincludes 5 EU Member States, with Sweden \nas the best EU performer. In the latest EIS, \nSweden, followed by Finland, Denmark and the \nNetherlands, are the innovation leaders.  \n\nWithin the EU, Ireland is the best performer, \nfollowed by Sweden, Luxembourg and \nHungary. Conversely, with its performance \nworsening, Greece is at the bottom end of the \nIndex, followed by Lithuania and Romania. To \nsome extent, the Innovation Output Indicator \nconfirms the innovation divide between north-\nwestern and south-eastern Europe (Figure 6.3-\n1). However, countries such as Hungary, Malta \nand Czechia, which show high shares of both \nmedium and high-tech products in total exports \nand employment in fast-growing enterprises in \ninnovative sectors, are remarkable exceptions. \nIn terms of progress, innovation output has \nimproved in most EU countries. Countries such as \nMalta and Portugal have improved considerably \nover time as a result of significant increases in \npatent applications and innovative high-growth \nenterprises, while innovation output has declined \nsubstantially in Greece due to deterioration in \nknowledge-intensive services exports and the \ninnovativeness of high-growth enterprises. The \nmixed progress across the EU indicates that the \ninnovation divide is not diminishing, even though \nthe performance of some innovation leaders, \nsuch has Finland, Germany and Denmark, has \nalso dropped. \n\n\n\n418\n\nFigure 6.3-1 Innovation output indicator (EU28, 2011 = 100), 2011, 2014 and 2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Commission, DG Joint Research Centre (V\u00e9rtesy and Damioli, 2020)\nNote: (1)EU: Two sets of values are available: values for worldwide comparison and values for European comparison.

In 2017, the EU accounted for \n20 % of worldwide PCT4 patent applications, \na decline from its 30 % share in 2000 \n(Figure 6.3-2). While the share of PCT patent \napplications has been growing quickly in East \nAsian countries, mainly in Japan and China, in \nWestern countries, such as the United States, \nthe EU and the United Kingdom, the share has \nbeen declining. In 2016, China, in particular, \n\nbecame a powerhouse in international patent \napplications, having caught up quickly by \ngrowing at an annual rate of roughly 22 % \nbetween 2000 and 2017. Even though the \nUnited States remains the world leader in \nPCT patent applications, its share declined \nsignificantly from 40 % in 2000 to 23.5 % in \n2017. When comparing these figures with \nresearch production in terms of scientific \npublications, it can be concluded that the EU \nis not capable of capturing the full value of its \nexcellent science.\n\n\n\n419\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 6\n\nFigure 6.3-2 World shares (%) of PCT patent applications(1), 2000-2017\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: OECD (Patents by technology)\nNote: (1)Patent applications filed under the PCT, at international phase, designating the European Patent Office (EPO).

When normalised by population, PCT \npatent applications in Japan and South Korea \nimproved remarkably over time (Figure 6.3-3). In \n2000, while South Korea was behind the United \nStates, Europe and Canada, in 2017 it was well \nahead of those countries. In recent years, the \nEU\u2019s performance has been quite stable, with an \nincreasing gap with Japan, South Korea and the \nUnited States, but remaining ahead of Canada. \n\nWithin the EU, performances vary \nconsiderably across Member States, \nreinforcing the persistent innovation divide. \nWhile north and western Europe mainly \nperform well, eastern and southern Europe\u2019s \nperformance is poor. Nonetheless, it is \n\n5 EPO and EIPO (2019), IPR-intensive industries and economic performance in the European Union.\n\nimportant to highlight that several factors \nexplain the differences in performance, i.e. \npatenting is linked, among other factors, to \nthe share of manufacturing in value added \n(as manufacturing companies tend to patent \nmore than service-sector companies5), to the \nhigh-tech orientation of the manufacturing \nsector, to the share of ICT and research-related \nservices as against other types of services, to \nthe enterprises\u2019 size distribution in a country \n(as larger enterprises tend to have higher \npatent propensity), and to the location of \ncompany\u2019s headquarters, as patenting tends \nto be carried out in countries with legislation \nwhich favours patent activity. Between 2000 \nand 2017, with the exception of Croatia and \nFinland, all the other EU countries have seen \ntheir performance improving. On the negative \nside, Finland stands out as its performance \n\n\n\n420\n\nhas worsened substantially. This might be \nassociated with the weak performance of Nokia \nwhich is the most important patent applicant6 \nin the country. On the other hand, countries like \nPortugal, Lithuania and Malta have seen two-\ndigit compound growth rates over the same \nperiod.

This might explain the differences \nbetween the United States and EU. Within \nthe EU, according to the European Innovation \nScoreboard, the most innovative economies, \nsuch as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, \nare also the countries with very high levels of \npatent intensity in relation to their levels of \nBERD intensity. On the other hand, Slovenia, \nAustria and Czechia, despite their relatively \nhigh levels of business expenditure in R&D, do \nnot translate this into patent applications. \n\nIn order to assess how innovation is \ncontributing to addressing sustainability \nand the challenges our society is currently \nfacing, one can look at the evolution \nof patent activity in areas such as the \nbioeconomy and food security, climate and \nenvironment, energy, security, transport \nand health. \n\nAs regarding PCT patent applications by \nsocietal challenges12, as defined under \nthe Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, \nthe total number of patent applications \nincreased over time in all fields. However, \nnot all of them follow the same path. After \na significant increase up to 2012, the energy \nsector has shown a decline in recent years, \nalbeit caused by a methodological issue13. \nTransport, which was the third most-\npatented field until 2010, overtook the food \nand bioeconomy sector with more than \n22 000 patent applications in 2016, reducing \nthe gap with health. Health remains the most-\n\n12 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/societal-challenges\n13 The decline is only due to the classification of the energy SGC, namely the Y-classification. A disadvantage of the Y-classification \n\nis that the CPC (Cooperative Patent Classification), on which it is based, is not provided for patents until the patents pending via \nthe PCT process are transferred to the national phase. This is only the case 30 months after registration. The current margin in the \nfigures is therefore even further back than in purely IPC-based patent searches.

Both sectors \nhave a high patent propensity14, reflecting \ntheir high number of patents compared to \nother fields. Even though the field of climate \nhas a persistently low number of patents, \nthis has more than doubled and, in 2016, \naccounted for almost 2 000 patents. Positive \nvariations in the transport (+233 %), energy \n(+239 %), security (+209 %) and climate \n(+133 %) sectors show how fields like climate \nchange, environment and resilience have \nmoved significantly higher in the global \npolitical agenda (Figure 6.3-6)15.  \n\nWhen considering the geographical \ndifferences, both the EU and the United \nStates have been losing ground in patent \napplications in the societal challenges \nfield, while Japan, South Korea and \nChina, in particular, have become more \nimportant.

However, \nthis can also be explained by the strong and \npatent-intensive automotive sector in some \nEuropean countries. Over time, the EU has \nundergone significant changes (Figure 6.3-8). \nWhile in 2000, the EU was more specialised \nthan the rest of the world in all fields except \n\nhealth, in 2016, only transport, food and the \nbioeconomy and climate, which have recovered \nslightly in recent years, were above the world \naverage. In addition, the greatest negative \nvariation was in the fields of security and \nclimate. When comparing the performance \nwith scientific publications, the EU is clearly \nstronger in the food and bioeconomy sector, \nwith specialisation indexes above its main \ncompetitors in both scientific publications and \npatent applications. \n\nFigure 6.3-8 EU Specialisation Index(1) by Societal Grand Challenge \n(vs. rest of the world), 2000-2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit\nNotes: Data produced Science-Metrix using data from the European Patent Office Patstat Spring 2019 database.  \n(1)Specialisation refers to the Intensity in the EU for a given societal challenge relative to the intensity in the world for the same \nresearch area.

These results are \nalso in line with the specialisation indexes in \nscientific publications in the same fields. In the \nhealth sector, however, the United States is \nsignificantly more specialised than the EU in \n\nboth patenting and publishing. Compared to \nChina, the EU has a very small advantage in \nthe field of health, in addition to a very strong \nperformance in terms of scientific publications. \nAs regards the security and energy sectors, the \nEU not only shows lower specialisation than \nChina, but its position has also deteriorated \nover time.

Worldwide figures are, nevertheless, at patent-level, rather than patent family (invention) level. Given that the \npatents covering an invention are very similar, one can assume that they are registered in the same WIPO class.\n\nThe majority of the FP self-reported \ninventions (patent families) are patented in \nhealth-related areas such as biotechnology, \npharmaceuticals, organic chemistry or \nmedical technology. Only a limited number \nof inventions relate to environmental \ntechnology.\n\nThe highest share of FP self-reported inventions \n(patent families) is related to biotechnology16 \n14 % of all self-reported inventions). This is \nalmost 6 times higher than the worldwide average \n(2.1 % of world patents are in biotechnology). \nPharmaceutical inventions follow with around 9 % \nof FP inventions, almost 4 times more than the \nglobal average (2.7 % of world patents are in this \nclass) and 3 times more than inventions registered \n\nat the EPO in this class (3.4 % of all EPO patents). \nOrganic fine chemistry FP inventions are also \nvisibly better represented than the overall world \npicture (a more than twofold increase from 6.1 % \nof FP inventions to 2.6 % in world patents) and \nin line with the percentage of EPO patents in the \nsame class. Inventions in the analysis of biological \nmaterials class, as well as nanotechnology FP \ninventions seem to be over-represented in the \nFP compared to the percentage of patents in \nthese classes  worldwide. At the same time, the \nFramework Programmes produce proportionately \nfewer patents than what is observed worldwide in \nthe electrical machinery and energy class, as well \nas in computer technology, digital communication, \ntelecommunication, transport and environmental \ntechnology classes, among others. \n\nFigure 6.3-10 Technological specialisation index of FP main patents, \nEPO published in 2009-2018 (worldwide=1)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Upcoming Monitoring Flash #4 Patents in FP, DG R&I based on ORBIS Intellectual Property (IP), CORDA and own calculations.  \n The analysis covers self-reported patents from more than 50,000 FP7 and Horizon 2020 projects funded until 2019.\nNote: Values are normalised so that worldwide percentage of patents in each WIPO technology class equals 1.

A trademark is \na distinctive sign that identifies certain goods or services such as those provided by a specific person or organisation and \ndistinguishes them from those of other organisations. Trademarks can be words, pictures, stylised words, logos, a colour or \ncolour combination, a shape, a sound or a combination of those signs.\n\nsuch as Lithuania and Bulgaria have shown \nsignificant improvements in recent years. These \npatterns might be the result of initial reforms \nin incentive systems and framework conditions. \nHowever, good performances in small countries \nlike Luxembourg and Malta might be the result \nof legislation, easy procedures and attractive \ntaxation systems rather than investment in \ninnovation or more innovative companies. \nDespite the good performance of some less-\ninnovative economies, countries performing \ntraditionally well in innovation, like Denmark or \nSweden, not only lead patent applications but \nalso other types of IP applications.

In fact, while patents \nare used mainly for products and to protect \ninnovations that are new to the market, trade \nsecrets and trademarks can be applied in both \nproducts/services and processes and also in \ninnovations new to a firm21, thereby increasing \nthe scope of these types of IP for innovation \nprotection. By type of IPR, Germany, followed by \nAustria and Czechia, show the highest shares \n\n21 European Union Intellectual Property office (2017), Protecting innovation through trade secrets and patents: determinants \nfor European Union firms.\n\nfor trade secrets in the EU; Sweden, followed \nby Bulgaria and Germany, show the highest \nshares for trademarks; and Germany, followed \nby Austria and Sweden, show the highest shares \nfor patents. As for utility models, industrial \ndesign and copyright, the top countries are \nGermany, France and Poland, respectively. Once \nagain, differences in the dominant economic \nsector to which innovative companies belong \nand variations in IPR legislation can explain the \nresults. Nonetheless, the highest shares are \nconcentrated in the more innovative countries \nsuch as Sweden, Germany and Austria. \n\nFigure 6.3-14 Share of innovative and non-innovative enterprises (%) that used \nintellectual property rights (IPRs), 2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat - Community Innovation Survey 2016 (online data code: inn_cis10_ipr)\nNote: (1)EU value estimated with the available 20 EU countries.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter63/figure-63-14.xlsx\n\nEU\n(1\n\n)\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\nIta\n\nly\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\nSp\n\nain\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\nMa\n\nlta\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nTu\nrke\n\ny\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\n\nSe\nrb\n\nia\n\nNo\nrth\n\n M\nac\n\ned\non\n\nia\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n70 \n\nInnovative enterprises Non-innovative enterprises \n\n%\n\n\n\n432\n\nFigure 6.3-15 Share of innovative enterprises (%) by intellectual property rights (IPRs) \nand licensing in the enterprise, 2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat - Community Innovation Survey 2016 (online data code: inn_cis10_ipr)\nNote: (1)EU value estimated with the available 20 EU countries.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter63/figure-63-15.xlsx\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n%\n\nPatent Trademark Utility Model\n\nIndustrial Design Trade Secret Copyright\n\nEU\n(1\n\n)\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\nIta\n\nly\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\nSp\n\nain\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\nMa\n\nlta\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nTu\nrke\n\ny\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\n\nSe\nrb\n\nia\n\nNo\nrth\n\n M\nac\n\ned\non\n\nia\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\n\n\n433\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 6\n\n3. An unequal landscape of innovative enterprises\n\n22 The concepts are in line with those recommended by the Oslo Manual (2005, 3rd edition) which is the internationally rec-\nognised standard methodology for collecting innovation statistics.\n\n23 European Commission (2019), European Innovation Scoreboard 2019.\n24 European Commission (2019). European Semester \u2013 Country Report.\n\nThe share of innovative enterprises \nin an economy also illustrates its \ninnovativeness. By definition, and according \nto the Community Innovation Survey of \n2016, enterprises are considered innovative \nif they carried out innovation activities during \nthe period 2014-2016, including ongoing \nand abandoned activities, i.e. regardless of \nwhether the innovation activity resulted in \nimplementation of an innovation22.  \n\nIn 2016, 48 % of EU enterprises reported \ninnovation activities in the period \n2014-2016, a decline of 5.7 percentage \npoints since 2010. Even though innovation \nperformance has improved over time, \naccording to the latest European Innovation \nScoreboard23, half of the EU countries have \nalso shown a decline in the share of innovative \nenterprises. On the negative side, countries \nsuch as Germany, Romania and Poland stand \nout with a significant decline in the share \nof innovative enterprises (Figure 6.3-16). \nConversely, Lithuania shows a significant \nimprovement when compared to 2010. \nBelgium is the EU country with the highest \nshare of innovative companies (almost 70 %), \nfollowed by Portugal and Finland. Among all \ncountries, Switzerland and Norway are the best \nperformers with shares above 70 %. On the \ndownside, Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and \nHungary have the lowest shares of innovative \ncompanies (less than 30 %). Looking at the \nfigures, the share of innovative enterprises \ndemonstrates the innovation divide between \nnorth-western and south-eastern Europe, with \nsome exceptions such as Portugal, Greece and \nItaly. Portugal, for instance, reports a relatively \n\nhigh share of innovative enterprises, mainly \ndriven by a very high share of innovative SMEs \nin combination with a relatively high share of \npublic support to business R&D investment \nand a good performance of SME investment \nin R&D. In addition, the share of innovative \ncompanies is connected with countries\u2019 \neconomic structures. The higher share of SMEs \nin medium-high, high-tech manufacturing and \nknowledge-intensive services (such as ICT and \nfinance) is likely to translate into a higher share \nof innovative enterprises which, for instance, \nmight explain the results from Belgium and \nLuxembourg.\n\nIn terms of company size, with more \nresources to invest in R&D, large companies \nare naturally more innovative than SMEs. \nHowever, the gap in both shares varies across \ncountries (Figure 6.3-17). More-innovative \ncountries, such as Luxembourg, the Netherlands, \nFinland, Belgium and Denmark show not only \na lower gap but also high shares of innovative \nSMEs and innovative big companies which, as \nmentioned previously, is partly explained by the \neconomic structure. Portugal comes out on top \nwith a high share of innovative SMEs and the \nlowest gap. On the contrary, eastern European \nand less-innovative countries like Romania, \nBulgaria24, Slovenia, Poland and Slovakia, where \nbusiness structures are dominated by few large \nmultinational companies that control most of \nthe business investment in R&D, have the lowest \nshares of innovative SMEs as well as the largest \ngaps between large enterprises and SMEs.  \n\n\n\n434\n\nFigure 6.3-16 Innovative enterprises as % of total number of enterprises, \n2010 and 2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Eurostat - Community Innovation Survey 2016 and 2010 (online data code: inn_cis10_type and inn_cis7_type)\nNote: (1)EU estimated and not including EL.

The economic impact of innovation illustrates \ndiverse national economic structures\n\nIn 2016, innovation turnover in the EU, \nmeasured as sales of new-to-market and \nnew-to-firm innovations, was 12.4 % of \ntotal turnover. Even though in absolute terms, \n\ninnovation turnover increased by 7%, the share \nis slightly lower than in 2010. In addition, the \nshare of innovation turnover fell in 17 of the \n27 EU countries. The decrease is particularly \n\nunable to secure business investment in R&D, \nwhen the highest share comes from external \nsources. As a consequence of deprived national \ninvestment systems, the results confirm the \n\nimportance of European funding in helping \ninnovative companies to fund their activities, \nespecially in the countries that are more \ndistant from the technological frontier.\n\n\n\n439\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 6\n\nsignificant in Denmark, Romania and Hungary \n(Figure 6.3-21). On the other hand, a few \ncountries have shown big improvements, such \nas Ireland, Latvia and Lithuania. Slovakia, \nfollowed by Spain and Ireland, show the highest \nshares of innovation turnover while Romania, \nLuxembourg and Denmark display the lowest \nshares. In Denmark, the result seems to be \nlinked to a high concentration of a few very \nlarge R&D-intensive industries, especially in the \npharmaceutical sector. Similarly, a concentration \nof a few very large R&D-intensive industries \nin Luxembourg\u2019s services sector might explain \n\nits low share. Therefore, these figures indicate \nthat innovation turnover does not seem to be \naligned to the share of innovative enterprises or \nthe country\u2019s innovation capacity. However, it is \nimportant to note that, while data on company \nshares includes several types of innovation and \nare dominated by the high number of SMEs, as \nregards turnover, larger companies play a bigger \nrole, especially multinational companies that \nimport innovations from the headquarter country. \nCountries with a relatively large high-tech and \nmedium-high-tech manufacturing sector also \ntend to show higher innovation turnover. \n\nFigure 6.3-21 Sales of new-to-market and new-to-firm innovations as % \nof total turnover, 2010 and 2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat - Community Innovation \nSurvey 2016 and 2010 (online data code: inn_cis10_prodt and inn_cis7_prod) and European Innovation Scoreboard 2019\nNote: (1)EU value was estimated.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter63/figure-63-21.xlsx\n\nEU\n(1\n\n)\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\nSp\n\nain\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\nIta\n\nly\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\nMa\n\nlta\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nSe\nrb\n\nia\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\n\nNo\nrth\n\n M\nac\n\ned\non\n\nia\n0 \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n20 \n\n25 \n\n%\n \n\n2016 2010\n\n\n\n440\n\nAs regards the export share of medium- \nand high-tech products, South Korea and \nJapan, with strong ICT hardware and \nautomotive industries, show the best \nperformance.

Athens \nused innovation to engage citizens, revive the \nlocal community, boost creativity and dynamism, \nand open the city to the world. \n\nAfter major cuts in resources and greater \npressure on public services, Athens revamped \nits policymaking processes to innovate quickly \nso that, along with its citizens, it could revive \nthe local economy, build up infrastructure and \nrebuild the residents\u2019 confidence in their city. \nInclusion and cooperation with citizens and \ncivil society is, more than anything else, what \nhas made this approach work. The innovation-\nsupport processes were accountable and \ntransparent, while citizens were consulted on \ndecisions throughout. This helped to regenerate \nneighbourhoods, integrate refugees, and improve \neducation and digital access. Athens now brings \ngroups together to improve the city rather than \ndirecting change from the top, showing that \ninnovation enables cities to do more with less. \nIn the end, the city has new businesses, a more \nattractive urban environment a revived cultural \nscene and better services.\n\nAs the previous Commissioner, Carlos Moedas \nstated: \u2018Athens stands out as an example that \na city facing many challenges can achieve great \nthings. Through innovation, Athens has found \nnew purpose to turn around the economic and \nsocial crisis.\u2019 \n\nExamples of initiatives include: \n\n\u00dd\u00dd The POLIS\u00b227 project aimed to revitalise \nabandoned buildings by providing small \ngrants to residents, small enterprises, creative \ncommunities and other civil society groups \nand to bring life to all corners of Athens.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd The Curing the Limbo28 initiative gives \nrefugees and migrants the possibility to \nconnect with other residents in order to \nlearn the language, develop new skills, find \nemployment opportunities, and engage in \nactive citizenship.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd The Digital Council29 brought together \ncompanies and educational institutions \nin the city to provide training on digital \nliteracy and civic technology as well as to \npromote sustainable innovations like smart \nrecycling bins \n\nIn 2019, Athens passed its title to the city of \nNantes, awarded for its open and inclusive \ngovernance approach, involving citizens in \u2018grand \ndebates\u2019 and discussions on major societal \nchallenges, leading to concrete initiatives. In \naddition, the city has built a dynamic and thriving \ndigital and start-up community, driving the city\u2019s \ninnovative ecosystem and providing cutting-\nedge solutions to local challenges.\n\nhttp://www.polis2.thisisathens.org/en/\nhttps://www.uia-initiative.eu/en/uia-cities/athens\nhttp://athenspartnership.org/news/\n\n\n445\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 6\n\nNantes' flagship policies and projects include:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd 15 places to be reinvented30: a competitive \nselection of ideas submitted by citizens that \nresulted, for instance, in turning an unused \nchapel into an urban mushroom farm or \ncreating a zero-waste awareness hub in \na former art school.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Nantes CityLab31 helps innovators test new \nsolutions in real life by providing physical and \ndigital infrastructure, such as a 3D-printed \nsocial house constructed in 3 days or an \nautonomous shuttle powered exclusively by \na solar road.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Creative factory32, a support system for \ncreative and cultural industries, and the \nEco-innovation factory33, a programme that \nselects projects such as one which uses \nbicycle trailers to collect biowaste from \nrestaurants and offices for local composting.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd The Nantes French Tech Capital34 programme \nfosters start-ups, scale-ups, attracting talents \nand breakthrough technologies, and enables \nthe coordination and promotion of the \nregional innovation ecosystem.\n\n30 https://www.nantes.fr/15lieux\n31 https://twitter.com/NantesCitylab\n32 https://www.creativefactory.info/\n33 http://www.nantes.fr/home/actualites/ville-de-nantes/economie/2017/ecoinnovation.html\n34 https://lacite-nantes.fr/nantes-labellisee-capitale-french-tech-465488.html\n35 https://ecossolies.fr/\n36 https://www.hacoopa.coop/decembre-2018-laureat-du-prix-de-linnovation-sociale/\n37 http://www.boutabout.org/\n38 https://www.mysmartlife.eu/cities/nantes/\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Ecossolies35 is a network that gathers \nprivate and public members to develop \ninitiatives in the field of social and solidarity \neconomy and promote them by awarding \nthe best social innovation solutions, such as \nthe Hacoopa36 project for housing the elderly \nor the Bout\u2019 \u00e0 Bout\u2019 association37 which is \nreducing the impact of the used glass bottles. \n\n\u00dd\u00dd MySMARTLife38 is an innovative European \nproject focusing on smart solutions for \nurban transition.\n\nhttps://www.nantes.fr/15lieux\nhttps://twitter.com/NantesCitylab\nhttps://www.creativefactory.info/\nhttp://www.nantes.fr/home/actualites/ville-de-nantes/economie/2017/ecoinnovation.html\nhttps://lacite-nantes.fr/nantes-labellisee-capitale-french-tech-465488.html\nhttps://www.nantes.fr/15lieux\nhttps://twitter.com/NantesCitylab\nhttps://www.creativefactory.info/\nhttp://www.nantes.fr/home/actualites/ville-de-nantes/economie/2017/ecoinnovation.html\nhttps://lacite-nantes.fr/nantes-labellisee-capitale-french-tech-465488.html\nhttps://ecossolies.fr/\nhttps://www.hacoopa.coop/decembre-2018-laureat-du-prix-de-linnovation-sociale/\nhttp://www.boutabout.org/\nhttps://www.mysmartlife.eu/cities/nantes/\nhttps://www.hacoopa.coop/decembre-2018-laureat-du-prix-de-linnovation-sociale/\nhttp://www.boutabout.org/\nhttps://www.mysmartlife.eu/cities/nantes/\n\n\n446\n\n5.   The need for a stronger knowledge valorisation \npolicy in Europe \n\n39 COM(2013), Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and \nSocial Committee and the Committee of the Regions.\n\n40 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9507-2018-INIT/en/pdf\n\nInnovation encompasses several dimen-\nsions. As shown previously, innovation output \u2013 \nas defined by the composite indicator produced \nby the Joint Research Centre \u2013 includes four \nindicators: patents, employment in knowledge-\nintensive activities, the competitiveness of \nknowledge-intensive goods and services, and \na measure of employment in fast-growing \nfirms in innovative sectors (V\u00e9rtesy and Damioli, \n2020). The patents component includes \ninventions that use the knowledge generated by \ninvesting in R&D and innovation, and which can \nbe transformed into successful technologies. \nSimilarly, indicators for the intensity of skilled \nlabour employment, in knowledge-intensive \nactivities and in fast-growing firms provide an \nindication of an economy\u2019s orientation towards \nthe production of goods and services with \ninnovation added value. Finally, the trade flows \nassociated with these commodities measure \ntheir capacity to reach global markets39.\n\nIt is necessary to go beyond the approach \nof innovation output only, towards a more \nholistic approach in order to understand \nhow knowledge is valorised, i.e. the process of \ncreating value from knowledge and turning the \nresults into sustainable solutions with economic \nvalue and societal benefits. This holistic \napproach should also include investments, \nknowledge flows, scientific performance and \ncitizens\u2019 engagement. R&I can only play \na decisive role in shaping the climate-ecological, \nsocial and economic transitions if excellent \nresults are made available quickly and put to \npractical use on a large scale. This is fully in line \nwith the Council Resolution of 29 May 2018 on \n\u2018Accelerating knowledge circulation in the EU\u201940.\n\nThere is a need to reinforce knowledge \nvalorisation in Europe. When looking at \nFigure 6.3-26, even though the EU outperforms \nthe United States in terms of scientific output \nand number of researchers, it is surpassed in \nscientific quality, technological progress and \nthe share of high-tech sectors in the economy. \nMore worryingly, the EU lags significantly \nbehind in terms of business-academia linkages. \nIf Europe wants to catch up and become more \ncompetitive internationally, it needs to address \nits deficiencies by promoting a culture of \nknowledge valorisation in European R&I system, \nensuring that the knowledge-based institutions \nknow how to manage their intellectual capital \nand improving the links between academia, \nindustry, citizens and policymakers. \n\nA strong valorisation policy relies on \na toolbox of instruments that acknow-\nledges different knowledge valorisation \nchannels. Many strategies, instruments and \nmeasures have been developed at the European, \nnational and regional level, by private and public \nplayers, to enhance knowledge transfer and \nvalorisation. For instance:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Academia-industry connections as well \nas the interaction of innovative companies \nin different sectors provide key channels for \nknowledge diffusion and valorisation. The \nEU Framework Programmes and Member \nStates support these collaborations through, \nfor example, collaborative research, public-\nprivate partnerships, innovation brokers and \nother intermediaries, mobility programmes, \nknowledge clusters, startup finance schemes, \netc. Digital solutions such as platforms \n\n\n\n447\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 6\n\nFigure 6.3-26 Knowledge-valorisation approach, latest available year\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Eurostat, data produced by Science-\nMetrix using data from the Scopus database and OECD data\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter63/figure-63-26.xlsx\n\nEU = 1 United States\nResearchers\n\nShare of HT sector\nin total value added\n\nWorld share of\nscientific publications\n\nPCT patents\nintensity\n\nWorld share of top 10 %\nscientific publications\n\nPublic-private scientific\npublications per capita\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nprovide new opportunities for industry cross-\nfertilisation and for better linking the various \nactors in the innovation system, for instance, to \nconnect the demand side, including end-user \nexpectations, with the supply of innovations.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Without citizen engagement even the \nbest-designed strategies and activities for \nvalorisation would not achieve the highest \nimpact or sufficiently support the economic, \nsocial and ecological transition in an inclusive \nway \u2013 so that no community or region across \nEurope is left behind. A European knowledge \nvalorisation policy also needs to ensure that \nit benefits all citizens, including by enabling \nresearch results and innovations to feed \nsolutions in cities and regions across Europe \nthat respond to their needs.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Intellectual property fosters innovation, \ncreativity and knowledge sharing, as the \nbasis for progress, growth and employment. \nIP protection is a tool to balance the \ninterests of both society and innovators. \nStandardisation facilitates the access to \nand spreading of new products in the market.\n\nExamining and sharing experiences and \nbest practices of knowledge valorisation \ncan be a powerful way to improve national \nand European strategies and policies and to \nenhance the societal and economic uptake of \nresearch-based solutions across the Union.\n\n\n\n448\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nThis chapter shows that innovation \noutput in the EU continues to lag behind \nJapan and the United States. Compared \nto the United States, the EU is stronger \nin exporting high-tech manufacturing \nproducts and knowledge-intensive \nservices, but weaker in terms of qualified \nemployment and patent applications. On the \nother hand, Japan and South Korea are \nleading in patent applications and exports \nof high-tech products. In terms of PCT patent \napplications, the EU and the United States \nhave been losing their share to countries like \nJapan and China, while in the case of China, \nits growth has been particularly impressive, \nputting additional competitive pressure on the \nEU. The findings show that if the EU wants \nto remain competitive and catch up with \nits main competitors it needs to make \nextra efforts, especially in supporting \nEuropean IP policy, in fostering science-\nindustry interaction and in improving its \nknowledge valorisation policy.  \n\nThe innovation divide within the EU \nremains stable. While north-western Europe \nperforms relatively well in most of the indicators, \nsouth-eastern Europe performs relatively \npoorly. Despite the fact that the countries\u2019 \neconomic structure also plays an important \nrole in explaining the differences in innovation \nperformance, the EU can still do more to reduce \nthe innovation divide among its Member States \nby supporting the improvement of national \ninnovation systems and facilitating knowledge \ncirculation. Ultimately, tackling the innovation \ndivide will help the EU as a whole to become \nmore competitive and innovative worldwide. \n\nThe chapter also shows that the share of \ninnovation companies and innovation \nturnover fell in the EU between 2010 \nand 2016. Nearly half of the companies in \nthe EU are innovative, with higher shares for \nproduct and/or process innovation. In addition, \naround half of European SMEs are innovative. \nEncouraging the creation of innovation-\nintensive sectors and upgrading the \ntechnology profiles of Member States \nwould definitely help the EU to have more \ninnovative enterprises that can boost jobs and \neconomic growth. \n\nLast but not least, the figures show that the \nEU is leading technological progress \nin the fields of transport, climate and \nenergy, where it shows the highest shares in \nterms of patent applications, while the United \nStates leads in the health, bioeconomy and \nfood and security sectors. In all fields, China \nhas reported extraordinary increases in its \nshare.

Artificial intelligence: a potential game changer \nfor productivity and sustainability\n\n1 Based on European Commission (2019), Report by the High-Level Expert Group on AI set up by the European Commission.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of \nstudy is already 70 years old. In 1950, Alan \nTuring put forward the so-called \u2018Turing test\u2019 as \na way of determining if a computer is capable \nof thinking like a human. John McCarthy, \na computer scientist, then coined the term \n\u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 during a conference in \n1955. Between 1955 and 1997 \u2013 when IBM\u2019s \nDeep Blue defeated Gary Kasparov, world chess \nchampion \u2013 there were periods of progress \nin the field, often restricted to highly specific \napplications and notably in natural language \nprocessing and neural networks. However, \nthere were also periods known as \u2018AI winters\u2019, \nbrought about by overly big expectations, a lack \nof practical applications of AI and, ultimately, \nreductions in AI research funding. In 2006, \ndevelopments in deep learning generated \n\nfurther enthusiasm around AI. Importantly, \nthe rise of big data allied to greater cloud and \ncomputing-processing capabilities boosted \nnumerous developments in the field. Nowadays, \nAI is not only present as a tool in scientific \nresearch and industry activities but is also \nincreasingly in everyday life.\n\nAlthough there is currently no established \nglobal definition of AI, a recent definition \nput forward by the High-Level Expert Group \non AI, set up by the European Commission1, \nis presented in Box 7-1. It includes the sub-\ndisciplines described in Figure 7-1, namely \nmachine learning (and, within this category, \ndeep learning and reinforcement learning), \nreasoning processes as well as intersections \nwith robotics fields, for example, sensors.\n\nBOX 7-1 Towards an AI definition\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems are \nsoftware (and possibly also hardware) \nsystems designed by humans that, given \na complex goal, act in the physical or digital \ndimension by perceiving their environment \nthrough data acquisition, interpreting the \ncollected structured or unstructured data, \nreasoning on the knowledge, or processing \nthe information derived from this data and \ndeciding the best action(s) to take to achieve \nthe given goal. AI systems can either use \nsymbolic rules or learn a numeric model, \nand can also adapt their behaviour by \nanalysing how the environment is affected \nby their previous actions.\n\nAs a scientific discipline, AI includes \nseveral approaches and techniques, \nsuch as machine learning (of which deep \nlearning and reinforcement learning are \nspecific examples), machine reasoning \n(which includes planning, scheduling, \nknowledge representation and reasoning, \nsearch, and optimisation), and robotics \n(which includes control, perception, \nsensors and actuators, as well as the \nintegration of all other techniques into \ncyber-physical systems) (see Figure 7-1).\n\nSource: European Commission (2019), Report by the High-Level Expert Group on AI set up by the European \nCommission\n\n\n\n454\n\nFigure 7-1 A simplified overview of AI\u2019s sub-disciplines and their relationship\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Commission (2019), Report by the High-Level Independent Expert Group on AI\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-1.xlsx\n\nMachine learning\nRobotics\n\nReasoning\n\nDeep learning\n\nSearch /\noptimise\n\nPlanning /\nscheduling\n\nKnowledge\nrepresentation / reasoning\n\nReinforcement\nlearning\n\nAchieving the full potential of AI for pro-\nductivity depends on having in place the \nright complementary skills, infrastructure, \nand management culture. The fact that AI is \nseen by many as the \u2018new electricity\u2019 relates to its \ncross-cutting applications that make it a general-\npurpose technology capable of driving efficiency \nand productivity in virtually all sectors of the \neconomy. By optimising operations and enabling \naccurate predictions, AI can also potentially be \na powerful tool to help achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. However, while digital \ntechnologies such as AI hold a lot of promise \nfor boosting growth and competitiveness, \nproductivity growth remains lackluster. Chapter \n3.1 - Productivity puzzle and innovation diffusion \nhighlights potential explanations for this, notably \nthe widening productivity gap between the most- \nand least-productive firms due to insufficient \ninnovation diffusion and the rising market \nconcentration around \u2018superstar firms\u2019.\n\nIn the specific case of AI, Brynjolfsson et \nal. (2017) point to the time lag in imple-\nmenting new technologies such as AI, or \n\npotential productivity mismeasurements \nfollowing a \u2018J-curve\u2019 (Brynjolfsson et al., \n2018). Moreover, AI investments depend on \nother complementary efforts and intangible \ninvestments that may take some time to \nmaterialise. These might include organisational \nand managerial changes and the need to acquire \nnew skills or retrain staff, among others. The \nauthors refer to the steam engine, electricity, \nand the internal combustion engine to argue that \ntheir impact also took some years (even decades) \nto be felt. Furthermore, AI can enable faster \nscientific discovery (OECD, 2018a) especially \nat a time when research productivity may be \nfalling and new ideas seem harder to find, as \nhighlighted by Bloom et al. (2017). Finally, AI can \nhelp increase productivity by helping humans use \nincreased capabilities faster, and enabling more \nreliable forecasting, more flexibility in operations \nbased on huge amounts of data, more precision, \netc. On the other hand, automation entails risks \nas regards replacing many jobs and tasks as well \nas other issues related to the future of work, as \naddressed in Chapter 4.1- Innovation, the future \nof work and inequality.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-1.xlsx\n\n\n455\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\nFigure 7-2 Examples of cross-sector applications of AI as a general-purpose \ntechnology to optimise operations and increase efficiency\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Statista - AI report (2019), fao.org - State \nof food nutrition, futurefarming.com, Forbes - How Is AI Used In Education, European Commission (2018), PwC, Forbes with Intel \u2013 Sizing \nUp AI\u2019s Predictive Analytics Powers In Healthcare: Top Use Cases, softwebsolutions.com.

Figure 7-2 provides some \nconcrete examples of AI applications across \ndifferent sectors of the economy. For example, \nin agriculture, AI technologies can better predict \ncrop outputs and detect pest infestations. In \nhealthcare, AI can contribute to drug discovery \nand early diagnosis. In industry, operations such \nas supply chain management can be optimised \nand quality control improved. In energy, power-\ngrid optimisation can rationalise energy supply \nbased on demand. However, AI applications \nalso pose some risks or face certain obstacles. \nOECD (2019a) stresses that in agriculture the \nlack of network connections in rural areas may \nundermine the use of sophisticated systems, \nand high-tech farms may require costly \ninvestments in automation tools and sensors. \nIn addition, in healthcare the data privacy of \npatients must be taken into account.\n\nThe role of AI in tackling global challenges \nshould not be underrated. In fact, AI \nand other digital technologies can be \nimportant channels towards cutting \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions. At the \nsame time, AI itself may be a contributor \nto further emissions, namely due to \ngreater energy consumption resulting \nfrom, for example, data centres \nand supercomputers. R&I can act as \na mitigator by contributing to energy-\nefficient computing and \u2018greener\u2019 \nsolutions. According to the Global Action \nSummit (2018), AI and digital technologies \ncan contribute to cutting global emissions \nacross sectors. For instance, annual emissions \nfrom the energy supply would be reduced \nvia better grid flexibility and storage. Efficient \nshipping would also be an important channel \nfor reducing the emissions from the transport \nsector, and precision agriculture could reduce \nthe sector\u2019s footprint.\n\nWith growing digitalisation and ever-\nlarger data flows, the need for both \nnetwork capacity and computing power \nhas increased enormously. As a result, \nenergy demand from data centres and data-\ntransmission networks could be on the rise. \nAndrae (2017) estimates that data centres \ncould account for 10 % of total electricity \nuse by 2025. Fortunately, the International \nEnergy Agency (2019) argues that to date \ntechnological progress in energy efficiency has \ncontributed to limiting the growth of electricity \ndemand and usage. In fact, accordingly, there \nhas been a shift away from small, inefficient \ndata centres towards much larger cloud and \nhyperscale data centres. Indeed, trade-offs \nmay occur. As discussed in Vinuesa et al. \n(2020), while AI can act as an enabler in 79 % \nof all SDG targets, the progress of 35 % of \nthem may be inhibited by AI, at least to some \nextent (Figure 7-3). As stated by the authors, \nthis requires policies that help direct the vast \npotential of AI towards the highest benefit for \nindividuals and the environment, as well as \ntowards achieving the SDGs.\n\nThus, R&I can be a powerful ally by \ngenerating \u2018greener\u2019 solutions. At the EU \nlevel, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking will develop \na \u2018world-class supercomputing ecosystem \nin Europe\u2019 that will also use R&I to develop \na low-power processor, for example. However, \nconcerns over the environmental footprint of \nAI and data centres will remain in both the \nshort and long run. According to Strubell et al. \n(2019), training a deep learning model could \nbe equivalent to that of the lifetime of five \ncars, which calls for the greater mobilisation \nof R&I efforts to boost the energy efficiency of \ndigital technologies, and eventually to replace \nthe most-pollutant technologies with more \nenergy-efficient or even carbon-neutral ones.\n\n\n\n457\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\nFigure 7-3 Summary of positive and negative impacts of AI  \non various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource:  Vinuesa, R., Azizpour, H., Leite, I. et al.

The Canadian start-up BlueDot \ndetected an outbreak2 of pneumonia cases in \nWuhan in December and identified the cities \n\nthat were at the highest risk of facing their \nown outbreaks.\n\nAI has been used to detect visual signs of \nCOVID-19 on images from lung CT scans, \nmonitoring changes in body temperature in real \ntime, providing an open-source data platform \nto track and monitor the spread of the disease, \nand is increasingly being used to help identify \npotential treatments and cures. At the same \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-3.xlsx\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/bluedot-used-artificial-intelligence-to-predict-coronavirus-spread.html\n\n\n458\n\ntime, the use of AI tracking and surveillance tools \nin the context of this pandemic has clearly shown \nthe need for a global ethical governance of AI.\n\nAI solutions in the fight against COVID-19\n\nAll over the world, ambitious R&I projects and \ncollaborations to track, monitor and contain \nthe COVID-19 pandemic are increasingly being \ncarried out, including AI-powered solutions. \n\nAI-related applications have enabled \npopulation screening, tracking the spread \nof the infection3, and the detection and \ndiagnosis of COVID-19. The new Pan \nEuropean Privacy- Preserving Proximity Tracing \ninitiative, compromising more than 130 \nmembers across eight European countries, is \none of several endeavours to set up a tracking \nsystem using mobile phones and anonymised \ndata in compliance with the European GDPR. \nAn important challenge in this respect would \nbe to ensure the compatibility of such national \nsystems across the EU. \n\nAI is also used to further speed up the drug-\ndevelopment process by modelling the efficacy \nof these drugs prior to clinical trials. In this \ncontext, AI could also optimise the process \nof clinical trials to discover new and effective \ndrugs and vaccines. \n\nAs mentioned in Ting et al. (2020), \u2018the utilization \nof various AI-based triage systems could \npotentially alleviate the clinical load of physicians\u2019. \nThis includes, for instance, online medical \n\u2018chat bots\u2019 to guide patients in understanding \ntheir symptoms, providing guidelines for hand \nwashing, and guiding patients through the next \nsteps should their symptoms worsen.

To date, this \ninventory has shown that the R&I community \nand enterprises have been very active in \ncoming up with such solutions. For example, \nthe Lucentia Lab in Spain has developed a \nplatform for big data and AI for handling \npatients. In Belgium, KU Leuven has deployed \ntherapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV \ninfection, and there are many other examples.\n\nOpen data based on FAIR principles5 and \nhigh-performance computing6 are key\n\nOpenly accessible, machine-readable, inter-\noperable data is needed to track, monitor \nand forecast the spread of COVID-19.

The \nproject is now processing digital models of the \ncoronavirus\u2019 protein and matching them against \na database of thousands of existing drugs, \naiming to discover which combinations of active \nmolecules could react to the virus. The project \nhas received EUR 3 million in funding from the \nEU\u2019s Horizon 2020 for research into COVID-19 \nvaccine development, treatment and diagnostics. \n\n7 https://www.exscalate.eu/en/\n8 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/forecasting-coronavirus-pandemic-help-eu-projects\n9 https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/231807\n10 http://www.gleamviz.org/\n\nEU projects mobilised to forecast and model \nthe pandemic8 \n\nThe EPIWORK9 project aimed to develop \na set of tools and knowledge to design \ninfrastructures that could forecast epidemics. \nIt resulted in the Global Epidemic and Mobility \nModel project (GLEAM)10 to deliver the analytic \nand forecasting power that could minimise the \nimpact of potentially devastating epidemics. \nResearchers who worked on these projects are \ncurrently using the results to try to understand \nhow the current pandemic may spread, how it \nmay evolve over time and how containment \nand prevention measures may help.\n\nAI solutions could also help to provide scenarios \nfor a gradual exit from the lockdown by guiding \nthe necessary social distancing and adapting \nthe measures to the corresponding risks.\n\n2. Global AI trends \n\nData explosion, stronger computational \npower, more sophisticated algorithms \nand open source software have fostered \nsignificant developments in AI R&I. The \nvolume of data and information created has \nincreased dramatically from just two zettabytes \nin 2010 to 26 in 2017 and is expected to \nreach 175 zettabytes by 2025 (Figure 7-4). \nThis data explosion has been fuelled by the \ndigital transformation of firms, economies \nand societies. Nowadays, the sources of data \nproduction include not only transactional and \npersonal data, but also social interactions and \nmachine-generated data. Indeed, the use of \npersonal devices such as smart phones has \nboosted the number of interactions online \n\nthrough, for example, video views and engaging \nin social media platforms. In addition, greater \ncloud capacity has enabled the management \nand storage of big datasets. The connection of \ndifferent Internet of Things (IoT) devices has \nalso generated large amounts of new data. \nAs a result, the increasing production of data \ncombined with more sophisticated techniques \nto explore and analyse databases have enabled \nimportant developments in AI, notably in deep \nlearning. However, not only huge amounts of \ndata are needed for accurate predictions \u2013 \nthe data must also be high quality.

It will \nserve as a channel providing access to \nall European AI resources to all related \ncommunities, both researchers/developers \nand users, identifying synergies, avoiding \nfragmentation and sharing resources, \nexpertise and skills. This platform will also \n\ncollaborate with the network of Digital \nInnovation Hubs13 distributed all over \nEurope which is helping local economies \nto take advantage of what technologies \nsuch as AI have to offer. In addition, as \naccess to data in Europe is often in silos, \nwith no standard data structures, the \nAI4EU on-demand platform can improve \nthe facilitation of access to data and \nknowledge sources.\n\n\u2018Deep-tech\u2019 and, in particular, AI, are \nthe result of the co-development of \nhard-core science and technology.

Hence, academia and public research \norganisations have an increasingly important role \nin AI-driven innovations which has been intensified \nby greater mobility. \n\nThe role of intellectual property (IP) in AI \nspin-offs also needs to be better understood. \nFor example, it has been suggested that the \nstandard technological discovery model does not \napply in spin-outs based on machine learning \nthat may rely instead on know-how on the part \nof the academic founders, which is central to the \nnew business (Royal Society, 2017).\n\nFigure 7-8 Other scientific fields for AI-related scientific documents as a percentage \nof all AI-related documents, 1996-2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: OECD (2019a), Measuring the Digital transformation\nNote: Calculations based on Scopus Custom data, Elsevier, Version 1.2018, January 2019. \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-8.xlsx\n\n \n\nMa\nte\n\nria\nls \n\nsc\nien\n\nce\n\nEa\nrth\n\n an\nd p\n\nlan\net\n\nar\ny s\n\ncie\nnc\n\nes\n\nEn\ner\n\ngy\n\nBio\nch\n\nem\nist\n\nry\n, g\n\nen\net\n\nics\n an\n\nd m\nole\n\ncu\nlar\n\n bi\nolo\n\ngy\n\nSo\ncia\n\nl s\ncie\n\nnc\nes\n\nDe\ncis\n\nion\n sc\n\nien\nce\n\ns\n\nEn\nvir\n\non\nme\n\nnt\nal \n\nsc\nien\n\nce\n\nAg\nric\n\nult\nur\n\nal \nan\n\nd b\niol\n\nog\nica\n\nl s\ncie\n\nnc\nes\n\nCh\nem\n\nist\nry\n\nMu\nlti\n\ndis\ncip\n\nlin\nar\n\ny\n\nCh\nem\n\nica\nl e\n\nng\nine\n\ner\ning\n\nNe\nur\n\nos\ncie\n\nnc\ne\n\nBu\nsin\n\nes\ns, \n\nma\nna\n\nge\nme\n\nnt\n an\n\nd a\ncc\n\nou\nnt\n\ning\n\nAr\nts \n\nan\nd h\n\num\nan\n\niti\nes\n\nHe\nalt\n\nh p\nro\n\nfe\nss\n\nion\ns\n\nEc\non\n\nom\nics\n\n, e\nco\n\nno\nme\n\ntri\ncs\n\n an\nd fi\n\nna\nnc\n\ne\n\nPs\nyc\n\nho\nlog\n\ny\n\nPh\nar\n\nma\nco\n\nlog\ny, \n\nto\nxic\n\nolo\ngy\n\n an\nd p\n\nha\nrm\n\nac\neu\n\ntic\ns\n\nIm\nmu\n\nno\nlog\n\ny a\nnd\n\n m\nicr\n\nob\niol\n\nog\ny\n\nNu\nrsi\n\nng\n\nVe\nte\n\nrin\nar\n\ny\n\nDe\nnt\n\nist\nry\n\n0.5 \n\n0\n\n1 \n\n1.5 \n\n2 \n\n%\n \n\n\n\n465\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\nFigure 7-9 Patent families for top selected AI application patent field categories, \nby earliest priority year, 2000-2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: WIPO Technology Trends 2019: Artificial Intelligence, based on Questel Orbit Intelligence, Fampat Database, March 2018\nNote: A patent may refer to more than one category.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-9.xlsx\n\nPa\nte\n\nnt\n f\n\nam\nili\n\nes\n\n0 \n\n3 000 \n\n6 000 \n\n9 000 \n\n12 000 \n\n15 000 \n\n18 000 \n\n21 000 \n\n24 000 \n\n27 000 \n\n30 000 \n\n20\n00\n\n \n\n20\n01\n\n \n\n20\n02\n\n \n\n20\n03\n\n \n\n20\n04\n\n \n\n20\n05\n\n \n\n20\n06\n\n \n\n20\n07\n\n \n\n20\n08\n\n \n\n20\n09\n\n \n\n20\n10\n\n \n\n20\n11\n\n \n\n20\n12\n\n \n\n20\n13\n\n \n\n20\n14\n\n \n\n20\n15\n\n \n\n20\n16\n\n \n\nTransportation \n\nTelecommunication \n\nSecurity \n\nLife and \nmedical sciences \nIndustry \nand manufacturing \nEnergy \nmanagement \n\nEducation \n\nAgriculture \n\nSince 2009, there has been a boom in AI \npatenting, notably in the fields of trans-\nportation, telecommunications, security, \nand life and medical sciences. Figure 7-9 \ndepicts the evolution of patent families for the \ntop selected AI application categories between \n2000 and 2016. It can be seen that, since 2009, \npatenting activity has grown across all sectors \nidentified in the graph, with the most pronounced \nincreases in transportation, telecommunications, \nsecurity, and life and medical sciences.\n\nAcquisition of AI startups is increasingly \nregarded as a strategic move by acquirer \ncompanies to acquire data and absorb new \nAI knowledge and capacities. Cumulatively, \nCBInsights reports that between 2010 and \n2019 (August) there were 635 acquisitions \nof AI companies. According to the WIPO \n(2019), most of the companies acquired are \nyoung startups with a median age of three \n\nyears old. Accordingly, these companies tend \nto specialise in virtual assistants, big data \nanalytics for recommendation systems, and \nimage recognition, using machine learning \nas the main technology. From Figure 7-10 \nit is possible to conclude that acquisitions \nhave become more common in recent years \n\u2013 in particular, around two thirds of all AI \nacquisitions occurred between 2017 and 2019. \nThis is also in line with the general trend in the \ngrowing number of acquisitions worldwide, as \ndescribed in Chapter 8 - Framework conditions. \nMoreover, the WIPO (2019) highlights that \nacquisitions in the AI sector can complement \nIP and development efforts since they may \nreduce the need for the acquirer to patent. \nThe authors illustrate this argument with \nthe example of Alphabet which has acquired \na substantial number of AI companies \u2018while at \nthe same time reducing its patent filing activity \nover the last several years\u2019.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-9.xlsx\n\n\n466\n\nFigure 7-10 Number of AI acquisitions by acquisition year, 2010-2019(1)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: CBInsights (2019), 'The Race For AI: Here Are The Tech Giants Rushing To Snap Up Artificial Intelligence Startups'\nNote: (1)Data as of 31/08/2019 hence not covering the whole year.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-10.xlsx\n\n9 10 \n\n25 \n35 39 \n\n78 \n\n120 \n\n166 \n\n145 \n\n0 \n\n20 \n\n40 \n\n60 \n\n80 \n\n100 \n\n120 \n\n140 \n\n160 \n\n180 \n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr \n\n8\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\n3. EU ranks among global leaders in AI science\n\nAlthough the EU ranks among global leaders \nin AI scientific production and excellence,  \nits position has been deteriorating over \ntime, while China has risen quickly. Globally, \nthe weight of EU publications in AI has been \non the decline since 2003, although it still \nranks among the global leaders in AI scientific \nproduction (Figure 7-11). Indeed, between \n2014 and 2018, the EU accounted for 22 % \nof world publications in AI, down from 27 % \nfrom 1999-2003. This compares with 26 % \nin China (up from only 11 %), and 18 % in the \nUnited States (down from 25 %). Thus, China \nhas been emerging quickly as the global leader \nin scientific production in the AI domain. Other \nplayers, such as India (with a 10 % share) and \nthe United Kingdom (with a 4 % share) have \nalso been quite active in AI publishing.\n\nWithin the EU, Germany, France and Spain \nare the top producers of AI publications \n\nthough the highest shares relative to \nnational publications are in Luxembourg, \nGreece, and Cyprus. In the EU, Germany, \nFrance, Spain and Italy are the top producers \nof publications in AI (Figure 7-12). The United \nKingdom also stands out as a major AI publishing \nnation in Europe. However, the size of these \ncountries (e.g. GDP, population) is potentially \ncorrelated with the number of publications. For \nthis reason, we have looked into the share of AI \npublications in relation to national publications. \nHaving taken the size of the country into account, \nLuxembourg, Greece and Malta emerge as the \nEU Member States with the highest shares of \nAI scientific publications, corresponding to 3.7 %, \n3.3 %, and 3.3 %, respectively, of all publications. \nThe average citation impact is highest in the \nNetherlands, Austria, Belgium and Denmark. \nSwitzerland\u2019s AI publications have the largest \ncitation impact of the group of Associated \nCountries in the graph.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-10.xlsx\n\n\n467\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\nFigure 7-11 Share of world publications in artificial intelligence in selected regions (%), \n1999-2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Elsevier (2018)\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-11.xlsx\n\n11% \n\n27% \n25% \n\n7% \n\n30% \n\n22% \n24% \n\n19% \n\n5% \n\n29% \n27% \n\n24% \n\n15% \n\n4% \n\n30% \n\n26% \n\n22% \n\n18% \n\n4% \n\n31% \n\n10 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n6 \n\nChina EU United States United\nKingdom \n\nRest of the world \n\n1999-2003 2004-2008 2009-2013 2014-2018 \n\nIndia \n\nJapan \n\nCanada \n\nIran \n\nAustralia \n\nSouth Korea \n\nOther \n\nFigure 7-12 Number and share of publications in AI by country, and related field-\nweighted citation impact (FWCI) by country, 2015-2018\n\n88 \n838 \n\n1 074 \n2 743 \n\n14 253 \n\n87 \n169 \n180 \n242 \n273 \n299 \n387 \n465 \n511 \n557 \n649 \n\n1 051 \n1 209 \n\n1 539 \n1 701 \n1 706 \n1 767 \n1 788 \n1 808 \n\n2 238 \n2 455 \n\n3 185 \n3 818 \n\n7 730 \n7 790 \n\n8 191 \n10 597 \n\nIceland \nSerbia \n\nNorway \nSwitzerland \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nMalta \nLatvia \n\nEstonia \nLithuania \n\nLuxembourg \nCyprus \n\nBulgaria \nCroatia \n\nSlovakia \nSlovenia \nHungary \nDenmark \n\nIreland \nFinland \nAustria \n\nRomania \nBelgium \nSweden \nCzechia \nGreece \n\nPortugal \nNetherlands \n\nPoland \nItaly \n\nSpain \nFrance \n\nGermany \n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n A\n\nI p\nub\n\nlic\nat\n\nio\nns\n\n \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-11.xlsx\n\n\n468\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit based on Elsevier (2018)\nNote: Both the AI publications and the total publications used to compile the ratio of AI publications in all publications reflect only \npublication types, articles, reviews, and conference proceedings to ensure they are comparable.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-12.xlsx\n\n1.5 \n2.9 \n\n1.3 \n1.6 \n\n2.1 \n\n3.2 \n2.0 \n\n1.5 \n1.7 \n\n3.7 \n3.3 \n\n2.2 \n1.8 \n\n1.6 \n2.4 \n\n1.6 \n1.0 \n\n2.4 \n2.0 \n\n1.8 \n2.9 \n\n1.4 \n1.2\n\n1.9 \n3.3 \n\n2.7 \n1.5 \n\n2.2 \n1.9 \n\n2.3 \n1.9 \n\n1.7 \n\nSh\nar\n\ne \nof\n\n A\nI p\n\nub\nlic\n\nat\nio\n\nns\n in\n\n n\nat\n\nio\nna\n\nl p\nub\n\nlic\nat\n\nio\nns\n\n (%\n) \n\n2.2 \n1.3 \n\n2.0 \n2.9 \n\n2.2 \n\n1.3 \n0.8 \n\n1.7 \n1.1 \n\n2.0 \n1.3 \n\n0.9 \n1.1 \n\n0.9 \n1.5 \n\n1.4 \n2.1 \n\n1.6 \n2.0 \n2.1 \n\n1.1 \n2.1 \n\n1.9 \n1.2 \n\n1.5 \n1.4 \n\n2.4 \n1.4 \n\n1.8 \n1.5 \n\n1.7 \n1.9 \n\nAv\ner\n\nag\ne \n\nfie\nld\n\n-w\nei\n\ngh\nte\n\nd \nci\n\nta\nti\n\non\n im\n\npa\nct\n\n (F\nW\n\nCI\n) \n\nIceland \nSerbia \n\nNorway \nSwitzerland \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nMalta \nLatvia \n\nEstonia \nLithuania \n\nLuxembourg \nCyprus \n\nBulgaria \nCroatia \n\nSlovakia \nSlovenia \nHungary \nDenmark \n\nIreland \nFinland \nAustria \n\nRomania \nBelgium \nSweden \nCzechia \nGreece \n\nPortugal \nNetherlands \n\nPoland \nItaly \n\nSpain \nFrance \n\nGermany \n\nIceland \nSerbia \n\nNorway \nSwitzerland \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nMalta \nLatvia \n\nEstonia \nLithuania \n\nLuxembourg \nCyprus \n\nBulgaria \nCroatia \n\nSlovakia \nSlovenia \nHungary \nDenmark \n\nIreland \nFinland \nAustria \n\nRomania \nBelgium \nSweden \nCzechia \nGreece \n\nPortugal \nNetherlands \n\nPoland \nItaly \n\nSpain \nFrance \n\nGermany \n\nThe lack of gender diversity in AI research \npersists, although there has been progress \nover time, notably in European countries. \nAs reported by NESTA (2019), a gender diversity \ngap in AI research (using the arXiv repository) \ncontinues to be prominent (Figure 7-13). \nWithin the EU, in 2018, the share of papers \nwith at least one female author was highest \nin the Netherlands (42 %), Denmark (39 %) \nand Portugal (35 %).

Building \non the group\u2019s ethical recommendations, the \nCommission issued a Communication on \n\u2018Building Trust in Human-Centric Artificial \nIntelligence\u2019 (April 2019) which confirms the \nEuropean ambition to create trustworthy AI \n(Box 7-4). The Commission would like to bring \nthis European approach to the global stage by \nopening up cooperation to all non-EU countries \nthat share the same values.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-18.xlsx\n\n\n475\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\nBOX 7-4 Towards trustworthy, ethical and innovative \nAI in the EU\nIn itself, AI is neither good nor bad; nor is \nit neutral (Kranzberg, 1986). As with any \nimpactful new technology, the way in which it \nis further developed and applied will determine \neither a positive or negative outcome. AI-\npowered cameras with facial recognition \ncapabilities can make your neighbourhood \nsafer but may also help oppressive regimes \nto identify and silence dissidents. Receiving \ntargeted advertising based on the contents \nof your e-mails may be acceptable but \nhaving similar AI systems use your data for \nmanipulating your voting behaviour is not.\n\nFor AI to have the positive impact we want, we \nshould carefully reflect on the choices we make \nwhile developing and applying it. \u2018AI ethics\u2019 is \nabout identifying the core principles to guide \nus in our quest to maximise the technology\u2019s \nbenefits while minimising its risks. Companies \nworking with AI could use such principles to \nself-regulate their developments; governments \ncould go a step further and enforce compliance \nthrough regulation.\n\nFor the Commission, seven key requirements \ndefine trustworthy AI:\n\n1. Human agency and oversight\n\n2. Technical robustness and safety\n\n3. Privacy and data governance\n\n4. Transparency\n\n5. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness\n\n6. Societal and environmental well-being\n\n7. Accountability\n\nIn order to operationalise these principles, the \nhigh-level expert group\u2019s ethical guidelines \npresent an assessment list to check compliance \nwith each of these requirements. During \na piloting phase, stakeholders from a large \nrange of sectors and types of organisations \nare currently testing and working with this \nassessment list. Their feedback will be used \nto optimise the list and turn it into a reliable \nand operational guide for the development of \ntrustworthy AI in Europe.\n\nThe \u2018ethics-by-design\u2019 approach will play a key \nrole in ensuring that ethical and legal principles \nare embedded at the very outset of system \ndevelopment. The European Commission has \nthus committed to exploring the opportunities \nfor introducing the ethics-by-design principle \nin relevant calls for proposals under the EU-\nfunded research programme.\n\nThe ethical principles for ethical, trustworthy \nAI may very well become the foundations on \nwhich a general European regulation for AI is \nbuilt.\n\nFor AI \u2018made in Europe\u2019, the ethics-by-\ndesign approach will play a key role in \nensuring that ethical and legal principles \nare embedded at the very outset of \nsystem development. Thus, the European \n\n15 https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/publication/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-com2018-795-final_en\n\nCommission has committed to exploring the \nopportunities for introducing the ethics-by-\ndesign principle in relevant calls for proposals \nunder the EU funded research programme15. \n\n\n\n476\n\nFollowing these important initiatives, in \nMay 2019, 42 OECD member countries \nadopted a set of AI principles that ensure \nthat AI fosters innovation while respecting \n\nhuman rights and democratic values (May \n2019). As established in OECD (2019b), the \nguidelines are developed around five main \nprinciples, quoting:\n\nThere are important privacy and ethical \nissues linked to AI. The EU is committed \nto building an AI ecosystem that spurs \n\ninnovation within a clear and adequate \nlegal and ethical framework.\n\n5. EU trails in AI innovation\n\nDespite ranking among global leaders on AI \nscientific excellence, the EU trails when it \ncomes to AI innovation performance, both \nin the number of companies and patenting. \nHowever, the EU\u2019s performance is in line \nwith its share in global R&D investments. \nNearly one third of the world\u2019s AI firms can be \nfound in the United States. China ranks second, \nwith close to one quarter of AI companies. Hence, \nthe two countries together account for slightly \nmore than half of all AI startups.

Although the EU has also made \nsome progress in recent years to attract \nprivate capital, investments remain well \nbelow that of its main global competitors. \nSince 2016, private investments in AI startups \nhave registered a significant boost worldwide, \nhaving doubled between 2016 and 2017 alone. \nDevelopments and breakthroughs in the AI field \n\nhave attracted growing interest from private \ninvestors who are aware of the high potential \nof AI applications to disrupt several sectors. \nIndeed, OECD (2018) found that in the first half \nof 2018, \u2018AI startups attracted around 12 % \nof all worldwide private equity investments, \na steep increase from just 3 % in 2011\u2019.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-22.xlsx\n\n\n480\n\nFigure 7-23 provides evidence of the \nUnited States\u2019 global leadership in terms \nof equity investments in AI startups. \nAccording to the OECD (2018), US startups \nhave attracted around two thirds of total \nprivate investments since 2011. However, \nmore recently, China has rapidly increased its \nrate of private investments in AI companies, \n\nclimbing from just 3 % in 2015 to 36 % of all AI \nprivate-equity investments worldwide in 2017. \nEU28 startups seem to be less attractive to \nprivate investors compared to US and Chinese \nAI startups, although it is important to note \nthe substantial progress made in recent years \n\u2013 from only 1 % in 2013 to 8 % of global AI \nprivate investments in 2017.\n\nFigure 7-23 Total estimated equity investments in AI startups(1) (USD bn)  \nby startup location, 2011-2017 and first half of 2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: OECD estimates based on Crunchbase (July 2018)\nNotes: (1)AI startups are companies founded after the year 2000 and categorised in the 'artificial intelligence' technological area of \nCrunchbase, as well as companies that use AI keywords in the description of their activity.

This \nis particularly the case in the United \nStates and China. Figure 7-26 shows that the \nnumber of new AI startups becoming the next \nunicorns has increased remarkably especially \nsince 2017, having more than doubled \nbetween 2017 and 2018 alone (see Chapter \n3.3 - Business dynamics and its contribution \nto structural change and productivity growth \nfor more on unicorn companies). Between \n2015 and 2019, 46 new AI-related unicorns \ncame into the picture (11 % of the current \ntotal number of private unicorns), with half \n(or 23) being US-based. China accounts for \n\nslightly more than a quarter of all AI unicorns, \nfollowed by the United Kingdom with four, \nIsrael with two, and France, Japan, Canada \nand Singapore with one each. Hence, only one \nunicorn in the AI field was found in the EU over \nthe period 2015-2019 (Figure 7-27). However, \nUiPath, an \u2018AI unicorn\u2019 with headquarters in the \nUnited States, has \u2018EU DNA\u2019 as the company\u2019s \nfounders are Romanian and the headquarters \nwere initially based in Bucharest. Considering \nthat the amount of funding received is \na key component of private valuations, this \nincrease could be partly explained by greater \ninterest on the part of private investors in AI \ntechnologies due to their potential to boost \ninnovation and productivity. \n\nFigure 7-26 Number of new private \nunicorns in AI, 2015-2019\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: CBInsights Unicorn Tracker, accessed on 11/12/2019\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-26.xlsx\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-27.xlsx\n\nFigure 7-27 Number of AI unicorns \nby country, 2015-2019\n\n4 \n\n2 \n\n7 \n\n17 \n16 \n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 \n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr \n\n23\n\n12\n\n4\n\n3\n\n1 \n\n2015-2019 \n\nJapan \n\nCanada \n\nSingapore \n\nFrance \n\nIsrael \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nChina \n\nUnited States \n\nTotal: 46 \n\nJapanEU\nChina\n\nRest of the World\n\nUnited States\n\nSouth Korea\nUK\n\nIndiaCanada GermanyFrance\nItaly\n\nBRIS\nDeveloped\nAsian\nEconomies\n\nIsrael\n\nSpain \nIreland \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-26.xlsx\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-27.xlsx\n\n\n484\n\nFigure 7-28 Acquisitions in the AI sector by country of acquired company, 1998-2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: WIPO 2019 report, based on CrunchBase database, May 2018\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-28.xlsx\n\nNumber of acquisitions\n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n8 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n17 \n\n25 \n\n283 \n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\nBelgium \n\nBrazil \n\nChina \n\nNetherlands \n\nSwitzerland \n\nSpain \n\nSweden \n\nIndia \n\nFrance \n\nGermany \n\nIsrael \n\nCanada \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nUnited States \n\nAcquisitions are on the rise.

Currently, AI \ntalent is relatively scarce worldwide but \nappears more predominant in the United \nStates. The EU faces a shortage in AI \nprofessionals which could undermine its \nambition to galvanise its AI innovation \nlandscape.  AI-related jobs seem harder to fill \ncompared to the \u2018average job\u2019 (Figure 7-31) \n\nwhich hints at a limited pool of AI talent \nworldwide. In particular, the profiles of computer \nscientists, algorithmic engineers and principal \nscientists are proving to be the hardest AI-\nrelated vacancies to be filled. For example, in \nthe Indeed portal \u2013 a job-search portal \u2013 64 % of \nthe computer scientist vacancies were still open \nafter 60 days of being published on the portal.\n\nFigure 7-31 Percentage of AI-related jobs on Indeed open after 60 days, and \ncomparison with average job\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Priceoconomics data studio \u2013 Which Industries are investing in Artificial inteligence (18 November 2018) based on Indeed data\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-31.xlsx\n\n25% \n\n33% \n\n41% \n\n45% \n\n46% \n\n49% \n\n64% \n\nAverage job \n\nData scientist \n\nMachine learning engineer \n\nComputer vision engineer \n\nPrincipal scientist \n\nAlgorithmic engineer \n\nComputer scientist \n\nOfficial statistics on the existence and \nproduction of AI talent are still lacking. \nHowever, certain external efforts have \nprovided some indication of the \ngeographical distribution of AI specialists \nworldwide. J.F. Gagn\u00e9 (2018) used the \nLinkedIn job platform to identify AI specialists \nall over the world (Figure 7-32). One caveat of \nthe analysis is that the use of LinkedIn is more \ncommon in the West, so there may be a bias \nin the data collected which may underestimate \nthe presence of AI specialists, for example, in \n\nChina. The United States appears to have more \nAI talent available than, for example, the EU or \nChina. In addition, most tech giants are based \nin the United States. In light of the scarcity \nof AI talent, these multinationals offer highly \ncompetitive salaries and alluring benefits to \nattract and retain top talent.\n\nFor the EU, this means that, on the one \nhand, it is important to increase the \nnumber of students and professionals \nwith an AI-related academic background \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-31.xlsx\n\n\n488\n\nand/or AI technical competences and \nskills acquired, for instance, in trainings \nthat also reflect the potential risks of AI \ntechnologies. On the other hand, the EU should \nenable the right environment for them to work \n\nin the EU (i.e. to retain AI talent) and attract \nmore talent from abroad, as highlighted in the \n2018 European Commission Communication on \n\u2018Artificial Intelligence for Europe\u2019, for example \nthrough the \u2018Blue Card scheme\u2019. \n\nFigure 7-32 Global AI talent pool based on AI Specialist LinkedIn profiles, 2018)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: J.F.

AI can lead to public-sector innovation but not \nall EU Member States are embracing it\n\nIt is time for the public sector to \nembrace the opportunities created by \nAI. While some EU Member States rank \nhigh internationally in \u2018government AI \nreadiness\u2019, in others a greater effort is \nneeded to roll-out AI capabilities. AI-related \ntechnologies can also lead to greater efficiency \nin the public sector, enhancing the quality of \npublic services and enabling better techniques \nto process and analyse data, as well as acting \n\nas a support tool for policy evaluation. In the \nEU, the public sector is one of the most data-\nintensive sectors. Clearly, the reuse of open \ndata can contribute to the development of AI. \nFor this reason, many countries worldwide, \nincluding EU Member States, are embedding \npublic sector AI innovation into their national AI \nstrategies. The OECD (2019c) describes some \nof the main elements of public sector-focused \nAI strategies, including, for example:\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-33.xlsx\n\n\n490\n\n\u00dd\u00dd \u2018Experimentation with AI in government \nand the identification of specific AI \nprojects currently under way or that \nwill be developed in the near future;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Collaboration across sectors, such as \nthrough public-private partnerships;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Fostering of cross-government councils, \nnetworks and communities to promote \nsystems approaches;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Automation of routine government \nprocesses to enhance efficiency.\n\nDespite these benefits, there are also \nconcerns about bias, privacy, transparency \nand the overall complexity of data \naccessibility and usability. The \u2018Open Data \n\n16 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&uri=CELEX:32019L1024\n\nDirective\u2019 (Directive (EU) 2019/1024)16, which \nentered into force on 16 July 2019, provides \nmore guidance and clarity on the use of open \ndata in the public sector. Under the new rules:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd All public sector content that can be \naccessed under national access to \ndocuments rules is in principle freely \navailable for reuse. This could allow \nmore SMEs and startups to enter \nnew markets in providing data-based \nproducts and services.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd A particular focus is placed on high-\nvalue datasets such as statistics or \ngeospatial data.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Public undertakings in the transport \nand utilities sector generating valuable \ndata when providing services in the \ngeneral interest will have to comply \nwith the principles of transparency, \n\nnon-discrimination and non-exclusivity \nset out in the Directive, and ensure the \nuse of appropriate data formats and \ndissemination methods. They will still \nbe able to set reasonable charges to \nrecover the costs of producing the data \nand of making it available for reuse. \n\n\u00dd\u00dd Publicly-funded research data enters \ninto the scope of the Directive: Member \nStates are required to develop policies \nfor open access to publicly funded \nresearch data while harmonised rules \non reuse will be applied to all publicly \nfunded research data which is made \naccessible via repositories. \n\nBuilding trust and broad social acceptance \naround AI is key for its success. Most \nEuropeans agree that robots and AI require \ncareful management (Figure 7-34), while the \n\nsame applies to the United States. As a result, \npolicies to foster AI should follow a human-\ncentric, transparent and trustworthy approach \nin order to promote public trust in this field. \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&uri=CELEX:32019L1024\n\n\n491\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\nFigure 7-34 Agreement with statement that robots and AI require careful \nmanagement(1), in the EU28 and the United States\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Centre for the Governance of AI and Eurobarometer\nNote: (1)EU28 data from 2017 Special Eurobarometer #460.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-34.xlsx\n\nNetherlands\n\nGreece\n\nSweden\n\nFrance\n\nCyprus\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nFinland\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nLuxembourg\n\nIreland\n\nDenmark\n\nGermany\n\nSlovakia\n\nEstonia\n\nSlovenia\n\nBulgaria\n\nEU28\n\nBelgium\n\nSpain\n\nCzechia\n\nPoland\n\nAustria\n\nPortugal\n\nMalta\n\nCroatia\n\nItaly\n\nUnited States\n\nHungary\n\nRomania\n\n0 % 50 %25 % 75 % 100 %\n\nPercentage of respondents\n\n2.

The strategy includes setting up a \ngovernance framework (including regulatory \naction), increasing investment, and creating \nsector-specific common European data spaces. \nData spaces for industry (manufacturing), the \nGreen Deal and health data, are among those \nbeing proposed, as well as the European Open \nScience Cloud.\n\nThe \u2018White Paper on Artificial Intelligence \n\u2013 A European approach to excellence and \ntrust\u201919 outlines the Commission\u2019s vision for a \nEuropean approach to AI, building on its existing \nstrengths (research, robotics, manufacturing, \nEU research funding, coordinated plan with the \nMS), respecting European values (ethics, privacy \nprotection) and presenting the main challenges. \nIn order to overcome these challenges, the White \nPaper describes actions to build an \u2018ecosystem \nof excellence\u2019 to encourage investment, on the \none hand, and an \u2018ecosystem of trust\u2019 through a \nregulatory framework, on the other.\n\nAn ecosystem of excellence is required to \nsupport the development and uptake of AI across \nthe EU economy and public administration. The \nproposed actions are focused on:\n\n1. revising the existing coordinated plan \nbetween the Member States; \n\n2. extending and creating new excellence and \ntesting centres; \n\n3. investing in advanced skills and higher \neducation; \n\n4. expanding Digital Innovation Hubs with a \nfocus on AI, and providing equity financing \n(a pilot in 2020 which can be scaled up in \n2021); \n\n5. creating public-private partnerships under the \nnew Horizon Europe framework programme, \nincluding one on \u2018AI, data and robotics\u2019; and\n\n6. facilitating public procurement.\n\nThe ecosystem of trust would consist of an \nappropriate regulatory framework providing \nlegal certainty and trust in AI and addressing \nits significant risks.

Blockchain is a technology \nthat allows for sharing and exchanging data in \na peer-to-peer way, i.e. without the need for an \nintermediary. Data in the blockchain are stored \nin blocks that are linked with each other using \ncryptographic methods. Multiple copies of the \nblockchain will then circulate in a blockchain \nnetwork, making it difficult to alter the data \nbecause if someone wanted to alter an entry \nshe/he would need to alter the entire blockchain \nand then get consensus in the network that his/\nher version of the blockchain was the correct \none rather than those held by the others. \n\nThe interest around AI is particularly true \nin the financial sector, but increasingly so \nin other sectors of the economy. Indeed, \ndata is increasingly becoming a key element \nacross many sectors of the economy. With the \nintroduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in \nareas like manufacturing, mobility, health, \nlogistics, etc., managing the amount of data \nproduced in a secure way will require new \ninnovative technologies like blockchain. The \ninterest around blockchain is reflected in Figure \n7-36 which shows the exponential increase \nin venture capital investment in blockchain \ntechnologies between 2017 and 2018.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-36.xlsx\n\n\n495\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\nThis interest is also reflected in the job \nmarket. Figure 7-37 gives an indication \nof this in the US market. In particular, it is \npossible to see that blockchain developer was \n\nthe top \u2018emerging job\u2019 on LinkedIn between \n2014 and 2018, with job postings growing \n33 times over that period.\n\nFigure 7-37 Emerging jobs on LinkedIn by growth over 2014-2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: LinkedIn 2018 Emerging Jobs in the US Report\nNote: Analysis of LinkedIn Economic Graph data between 2014-2018.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-37.xlsx\n\n2018 Top 5 emerging jobs Growth (2014-2018)\n\n1 Blockchain Developer 33x\n\n2 Machine Learning Engineer 12x\n\n3 Application Sales Executive 8x\n\n4 Machine Learning Specialist 6x\n\n5 Professional Medical Representative 6x\n\nBlockchain and other distributed data \ntechnologies could provide technical \nsolutions that guarantee the authenticity \nof the data to be used in machine-learning \nalgorithms. The success of machine learning \nis based on the availability of data \u2013 not just \nany data but data that can be trusted. In this \nrespect, verifiable provenance of data used \nin ML algorithms is essential. Data protection \nof private data requires the consent of data \nsubjects for its use. In that sense, blockchain \ncould provide technical solutions that give \ncontrol of the data to those to whom the data \nbelong. For example, the research project \nDECODE20 funded by Horizon 2020 is using \nblockchain to offer tools that give individuals \ncontrol over their personal data.\n\nThe United States and China lead in terms \nof blockchain startups, while the EU28 \n\n20 https://decodeproject.eu/\n\nonly account for 15 % of all blockchain \nstartups. Funding for blockchain startups \nalso appears more readily available in \nthe United States than in the EU. Figure \n7-38 shows the geographical distribution of \nboth blockchain startups (left-hand chart) and \nthe funding received by these startups (right-\nhand chart).

The food sector has registered a 32 % \nincrease in robot deployment (Figure 7-40).  \n\nThere are a number of examples of AI \nin current and potential application \nareas in manufacturing, such as cognitive \nautomation, learning machines and robotics, \nintelligence monitoring (for anomaly detection \nand inspection) and predictive maintenance, \nprocess optimisation, sensors development, \nproduction ramp-up commissioning, task \nplanning and scheduling, energy management, \nand logistics and value chains. Overall, AI will \nhave a major impact on how a factory will \nbe run and which tasks workers will have \nto carry out25. \n\n25 See JRC, The changing nature of work and skills in the digital age, September 2019.\n\nAnother example where AI is expected \nto make a significant impact concerns \nthe capabilities of industrial robots, \nmaking them smarter and enabling their \ndeployment in tough and unstructured \nenvironments. Eurofound (2019) identifies \nadvanced industrial robotics as one of the five \ngame-changing technologies in manufacturing.\n\nFactories of the future will feature \nadvanced robots that will be able to \nroam around a site autonomously, \nrecognise objects and humans, predict \ntheir movements and intentions, inspect \nproducts and assess quality.

They \nidentified the need for further research on \nnew materials and fabrication schemes, \nnew batteries and power sources for \nmobile robots, robot swarms, new \nnavigation systems, AI technologies, social \ninteraction and security. For example, further \nresearch is needed to overcome the limitations \nof techniques such as SLAM (Simultaneous \nlocalisation and mapping) to allow for the \nnavigation and exploration of unmapped, time-\nvarying and dynamic environments. This would \nenable an effective deployment in unstructured \nenvironments, such as construction sites. AI is \nstill far from giving robots the capability to learn \non-the-fly, adapt to dynamic settings or recover \nfrom failure. Despite great advances in sensing \ntechnologies, robots have underdeveloped \nsocial abilities. Today, robots are not able to \ninterpret social clues such as gaze direction, \nfacial expression or vocal intonations, which are \n\n26 Yang et al., Science Robotics 3, eaar7965 (2018).\n\nkey to unlocking the full potential of human-\nrobot collaboration.\n\nEurope is leading the way in collaborative \nrobots. According to the International Data \nCorporation (IDC), discrete manufacturing and \nprocess manufacturing are expected to attract \n30 % and 13 %, respectively, of global investment \nin AI estimated at EUR 32.7 billion in the world \nand EUR 4.6 billion in Europe (Figure 7-41).\n\nAI in manufacturing, which relies mainly \non a B2B business model, is fundamentally \ndifferent from AI in the B2C world as it \nutilises less, but very heterogeneous, \ndata from a variety of sources often \nimplemented on edge devices rather than \nin the cloud. Manufacturing also has higher \nrequirements regarding reliability, while the \nadoption of autonomy comes with safety, \nsecurity and ethical issues. For business-to-\nbusiness applications, Europe is still a champion. \n\nFigure 7-41 Expected distribution of financial investments in AI systems,  \nrobotics and drones in Western Europe, 2019\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: https://www.eu-robotics.net/cms/upload/downloads/ppp-documents/AI_PPP_SRIDA-Consultation_Version-June_2019_-_\nOnline_version.pdf\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-41.xlsx\n\nDiscrete \nmanufacturing \n\n30% \n\nProcess \nmanufacturing \n\n13% \n\nConsumer \n7% \n\nRetail \n7% \n\nResource industries \n7% \n\nHealthcare \n6% \n\nBanking \n4% \n\nUtilities \n4% \n\nTransportation \n4% \n\nConstruction \n3% \n\nFederal provider \n3% \n\nWholesale \n2% \n\nTelecom \n2% \n\nState/Local government  \n2% \n\nInsurance \n2% \n\nOther \n4% \n\nhttps://www.eu-robotics.net/cms/upload/downloads/ppp-documents/AI_PPP_SRIDA-Consultation_Version-June_2019_-_Online_version.pdf\nhttps://www.eu-robotics.net/cms/upload/downloads/ppp-documents/AI_PPP_SRIDA-Consultation_Version-June_2019_-_Online_version.pdf\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter7/figure-7-41.xlsx\n\n\n500\n\nThree of the world's largest producers of \nindustrial robots are European and 20 % of \nindustrial robots are produced in Europe.\n\nIndustrial robots were introduced decades \nago to carry out repetitive, dull and tedious \ntasks better and faster than humans. \nNormally, such robots are caged behind fences \nfor safety reasons and need to be carefully pre-\nprogrammed to do a specific task. Reconfiguration \nand flexibility are minimal. Factories of the \nfuture will feature advanced robots that will \nbe able to roam around the site autonomously, \nrecognise objects and humans, predict their \nmovements and intentions, inspect products and \nassess quality. Robots will be able to learn from \ngestures and voice commands. All these features \nwill enable a true human-robot collaboration. \nNevertheless, although several advances have \nbeen achieved on smart grippers, connectivity \nand programming, in order to make advanced \nindustrial robotics a reality on the shop floor \n\nthe further development and integration of AI \ntechnologies, such as machine learning, computer \nvision, connected automatic vehicles, speech \nrecognition and neural networks is required. \n\nCurrently, Europe as a whole is the \nkey market for collaborative robotics, \naccounting for a significant share of \naround 37 % in 2018 (Grand View Research, \n2019). The material handling and assembly \napplication segments are currently the \nstrongest in the collaborative robot market \nwith end use in the automotive, plastic and \npolymers, metal and machine, electronics, \npharma food beverage and furniture and \nequipment industries. As illustrated in the \nfigure below, assembly application is expected \nto undergo steady growth over the forecast \nperiod thanks to the ability of combining both \nrepetitive and easy work along with more \ncomplex assembly processes in industries such \nas inspection, logistics and electronics.\n\nFigure 7-42 Collaborative robots: market size and growth prospects\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Grand View Research (2019) based on RIA, IFR, Factor-tech and Discover Magazine.

In 2018, 5 new \ncollaborative projects on human-robot \ncollaboration were funded, for around EUR \n37 million, under the contractual public \nand private partnership Factories-of-the-\nFuture. a large number of sectors are \nbeing targeted, from aeronautics to white \ngoods production, and from electronic-\nwaste recycling to food packaging.\n\nThe EU-funded THOMAS project is \ndeveloping a new reconfigurable indus-\ntrial shop floor where AI provides \nmobile robots with cognitive abilities \nthat enable them to detect other robots \nand thereby to calculate collision-free \ntrajectories, share and reallocate work \nin case of unexpected events, whilst also \ndetecting people in the work space and \nunderstanding their intentions. THOMAS \nis validating its new concept with end-\nusers in the automotive and aeronautics \nsectors, estimating a market potential of \nat least 300 factories in Europe.\n\nAI and material discoveries\n\nAI is providing ways to speed up discoveries \nin materials science. \u2018From the Stone Age \nthrough the Bronze and Iron Ages to today\u2019s \nSilicon Age, every major advance in human \ncivilisation has been driven by a fundamental \ndevelopment in materials science.\u2019 Professor \nSpaldin from ETH Z\u00fcrich quotes and argues \nthat without new materials we are stuck \nwith our existing concepts for information \ntechnology and have an energy bottleneck in \nhuman progress.\n\nThe traditional pipeline through which \nnew materials are discovered, designed, \ndeveloped, manufactured, and deployed \nremains slow, costly, and highly inefficient \n(Himanen et al., 2019). AI applications \n(computational data science and machine \nlearning) are significantly speeding up both \nfundamental and applied materials research \n(Schmidt et al., 2019). Current machine \nlearning applications in materials science are \nrich and diverse, ranging from catalyst design, \n\nexploring the mechanisms of high-temperature \nsuperconductivity to predicting excitation \nspectra. Researchers are using computer \nmodelling and machine-learning techniques \nto generate libraries of candidate materials by \nthe tens of thousands to shortlist, for example, \nhow well they will work as a conductor or an \ninsulator, whether they will act as a magnet, \nand how much heat and pressure they can \nwithstand (Nosengo, 2016). \n\nIt takes a lot of trial and error as well \nas lab experimentation to identify new \nmaterials, particularly high-performance \nmaterials for next-generation applica-\ntions. Researchers are combining AI and \nmachine learning models to find the opti-\nmal material to fit any given criteria in \norder to reduce the time and cost spent \nmoving from lab to market. The use of ma-\nchine learning and ab initio calculations are \npresented to guide strain engineering whereby \nmaterial properties and performance could be \ndesigned (Shi et al., 2019). \n\n\n\n503\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\nNanomedicine design also benefits from \nthe application of AI by optimising material \nproperties according to predicted interactions \nwith the target drug, biological fluids, immune \nsystem, vasculature, and cell membranes, all \n\naffecting therapeutic efficacy (Adir et al., 2019). \nSuch machine learning tools are increasingly \nbeing incorporated directly into material data \ninfrastructures (Himanen et al., 2019).\n\nBox 7-7 Snapshot of EU-funded projects using AI to \naccelerate material discoveries for green solutions\n\nThe large-scale Battery 2030 project, \nwith 17 partners from academia and \nindustry, wants to design batteries of the \nfuture by using ultra-high-performance \nmaterials and structures from the atomic \nlevel up, using advanced approaches like \ndensity functional theory calculations in \ncombination with AI.\n\nThe Moldesign project uses computa-\ntional material design by combining \nmaterial simulation methods with AI to \nenable large-scale material screening for \nthe next generation of organic solar cells.\n\nThe CoMManD project is developing \na computational approach using AI to \naccelerate the discovery of molecular \nmaterials targeting applications in \nmolecular separations, sensing, (photo)\ncatalysis and photovoltaics. \n\nThe DYNAPOL project is studying bio-\ninspired properties such as the ability of \nvarious supramolecular materials to self-\nheal, adapt or reconfigure dynamically \nby using AI and massive multi-scale \nmodelling.\n\nAccelerating the discovery of new \nmaterials, and the associated research \nrequired for real deployment, will require \na radical departure from traditional \nforms of discovery and a multidisciplinary \nand international effort. Computation and \ndesign are simply the first step in bringing \nnovel materials to market. Materials synthesis \nand characterisation have yet to benefit from \nautomation and accelerated learning on \na large scale27.

However, there is \nan AI innovation gap when compared to \nthe United States and China. This includes, \nfor instance, the number of AI firms and the \nshare of firms active in AI patenting. Most \nunicorn companies in the AI field are also \nbased in the United States and China.\n\nIn terms of \u2018AI dynamics\u2019, worldwide \nacademia-business and cross-country \ncollaborations have intensified over time. \nThe EU collaborates strongly with the United \nStates, then China, in research and patenting \nin the AI domain. Likewise, AI science is no \nlonger confined to fields such as computer \nscience. In the EU, AI research is more \noriented towards humanities and social \nsciences. Moreover, in the global AI race, top \ncompanies are investing highly in AI. This is \nillustrated by the rapid pace of acquisitions \nof AI startups (notably by tech giants), \nespecially in recent years, in order to access \ndata and top AI knowledge, with implications \nfor the EU\u2019s future positioning in AI, market-\nconcentration dynamics, data protection and \ncompetition policy.\n\nWorldwide, major economies have put \nforward ambitious AI strategies. China was \nfirst to launch a comprehensive AI strategy \nin 2017 with the \u2018Next Generation Artificial \nIntelligence Development Plan\u2019 followed by the \nindustry-targeted \u2018Three-Year Action Plan for \nPromoting Development of a New Generation \nArtificial Intelligence Industry (2017)\u201928 with the \n\naim of becoming the global AI leading nation by \n2030. With the Declaration on Cooperation \non Artificial Intelligence (2018) and the \nCoordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence \n\u2018Made in Europe\u2019 (2018)29, the EU and the \nMember States demonstrated their ambition \nto align priorities and maximise the impact of \npublic and private investments in AI to enable \ninnovation and collectively ensure that the \nEU as a whole can compete globally. The EU \nDigital Strategy30 wants to ensure not only \nthat Europe is a global digital player but also \nthat the EU leads in making sure that technology \nworks for all, and that we live in an open, \ndemocratic and sustainable digital society. The \nUnited States followed with a national strategy \nfor AI, the American AI Initiative (2019)31 which \nidentifies R&D as a top priority for maintaining \nglobal leadership in AI. \n\nAI can play a big role in the economic, \nsocial and ecological transition that \nEurope is undergoing. In the context of \nthe current productivity slowdown, AI can \nbe a powerful tool to improve the efficiency \nof operations throughout the economy. As \na result, the EU should capitalise on its \nindustrial strengths to lead in AI development. \nThis includes, for instance, manufacturing \nas well as new areas of early application \nsuch as material science. In order to achieve \ntechnology sovereignty in the field of AI \nas well as to diffuse it across sectors and \nregions, the combination of efforts at the EU \nand Member State level is paramount.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/content/european-digital-strategy\n\n\n505\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\nAlthough AI, like any technology, does \nnot automatically make the world \na better place, it can. In the fight against \nclimate change, AI can make a significant \ncontribution across different fields. By \nenabling automatic monitoring through remote \nsensing (e.g. pinpointing deforestation, and \nassessing damage after disasters), accelerating \nthe process of scientific discovery (e.g. by \nsuggesting new materials for batteries and \ncarbon capture) and optimising systems to \nimprove efficiency (e.g. by consolidating freight, \ndesigning carbon markets, and reducing food \nwaste)32. In addition, AI can also help to improve \npublic services (e.g. traffic management, \nhealthcare delivery and processing tax \nforms). While some EU Member States have \na high international ranking in \u2018government \nAI readiness\u2019, more efforts to roll-out AI \ncapabilities are needed in other countries.\n\nAI and other digital technologies have \nreached a stage of technological maturity \nthat makes them important tools to help \nin the fight against a pandemic such as \nCOVID-19. All over the world, ambitious R&I \nprojects and collaborations to track, monitor \nand contain the COVID-19 pandemic are \nincreasingly being carried out, including AI-\npowered solutions. AI-related applications \nhave enabled population screening, tracking \nthe spread of the infection, and the detection \nand diagnosis of COVID-19. Openly accessible, \nmachine-readable, interoperable data is \nneeded to track, monitor and forecast the \nspread of COVID-19. At the EU level, the Action \nPlan - Research data-sharing platform for the \nSARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 diseases launched \nby the EMBL\u2019s European Bioinformatics \nInstitute (EMBL-EBI) and the European Open \nScience Cloud intends to speed up and improve \nthe sharing, storage, processing of and access \nto research data and metadata on the SARS-\n\n32 Tackling climate change with machine learning: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05433\n\nCoV-2 and COVID-19 diseases. At the same \ntime, the use of AI tracking and surveillance \ntools in the context of this pandemic has \nclearly shown the need for the global \nethical governance of AI.\n\nAI also requires investing in a set of \ncomplementary assets. These include fos-\ntering talent production and retention in the \nEU (while attracting foreign talent from other \nparts of the globe), investments and capacity-\nbuilding in related digital technologies, \nsuch as high-performance computing, European \ncloud and micro-electronics, and research and \ndigital infrastructure, notably 5G networks, \nfor Europe to remain competitive and ensure \ntechnological sovereignty. Both the EC\u2019s Horizon \nEurope and Digital Europe Programmes will \nbe instrumental in achieving this. Furthermore, \nadvancing market integration in Europe \nwith a complete Digital Single Market is vital for \nAI startups and scale-ups to succeed, including \nsimpler and quicker patent rights.\n\nIn addition, one of the most important \nconsiderations is to ensure that the \neconomic and social benefits of AI are \nbroadly shared across society. Thus, \nbuilding \u2018trust in tech\u2019 and social \nacceptance around AI is essential. For \nexample, open source and open data have \nimportant implications for boosting innovation, \nalthough there are also concerns relating to \nprivacy and cybersecurity. In the EU, the General \nData Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a major \nstep towards building trust and ensuring \nlegal clarity in AI-based applications. Also, AI \npredictions and decision-making capabilities \nare only as good as the quality of the underlying \ndata. Concerns over AI bias based on gender, \nrace and other factors due to \u2018inherited\u2019 bias \nin historical data or missing observations may \nlead to discriminatory decisions. \n\n\n\n506\n\nAll in all, although Europe has a rich \nhistory in AI research and continues to \nlead in that area, it is clear that the early \nimplementers of recent breakthroughs in \nmachine learning, big data analytics, and \ncloud computing are situated mainly in \nthe United States and China, predominantly \nin the B2C market. In years to come, the \napplication of AI will increasingly be the subject \nof concerns about its long-term impacts on \nprivacy, technological sovereignty and the \nfuture of work. Europe is currently carving out \na position to lead in a more thoughtful, ethical \n\napproach to AI with a clear and adequate legal \nand ethical framework to build an AI ecosystem \nthat spurs innovation: Europe is designing \nits own way. By seeking out opportunities in \nthe business-to-business market, investing in \nthe development of privacy-preserving and \ntransparent AI, rethinking existing paradigms \n(e.g. edge vs. cloud-based AI), putting an \nemphasis on the environmental impact of \ninformation technologies, and by introducing \ntargeted regulation (of which GDPR could be \nseen as an onset), Europe is positioning itself \nfor a self-designed, AI-infused future.\n\n\n\n507\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 7\n\n11.

In the United \nStates, eight times more venture capital \nfunds are raised for innovation.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd The public sector has been an important \nactor in the recovery of venture capital \nin the EU.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd When it comes to R&I-related activities, \nthree main barriers to the internal \nmarket can be identified, namely limited \nknowledge circulation, limited innovation \ndiffusion, and gaps in the quality and \nefficiency of R&I systems.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd There is a positive correlation between \ncountries\u2019 regulatory quality and \ninnovation performance. However, China \ndoes not follow this pattern, showing strong \nR&I performance but a very low score in \nterms of regulatory quality.\n\n What does it mean for policy?\n\n\u00dd\u00dd These results call for policies ensuring \nefficient framework conditions and \nimproving institutional quality across \nand within Member States, in particular \nperipheral economies in the south and east.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Foster the access to risk capital and \nother alternative sources of financing \nto improve the scaling-up performance of \nEuropean innovative companies.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Europe needs a fit-for-purpose and \nforward-looking regulatory framework \nencouraging innovation to support \nsocial, economic and environmental \ntransitions.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Completing the Single Market for \nresearch, education and innovation \ncan foster knowledge diffusion across the \ncontinent.\n\n\n\n513\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\nInvesting in innovation activities is a risky \nprocess characterised by high uncertainty \nconcerning the returns and their \nappropriability. Because of this, and the related \ndifficulties in getting access to appropriate \nsources of finance, private investment in R&D \nand innovation tends to be lower than what would \nbe socially desirable. Such underinvestment has \nbeen investigated by analysts and policymakers \nas it brings a social loss due to missed positive \nspillovers from R&I activities in terms of both \ntechnological opportunities and economic \nimpacts (Arrow, 1962; David et al., 2000). On the \none hand, such a \u2018market failure\u2019 justifies direct \npublic support for business R&D and innovative \nactivities in order to increase investment and the \nassociated benefits for society as a whole. On \nthe other hand, this suggests that the overall \nframework conditions in which companies \noperate are fundamental as they set business \nincentives and shape the innovation capacity \nof economies.\n\n\u2018Good\u2019 framework conditions positively \naffect business-investment decisions, ease \naccess to markets for new and innovative \ncompanies, and contribute to reallocating \nresources towards more productive \nand innovative activities. This chapter \ninvestigates how fit-for-purpose framework \nconditions are in Europe and peer economies, \nalong several dimensions: i) the efficiency of \nproduct markets and the functioning of the \nlabour market; ii) the availability of sources \nof finance for innovative investments; iii) the \nquality of the institutional frameworks; and \niv) the regulatory framework for innovation. \nThese factors contribute to determining the \nopportunities and costs businesses face \nwhen operating in a market and, as such, \n\n1 See https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/methodology and the methodological Annex for more details.\n\naffect their decisions. In particular, a higher \nnumber of bureaucratic and often redundant \nrequirements (red tape) to engage in economic \nactivities and exchanges pose additional, often \nunnecessary, burdens on companies. These are \nnormally known as transaction costs and act \nas a deterrent to firms\u2019 investment and growth \nprospects as they affect business activities \nin terms of both time and monetary costs. \nTherefore, while they hinder investment and \neconomic performance horizontally across \nsectors, their impact is specifically relevant for \ncompanies in the domain of R&I, characterised \nby higher risk and uncertainty over the \noutcomes. \n\nFramework conditions for engaging in \nbusiness activities in the EU have been \nimproving over the last decade and \na positive trend can be observed in most \nMember States. Europe has made substantial \nprogress in improving the conditions for \nfirms to operate in the markets, reducing \nbureaucratic requirements and other costs \nrelated to running a business. This trend is \nshown in Figure 8-1 which plots the ease of \ndoing business indicator produced by the World \nBank for 2010 and 2019. It is an encompassing \nindex summarising information drawn from \n10 indicators describing how easy it is to start \na business or leave the market, dealing with \nbureaucratic procedures, getting credit and \ngoing through legal procedures1. An overall \nimprovement for the EU has been driven by \nincreases in the index for the Member States \nwith the lowest values in 2010, suggesting \nthat an upward convergence trend is in place. \nThe reforms implemented by Member States \nand the deepening of the Single Market have \nbeen two key driving factors.\n\n\n\n514\n\nFigure 8-1 Ease of doing business - distance to frontier \n(0 = lowest performance to 100 = frontier)(1), 2010 and 2019\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: World Bank data, Ease of Doing Business Index\nNotes: (1)The distance to frontier score illustrates the distance of an economy to the 'frontier' which represents the best \nperformance observed across all economies.

Efficiency of the product and labour markets \nis heterogeneous among Member States, \nwith a persisting gap vis-\u00e0-vis peer economies \n\nThe structure of the product market \ndetermines the conditions under which \nbusinesses operate, shaping their \nincentives and opportunities to invest. \nEfficient product markets allow companies \nto compete equally, rewarding innovative \ninvestments and incentivising the entry of \nnew firms and startup creation. Conversely, \ninefficient product markets that do not provide \na levelling field for private activities contribute \nto the misallocation of resources towards \n\nless-productive uses, eventually hindering \naggregate productivity.\n\nThe European product market performs \nbetter than in China or South Korea, \nbut there is still a gap with the United \nStates and Japan, while differences \nbetween Member States are still relevant. \nFigure 8-2 presents an index of the efficiency \nof the product market developed by the World \nEconomic Forum (WEF), which accounts for \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-1.xlsx\n\n\n515\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\nthe above factors by drawing data from \ndifferent sources, including surveys to business \nrepresentatives. The index is an aggregate \nmeasure that includes information on the \ndistortive effects of taxes and subsidies on \ncompetition across several sectors, the \nextent of market concentration and barriers \nto economic exchanges, including trade2. \nInternational benchmarking places the EU in \nan intermediate position compared to its main \npeer economies. While the product market is \nmore efficient in the United States and Japan, \nit performs better in the EU compared to \nSouth Korea and China. There is substantial \nheterogeneity between Member States, with \ncentral and eastern economies having less-\nperforming goods markets while countries in \nthe west and north of Europe have the most \nefficient ones. Countries in the south of Europe \nare in-between, with the notable exception \nof Greece which is at the bottom of the \ndistribution.\n\nCompetition is one of the key elements \ndefining the efficiency of the goods market. \nIndeed, while from a theoretical perspective the \nrelationship between competition and innovation \nis not straightforward3, the underperforming \nproductivity dynamics of recent decades have \nraised concerns on the impact of competition on \n\n2 The Index corresponds to the 7th pillar of the Global Competitive Index which, in turn, is the summary measure of eight sub-indi-\ncators.

However, the Schumpeterian argument states that larger firms with market power are more likely to innovate be-\ncause they can benefit from innovation rents. Empirical evidence suggests that the relationship is not linear and depends \non the initial level of competition and economy-wide factors, such as the characteristics of industry and firms and the \ntechnology opportunity provided by the structure of the economy. See, for instance, the review in Cohen (2010).\n\n4 According to data reported in The 2019 European Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard, the world top 2 500 R&D inves-\ntors account for approximately 90 % of the global business R&D investment.\n\ninnovative investment and growth. In particular, \nthe rise of \u2018superstar\u2019 firms has led to an \nunprecedented concentration of investment, \ninnovation activities and the associated benefits. \nWhile these companies are more productive \nand invest more in intangible assets4 than the \nrest, recent evidence from the International \nMonetary Fund suggests that their increasing \nmarket shares and mark-ups may eventually \ncreate negative effects on overall investment, \nproductivity growth, labour shares and \ninnovation rates. This relationship becomes more \npronounced the more industries are concentrated \nand the closer they are to the technological \nfrontier (Diez et al., 2018).

The common view on labour \nmarket efficiency suggests that the excessive \nregulation of hiring and firing relationships has \nnegative impacts on employment trends, and \neventually on productivity growth (Bassanini \nand Ernst, 2002). In particular, rigidities \nin determining salaries together with high \nlabour costs have negative bearings on firms\u2019 \ninvestments and may discourage the adoption \nof innovation. As a result, industry productivity \nis hindered, with long-term implications \nfor industries\u2019 competitiveness and growth \nprospects (Tressel and Scarpetta, 2004; Thum-\n\nThysen et al., 2017).

Such a risk is \nhigher in economies characterised by relatively \nlow shares of knowledge-intensive sectors, \nwhere less employment protection may create \nunintended incentives for firms to opt for \ncost-competitiveness solutions, rather than \nscaling up the technological content of their \nactivities (Lucidi, 2012; Pyke, 2018). As such, \nhigher labour market flexibility could have \nan unintended \u2018protecting\u2019 effect on less-\ninnovative firms which will be able to engage \nin cost-based competition and have a greater \nchance of survival (Kleinknecht, 1998). Within \nthis perspective, the Schumpeterian \u2018creative \ndestruction\u2019 process would be hampered, \nallowing less-competitive and innovative firms \nto survive rather than being \u2018competed away\u2019 \nby innovating firms, which are less likely to \nbenefit from looser labour market flexibility, \ndue to higher profits and market dominance7 \n(Kleinknecht et al., 2014). Furthermore, \nthe impact of technological change on job \nlosses may have harmful and costly effects \non displaced workers with obsolete skills. \nActive labour market policies promoting \nlifelong learning, up- and reskilling are crucial, \nespecially in the context of the unprecedented \nspeed of technological change and to ensure \ninclusive growth is achieved (Pyke, 2018)8. \n\n7 The existing empirical evidence is inconclusive and varies with the data and indicators used as, for instance, reported in \nDe Spiegelaere et al. (2014). Among others, Kleinknecht et al. (2014) report that labour market flexibility negatively af-\nfects innovation in sectors where innovation output depends on large R&D investment based on accumulated and specific \nknowledge, with monopolistic competition or oligopolies. See also Chapter 13 - Regulations and technology diffusion in \nEurope: the role of Industry dynamics.\n\n8 See also Chapter 2 - Changing innovation dynamics in the age of digital transformation, and Chapter 5.2 - Investment in \neducation, human capital and skills.\n\n9 While the index is predominantly a measure of labour market flexibility (8 out of 12 indicators are related to it), it allows \nfor the inclusion of different factors that are relevant for both the definition of framework conditions conducive to inno-\nvation and, partially, to the implication of technological change on employment dynamics. See also: weforum.org/glob-\nal-competitiveness-report-2018/appendix-c-the-global-competitiveness-index-4-0-methodology-and-technical-notes/ \nfor more details.\n\n10 Some of the measures are based on surveys among business representatives. Therefore, while European Member States \nhave undertaken several reforms in recent years, some time lag may be needed for the reforms to be perceived as effective.\n\nGiven the above framework, Figure 8-6 \nreports a labour market efficiency index \ndeveloped by the WEF. This is an aggregate \nindex encompassing different dimensions of \nemployment relationships. On the one hand, it \naccounts for regulation and flexibility, including \nredundancy costs, flexibility in hiring and firing \nand in wage determination, mobility of labour, \nthe labour tax rate and the extent to which \nwage is related to employee productivity. On \nthe other hand, it accounts for worker rights, \nthe presence of active labour market policies \nfor reskilling, female participation in the labour \nforce and management9. \n\nThe efficiency of labour markets is hetero- \ngeneous among Member States, with \na divide emerging between most peripheral \ncountries and the core. While the best-\nperforming Member States have very efficient \nlabour markets in a global perspective, on \naverage the EU lags behind the United States, \nJapan and several third countries. Rigidities in \nhiring and firing practices are among the drivers \nof the low efficiency recorded for most of the \nsouth and central-eastern Member States10, \ntogether with France and Belgium. The lack of \nadequate active labour market policies is also \na relevant factor for southern economies like \nSpain, Italy and Greece.\n\nhttps://weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2018/appendix-c-the-global-competitiveness-index-4-0-methodology-and-technical-notes/\nhttps://weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2018/appendix-c-the-global-competitiveness-index-4-0-methodology-and-technical-notes/\n\n\n521\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\n2.  Regional and within-countries institutional \nquality differences persist across the EU\n\nWhile the regulatory constraints and \nred tape faced by companies constitute \na relevant barrier affecting overall \nbusiness investment and the innovation \npotential of economies, the quality of \nthe local institutional framework is a key \ndeterminant of economic and innovative \nperformance. Indeed, the role that institutions \nplay in shaping countries\u2019 economic performance \nhas received growing attention. Usually \ndefined as the set of rules setting the possible \noptions individuals and companies have when \nmaking economic and social choices, they are \ndevised to reduce transaction costs and favour \nproductive investments at a lower total cost and \nto discourage rent-seeking behaviour (North, \n\n1991; Williamson, 2000; Acemoglu et al., 2001). \nThe definition of a good institution is linked to \nhow effective it is in meeting these objectives \nand, consequently, improving economic and \ninnovation performance. Empirical analyses \nusually measure the \u2018goodness\u2019 of (public) \ninstitutions by the extent to which they efficiently \nand effectively deliver public goods and services, \nand they guarantee all actors the protection and \nenforcement of property rights (Acemoglu et al., \n2001; Ogilvie and Carus, 2014).\n\nGood institutional frameworks improve \neconomic and innovation prospects as they \nreduce uncertainty on the appro-priability \nof the returns on investment, which is \n\nFigure 8-6 Global Competitiveness Index - labour market, 2018  \nvalues are on a scale of 0 to 100 (best)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Word Economic Forum - The Global Competitiveness Index dataset 2018\nNote: (1)EU is the unweighted average of the values for the EU Member States.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-6.xlsx\n\nUn\nite\n\nd S\nta\n\nte\ns\nJa\n\npa\nn\nEU\n\n(1\n)\n\nSo\nut\n\nh K\nor\n\nea\nCh\n\nina\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\nMa\n\nlta\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd\nSp\n\nainIta\nly\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n\nSw\nitz\n\ner\nlan\n\nd\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm\n\nIce\nlan\n\nd\n\nNo\nrw\n\nay\nIsr\n\nae\nl\n\nMo\nnt\n\nen\neg\n\nro\n\nGe\nor\n\ngia\n\nAr\nme\n\nnia\n\nAlb\nan\n\nia\n\nSe\nrb\n\nia\n\nUk\nra\n\nine\n\nMo\nldo\n\nva\n\nNo\nrth\n\n M\nac\n\ned\non\n\nia\n\nTu\nrke\n\ny\n\nBo\nsn\n\nia \nan\n\nd H\ner\n\nze\ngo\n\nvin\na\n\nTu\nnis\n\nia\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nIn\nde\n\nx\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-6.xlsx\n\n\n522\n\nalready higher in the context of R&D and \ninnovative activities.

It reflects the \nperception of the quality of public services, policy \nimplementation and its credibility, as well as the \nindependence of the civil service from political \npressures. As such, it encompasses some of \nthe characteristics of good institutions outlined \nabove. Government effectiveness among the \nbest EU performers, i.e. Finland, the Netherlands, \nSweden, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg \nand Austria, is as high as in the leading \ncountries worldwide, just below Switzerland \nand Norway.

While the general framework is set at \nthe national level, regional and local authorities \nare ultimately responsible for policy implemen-\ntation and public goods and services delivery, \nwhich become more crucial the more auton-\nomy lower levels of government have. This is \nparticularly relevant in the European case, both \nbecause of the organisation of governments in \nMember States, which favours decentralisa-\ntion in several instances, and to the principle \nof subsidiarity establishing that decisions must \nbe taken as closely as possible to the citizen. \nFor instance, Member States and their regions \nimplement EU Cohesion Policy in partnership \nwith the European Commission, including the \nselection, monitoring and evaluation of pro-\njects financed by the European Structural and \nInvestment Funds11. \n\nTherefore, the quality of regional and local \ninstitutions affects regional performance \nand contributes to explaining the econom-\nic and innovation divide both within and \nbetween countries.

(2019) and drawing on the \ndata and methodology of the European Social \nProgress Index (EU SPI) developed by the Euro-\npean Commission12. While the EU SPI develops \nits aggregate index on a broad set of meas-\nures, the focus here is on two main dimen-\nsions. On the one hand, the index uses some \nsub-indicators to measure the provision of \npublic services, the accountability and impar-\ntiality of regional governments and the degree \nof corruption. This (government effectiveness) \ndimension highlights the quality and effective-\nness of public service delivery as well as the \ngeneralised protection of property rights, which \nprovide a level playing field for all businesses \nand individuals to reduce their costs and risk \nwhile engaging in economic and innovation \nactivities. On the other hand, the Institutional \nIndex also accounts for those public goods and \nservices relevant for increasing the capacity \nof regional ecosystems to create, diffuse and \nabsorb knowledge. This ( absorption capacity) \ndimension includes information on education \nattainment and access to basic knowledge, to \nadvanced education and to information and \ncommunication infrastructure13. Therefore, the \nInstitutional Index is consistent with the concept \nof institutional quality, whilst also accounting \nfor measures of absorption capacity and gen-\neralised opportunity, directly linked to innova-\ntion performance ( Bianchini et al., 2019)14.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/how/stages-step-by-step/\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/information/maps/methodological_note_eu_spi_2016.pdf\n\n\n524\n\nFigure 8-8 The Institutional Index\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Uni based on Bianchini et al.

However, \nin the United States, eight times more \nventure capital funding is raised for \ninnovation than in the EU. This may not only \nlimit the scaling-up of \u2018made in EU\u2019 disruptive \nideas and solutions but may also challenge \nthe permanence of these startups in the EU. \nDisruptive and market-creating innovations \nare typically associated with a \u2018high risk\u2019 and \ndegree of uncertainty which traditional finance \n(e.g. bank loans) is often not capable of bearing. \nFor this reason, access to risk finance is seen \nas the alternative route for financing risky ideas \nand businesses, both at early and later stages. \nIndeed, venture capital investors often follow \na \u2018high-risk\u2019-\u2018high-return\u2019 mindset in contrast \nto banks and traditional finance. As mentioned \nin Chapter 3.3 - Business dynamics and its \ncontribution to structural change, the EU trails \nbehind other major economies when it comes \n\nto transformational entrepreneurship that may \nlead to the \u2018next global technological champions\u2019. \nOne of the key reasons for this lies in the large \ngap in terms of venture capital compared to \ncountries such as the United States. Indeed, \nfrom Figure 8-12 it is clear that the EU has not \nmanaged to close the gap in funds raised. Even \nthough funds raised in the EU have increased \nsince 2013 and are currently above pre-crisis \nlevels, the venture funds raised in the United \nStates have also risen and have almost doubled \ncompared to 2007. Overall, the venture funds \navailable in the EU only amount to around one-\neighth of those in the United States.\n\nNevertheless, the availability of venture \ncapital has increased in the EU in recent \nyears, recovering from the aftermath \nof the last economic crisis. This could be \npartly attributed to an overall improvement \nin Europe\u2019s macroeconomic conditions (OECD, \n2019; Pradhan et al., 2017).\n\nFigure 8-12 Venture capital funds raised (EUR billion) in the EU and in the \nUnited States, 2007-2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource:  DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit, based on Invest Europe and NVCA/PitchBook data\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-12.xlsx\n\n25 \n\n21 \n\n9 \n\n15 \n18 19 \n\n16 \n\n25 \n\n33 \n\n36 \n\n30 \n\n46 \n\n5 4 \n2 2 3 3 2 3 \n\n4 \n6 7 6 \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 \n\nEU\nR \n\nbi\nlli\n\non\n \n\nUnited States EU \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-12.xlsx\n\n\n531\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\nThe gap in risk capital relative to the \nUnited States can also be seen in terms \nof the average fund size.

Later, the company may consider \nan Initial Public Offering (IPO), for example. \nThis cycle is represented in Figure 8-1717.\n\nFigure 8-17 Visual simplification of the startup venture capital investment cycle\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit, based on Medium-The Startup Investment \nCycle, InvestEurope and coxblue.com          \nImages: stock.adobe.com \u00a9 csiling, #277690257; 2019. \u00a9 Gstudio Group, #176944380; 2019 \u00a9 Gstudio Group, #176944413; \n2019. \u00a9 Gstudio Group, #176944454; 2019. \u00a9 Mark Stock, #196345712; 2019.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-17.xlsx\n\n\u20ac\u20ac \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac \u20ac\n\nIN\nV\n\nES\nTM\n\nEN\nT \n\nSI\nZE\n\nRI\nSK\n\nRE\nV\n\nEN\nU\n\nE\n\nSEED LATERSTAGESTARTUP\n\nTIMEValley of death\n\n(Public markets)\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-17.xlsx\n\n\n536\n\nOverall, venture capital in the EU is \nmainly concentrated in a few EU Member \nStates that are either \u2018innovation \nleaders\u2019 or \u2018strong innovators\u2019 as in the \nEuropean Innovation Scoreboard. There \nare significant intra-EU differences in the \navailability of venture capital at each \nstage. Seed and startup capital have \nincreased in the EU, while later-stage \nas a percentage of GDP has declined \ncompared to 2007-2010. In recent years, \nwhen comparing the change in venture capital \nas a percentage of GDP between 2007-2010 \nand 2015-2018, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, \nFrance and Denmark stand out as the countries \nwith the highest shares of venture capital as \na percentage of GDP, while Italy, Slovenia, \nCroatia, Malta and Romania have the lowest \nshares (Figure 8-18). Most EU Member States \n\neither maintained or increased the share of \nventure capital in GDP. Compared to 2007-\n2010, there was a decline in Sweden, Denmark, \nLuxembourg, Portugal, Bulgaria, Italy, Croatia, \nMalta and Romania. There are also substantial \nintra-EU differences in the availability of \nventure capital by stage, although it seems \nthat startup capital has the highest share in \nGDP in most countries. Seed capital as a share \nof GDP is highest in Hungary, Ireland and \nFrance but, according to the data, is practically \nnon-existent in Croatia, Malta and Romania. \nFinland, Ireland and Sweden lead in terms \nof the relative availability of startup capital. \nFinland and Sweden are the Member States \nwith the largest relative presence of late-stage \ncapital while it appears practically absent in \nCyprus, Croatia and Malta.\n\nFigure 8-18 Venture capital (market statistics) by stage as % of GDP,  \nperiods 2007-2010 and 2015-2018\n\n \n\nEU\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSp\nain\n\n 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia \n20\n\n07\n-2\n\n01\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nGD\n\nP\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nG\n\nDP\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia \n20\n\n07\n-2\n\n01\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia \n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n01\n\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nIta\nly \n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n01\n\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nMa\nlta\n\n 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm \n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n01\n\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSeed Startup Large stage\n\nSeed Startup Large stage\n\n\n\n537\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\nThe public sector contributes actively \nto a stronger innovation ecosystem. In \nparticular, at the EU level, the European \nInnovation Council (EIC) will pool \nresources to support innovators with \nbreakthrough ideas and market-creating \ninnovations. The EIC intends to play a key \nrole in tackling the financing gap for innovative \nand disruptive startups in Europe in a context \nwhere some degree of fragmentation of the \ninnovation ecosystem remains. The EIC remit is \nrepresented in Figure 8-19.\n\nThe next Framework Programme, Horizon \nEurope, will introduce the EIC under the \nInnovative pillar to support the ambition \nof making the EU a global leader in \nmarket-creating innovations. The EIC will \nintegrate, reorganise and expand activities \nwhich were previously part of Horizon 2020, \nsuch as Access to Risk Finance (in synergy \nwith the InvestEU programme), Innovation in \n\nSMEs (notably the SME instrument), Fast-track \nto Innovation, as well as Future and Emerging \nTechnologies (\u2018FET-Open\u2019 and \u2018FET ProActive\u2019).\n\nThe EIC will notably implement two \ncomplementary instruments, namely the \nEIC Pathfinder and the EIC Accelerator: it \nwill focus on detecting, nurturing, supporting and \nscaling-up breakthrough market-creating and \ndisruptive innovation, from the idea (\u2018Pathfinder\u2019 \nscheme) down to market deployment and scaleup \n(\u2018Accelerator\u2019 scheme). The EIC Pathfinder for \nadvanced research will provide grants for high-\nrisk, cutting-edge projects implemented mainly \nby consortia exploring new territories aimed at \ndeveloping radical and innovative technologies \n(i.e. early-stage research on technological ideas \nthat can be transformational, to support spin-\noffs and market-creating innovations). The EIC \nAccelerator will provide single startups, SMEs \nand, in very rare cases, small midcaps carrying \nout disruptive innovation which are still too risky \n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit, based on Invest Europe and Eurostat data\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-18.xlsx\n\n \n\nEU\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nFin\nlan\n\nd 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nIre\nlan\n\nd 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nDe\nnm\n\nar\nk 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nHu\nng\n\nar\ny 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSp\nain\n\n 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nBe\nlgi\n\num\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nNe\nth\n\ner\nlan\n\nds\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nGe\nrm\n\nan\ny 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nEs\nto\n\nnia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nAu\nstr\n\nia \n20\n\n07\n-2\n\n01\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmb\nou\n\nrg\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nCy\npr\n\nus\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nGD\n\nP\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n%\n\n o\nf \n\nG\nDP\n\nPo\nrtu\n\nga\nl 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia \n20\n\n07\n-2\n\n01\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nGr\nee\n\nce\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nBu\nlga\n\nria\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nLit\nhu\n\nan\nia \n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n01\n\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nPo\nlan\n\nd 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nIta\nly \n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n01\n\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nCr\noa\n\ntia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nMa\nlta\n\n 2\n00\n\n7-\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nCz\nec\n\nhia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nRo\nma\n\nnia\n 2\n\n00\n7-\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nUn\nite\n\nd K\ning\n\ndo\nm \n\n20\n07\n\n-2\n01\n\n0\n\n20\n15\n\n-2\n01\n\n8\n\nSeed Startup Large stage\n\nSeed Startup Large stage\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-18.xlsx\n\n\n538\n\nto attract private investments with the necessary \nmeans to scale up through a mix of grant \nand finance (notably equity support, but also \ndebt financing/guarantees) with the ultimate \nobjective of incentivising and subsequently \nattracting ideally immediately) co-investments \nfrom private (or other public) investments.\n\nMoreover, as funding is not enough, the EIC \nwill provide its beneficiaries with a com-\nplete set of business-acceleration services \n(such as mentoring, coaching, access to large \n corporates, investors, international fairs, etc.). \n\nThe EIC will develop complementarities \nwith the European Institute of Innovation \nand Technology (EIT) which is also enabling \ninnovation to flourish in Europe through \nan active knowledge-triangle integration \n(i.e. education, research and innovation) that \nempowers innovators and entrepreneurs to \nsolve global challenges through knowledge \nand innovation communities (KICS) in the fields \nof digital, environment, health, food, etc.\n\nIndeed, targeted \u2018R&D grants for scaleups\u201918 \ncan play an important role in the scaling-\nup phase of innovative companies.

Box 8-2 discusses the potential of \npublic procurement for innovation, reflecting \non the opportunities and challenges it provides.\n\nBOX 8-2  The role of public procurement for innovation\n\nAs noted by the European Commission, public \nprocurement refers to the process by which public \nauthorities, such as government departments \nor local authorities, purchase work, goods or \nservices from companies19. Indeed, with the \nright framework in place, public procurement \ncan boost innovation and potentially lead to \nefficiency gains and greater inclusiveness, both \nat the national and local levels20. \n\nThe EU 2020 Strategy recommends using public \nprocurement not only to drive innovation but also \nto achieve high-quality public services in Europe. \nIn the EU, almost 14 % of GDP is spent every \nyear on public procurement. Two of the main \nfindings by the OECD (2017) were that 81 % of \nOECD countries21 have developed strategies or \npolicies to support innovative goods and services \nthrough public procurement, but only 39.4 % of \nOECD countries are measuring the results of \ntheir support to innovative goods and services \nthrough public procurement. The report also \nnotes that demand-side-driven procurement \npolicies have led to breakthroughs key to the \n\u2018green and social economy\u2019, such as liquid light-\nemitting diodes (LEDs), electric cars and robotic \nbed-washing facilities in hospitals. Hence, public \nprocurement can be an important channel for \nmarket-creation and directionality.\n\nThe RISE group (2019) refers to the \u2018triple \nrationale\u2019 for the application of public \nprocurement of goods and services to \ninnovation as follows:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd the improvement of public services;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd the inducement of supplier firms (and \neventually other firms) to be more innovative;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd the pursuit of broader societal goals or \nmissions.\n\nAs regards the challenges for public procurement \nfor innovation, the OECD (2017) highlights the \nneed to decrease risk aversion, set up more \neffective coordination mechanisms, boost \nskills and capacity-building, encourage public \npurchasers to dialogue with suppliers, and \nenhance data collection and the monitoring of \nresults. These are consistent with the lessons \nlearned from the mutual learning exercise on \ninnovation-related public procurement under \nthe Horizon 2020 Policy Support Facility. The \nfinal report22 puts forward three main lessons \nlearned, grouped as: i) developing a strategic \nframework; b) capacity-building; and c) financial \nsupport mechanisms.\n\n\n\n540\n\nThe public sector has been an important \nactor in the recovery of venture capital \nin the EU, both in the years immediately \nafter the financial crisis at a time when \nprivate sources were contracting, and \nin stimulating the availability of capital \nin recent years. Public funding sources, \nincluding governmental agencies and \ninstitutions such as the European Investment \nFund (EIF), seem to play an important role in \nensuring the availability of venture capital in \nthe EU, which was particularly crucial in the \naftermath of the crisis when private sources \ndeclined dramatically (Figure 8-20). Moreover, \nits weight increased from 13 % in 2007 to \n\naround 22 % of total venture funds raised in \n2018. In contrast, the share of private funding \nhas been more vulnerable to macroeconomic \nconditions and external shocks.\n\nNevertheless, in recent years, private \nsources have recovered and regained their \nprominent role, accounting for around \n50 % of new funds raised. In absolute \nterms, private funds have even surpassed pre-\ncrisis levels since 2016. The \u2018mixed\u2019 category \nincludes, for instance, capital made available \nunder the so-called \u2018fund-of-funds\u2019, which \ncombines public and private efforts to mobilise \nventure capital.\n\nFigure 8-20 Venture capital in the EU - new funds raised by \nsource (in EUR million), 2007-2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit, based on Invest Europe data\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-20.xlsx\n\n0 \n\n1 000 \n\n2 000 \n\n3 000 \n\n4 000 \n\n5 000 \n\n6 000 \n\n7 000 \n\n8 000 \n\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 \n\nEU\nR \n\nm\nill\n\nio\nn\n\n \n\nPrivate sources Public sources Mixed Unclassified \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-20.xlsx\n\n\n541\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\nOverall, there seems to be a gender gap \nin startup funding as well as in achieving \nsuccessful exit strategies, namely IPOs \nand acquisitions. Gender differences \nin the likelihood of accessing funding \nopportunities appear more striking in \nEurope than in other regions. Lass\u00e9bie et \nal. (2019) used Crunchbase data to detect \nany potential gender gaps in terms of access \nto funding and the likelihood of going public or \nbeing acquired in Europe, Asia and the United \nStates. The results are reported in Figure 8-21. \n\nGender differences in the probability of receiving \nfunding seem more pronounced in Europe than in \nthe United States or Asia. However, accordingly, \nthe difference between gender in the probability \nto go public via an IPO is not significant in the \nthree regions.

China is \ncurrently the largest market providing \nsuch solutions. Alternative financing models \nhave spread more significantly in the aftermath \nof the banking crisis, which has also been \nfostered by the digitalisation wave, including the \ndevelopment of online intermediate platforms \nthat disrupted business models. The growing \n\u2018appetite\u2019 for online alternative finance is also \nobservable in the EU (Figure 8-31). According \nto the Cambridge Centre for Alternative \n\nFinance (2019), online alternative finance \nmodels include a wide range of modalities that \ncan be debt- or equity-based. These include, \nfor example, P2P consumer lending, P2P \nbusiness lending, equity-based crowdfunding, \nreward-based crowdfunding, donation-based \ncrowdfunding, and profit sharing, among others. \nAccordingly, many platforms in Europe are \npositive about the regulatory framework, but \na considerable number still consider the existing \nregulation as unsuitable.

Better regulation for R&I will incentivise \ncompetition and innovation in Europe\n\nIn order to ensure well-functioning mar-\nkets that incentivise competition and in-\nnovation, thereby maximising the impact \nof EU R&I investments, Europe needs \na fit-for-purpose, forward-looking and \noverall innovation-friendly regulatory \nframework. There is well-established litera- \nture demonstrating that regulation, when it \nfeatures adequate levels of stringency and \nthe appropriate timing, can steer innovation \ntowards addressing societal needs (Pelkmans \nand Renda, 2014; Ashford and Renda, 2016; \nPeter et al., 2017). Regulation needs the flex-\nibility to adapt to an industry and society that \nare evolving rapidly. Hence, regulators are key \nplayers to support R&I by creating the right \nconditions for it and ensuring that policies are \ndeveloped with innovation in mind. Regula-\ntory frameworks need to enable more testing, \nlearning and adaptation, and public policies \nhave to make better use of all existing data \n\nand analytics. This implies that regulation, \nat both European and Member-State levels, \nshould strike a balance between predictabil-\nity and flexibility. It should also guarantee fair \ncompetition without sanctioning failure or \nrisk-taking.\n\nAt the EU level, the European Commission \nrecognises the importance of regulation in \nstimulating innovation to support social, \nenvironmental and economic objectives. In \nthis context, it applies an innovation principle \n(Box 8-4) when preparing major legislative \ninitiatives. To clarify how existing regulatory \nrequirements apply to innovative ideas, the \nCommission has also been piloting Innovation \nDeals to help innovators address perceived \nEU regulatory obstacles. Early results in pilots \non batteries and water reuse suggest the \nexperience can provide useful feedback to \nimprove regulation and promote innovation.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/180308-action-plan-fintech-factsheet_en.pdf\n\n\n557\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\nBOX 8-4 The innovation principle \n\n28 Injection of fertilisers into an irrigation system.\n\nThe innovation principle helps to ensure \nthat EU legislation is analysed and designed \nso as to encourage innovation to deliver social, \nenvironmental and economic benefits and help \nprotect Europeans. It supports the EU's better \nregulation approach to help to enact smart, \nfuture-oriented regulation.\n\nExamples of recent experience with the \ninnovation principle in EU rules include:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Regulation on the minimum requirements \nfor water reuse: implications of the different \npolicy options for this initiative were \ndiscussed with innovators. They indicated \na preference for mandatory EU minimum \nquality requirements which became part of \nthe legislative proposal.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Regulation on health technology assessment \n(HTA): this helps to inform policy and clinical \ndecision-making on the introduction and \nuse of health technologies. HTA systems in \nEurope used to be fragmented with different \nmethods, different requirements regarding \nthe type of clinical evidence, and different \nprocedures, which impeded the take-up \nof innovations. Better cooperation on HTA \nwill improve the availability of innovative \nproducts for patients and stimulate the \n\ndevelopment of innovative health technology. \nThe Commission analysed elements such \nas improved innovation incentives and \nchoices for R&D investments, a reduced \nadministrative burden in bringing new \nproducts to the market, reduced regulatory \nuncertainty and better adaptability to rapid \ntechnological developments.\n\nAs part of the innovation principle, the \nInnovation Deals address perceived \nregulatory obstacles to innovative \nsolutions, stemming from the existing EU \nregulatory framework. Launched in 2017, \na deal on anaerobic membrane technology for \nreuse of wastewater in agriculture aimed to \ninvestigate the (perceived) regulatory barriers \nthat may prevent a broader application of \nanaerobic membrane bioreactor technology \nto enable the reuse of reclaimed water and \nnutrients in agriculture. Recommendations \nfrom this deal include: i) changing existing \nrules to enable fertigation28 in sensitive areas \nwhile ensuring environmental protection; ii) \ndeveloping guidance for Member States on \nthe integration of environmental risks relating \nto nutrients; and iii) reflecting on methods \nfor water pricing and recovering costs from \npolluters when water is reused in agriculture.\n\n\n\n558\n\nWhile the importance of a well-designed \nregulation to promote innovation is being \nincreasingly acknowledged by policymakers, \nthere are still strong differences between \nEU Member States in terms of regulatory \nquality. The perception of government\u2019s ability \nto formulate and implement sound policies \nand regulations for promoting private-sector \ndevelopment is very high in strong R&I countries \nsuch as Germany and Nordic countries. On the \nother hand, the quality of regulation is perceived \nas very low in countries such as Greece, Croatia, \nSlovenia and Bulgaria, which are also weaker in \nterms of R&I performance.\n\n29 Here as measured by the Global Innovation Index.\n30 This index is published by Cornell University, INSEAD, and the World Intellectual Property Organization, in partnership with \n\nother organisations and institutions.\n\nOverall, there seems to be a clear \ncorrelation between how countries are \npositioned in terms of regulatory quality \nand their innovation performance29 \n(Figure 8-37). This is also true for global non-EU \ncountries, with Switzerland, the United States \nand the United Kingdom showing both very \nstrong R&I performance and regulatory quality. \nCompared to global competitors, central and \neastern EU countries tend to present lower \nperceived regulatory quality as well as weaker \nR&I performance.30\n\nFigure 8-37 Regulatory quality\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Global Innovation Index 2019 Indicators\nNotes: The Global Innovation Index30 provides a score by country on its capacity for, and success in, innovation.

This may point to the idea that China \nis playing outside the rules, its success being \nthe result of building a competitive edge \npotentially to the detriment of standards and, \nalso based on other insights on framework \nconditions in this section, providing generous \nstate subsidies, significant market protection \nand a lengthy track record of unfair trade \npractices, commercial espionage and \nintellectual property right infringements (EPSC, \n2019). Hence, compared to China, Europe \nseems to enjoy substantially more trust and \nconfidence regarding its regulations and \nstandards. This also means that Europe should \ncapitalise on its acquis while facing potentially \nunfair practices, which calls for proper agility \nand flexibility in its regulatory framework.\n\nIn this respect, the innovation principle \napplied to R&I in different sectors \n(e.g. health technologies, waste mana-\ngement, energy generation) goes beyond \nimproving the environment for doing \nbusiness and can contribute to achieving \nsustainable growth and desirable social \nand environmental benefits. Using horizon \nscanning and innovative regulatory approaches \nto harness future technological advances and \nsteer them towards delivering on European \nCommission priorities, the innovation principle \ncan provide valuable insights into other policies \nin the areas of climate, environment, health, \nfood, competitiveness and industry.\n\nBy its very nature and speed, innovation \nmay often call into question traditional \napproaches to regulation. This raises the \nbroader question of how regulation could \n\n31 For an illustration, see Financial Conduct Authority, Regulatory sandbox lessons learned report (2017).\n32 On this point, see, for instance, the Expert Group on Regulatory Obstacles to Financial Innovation (ROFIEG), Thirty Recom-\n\nmendations on Regulation, Innovation and Finance, Report for the European Commission, December 2019.\n\nbe made fit for purpose to continue to be \nefficient while meeting the desired policy goals \nin a fast-moving and increasingly complex \nenvironment. Experimental approaches to \nregulation, including the so-called \u2018regulatory \nsandboxes\u201931 are relevant in this context. When \ntesting new solutions and alternative business \nmodels, accountability and the involvement \nof those who are impacted by innovation are \nessential.\n\nWhen designing and evaluating regulation, \nthe growing role of digitalisation in \nvarious sectors of the economy is not \nalways reflected; the same applies to \nthe increasingly data-driven nature \nof innovation. In some instances, the \nopportunities offered by digitalisation can \nfacilitate the implementation of and compliance \nwith existing rules, by reducing administrative \nburdens without affecting intended policy \nobjectives, among others. More importantly, \ndigitalisation also matters for policy design \nand for identifying policy approaches that \ngrant sufficient adaptability to accommodate \ninnovation and fast technological change, \nwhere appropriate. Indeed, while digitalisation \nand technology are enablers of solutions, they \nmay also be the sources of new risks, which \nalso need to be assessed and understood32.\n\nThe Finnish Presidency, in cooperation with \nthe Commission, organised a high-level \nconference on the innovation principle \nin December 2019. It concluded that the \ninnovation principle can promote sustainable \ngrowth while offering a novel and important \napproach to addressing key socio-economic \ntransitions. Thus, it is particularly relevant to \nmeet ambitious policy goals such as carbon-\nneutrality but also to respond in an agile way to \n\n\n\n560\n\nrapid technological development33. While human \ncreativity has an inherent value, innovation \ncan have unintended outcomes. Therefore, \na critical assessment of responsible innovation \nis essential. In this respect, the way forward \nfor the innovation principle rests on convening \n\n33 Positive policy examples of innovation-friendly regulation provided during the conference included mobility as a service in \nFinland, and platforms to business regulation in EU rules.\n\n34 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market_en\n\nand partnering with all stakeholder groups, \nincluding civil society. In relation to institutional \nquality, people\u2019s skills are key to successfully \ndelivering regulatory innovation. Human-centric \napproaches, design thinking and user focus can \nhelp public organisations do better.\n\n5. Fulfilling the European Single Market\n\nThe EU Single Market for goods \nand services\n\nThe EU Single Market has been one of the \nkey pillars of Europe\u2019s competitiveness. \nCompleting the Single Market can foster \nknowledge diffusion across the continent. \nThe aim of the EU\u2019s Single Market is to create \na territory without any internal borders or other \nregulatory obstacles to the free movement \nof goods and services34. A functioning single \nmarket stimulates competition and trade, helps \ncompanies to benefit from economies of scale, \ntriggers efficiency gains, and offers consumers \na wider variety of products and services at lower \nprices (European Commission, 2015a). However, \nthere is room for improvement to fulfil the \npromise of delivering a fully functioning Single \nMarket. The Commission (2015b) stresses that \nlabour productivity growth could be boosted \nin the EU space if regulatory barriers were \nremoved, thereby allowing for improvements \nin the allocation of resources across firms and \nsectors. Improving the regulatory and cross-\nborder frameworks is of the utmost importance \nfor innovative firms that want easier access \nto the EU market. Furthermore, as discussed \nin Chapter 3.1 - Productivity puzzle and \ninnovation diffusion, innovation diffusion from \nleading to laggard firms seems to be stalling \n\nEurope\u2019s productivity. Hence, stimulating \nknowledge flows and the diffusion of knowledge \nthrough a well-functioning single market for \nknowledge is of tremendous importance. The \nmobility of researchers and, more generally, \nbrain circulation can also boost collaborative \ninnovation (see Chapter 6.2 - Knowledge flows).\n\nBuilding a culture of compliance and smart \nenforcement will set the foundations for \nthe complete success of the EU Single \nMarket. Figure 8-38 shows the performance of \nEU Member States in relation to the transposition \nand conformity deficit, according to the EU Single \nMarket Scoreboard 2019. Accordingly, seven \nMember States still exceeded the 1 % target, \nwhich was down from 13 in 2017: Germany, \nLuxembourg, Romania, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus \nand Spain. Moreover, there is a need to verify \nthe compliance of national measures taken \npursuant to directives to ensure the proper \nfunctioning of the EU Single Market. This is \nreflected in the conformity deficit. In particular, \nonly five EU Member States \u2013 Malta, Greece, \nLithuania, Denmark and Luxembourg \u2013 had \na compliance deficit of less than 0.5 %. Eleven \nMember States registered a high conformity \ndeficit, surpassing the 1 % mark. \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market_en\n\n\n561\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\nEU trade in goods and services measures \nthe integration into European value \nchains and the degree of openness. Four \nEastern countries \u2013 Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia \nand Czechia \u2013 have the highest percentages \nof GDP that are accounted for by trade with \nEU countries (imports and exports) in goods \n(Figure 8-39). This is probably a reflection of \nthe foreign direct investment (FDI)-led growth \nmodel in these countries, which has led to \nstrong manufacturing bases, well integrated \n\ninto western European production chains \n(Correia et al., 2018). The United Kingdom, \nGreece and France are at the lower spectrum \nof trade integration in goods.\n\nFigure 8-40 presents the level of trade \nintegration in services by EU Member States. \nIt is highest in Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland \nwhile Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom \nregister the lowest trade shares in GDP.\n\nFigure 8-38 Transposition deficit(1) and compliance deficit(2) in EU Member States, \nas of December 2018\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Commission (2019), EU Single Market Scoreboard\nNotes: (1)The transposition deficit shows the percentage of Single Market directives not yet completely notified to the Commission \nin relation to the total number of directives that should have been notified by the deadline.

Limited knowledge \ncirculation\n\nR&I increasingly happen within global networks \nin which interactions create value. Knowledge \nflows across disciplines, sectors and countries, \nthrough the geographical proximity of \nresearchers, are crucial for fostering the higher \nquality and greater impact of R&I activities. \n\nDifferent factors hamper knowledge flows, \nnamely:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Brain circulation is a complex and multi-\ndirectional phenomenon. International mobil-\nity is driven by research-job characteristics \nsuch as international networking, career \nperspectives and working with high-quality \npeers. Material working conditions related to \nremuneration, pensions and job security and \nother non-science-related conditions also \ninfluence job choice, and to a lesser extent \n\nBarriers for a Single Market for R&I\n\nWhen it comes to R&I-related activities, \nthree main barriers to the internal market \ncan be identified: i) limited knowledge \ncirculation; ii) limited innovation diffusion; \nand iii) gaps in the quality and efficiency of \nR&I systems (Figure 8-41). When it comes to \n\nthese aspects, current intra-EU disparities are \ncreating hurdles to a fully functioning Single \nMarket and can exacerbate inequalities among \nnational R&I systems, hampering cross-border \ncirculation of R&I activities. While these factors \nhave been analysed throughout this report, this \nsection will summarise their relevance for R&I \nsystem integration into the EU\u2019s Single Market.\n\nFigure 8-41 Barriers for a Single Market related to R&I activities\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: DG Research and Innovation, Chief Economist - R&I Strategy & Foresight Unit\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-41.xlsx\n\nBarriers for a Single Market for R&I\n\nLimited\nknowledge\ncirculation\n\nLimited\ninnovation\ndiffusion\n\nGaps in quality \nand efficiency of \n\nR&I systems\n\nBrain circulation\n\nNeed for reinforced \nopen science\n\nCultural and\ngeographical factors\n\nIndustry concentration\n\nBarriers to exit \n(zombie firms)\n\nCross-border flows of \nR&D subsidies\n\nSkills shortages\n\nFragmented funding\n\nDiscrepancies in \nforward-looking \ngrowth models\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/parti/chapter8/figure-8-41.xlsx\n\n\n564\n\nmobility. Overall, the interactions of these \nfactors contribute to explaining why brain \ncirculation is not benefitting all countries in \nthe EU in the same way, with an emerging \ncore-periphery divide.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd  Open access, free flow of scientific \nand other data \u2013 i.e. open science \u2013 are \na way of strengthening scientific excellence, \nbenefiting from citizen participation, \nachieving better reproducibility of results \nand increasing knowledge circulation and the \nreuse of research data, thereby accelerating \nthe take-up of R&I knowledge and solutions \nand increasing their impact. Limited progress \nacross these dimensions hinders the full \nintegration of European R&I systems and \nthe complete unleashing of spillover benefits \n(see Chapter 6.2 - Knowledge flows).\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Geographical distance still matters for \ninternational R&I collaborations and hence \ncan hamper knowledge circulation between \ndistant entities in the EU, despite virtual \n(remote) collaborations which can help to \nbridge the gap. Cultural differences may also \nhave a detrimental effect on collaboration \nand circulation.\n\nOverall, there are large differences between \nMember States in terms of knowledge flows. \nThere is a clear divide between central and north-\nern, and eastern and southern European coun-\ntries, with the former performing considerably \nbetter. The latest European Research Area Prog-\nress Report 2018 shows that, while progress has \nbeen made, the momentum is slowing down and \nobstacles remain to a well-functioning single \nmarket for knowledge. In particular, these include \ndiscrepancies between Member States in appli-\ncation of the principles of openness, transparen-\ncy and merit-based recruitment in national R&I \nfunding schemes, and the persistence of barriers \nfor researcher recruitment.\n\nBarrier 2. Limited innovation \ndiffusion\n\nAs shown in Chapter 3.1 - Productivity \npuzzle and innovation diffusion, the lack \nof innovation diffusion from leading to \nlaggard regions and firms is stalling \nEurope\u2019s productivity growth. Knowledge \nand innovation do not spread rapidly enough \nacross the EU and laggard economies struggle \nto adopt advanced technologies and business \nprocesses from the technological frontier, \nraising questions about the functioning of the \nSingle Market in these sectors. \n\nIncreasing industry concentration hinders \ninnovation diffusion and suggests that \nrigidities in the product market persist. \nTechnological change or globalisation enables \nthe most-productive firms to expand, raising \nquestions about the potential lack of competition \nand the emergence of quasi monopolies on \ninnovation patterns in the long term. In the \nperiod 2000-2014, three quarters of European \nindustries saw a four percentage points increase \nin concentration of market performance for the \naverage European industry (Bajgar et al., 2019). \nEvidence shows there is a clear divergence in \nproductivity growth performance between \nfrontier firms, which continue to exhibit strong \nproductivity dynamics, and laggards, whose \nproductivity growth is stalling (Andrews et \nal., 2016). Chapter 2 - Changing innovation \ndynamics in the age of digital transformation \ndevelops these new dynamics further.\n\nThe broader effects of the Single Market \nshould help raise the productivity levels \nof Europe\u2019s \u2018less-productive\u2019 (or laggard) \nfirms and boost their returns when they \naccess a larger market for their products \nand/or services. It should also contribute to \nremoving obstacles to innovation diffusion \nacross Europe. However, a yet incomplete \n\n\n\n565\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\ninternal market is hindering Europe\u2019s ability to \nscale up innovations, notably in strategic areas \nsuch as digital or services. This suggests there \nis still room for an adequate policy mix to: \n\n\u00dd\u00dd address the incomplete market and give \ninnovations \u2018born in Europe\u2019 the opportunity \nto scale up and become global players;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd foster EU trade integration, innovation-\nfriendly regulation at the EU and national \nlevel, and integration into value chains for \nless-productive firms.\n\nBarrier 3. Gaps in the quality and \nefficiency of R&I systems\n\nThe quality and efficiency of the overall \nR&I system and governments\u2019 longer-term \ncommitment to investments in intangible \nassets play a fundamental role in boosting \ngrowth in a given country and a key \nrole for mobility choices in the internal \nmarket (European Commission, 2017). There \nare significant gaps and discrepancies in the \nquality of R&I systems across Europe, which \ndirectly affect the cross-border circulation \nof R&I activities. Boosting investment and \nreforms to modernise R&I systems and policies \nacross Europe remains essential to foster \nthe cross-border circulation of R&I activities. \nWhile performance-based research funding35 \nsystems are becoming increasingly important \nas part of countries\u2019 research policy mix, there \nis considerable variation among countries \n(Arnold and Mahieu, 2018). There are also large \ndifferences in the way direct and indirect public \n\n35 Performance-based funding, unlike institutional funding, involves competing for money on a project or mandate basis.\n\nsupport for R&D are used by Member States, \nwith an increasing use of R&D tax incentives by \nsome countries, impacting, and to some extent \ntilting, the EU funding landscape for R&I.\n\nThe Single Market supports the quality \nand efficiency of R&I systems across \nEurope by enabling exchanges of tangible \nassets through trade and FDI, but also of \nintangible assets which include ICT, skills, \neconomic competences and R&D (including the \npositive effects stemming from the mobility \nof scientists, researchers and innovators). \nHowever, there are barriers to cross-border flows \nof R&D subsidies in many national systems and \neven preferential access to subsidies for local \nproviders of R&D services. The cross-border \nportability of R&I funding is limited, with only \na few funding schemes, such as the European \nResearch Council or Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie \nactions, supporting such portability. \n\nOverall, the markets for research funding \nand venture capital are shallow and \nfragmented in the EU. There is insufficient \naccess to risk capital in Europe to support \ninnovation and startup scaleups. Risk and \npatient capital, while recovering, remain \nvery low in comparison to the United States. \nAlthough access to finance has improved \nsignificantly in Europe in recent years, risk \ncapital (in particular for growing and scaling \nup businesses) continues to be scarce and \nsignificant differences persist between Member \nStates in their access to venture capital. \nVenture capital raised in Europe is about one \nfifth of the amount raised in the United States \nwhile the EU funds are more shallow in volume. \n\n\n\n566\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nEfficient and innovation-friendly frame-\nwork conditions are key for business \n investment in innovative activities and \nenable new ideas and technologies to get \nto market. An innovation-friendly business \nenvironment includes efficient product and \nlabour markets, national and local institutions \nable to provide citizens and firms with public \ngoods and services, as well as diffused access \nto finance and smart regulation.\n\nWhile the efficiency of framework con-\nditions in Europe are just shy of the \nbest performers among peer economies, \nsignificant heterogeneity across and within \nMember States can be observed. Different \nindicators of the efficiency of product markets, \nincluding ease of doing business and the degree \nof competition, suggest that a periphery-core \ngap persists, together with substantial within-\ncountries differences for what concerns the \npublic delivery of services and goods and overall \ninstitutional performance.\n\nThe availability of risk finance for \ninnovative investments in Europe has \nimproved compared to the aftermath of \nthe crisis, but remains insufficient to meet \nEU ambitions in a system which is still very \nreliant on bank financing. A comparison with \nthe United States reveals a significant gap in \n\naccess to risk capital, late-stage financing being \none of the key bottlenecks that can constrain \nthe scaling up of European companies. Venture \ncapital funds tend to be smaller, fewer and are \nmostly concentrated in a few Member States, \nnotably among the \u2018innovation leaders\u2019 and the \n\u2018strong innovators\u2019. Nevertheless, the public \nsector is a key player and policy initiatives at \nthe EU level \u2013 e.g. the EIC and Horizon Europe \n\u2013 will contribute to leveraging resources to \nfinance the innovation potential of European \ncompanies and innovators.\n\nThe quality of regulation shapes how \ninnovation outcomes affect social, \nenvironmental and economic targets. \nIn this respect, fulfilling the EU Single Market \nis a key pillar for Europe\u2019s competitiveness \nand for meeting the objectives of sustainable \ngrowth that leaves no one and no place behind, \nwhile respecting environmental boundaries. \nReducing the existing barriers to completion of \nthe Single Market (e.g. still limited knowledge \ncirculation and innovation diffusion, together \nwith persisting gaps in the quality and efficiency \nof R&I systems) will unlock the potential of EU \ninnovation and development. Overall, while \nEurope is progressing towards a fit-for-purpose \nand forward-looking regulatory framework, \nthere are still strong differences between EU \nMember States and the challenges ahead.\n\n\n\n567\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 8\n\n7.

Introduction \n\n1.1  Grand challenges in a policy \ncontext: climate change, SDGs, \nand economic growth\n\nTransformative innovation and systemic \ntransitions are attracting increasing attention \nin the context of three policy problems. First, \naddressing climate change will require radical \ninnovation and low-carbon transition in many \nsystems, as the Commission\u2019s recent climate \nstrategy recognises: \u2018The transition to a net-\nzero greenhouse gas emission economy by \nmid-century will radically transform our energy \nsystem, land and agriculture sector, modernise \nour industrial fabric and our transport systems \nand cities\u2019 (EC, 2018a: 6). \n\nSecond, addressing other grand societal \nchallenges (such as ageing, obesity, energy \nsecurity, urban quality of life, and inequality) \nand the Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs) will require transformative innovations \n\nin health care, agro-food and urban systems, \nas Vice-Presidents Timmermans and Katainen \nnote in the foreword to the Commission\u2019s recent \nReflections Paper: \u2018Sustainable development \nmeans that we need to modernise our \neconomy to embrace sustainable consumption \nand production patterns, to correct the \nimbalances in our food system, and to our \nmobility, the way we produce and use energy, \nand design our buildings on to a sustainable \npath\u2019 (EC, 2019: 3).\n\nThird, low-carbon and sustainability transitions \noffer attractive growth prospects, as the \nCommission\u2019s expert group on green growth \nand jobs concludes: \u2018There is a huge competitive \nopportunity for Europe to ride this \u2018green\u2019 \ntrajectory and turn environmental problems \ninto solutions for promoting investment and \njobs. Such a green direction implies the use of \ntechnological capacities (which the EU has) in \norder to drastically increase the productivity of \n\nSummary\n\nThe aim of the chapter is to present the \nrole of transformative innovation as a new \nparadigm to address many of the most \npressing societal challenges we are facing, \nnotably transition to sustainability and \ncombatting climate change. It elaborates on \nwhat it means for research and innovation \n(R&I) policy and attempts to \u2018operationalise\u2019 \nthese transitions. \n\nThis chapter presents a broader conceptual \nmodel to benefit policies for transformative \ninnovation and grand challenges that goes \n\nbeyond the linear model and innovation \nsystem approaches. The new role for R&I is \nto support socio-economic transformations, \nbut it needs to be complemented with other \npolicies to have a stronger impact. After \nintroducing the socio-technical transitions \nand potential barriers for the uptake of \nthese niche innovations, the final analytical \nsection gives several examples where these \ntransformations have taken place, in both \nenergy and mobility. The chapter closes with \nan extensive overview of policy conclusions.\n\n\n\n575\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nFigure 9-1 Three frames in innovation policy\n\nFraming Key features Policy rationale Policy approaches (examples)\n\nScience and \ntechnology for \n\ngrowth (since 1950s)\n\nLinear innovation model, \ndriven by R&D (research \n\nand development)\n\nAddressing market \nfailures (firms invest \ninsufficiently in R&D \n\nbecause of public good \ncharacter of innovation)\n\nState financing \nof R&D; subsidies \n\nor tax incentives for \nbusiness R&D\n\nNational and sectoral \nsystems of innovation \n\nfor improved \ncompetitiveness \n(since 1980s)\n\nFocus on knowledge \nflows between upstream \n\nactors (universities, \nfirms, agencies)\n\nResponding to system \nfailures, e.g. improving \n\nlinkages between \nactors, addressing \n\ninstitutional problems \n(in laws, property rights, \n\nregulations)\n\nPromoting science \nhubs and science-\n\nindustry collaboration; \neducation and training; \n\ncluster policies\n\nTransformative \nchange to address \ngrand challenges \n\n(since 2010s)\n\nNurture radical \ninnovation and new \n\npathways; shape \ndirectionality of \n\ninnovation\n\nPromote system \ntransformation, \n\nwhich incumbent \nactors are slow or \n\nreluctant to do\n\nMissions and goals \n(SDGs, climate targets), \nassisting new entrants, \ncreating transformative \n\ncoalitions, learning, \nexperimentation\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author's elaboration based on Schot and Steinmueller, 2018\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-1.xlsx\n\nenergy and material resources (which the EU \nonly has in limited quantities). The markets of \nthe future are bound to grow in that direction\u2019 \n(EC, 2016: 11). But to exploit and compete \nglobally in this area, radical innovation should \nbe nurtured: \u2018Europe is relatively strong in \nadding or sustaining value for existing products, \nservices and processes, known as incremental \ninnovation. (\u2026) But Europe needs to do better \nat generating disruptive and breakthrough \ninnovations\u2019 (EC, 2018b: 11).\n\n1.2  Analytical challenges for \ninnovation policy\n\nTransformative innovation and systemic transi-\ntions pose analytical challenges for innovation \npolicy that come in addition to traditional chal-\nlenges. Schot and Steinmueller (2018)  distinguish \nthree frames for innovation policy, which \n respectively focus on stimulating R&D, improv-\ning knowledge flows in innovation systems, and \nstimulating transformation (Figure 9-1). \n\n\n\n576\n\nWhilst the first two frames remain relevant, \ntransformative innovation and systemic \ntransitions involve several new policy \nchallenges.\n\nHorizontal policy coordination\nSystemic transitions go beyond products and \ntechnologies to involve changes in broader \nsocio-technical systems, which refer to all \n\nthe elements that make energy, mobility and \nagro-food systems work (Geels, 2004), as \nschematically represented in Figure 9-2. While \ninnovation policy remains essential, horizontal \ncoordination with other policy domains (e.g. \nlabour markets, competition policy, finance, \nindustry policy, transport/energy/agricultural \npolicy, environmental policy) is crucial to \ntransform entire systems.\n\nSocial, business model and \ninfrastructural innovation\nWhile innovation policy traditionally tends to \nfocus on science and technology, transforming \nentire socio-technical systems involves not \njust radically new technologies, but also social, \nbusiness model and infrastructural innovation \n\n(Bulkeley et al., 2013; Bolton and Foxon, 2015; \nBolton and Hannon, 2016; Hoppe and de \nVries, 2019; Van Waes et al., 2018). Focusing \non environmental sustainability, Figure 9-3 \nprovides some examples of innovations that \nmay create the seeds for low-carbon and \nsustainability transitions.\n\nFigure 9-2 Schematic representation of socio-technical system elements\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Geels, 2004: 900\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-2.xlsx\n\nPRODUCTION\nAPPLICATION DOMAIN,\nTECHNOLOGY\rIN\rUSE\n\nTransfer of knowledge\n(education)\n\nScientific\nknowledge\n\nLabour/\nhuman resources\n\nProduction\nof artefactsTechnological/\n\ndesign knowledge\n\nCapital\n(money)\n\nTools/machines\n\nNatural\nresources/parts\n\nRegulation which\nproduces \u2018trust\u2019\n(quality norms,\nproperty rights, laws)\n\nDistribution\n(networks/\nmarkets/\ninfrastructure)\n\nUse of artefacts\nin user practice\n\nComplementary artefacts\n(possibly linked into\na technical system)\n\nFacilities for\nrepair/maintenance\n\nCultural\nmeaning\n\n\n\n577\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nFigure 9-3 Examples of radical innovations in mobility, \nagro-food and the energy domain\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author's elaboration based on Bulkeley et al., 2013; Bolton and Foxon, 2015; Bolton and Hannon, 2016; Hoppe and de \nVries, 2019; Van Waes et al., 2018\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-3.xlsx\n\nMobility Agro-food Energy (electricity, heat)\n\nRadical technical \ninnovation\n\nBattery-electric vehicles, \n(plug-in) hybrid electric \nvehicles, biofuel cars, \nself-driving vehicles\n\nPermaculture, agro-\necology, artificial meat, \n\nplant-based milk, \nmanure digestion\n\nRenewable electricity \n(wind, solar, biomass, \nhydro), heat pumps, \n\npassive house , biomass \nstoves, smart meters\n\nGrass-roots and social \ninnovation\n\nCar sharing, bike clubs, \nmodal shift to bicycles \n\nand buses, tele-working, \ntele-conferencing\n\nAlternative food \nnetworks, organic food, \n\u2018less meat\u2019 initiatives, \n\nurban farming\n\nDecentralised energy \nproduction (\u2018prosumers\u2019), \n\ncommunity energy, \nenergy caf\u00e9s\n\nBusiness model \ninnovation\n\nMobility services, car \nsharing, bike sharing\n\nAlternative food \nnetworks, organic food\n\nEnergy service \ncompanies, back-up \n\ncapacity for electricity \nprovision, vehicle-to-grid \n\nelectricity provision\n\nInfra-structural \ninnovation\n\nIntermodal transport \nsystems, compact \n\ncities, revamped urban \ntransport systems (tram, \n\nlight-rail, metro)\n\nEfficient irrigation \nsystem, agro-forestry, \n\nrewilding, multi-\nfunctional land use\n\nDistrict heating systems, \nsmart grids, bio-\n\nmethane in reconfigured \ngas grid\n\nWider set of actors and coalitions\nWhile innovation policy traditionally has \nan \u2018upstream\u2019 focus (on knowledge flows \nbetween universities, firms, policymakers), \nthe implication of the previous two points is \nthat transformative innovation and transition \nprocesses require the involvement of a wider \nset of actors. The inclusion of new entrants, \nlike start-up companies, cities, communities, \ncitizens and NGOs, may help to create \ntransformative coalitions that think out of the \nbox and drive transitions (Diercks et al., 2019; \nMarletto et al., 2016; S\u00f6derholm et al., 2019; \nSteward, 2012).\n\nEU policy discussions already recognise this \nidea, which underpins the notion of \u2018open in-\nnovation\u2019. For example, the European Com-\nmission\u2019s RISE group (research, innovation and \nscience experts) notes that: \u2018Traditionally, ad-\ndressing societal challenges has been primari-\nly a 'supply-pushed' concern with the research \ncommunity playing a central role. (\u2026) Imple-\nmentation in terms of innovation has, however, \noften been disappointing. Typically, users and \nmore broadly the demand side, has been in-\nsufficiently involved in the design and develop-\nment of innovative ways to address those \nsocietal, global challenges\u2019 (EC, 2017a: 160). \n\n\n\n578\n\nThe RISE group therefore recommends that: \u2018It \nwill be crucial to break open the current sup-\nply-side research dominance in addressing \nsocietal challenges, which has sometimes cor-\nnered the discussion and debates to technic-\nal debates about measurement, evidence and \nmethodologies\u2019 (EC, 2017a: 160).\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Lamy report similarly calls \nfor wider stakeholder engagement: \u2018As part of \na coherent innovation policy, EU policymakers \nshould be required to regularly identify, in \ndialogue with stakeholders and citizens, how \nand what innovation can help them more easily \nachieve their objectives\u2019 (EC, 2017b: 12). \u2018Fully \nmobilising and involving stakeholders, end-users \nand citizens in the post-2020 EU R&I programme, \nfor instance in defining its missions, will not only \nincrease the degree of co-creation, it will also \nmaximise its impact and stimulate a stronger \ndemand for innovative products and services \nas well as a better grasp of social changes. This \nwill bring open science and open innovation to \nthe next level and turn Europe into a continental \nliving innovation lab\u2019 (EC, 2017b: 19).\n\nVisions and missions to create drive and \ndirectionality\nWhile innovation policy traditionally focuses on \nrates of innovation, transformative innovation \nis also about directionality since sustainability \ntransitions aim to solve particular problems and \nreach particular goals (e.g. 80-90 % reduction \nof greenhouse gas emissions by 2050). Recent \ndebates about mission-oriented innovation \npolicy emphasise the importance of inspiring \nvisions which provide long-term directionality and \nchallenging, yet doable missions that formulate \nmore specific targets (which enable accountability) \nand are accompanied by financial instruments \n(that enable concrete action) (Mazzucato, 2018).\n\nDiffusion\nWhile innovation policy tends to focus on the \nemergence of new ideas and innovations \n(R&D), transformation and system transitions \nonly happen when radical innovations actually \ndiffuse into markets and society, which \nincludes embedding in business, user, civil \nsociety and policy environments (Deuten et al., \n1997; Kanger et al., 2019; Mylan et al., 2019), \nas schematically represented in Figure 9-4.\n\nFigure 9-4 Relevant environments for new products and practices\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Adapted from Deuten et al., 1997: 134\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-4.xlsx\n\nBusiness\nenvironment\n\nNew\nproduct\n\nPolicy\nenvironment\n\nUser\nenvironment\n\nWider\npublics,\nculture\n\n\n\n579\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nThese five challenges suggest that policies for \ntransformative innovation and grand challenges \ncould benefit from a broader conceptual \nmodel that goes beyond the linear model and \ninnovation system approaches (Figure 9-1). \nSection 2 describes such a conceptual model, \nwhich provides a big-picture understanding \nof core processes and mechanisms in \nsystemic transitions. The so-called multi-level \nperspective provides a general framework, \nwhich has been tested and refined with dozens \nof historical case studies, including shifts from \ncesspools to sewer systems, from horse-drawn \ntransport to automobiles, from sailing ships to \n\nsteamships, from traditional factories to mass \nproduction (Geels and Schot, 2007). It has also \nbeen widely applied to low-carbon transitions \n(Geels et al., 2016, 2017; Moradi and Vagoni, \n2018; Berkeley et al., 2018) and has become \na core framework in studies of sustainability \ntransitions (Smith et al., 2010; K\u00f6hler et al., \n2019). Section 3 empirically illustrates this \nmodel with three case studies of sustainability \ntransitions: the German electricity transition, \nAustrian biomass district heating, and French \ntram systems. Section 4 discusses the five \npolicy challenges in the three cases and ends \nwith policy messages.\n\n2.  Multi-level perspective on socio-technical \ntransitions\n\n2.1 Basic concepts\n\nDrawing on evolutionary economics, the \nsociology of innovation, and institutional theory, \nthe multi-level perspective (Geels, 2002; 2004; \nSmith et al., 2010) suggests that transitions \ncome about through the interplay between \nprocesses at niche, regime and landscape levels. \n\nRadical innovations tend to emerge in \nsmall niches at the periphery of existing \nsystems, through the pioneering activities of \nentrepreneurs, startups, activists or other relative \noutsiders (Van de Poel, 2000; Schot and Geels, \n2008). Niche innovations like those in Figure 9-3 \nare \u2018radical\u2019 because they deviate from existing \nsystems on technical, social, business model or \ninfrastructural dimensions, which also implies \nthey often cannot survive mainstream selection \npressures. Niches therefore act as \u2018protected \nspaces\u2019 that shelter radical innovations in early \nphases and nurture learning and development \nprocesses (Smith and Raven, 2012). \n\nSince radical innovations are often enacted by \nnew entrants, they may entail organisational \ninnovation and new business models (Bolton \nand Hannon, 2016; Van Waes et al., 2018), \nimplying changes in the ways that firms \nappropriate value from their activities. \nBusiness model innovation may be risky and \nchallenging, as the ongoing struggles of Tesla \nand Uber to become profitable suggest. Niches \nmay also nurture social innovations and grass-\nroots innovations, although actors, motivations, \nand forms of protection may be different \nthan those for market-based innovation \n(Figure 9-5). Grass-roots innovations include \nchanges in social practices and lifestyle \nand using technologies (see Figure 9-3 for \nexamples), which are typically enacted by \nvolunteers and activists (Seyfang and Smith, \n2007; Hargreaves et al., 2013), foreground \nmoral values and collective aspirations, and \nare highly contextual, often developed in \nresponse to local problems (Hossain, 2018). \nFigure 9-5 summarises some of the differences \n\n\n\n580\n\nbetween grass-roots innovations and market-\nbased innovations. Despite these differences, \ntemporal developments of both types of \ninnovation can be analysed with strategic \nniche management categories (learning, \nnetwork building, visioning), although specific \nmechanisms vary (as discussed in section 2.2).\n\nRadical niche innovations face uphill struggles \nagainst existing energy, agro-food and \nmobility systems, which are stabilised by the \nalignments between technologies, policies, \nuser patterns, infrastructures and cultural \ndiscourses (Figure 9-2), that were created in \nprevious decades. Elements of existing systems \nare reproduced, maintained and incrementally \nimproved by incumbent actors, such as firms, \nengineers, users, policymakers and special-\ninterest groups. The perceptions and actions of \nthese social groups are shaped by entrenched \nshared rules and institutions, called socio-\ntechnical regimes (Geels, 2004; Fuenfschilling \nand Truffer, 2014). Innovation in existing \nsystems and regimes is mostly incremental \nand path-dependent because of various lock-\nin mechanisms (Klitkou et al., 2015):\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Techno-economic lock-in mechanisms: a) sunk \ninvestments (in competencies, factories, \ninfrastructures) that create vested interests \n\nagainst transitional change; b) low-cost and \nhigh-performance characteristics of existing \ntechnologies due to economies of scale and \ndecades of learning-by-doing improvements.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Social and cognitive lock-in mechanisms: \na) routines, shared mindsets and core \ncapabilities that \u2018blind\u2019 firms and other actors \nto developments outside their focus (Leonard-\nBarton, 1992; Nelson, 2008); b) \u2018social \ncapital\u2019 resulting from alignments between \nsocial groups; organisations develop \u2018webs \nof interdependent relationships with buyers, \nsuppliers, and financial backers\u2019 (Tushman \nand Romanelli, 1985: 177), which may be \ndifficult to change; c) user practices and \nlifestyles which have been organised around \nparticular technologies (Shove, 2003).\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Institutional and political lock-in mechanisms: \na) existing regulations and policy networks \nfavour incumbents and create an uneven \nplaying field (Walker, 2000); b) vested \ninterests use their access to policy networks \nto water down regulatory change and hinder \nradical innovation (Hess, 2016).\n\nBecause of their commitments to existing socio-\ntechnical systems and regimes, incumbent \norganisations (like coal, oil, and agro-food \n\nFigure 9-5 Comparing the characteristics of market-based and grass-roots innovations\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Seyfang and Smith, 2007: 92\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-5.xlsx\n\nMarket-based innovations Grass-roots innovations\nContext Market economy Social economy\nDriving force Profit: Schumpeterian rent Social need; ideological\n\nNiche \nprotection\n\nMarket rules are different: tax and \nsubsidies temporarily shelter novelty \nfrom full market forces\n\nValues are different: alternative social and \ncultural expressions enabled within the niche\n\nOrganisational \nform\n\nFirms\nVoluntary associations, co-ops, informal \ncommunity groups\n\nResource base Income from commercial activity\nGrant funding, voluntary input, mutual \nexchanges, limited commercial activity\n\n\n\n581\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\ncompanies) tend to oppose sustainability \ntransitions (Geels, 2014) or prefer incremental, \nefficiency-oriented changes (e.g. direct fuel \ninjection in car engines or \u2018clean coal\u2019 power \nplants). Nevertheless, incumbent firms can \n(often gradually) reorient to address social or \nenvironmental problems (Penna and Geels, 2015) \nif they are stimulated by attractive financial \nincentives, forced by legislation or pushed by \npublic opinion, especially when scandals (like \n\u2018Dieselgate\u2019) erode their social legitimacy. \n\nNiche and regime actors operate in wider secular \ncontexts (called \u2018socio-technical landscapes\u2019), \nwhich accommodate both gradual changes \n\n(e.g. demographics, political ideologies, macro- \neconomic trends) and shocks (e.g. accidents, \noil crises, wars, recessions) (Van Driel and \nSchot, 2005). \n\nAlthough transition specifics vary between \ndomains and countries, the general dynamic \nis that: a) niche innovations gradually build \nup internal momentum; b) changes at the \nlandscape level create pressure on the system \nand regime; and c) destabilisation of the regime \ncreates windows of opportunity for niche \ninnovations, which then diffuse and disrupt \n(parts of) the existing system (Figure 9-6).\n\nFigure 9-6 Multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Substantially adapted from Geels, 2002: 1 263\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-6.xlsx\n\nSocio-technical\nlandscape\n(exogenous\ncontext)\n\nSocio-\ntechnical\nsystem\n\nNiche\ninnovations\n\nPhase 1\n(experimentation)\n\nPhase 2\n(stabilisation)\n\nPhase 3\n(diffusion, disruption)\n\nPhase 4\n(institutionalisation, anchoring)\n\nTime\n\nLandscape developments\nput pressure on existing system,\n\nwhich opens up,\ncreating windows\n\nof opportunity for niche \ninnovations.\n\nTechnology\n\nSocio-technical system is locked in. \nSystem elements change\nincrementally along trajectories.\n\nDimensions become aligned,\nand stabilise in a dominant design.\nInternal momentum increases because of\nprice/performance improvements, support\nfrom powerful actors, shared visions.\n\nNew entrants pioneer radical innovations on fringe of existing system.\nHigh degree of uncertainty, trial and error, entry and exit.\nLearning processes occur on multiple dimensions (technology, markets,\nconsumer practices, cultural meaning, infrastructure requirements).\n\nRadical innovation breaks through, taking\nadvantage of \u2018windows of opportunity\u2019. \nThis triggers adjustments in socio-technical system.\n\nMarket, user\npreferences\n\nIndustry\nScience\n\nPolicy\n\nCulture\n\nExternal\ninfluences\non niche\ndynamics.\n\nNew system\ninfluences landscape\n\n\n\n582\n\n2.2  Core processes in different phases \nof socio-technical transitions\n\nSocio-technical transitions take several \ndecades and can be divided into four phases \nwith different challenges and core activities. \nFor the first phase, the niche development \nliterature distinguishes three core processes \n(Kemp et al., 1998; Schot and Geels, 2008): \na) experimentation and trial-and-error learning \nabout the techno-economic performance, socio-\ncultural acceptance and political feasibility \nof radical innovations; b) building of social \nnetworks and transformative coalitions of actors \nwho are willing to develop, nurture and protect \nthe innovation; and c) the articulation of positive \nvisions that provide direction for innovation \nprocesses and attract wider attention.\n\nWhile there are presently many sustainability \nexperiments (Sengers et al., 2019), urban \nprojects (Bulkeley et al., 2016), and local \ngrass-roots initiative projects (Pesch et al., \n2019), which act as concrete carriers of \nniche innovations, an important challenge is \nto \u2018overcome the current fragmentation of \ninitiatives, and their tendency to remain isolated \nor short-lived, which ultimately reduces their \npotential for lasting and wide-ranging change\u2019 \n(Turnheim et al., 2018: 237). In addition, niche \ninnovations initially face other challenges \nsuch as being more expensive than existing \ntechnologies, the absence of \u2018ready-made\u2019 \nmarkets, and social acceptance problems due \nto unfamiliarity (\u2018liability of newness\u2019). \n\nBecause grass-roots innovations rely on \nvoluntary commitments, they are also vulnerable \nto the departure of key champions and a high \nturnover of volunteers (Hargreaves et al., 2013). \nGrass-roots innovations may also experience \ndifficulties in securing funding because activists \nmay lack either the professional skills to apply \nfor such funding (e.g. proposal writing, reporting, \nfinancial accountability) or the desire to deal \nwith bureaucratic procedures (Hossain, 2018). \n\nIn the second phase, niche innovations begin to \nstabilise because: a) they establish a foothold \nin small market niches which creates a flow \nof resources for ongoing innovation activities; \nb) the articulation of codified design rules, \ntechnical models, standards, consumer \npreferences, and policies, which reduce \nuncertainties (Geels and Raven, 2006); and \nc) the creation of communities that share \nexperiences and support dedicated aggregation \nactivities by intermediary actors such as \nindustry associations, engineering communities \nor innovation agencies (Hargreaves et al., 2013; \nKivimaa et al., 2019). These socio-cognitive \nactivities help to gradually stabilise innovation \ntrajectories (Figure 9-7).\n\nAggregation and cumulative learning among \nprojects may be more difficult for grass-roots \nmovements (GMs) which tend to \u2018engage \nin informal learning, mainly due to a lack of \nintermediary actors. Most GMs do not document \ntheir tacit knowledge, such as the institutional \nlearning, skills, and training that their members \npossess\u2019 (Hossain, 2018: 67). The variability \nand context-specificity of local projects may \nalso complicate the articulation of \u2018best \npractice\u2019 lessons. And grass-roots activists \nmay resist codification and mainstreaming if \nthis involves the loss of particular values that \ninspired initial initiatives (Smith, 2012). \n\nIn the third phase, the radical innovation diffuses \nmore widely, which includes embedding in \nvarious environments (Figure 9-4). Internal \ndrivers of diffusion are: a) price/performance \nimprovements, due to learning-by-doing, scale \neconomies, and complementary innovations \n(Arthur, 1994); b) consumer interest and \nadoption; c) business investments in production \nfacilities, supply chains, infrastructure; d) policies \nand institutional change which may shape \nmarkets, consumer adoption and business \nconfidence (King and Pearce, 2010); and e) \npositive cultural discourses which may shape \nconsumer preferences and political support \n\n\n\n583\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nFigure 9-7 Innovation trajectory emerging from sequences of local projects\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Adapted from Geels and Raven, 2006: 379\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-7.xlsx\n\nCodified,\nfield-level\nknowledge\n\nSituated, tacit\nknowledge in\nlocal projects\n\nShared rules (problem agendas, search heuristics,\nexpectations, abstract theories, technical models)\n\nEmerging\ntechnological\ntrajectory\n\nAggregation\nlearningFraming,\n\ncoordinating\n\n(Lounsbury and Glynn, 2001). But diffusion \ncan also be facilitated by external landscape \ndevelopments that destabilise the existing \nregime (Turnheim and Geels, 2012) and thus \ncreate \u2018windows of opportunity\u2019 for diffusing \ninnovations (represented by diverging arrows in \nFigure 9-6). \n\nThe third phase is often full of struggles such as: \neconomic competition between new and existing \ntechnologies; business struggles between new \nentrants and incumbents, which may lead to \nthe downfall or reorientation of existing firms \n(Christensen, 1997); political conflicts and power \nstruggles over adjustments in subsidies, taxes \nand regulations (Meadowcroft, 2009); and \ndiscursive struggles about problem framing and \n(dis)advantages of particular innovations and \ntransition pathways (Rosenbloom et al., 2016). \nThere is no guarantee that niche innovations \ninevitably win these struggles. Radical \ninnovations may fail to build up sufficient \n\nendogenous momentum or suffer setbacks. \nTensions in existing regimes may be contained, \nsuch that windows of opportunity for niche \ninnovations do not (sufficiently) materialise. \nOr incumbent actors may successfully \ncounter-mobilise and thwart niche innovations \n(Geels, 2014). \n\nIn the fourth phase, the new socio-technical \nsystem replaces the old one and becomes \ninstitutionalised in regulatory programmes, \nindustry structures, habits of use, views of \nnormality, professional standards, and training \nprogrammes. \u2018Whole system\u2019 transitions are \nnot about single technologies (e.g. renewable \nenergy) \u2013 they also involve complementary \ninnovations (e.g. smart meters, energy \nstorage), infrastructure adjustment (e.g. smart \ngrids, bidirectional flows), new business models \n(e.g. capacity markets), and user practices (e.g. \ndemand response, self-generation) (McMeekin \net al., 2019).\n\n\n\n584\n\n3.  Empirical examples\n\nThree brief case studies aim to illustrate the \nsocio-technical transition perspective: the \nGerman electricity transition (1986-2016), \nAustrian biomass district heating systems \n(1970-2013), and French urban tram systems \n(1971-2016). The three cases were chosen \nbecause they all became linked to grand \nchallenges (e.g. climate change, urban quality \nof life), had economic growth and export \nimplications, transformed entire systems, \ninvolved multiple actors, activities and \ndimensions (techno-economic, social, political, \ncultural), and are longitudinal processes that \nprogressed through several phases. Because \nof their complexity, the case studies are not \ncomprehensive but selectively emphasise parts \nof the theoretical perspective. The German \nelectricity transition emphasises multi-level \ninteractions, showcasing how niche innovations \ncan disrupt the existing regime in the context \nof landscape developments and shocks. The \nAustrian and French cases focus more on the \nemergence and diffusion of niche innovations, \nshowcasing two different kinds of niche-regime \ninteractions. Although Austrian biomass district \nheating systems were initially pioneered by new \nentrants, incumbent regime actors reoriented \nin later phases and their involvement further \naccelerated diffusion. French tram systems, \nin contrast, were developed by incumbent \nregime actors (transport ministry and railway \nindustry) from the start, and subsequently \ninvolved new entrants (particularly cities and \nentrepreneurial mayors) in local deployment. \nBoth cases emphasise learning processes, \nknowledge stabilisation, changing visions and \nsocial networks.\n\n3.1  German electricity transition \n(1986-2016)\n\nElectricity from renewable energy technologies \n(RETs) in Germany increased from 3.6 % \nin 1990 to 29.0 % in 2016, while nuclear \nenergy and hard coal declined substantially \n(Figure 9-8). Natural gas increased until 2010, \nthen declined, before bouncing back in 2016, \nwhile brown coal declined between 1990-2000 \nand then fluctuated. This unfolding supply-side \nenergy transition provides a good illustration \nof the multi-level perspective.\n\nIn the first period (1986-1998), niche innov-\nations were nurtured in the context of a stable \nregime. Wind turbines and solar PV were \nsupported by R&D programmes introduced \nafter the 1970s\u2019 oil crises, but deployment \nremained limited in the 1980s because of poor \nperformance and high costs (Jacobsson and \nLauber, 2006). The 1986 Chernobyl accident \nwas a landscape shock that stimulated some \ndeployment of wind turbines by new entrants \nsuch as environmentally motivated citizens, \nfarmers, and anti-nuclear activists who wanted \nto demonstrate the feasibility of alternatives. \nThe accident also created negative public \nattitudes towards nuclear power, which \nwas supported, however, by successive \nConservative-Liberal governments.\n\n\n\n585\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nProposals for RET market support were \ndefeated in parliament, although the 1991 \nproposal succeed \u2018by accident\u2019 as the \ngovernment was preoccupied with German \nreunification (Jacobsson and Lauber, 2006). \nIt was not expected that the resulting Feed-in \nLaw would have major effects and, in 1994, \nthe Environment Minister Angela Merkel \nthought it unlikely that Germany would ever \ngenerate more than 4 % renewable electricity \n(Lauber and Jacobsson, 2016). However, the \nFeed-in Law, which obliged utilities to purchase \nrenewable electricity at 90 % of the retail price, \nmade onshore wind deployment economically \nfeasible and stimulated significant deployment \nin the 1990s (Figure 9-9). The success of \n\nGerman turbine manufacturers (Enercon, \nHusumer Schiffswerft, Tacke) also attracted \nindustrial policy support in the peripheral \nregions of Northern Germany, which expanded \nthe RET advocacy coalition (Geels et al., 2016). \n\nTo hinder RETs, incumbent utilities lobbied the \ngovernment which, in 1997, proposed to reduce \nfeed-in tariffs. But public protests by the RET \nadvocacy coalition (including environmental \ngroups, solar and wind associations, metal- \nand machine workers, farmer groups and \nchurch groups) led to the rejection of the \nproposal by the German parliament and the \ncontinued protection of RETs (Jacobsson and \nLauber, 2006).\n\nFigure 9-8 German electricity generation by source, 1990-2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: AG Energiebilanzen\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-8.xlsx\n\nLignite\n\nNuclear\n\nHard coal\n\nNatural\ngas\n\nOil\n\nRenewables\n\nOther\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nEl\nec\n\ntr\nic\n\nit\ny \n\nge\nne\n\nra\nti\n\non\n b\n\ny \nfu\n\nel\n t\n\nyp\ne \n\n(%\n)\n\n19\n90\n\n19\n91\n\n19\n92\n\n19\n93\n\n19\n94\n\n19\n95\n\n19\n96\n\n19\n97\n\n19\n98\n\n19\n99\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n01\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n03\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n06\n\n20\n07\n\n20\n08\n\n20\n09\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n11\n\n20\n12\n\n20\n13\n\n20\n14\n\n20\n15\n\n20\n16\n\n\n\n586\n\nIn the second period (1998-2009), the election \nof a \u2018Red-Green\u2019 coalition government between \nthe Social Democratic Party and the Green Party \n(1998-2005) was another landscape shock, which \ndisrupted the cosy regime-level relations between \nutilities and policymakers (Geels et al., 2016). The \nnew government decided to phase out nuclear \nenergy and support RETs with the Renewable \nEnergy Act (EEG, 2000), which guaranteed fixed, \npremium payments for renewable electricity over \na 20-year period, with tariffs varying with the \nmaturity of the technology. \n\nRenewable electricity subsequently diffused \nrapidly from 6.6 % in 2000 to 15.9 % in \n2009 (Figure 9-8) because of reinforcing \ndevelopments in multiple environments:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the policy environment, generous and \nstable feed-in tariffs created attractive \nmarket opportunities.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the business environment, new entrants \n(like households, farmers, municipal utilities, \nproject developers and other industries) \n\ndominated RET deployment, while the \nincumbent utilities produced only 6.5 % of \nrenewable electricity in 2010 (Figure 9-10). \nThe very rapid diffusion of solar PV after \n2006 (Figure 9-9) was unforeseen and driven \nby feed-in tariffs that far exceeded generation \ncost as the price of solar PV panels fell \nrapidly. This stimulated strong interest from \nhouseholds, who deployed small-scale rooftop \nPV systems, and from farmers, who deployed \nlarge-scale roof- and field-mounted systems \n(Dewald and Truffer, 2011). Solar PV became \nan industrial success story as total sales for \nthe German PV industry grew from EUR 201 \nmillion in 2000 to EUR 7 billion in 2008.

By the mid-2000s, the big-4 \nwere investing in new coal- and gas-fired power \n\nplants to meet expected growth in demand (Kungl \nand Geels, 2018). They also focused on European \nand global expansions, which boosted growth and \nstock prices (Figure 9-11). After years of lobbying, \nthe utilities also scored a political victory when \nthe newly elected (2009) Conservative-Liberal \ngovernment decided to overturn the earlier \nnuclear phase-out decision.\n\nFigure 9-10 Ownership of installed capacity of different renewable electricity \ntechnologies in Germany in 2010 (%)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Klaus Novy Institut, 2011\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-10.xlsx\n\nHouse-\nholds Farmers\n\nBanks, \nfunds\n\nProject \ndevel-\nopers\n\nMunicipal \nutilities Industry\n\nFour \nmajor \n\nutilities\nOthers\n\nWind 51.5 1.8 15.5 21.3 3.4 2.3 2.1 2.2\nBiogas 0.1 71.5 6.2 13.1 3.1 0.1 0.1 5.7\nBiomass 2.0 0 3.0 6.9 24.3 41.5 9.6 12.7\n\nSolar PV 39.3 21.2 8.1 8.3 2.6 19.2 0.2 1.1\n\n\n\n588\n\nIn the third period (2009-2016), RETs further \ndiffused thanks to feed-in-tariffs, positive \ndiscourses and declining RET prices. The price \nof PV modules, for instance, decreased by more \nthan 65 % between 2007 and 2011 as a result \nof scale economies in Chinese production, \noversupply, and price dumping (Goodrich et al., \n2013). RET diffusion was also facilitated by \nanother landscape shock (the 2011 Fukushima \naccident) which destabilised the regime as the \ngovernment performed a U-turn and reintroduced \nthe nuclear phase-out, with a target date of \n2022. The government also adopted an official \nenergy transition policy (Energiewende) that \nincluded ambitious future targets for renewable \nelectricity (35 % by 2020, 40-45 % by 2025, 55-\n60 % by 2035 and 80 % by 2050).\n\nThe existing regime destabilised and \nexperienced various problems during this \nperiod (Geels et al., 2016): a) the expansion \nof renewables reduced the market share of \nexisting fossil plants and decreased wholesale \n\nelectricity prices because of the \u2018merit \norder effect\u2019 (solar PV and wind, with low \nmarginal costs, were dispatched first in power \ngeneration); b) the aftermath of the financial \ncrisis (another landscape shock) depressed \neconomic activity and reduced electricity \ndemand, which eroded the economic viability \nof newly built fossil plants; and c) the nuclear \nphase-out decision implied write-off costs. \nThese developments reduced net incomes of \nthe big-4 utilities after 2011 (Figure 9-12) and \ncreated doubts about the viability of traditional \nbusiness models. Consequently, incumbent \nutilities began strategic reorientation activities \n(Kung and Geels, 2018). In 2014, E.ON split into \ntwo companies: one focused on renewables, \ndistribution grids and service activities, the \nother holding conventional assets in large-scale \nelectricity production and trading activities. \nIn 2015, Vattenfall put up its German lignite \nactivities for sale. And in 2015, RWE announced \nplans to separate its renewables, grid and retail \nbusiness into a new sub-company.\n\nFigure 9-12 Net profits of the big-4 utilities in Germany, 1998-2015\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Kungl and Geels, 2018: 79\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-12.xlsx\n\n2 000\n\n4 000\n\n6 000\n\n8 000\n\n10 000\n\n12 000\n\n14 000\n\n16 000\n\n0\n\n19\n98\n\n19\n99\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n01\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n03\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n06\n\n20\n07\n\n20\n08\n\n20\n09\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n11\n\n20\n12\n\n20\n13\n\n20\n14\n\n20\n15\n\nE.ON\n\nRWE\n\nEnBW\n\nVattenfall AB\n\nEU\nR \n\nm\nill\n\nio\nn\n\n\n\n589\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nThe diffusion of RETs also experienced several \nunforeseen problems (Geels et al., 2016): a) many \nGerman PV manufacturers went bankrupt because \nof Chinese competition, which eroded the salience \nof the green growth discourse; b) the deployment \nof renewables (especially solar PV) increased \nEEG (Renewable Energy Act) surcharges from 1.3 \neurocents/kWh in 2009 to 6.24 eurocents/kWh in \n2014, making German retail electricity prices the \nhighest in Europe; c) these increasing surcharges \nprovided ammunition for political opposition \nfrom utilities and the Economics Ministry; and \nd) intermittent renewables threatened grid \nstability and increased price volatility, leading to \nnegative prices on sunny, windy days when supply \nexceeded demand. \n\nThese RET-related problems and the economic \nproblems of utilities (which were seen as \n\u2018too big to fail\u2019) led to government efforts to \nslow RET expansion and increase support for \nthe utilities: a) feed-in tariffs were reduced in \n\nseveral rounds (Hoppmann et al., 2014); b) from \n2017 onwards, feed-in tariffs were replaced by \na bidding system for target capacity (which \nrequired capabilities and resources that suited \nbig players); and c) offshore wind deployment \nwas stimulated, which provided attractive \ndiversification opportunities for incumbents \nbecause of size and cost structures.\n\n3.2  Biomass district heating systems \nin Austria (1970-2013)\n\nBiomass district heating (BMDH) is a complex \nsocio-technical system that uses pellets and \nwaste wood from Austria\u2019s abundant forests as \ninput for generating heat in boilers which is then \ndisseminated through piped infrastructures and \nextracted by heat exchangers in target buildings \n(houses, schools, hospitals). Austrian BMDH \nsystems emerged in the early 1970s, stabilised \nand slowly diffused between 1986-2002, and \nrapidly expanded after 2002 (Figure 9-13).\n\nFigure 9-13 Annual heat production from Austrian BMDH, 1970-2013\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Statistik Austria, 2015\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-13.xlsx\n\nTW\nh\n\n19\n70\n\n19\n72\n\n19\n74\n\n19\n76\n\n19\n78\n\n19\n80\n\n19\n82\n\n19\n84\n\n19\n86\n\n19\n88\n\n19\n90\n\n19\n92\n\n19\n94\n\n19\n96\n\n19\n98\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n06\n\n20\n08\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n12\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\n\n590\n\nThe first period (1970-1986) was characterised \nby local tinkering with BMDH systems by new \nentrants such as sawmill owners, carpenters, \nmonasteries and agricultural cooperatives which \nutilised wood residues and imported boilers \n(from Sweden) to provide heat services to nearby \nbuildings. Farmers, who often own forests in \nAustria, teamed up in cooperatives to address \nhigh investment costs and to pool resources such \nas time, skills and fuel (Seiwald, 2014). Installers, \noperators and local plumbers lacked engineering \nskills and experience, leading to design mistakes \nand over-dimensioning in early BMDH systems \n(Madlener, 2007). In this early niche development \nphase, plant operators shared little information \nand were secretive about operational problems. \nThere was limited feedback to technology \nsuppliers and no institutionalised learning or \nperformance evaluation.\n\nThe second period (1986-2002) saw slow but \nsteady growth of these small- to medium-\nscale, village, heat-only system (400 kWth to \n1 MWth), enhanced interactions and informal \nknowledge exchange among BMDH innovators, \nand increasing interest and support from \nagricultural policymakers who saw BMDH as \na means for regional revitalisation, providing \nopportunities for alternative incomes in agro-\nforestry. Provincial energy agencies and the \nnewly created Austrian Biomass Association \nacted as intermediary organisations which \ncollected and compared local operating \nexperiences, formulated generic lessons and \ninsights and organised workshops to facilitate \nnetwork building and disseminate more \ncodified knowledge (Geels and Johnson, 2018). \nEnergy agencies in pioneering provinces (Lower \nAustria, Styria) also provided training and \nfinancial support for BMDH developers, assisted \nby heat-mapping exercises, and advised in \nBMDH construction via \u2018technology introduction \nmanagers\u2019 (Rakos, 1995). BMDH also benefitted \nfrom regional innovation policies that supported \nresearch and product development in the fields \nof energy efficiency and renewable energy \n\nsources. \u2018Research and development in energy \ntechnology has a long and strong tradition in \nAustria and has been successful in creating \nworld-class industries, e.g. for small-scale \nbiomass boilers\u2019 (IEA, 2014). \n\nEarly diffusion in this second period was driven \nby developments in multiple environments:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the business environment, learning-\nby-doing and dedicated aggregation \nactivities gradually reduced operational \nproblems and improved techno-economic \nperformance. Dedicated supply chains for \nbiomass, pellet boilers and prefabricated \nheat pipes emerged in the 1990s (Kalt and \nKranzl, 2009) which, in turn, stimulated \nspecialisation and innovation. \n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the user environment, local residents \nbegan to switch to BMDH, which was slightly \nmore expensive than traditional stoves (that \nburned biomass, coal or oil) but offered \ngreater comfort and convenience, e.g. \ncontinuous heat without smoke emissions \nand no need for storage space and manual \nhandling of fuel (Seiwald, 2014). The \nswitch to BMDH required few adjustments \nin user skills and routines, although \nconsumers did experience some difficulties \nin understanding the bills for heat services, \nparticularly the addition of service charges \n(for recovery of fixed costs, maintenance \nand metering) besides consumption-based \ncharges (Metschina, 2014). To stimulate \nuse among local farmers, municipalities \nalso began to adopt BMDH to heat public \nbuildings, such as schools, town halls, \nhospitals and swimming pools.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the policy environment, in the early 1990s, \nthe federal Ministry of Agriculture started to \ncomplement provincial BMDH support which \nled to subsidies and capital grants that \ncould amount to 60 % of investment costs \n(Geels and Johnson, 2018). This reduced \n\n\n\n591\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nthe commercial risks for BMDH system \nbuilders and operators. From the mid-\n1990s, the Environmental Promotion Fund \nalso provided support for BMDH.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd While narratives in the public sphere initially \nframed BMDH as a potential response \nto rural problems (e.g. unemployment, \ndeclining industrial base and depopulation), \nthese were complemented in the mid-\n1990s by discourses that were portrayed \nas a response to climate change.\n\nIn the third period (2002-2013), diffusion \naccelerated as two other technical \nconfigurations also gained momentum \n(Seiwald, 2014): a)  large-scale BMDH-CHP \nplants (between 10-65 MWth), which produced \nboth heat and power and were operated by \nincumbent organisations like energy utilities; \nand b) small-scale micro-grids (between 100-\n400 kWth), which provided heat for a limited \nnumber of closely situated buildings and were \noften operated by energy service companies \n(ESCos) that pioneered new business models \nlike energy service contracting1. The following \ndevelopments assisted rapid diffusion:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the user environment, housing associ-\nations, hotels and public-building operators \nbecame interested in micro-grids because of \ntheir operational ease and cost-effectiveness, \nwhile large-scale BMDH-CHP plants mainly \nfocused on electricity production to the grid. \n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the business environment, incumbent \nactors from the electricity regime reoriented \nto BMDH-CHP because the Green Electricity \nAct (2002) established an attractive feed-\nin tariff for electricity generated from \nbiomass CHP. The involvement of incumbent \norganisations advanced BMDH diffusion by \nmaking available greater financial resources \n\n1 In energy service contracts, customers pay a monthly rate for the provision of heat (and electricity), leaving the construction \nand operation of biomass plants, located on the client\u2019s premises, to ESCos.\n\nand more profound technical and operational \ncapabilities. BMDH diffusion stimulated \ncomplementary innovations in biomass \ncollection and processing, prefabricated \nheat pipes (which reduced infrastructure \ninstallation costs and increased system \nefficiencies) and pellet boilers (which \nbecame easier to handle and more fuel-\nefficient). The creation of specialised \nclusters and supply chains made Austrian \nmanufacturers world-leading exporters of \npellet boilers (Geels and Johnson, 2018). \nBusiness opposition came from chimney \ncleaners and coal dealers whose jobs were \nthreatened, and from natural gas suppliers \nwho also wanted to expand into rural areas, \ngiving rise to \u2018significant conflicts between \nagricultural lobbies and the gas industry\u2019 \n(Rakos, 1995: 879).\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the policy environment, BMDH continued \nto benefit from support policies, such as \nthe Green Electricity Act (2002), the CHP \nLaw (2009), and the Law for the Expansion \nof District Heating and Cooling Networks \n(2009). From the mid-2000s, BMDH also \nbecame part of wider biomass strategies \n(such as the 2006 Biomass Action Plan and \nthe 2010 Austrian Energy Strategy 2020), \nwhich emphasised energy self-sufficiency, \nsustainability, green growth, and export \nopportunities for Austria\u2019s world-leading \nbiomass energy systems (Geels and \nJohnson, 2018).\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Ongoing policy support in this period was \nlegitimated by public discourses that \ncombined environmental benefits and \neconomic goals through notions such as self-\nsufficient \u2018energy regions\u2019 and the inclusion \nof BMDH in national biomass strategies \nwhich emphasised energy autarky, green \ngrowth and exports. The Federal Minister \n\n\n\n592\n\nfor Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and \nWater Management supported this vision \nin the preface to a Bio-Energy Report: \u2018We \ncan produce in Austria, on balance, as much \nenergy from domestic, renewable sources \nas we consume by ourselves. This makes us \nindependent from expensive, fossil energy \nimports such as oil and gas and brings \nabout a boom in the economy as well as \npositive employment effects with new green \njobs' (Austrian Energy Agency, 2012, p. 2).\n\n3.3  Urban tram systems in France \n(1971-2016)\n\nTrams were widely used in the first half of \nthe 20th century but disappeared from many \nEuropean cities in the 1950s and 1960s to \nmake way for motorised transport. From \nthe 1970s onwards, however, they made \na comeback which was particularly strong in \nFrance where tram systems spread to 15 out \nof 19 cities of more than 300 000 inhabitants \nand, in some instances, to cities with fewer than \n200 000 inhabitants (Figure 9-14). For larger \ncities (over 400 000 inhabitants) penetration \nreached 27 %, 53 % and 80 % by 1994, 2001 \nand 2010, respectively.\n\nFigure 9-14 Modern tramway diffusion in French cities \n(solid line: tramways; dotted line: tramways and rubber-tyred tramways)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: CERTU, 2013\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-14.xlsx\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\n\nSaint-\u00c9tienne (upgrade)\nNantes\n\nGrenoble\nParis\n\nLille (upgrade)\nRouen\n\nStrasbourg\nMontpellier\n\nOrl\u00e9ans\nLyon\n\nNancy (TVR)\nCaen (TVR)\n\nBordeaux\nMulhouse\n\nValenciennes\nClermont-Ferrand (Translohr)\n\nNice\nMarseille\nLe Mans\nToulouse\n\nReims\nAngers\n\nLe Havre\nBrest\nDijon\nTours\n\nAubagne\nBesan\u00e7on\n\nAvignon\n\nChanging conditions for\nmodern tram experiments \n\nDevolution and\npioneering projects  \n\nExpansion and\nstandardisation \n\nStreamlining,\nmaturity,\ndifficulties  \n\n\n\n593\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nBecause urban tram systems are expensive \ninfrastructure projects, they often involve \nlengthy planning and design periods before \nactual construction. In the first period (1971-\n1983), the success of high-speed railways (TGV) \nand concerns about urban congestion and car \naccidents led policymakers to prepare the ground \n\nfor tram systems. In 1971, they introduced the \n\u2018versement transport\u2019 financing instrument \nwhich raised employment tax locally to pay for \nlarge public transport schemes. First introduced \nin Paris as support for metro-like schemes, \nit was gradually extended to smaller cities \n(Figure 9-15) and used to support tram systems.\n\nFigure 9-15 Evolution of French municipalities collecting local transport tax, 1973-2013\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: GART, 2015\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-15.xlsx\n\n0\n7\n\n29\n39 41\n\n44 48\n52 53 56\n\n95\n\n109\n118122\n\n132135135\n142\n\n153\n161165\n\n170171\n176178179180179178\n\n186190\n197201\n\n208210\n214\n\n221\n226\n\n231\n236\n\n242\n\n1974\n\nSize threshold\nlowered from\n300 000 to\n100 000\ninhabitants\n\n1982\n\nSize threshold\nlowered from\n100 000 to\n30 000 inhabitants \n\n1992\n\nSize threshold\nlowered from\n30 000 to 20 000\ninhabitants  \n\n2000\n\nSize threshold\nlowered from\n20 000 to 10 000\ninhabitants  \n\n19\n73\n\n19\n74\n\n19\n75\n\n19\n76\n\n19\n77\n\n19\n78\n\n19\n79\n\n19\n80\n\n19\n81\n\n19\n82\n\n19\n83\n\n19\n84\n\n19\n85\n\n19\n86\n\n19\n87\n\n19\n88\n\n19\n89\n\n19\n90\n\n19\n91\n\n19\n92\n\n19\n93\n\n19\n94\n\n19\n95\n\n19\n96\n\n19\n97\n\n19\n98\n\n19\n99\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n01\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n03\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n06\n\n20\n07\n\n20\n08\n\n20\n09\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n11\n\n20\n12\n\n20\n13\n\n\n\n594\n\nThe early support coalition for trams comprised \nincumbent actors with congruent motivations \nand skills (Turnheim and Geels, 2019): a) the \nTransport Ministry saw trams as a means \nof addressing local transport problems and \nindustrial exports; b) the railway industry \n(GEC Alsthom) saw trams as a diversification \nopportunity, using its technological skills to enter \nnew markets; and c) the national rail operator \n(SNCF) wanted to use its network management \nskills to enter the urban public transport market. \nIn 1974, Transport Minister Marcel Cavaill\u00e9 \nset up a working group with members of this \ncoalition which coordinated R&D programmes \nand developed a top-down vision of rail-based, \npublic transport as a radical solution to transform \nurban transport systems. The 1975 Cavaill\u00e9 \nCirculaire called on eight cities to explore this \nvision and test new tram technologies with on-\nthe-ground projects, funded through versement \ntransport. This created space for the newly \nelected Socialist mayors (in Nantes, Strasbourg \nand Grenoble) to advance radical new transport \nideas for their cities which, in the late 1970s, led \nto more detailed design and planning studies.\n\nIn the second period (1985-1995), pioneering \ntram projects were stimulated by \u2018landscape\u2019 \ndevelopments such as Mitterrand\u2019s 1981 \nelection, which led to stronger strategic state \nintervention and the devolution of planning \npowers to cities (through the 1982 Gaston \nDefferre laws), including public transport \nresponsibilities and resources (through the \n1982 domestic transport guidance law, \nLOTI). Local tram projects promoted by city \nmayors were also enabled by planning and \ndesign support from technical bureaucracies \nand generous public funding, ranging from \nbetween 15 % and 40 % of capital costs in this \nperiod (ACUF, 2007), which was legitimated \nby high-level visions and a modernist and \npatriotic discourse about high-tech industrial \nachievement (Turnheim and Geels, 2019).\n\nIn 1985, Nantes opened the first modern \ntramway system which established technical \nand commercial viability of the new designs \n(based on adaptations of existing rail-industry \nknowledge). Learning from the Nantes project \n(which encountered some local opposition \nduring construction), Grenoble\u2019s tramway \nsystem, opened in 1987, included compensation \nfor local businesses, low-floor carriages for \nbetter accessibility for disabled users, and full \npedestrianisation of a segment crossing the \nurban centre (Laisney, 2011). The Strasbourg \nproject was designed in 1985, revoked in 1988, \nand reintroduced in 1989 by the incoming \nSocialist mayor who framed it as a civilisation \nbattle to reconquer public space from cars \n(Laisney, 2011). Opened in 1994, the system \nhad low-floor carriages, bay windows, a hyper-\nfuturist design and was developed to act as \na public transport backbone with park-and-ride \nfacilities and buses acting as feeders/extensions.\n\nLessons from one project fed into the next, and \nknowledge gradually stabilised as technical \nbodies, research centres and government-\naffiliated technical services (including the \n\u2018technical committee for the standard French \ntram\u2019, established in 1982) acted as intermediary \norganisations that aggregated, standardised and \ncodified technical knowledge (Hamman, 2015).\n\nTrams spread rapidly in the third period (1995-\n2008) as the success of Strasbourg led to \na flurry of new tram projects, both in large \ncities (Lyon, Bordeaux, Marseille) and smaller \nones (Figure 9-16). Central government funding \nbecame more codified via 1994 and 2001 \n\u2018guidance circulars\u2019 which specified evaluation \ncriteria (including social and security objectives) \nand institutionalised technical expertise. \nCERTU (the assessment centre on networks, \ntransport and public works) and governmental \ntechnical services delivered technical manuals, \nevaluation guidelines, technical notes and travel \nobservatories that further stabilised tram design \nand operational features (Hamman, 2015).\n\n\n\n595\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nFigure 9-16 Adoption of modern tramways by French cities (excluding Paris) \naccording to urban area population\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: CERTU, 2013\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-16.xlsx\n\nLyon\n\nLille (upgrade)\n\nMarseille\n\nToulouse\n\nNantes\n\nBordeaux\n\nNice\nRouen\n\nStrasbourg\nMontpellier\n\nGrenoble\n\nSaint-\u00c9tienne (upgrade)\n\nValenciennes\n\nToursClermont (Translohr)Orl\u00e9ans Nancy (TVR)\n\nMulhouse\n\nBrestCaen (TVR) Reims\nLe Mans\n\nBesan\u00e7on\n\n0\n\n200 000\n\n400 000\n\n600 000\n\n800 000\n\n1 000 000\n\n1 200 000\n\nPT\nU\n\n p\nop\n\nul\nat\n\nio\nn \n\nin\n 2\n\n01\n0\n\nAngers\nDijon\n\nLe Havre\n\n19\n80\n\n19\n85\n\n19\n90\n\n19\n95\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n15\n\nOpening date\n\nAubagne\n\nIn the policy environment, strategic mobility \nplans (plans de d\u00e9placements urbains, PDU) \nbecame mandatory (requiring cities to develop \nalternatives to cars) and increasingly linked \nto energy and air-pollution measures. Local \npolicymakers increasingly embraced trams \nas vehicles for urban marketing, promoting \n\u2018emerging\u2019 urban areas (often for business \nand tourism attractiveness) and projecting \na modern city image (Kaminagai, 2014). In \n2003, central government funding for light rail \nwas reduced, which delayed several projects \nand increased reliance on loans and cross-\nfinancing (Turnheim and Geels, 2019).\n\nLighter top-down government influence (e.g. \nreduced funding) increased dynamics in \nthe business environment, as Alstom faced \ncompetition from consultancy and engineering \ncompanies, while SNCF increasingly competed \nwith other local transport service operators \n(Keolis, Connex/Veolia Transport, RATP). \n\nUsers also enthusiastically embraced trams, \nalthough lengthy construction projects \nsometimes encountered local opposition. \nFrom the late 1990s, increasing tram use led \nto declining car use in various French cities \n(Figure 9-17).\n\n\n\n596\n\nThe public discourse also changed during \nthis period, as tram debates moved beyond \ntransport-specific considerations and \nbecame linked to wider issues such as \nurban transformation, quality of life and \nenvironmental problems. Thus, tram visions \ntook on new meanings that aligned with \nemerging norms and values (e.g. access, \nsustainability, liveability, urban renewal) which \nbroadened the attractiveness of trams and \nhelped to build a broad discourse coalition, so \nthat trams became \u2018irresistible\u2019 for mayors of \nmedium and large cities (Hamman, 2015). \n\nIn the fourth period (2008-2016), trams \nbecame further linked to environmental \nobjectives as the 2007 \u2018Grenelle Environment\u2019 \n(a multi-party debate between government, \nlocal authorities, trade unions, business and \nvoluntary sectors) committed, amongst others, \nto building more urban light-rail projects. In \n\n2008, although the government increased \ncentral funding again, the money was spread \nthinly over more projects, new tram designs \naimed at streamlining and cost-cutting. \n\nMotivations for tram projects became highly \nconvergent, emphasising \u2018urban sustainable \ndevelopment and environmental preservation, \nrenewal or requalification of urban space, \nmature technology, positive effects on job \ncreation\u2019 (Pissaloux and Ducol, 2016: 183). \nFrench tram manufacturers (e.g. Alstom), \noperators (e.g. Keolis, Transdev, RATP) and \nengineering firms (Vinci, Bouygues) increasingly \nturned to export markets, building on earlier \nexperiences: \u2018the building consultants, the \ntransport operators and the designers intervene \nin response to a growing number of cities in the \nworld, on the base of the references created in \nthe French cities\u2019 (Kaminagai, 2014: 62).\n\nFigure 9-17 Evolution of car use (percentage of journeys) in selected French cities \nwith tramways\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: CERTU, 2013\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter9/figure_9-17.xlsx\n\nBordeaux\n\nGrenoble\n\nLille\n\nLyon\nMarseille\n\nStrasbourg\n\n30 %\n\n40 %\n\n50 %\n\n60 %\n\n70 %\n\n19\n75\n\n19\n80\n\n19\n85\n\n19\n90\n\n19\n95\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n15\n\n20\n10\n\n\n\n597\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\n4.  Conclusions and policy recommendations\n\n4.1 Socio-technical transitions\n\nThe three examples have demonstrated that \nsocio-technical transitions are longitudinal \nprocesses which progress through phases with \ndifferent activities and causal mechanisms. \nThe radical innovations emerged in sheltered \nniches, but their transformative effects were not \nrealised until they were diffused more widely, \nwhich (inevitably) takes time and involves \nembedding processes in business, policy, \nuser and cultural environments. The German \nelectricity transition most clearly also involved \nlandscape developments (e.g. 1998 election, \nChernobyl and Fukushima accidents, financial-\neconomic crises) and regime disruption, which \nwas only briefly addressed in the other two \ncases (e.g. disruption of Austrian chimney \ncleaners and coal dealers, and a decline in car \nuse in French cities). \n\nAll three cases also involved multiple actors \nand dimensions, which demonstrates that \nsocio-technical transitions are not just \nabout universities, firms and markets (as in \ninnovation system approaches), but are also \nabout households, cities, communities, NGOs \nand the wider public. In all three cases, radical \ninnovations became linked to grand challenges \n(particularly climate change and quality of life), \nalthough this alignment was often strengthened \nin later phases as visions became broader \nand combined multiple issues (a pattern \ncalled \u2018issue linkage\u2019). Furthermore, the cases \nillustrate socio-technical transitions are non-\nlinear processes, characterised by surprises, \nunintended consequences, setbacks and twists \nand turns, which means that transformative \neffects are difficult to predict correctly. All \nthree cases also showed that environmentally \noriented socio-technical transitions can \nhave positive economic and export effects, \nwhich substantiates the suggestion from the \n\nCommission\u2019s expert group on green growth \nand jobs, cited in the introduction. The German \ncase, however, shows that positive green growth \neffects may be eroded when competitors, such \nas Chinese manufacturers, successfully enter \nthe new economic domain.\n\n4.2  Five policy challenges in the \ncase studies\n\nThe five policy challenges mentioned in the \nintroduction also played out in all three cases, \nalthough in different ways.\n\nHorizontal policy coordination. Although \ninnovation policy (particularly R&D support, \ndemonstration projects and knowledge \naggregation) was important in all three cases, \nsector-specific policies (energy, agricultural, \ntransport, environmental) were also clearly \nrelevant, especially for deployment and diffusion:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the German energy transition, R&D \nsupport and demonstration projects helped \nto create technological niches for wind \nand solar PV in the 1980s and 1990s. But \nrenewable energy policy (particularly feed-\nin tariffs) was crucial to create market \nniches and drive subsequent diffusion. \nResponsibility for renewable energy policy \nchanged from the Ministry of Economic \nAffairs to the Ministry for Environmental \nAffairs in 2002 and back again in 2014, \nwhich suggests that horizontal coordination \nmay involve turf battles between ministries.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the Austrian BMDH transition, innovation \npolicy helped to generate knowledge and \nimprove techno-economic performance \nin the 1980s and 1990s. But other policy \ndomains were also important: agricultural \npolicy provided financial support to BMDH \noperators, which reduced investment risks \n\n\n\n598\n\nand facilitated learning-by-doing (especially \nin the early phases); environmental and \nclimate policy subsidised green innovations \n(like BMDH); regional energy policy \n(especially provincial energy agencies) \nhelped with knowledge aggregation, \ncodification and dissemination (in the \nearly phases), while federal energy policy \nstimulated the reorientation of energy \nutilities through the CHP feed-in tariff (in the \nlater phases); and economic and industrial \npolicy stimulated energy clusters, green \ngrowth and exports (in the later phases).\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Innovation policy was crucial for the \ndevelopment of French tram designs, by \nstimulating R&D, technical learning, and \ncodification. However, transport policy, \nenvironmental policy and industrial policy \nalso supported the development and \ndeployment of tram systems.\n\nSocial, business model and infrastructural \ninnovation. While technological innovation \nwas crucial in all three cases, other forms of \ninnovation were also important:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Community energy (particularly collectively \nowned wind turbines) was an important \nsocial innovation which made citizens \nand communities active participants in \nGermany\u2019s energy transition. In the later \nphases, the diffusion of intermittent \nrenewables (wind, solar PV) also required \ninfrastructural innovations, such as grid \nextensions, smart grids, back-up capacity \nand energy storage.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Infrastructural innovation was central to \nthe Austrian BMDH transition involved, \nwhich policymakers stimulated by providing \nfinancial support (e.g. capital grants) that \nreduced investment risks. It also involved \n\nbusiness model innovation (e.g. energy \nservice companies) and some social \ninnovation (shift towards heating services), \nwhich were mostly left to the market.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd French tram systems involved the building \nof new infrastructures, but also had wider \ntransformative effects as cities started to \nclose off city centres to cars and to align \npedestrianised areas with tram systems. The \nmodal shift from cars to trams (and buses) \nalso constituted important social innovations.\n\nWider set of actors and coalitions. All three \ncases involved wider sets of actors than the \n\u2018upstream\u2019 groups (universities, research \ncentres, firms) that are central to innovation \nsystem approaches, although their roles vary:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd The German energy transition was \nmainly driven by new entrants like \nhouseholds, farmers, municipal utilities \nand project developers which, together \nwith environmental groups, solar and wind \nassociations, metal- and machine workers, \nfarmer groups and church groups, formed \na powerful advocacy coalition lobbying for \nstronger support policies. In addition, the \ntraditional regime-level coalition between \nutilities and the government was disrupted \nby the election of a Red-Green government \n(1998-2005) which introduced EEG support \nand nuclear phase-out policies that had an \nunfavourable effect on the big-4 utilities.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd The Austrian BMDH transition was also \npioneered by new entrants (e.g. woodworkers, \nfarmers) without dedicated policy support \nduring the first period. In the second and third \nperiods, these new entrants were supported \nby various policies that enabled the building \nof green clusters and energy regions. In the \nthird period, incumbent actors like energy \n\n\n\n599\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\nutilities reoriented and also became involved, \nfocusing particularly on large-scale BMDH-\nCHP systems which were supported by \nattractive feed-in tariffs. Over time, the actor \ncoalition expanded to include domestic boiler \nmanufacturers, installers, municipalities, \nfarmers, energy service companies and \nvarious kinds of users (households, housing \nassociations, hotels and public-building \noperators).\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In contrast to the other two cases, French \ntram systems were pioneered by incumbent \nregime actors (railway companies, national \nrail operator, the Transport Ministry, and \ntechnical services), although new entrants \n(cities, mayors) were also important for \nlocal implementation and on-the-ground \nlearning, which led to cumulative design \nimprovements. Over time, the actor coalition \nwidened to include consultancy and \nengineering companies, other local transport \nservice operators, citizens, and advocates of \nvarious societal issues (environment, climate \nchange, air pollution, congestion and safety).\n\nVisions and missions to create drive and \ndirectionality. Future visions were important \nin all three cases, but they evolved during \nthe transitions as actors learned more about \ntechnical performance and functionalities and \nas more actors (with different concerns) joined \nthe advocacy coalitions. The alignment with \ngrand challenges often became more pertinent \nin the later phases of transition, rather than \ndriving them from the start, although the \ncases do vary.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd In the German energy transition, visions \nin the 1980s and 1990s were inspired by \nanti-nuclear and pro-renewable sentiments, \nbut federal policy support occurred mainly \n\u2018by accident\u2019. The Red-Green government \n\ncoalition (1998-2005) did develop a long-\nterm vision which anticipated that wind \nand solar PV innovations could become \neconomically viable in the 2020s (through \nscale economies and learning-by-doing \nprocesses) if sufficiently nurtured, which led \nto the 2000 EEG support policy. The energy \ntransition mission (with ambitious targets \nand explicitly linked to climate change) did \nnot emerge until 2011, in the context of \na landscape shock (Fukushima), the nuclear \nphase-out decision, strong RET-growth and \na broad-based advocacy coalition.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Visions of Austrian BMDH also evolved \nas the transition unfolded. In the mid-\n1980s, BMDH was seen as a means for \nlocal economic development and the \nrevitalisation of rural areas. By the mid-\n1990s, environmental and climate change \nbenefits were also being emphasised. And \nby the mid-2000s, BMDH became part \nof wider plans and strategies through \nits inclusion in the 2006 Biomass Action \nPlan and 2010 Austrian Energy Strategy \n2020. This linking of BMDH to multiple \npolicy goals (agricultural, environmental, \neconomic) helped to create legitimacy and \nwider advocacy coalitions that underpinned \ncontinued policy support.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd French tram development was driven from \nthe start by a dedicated, top-down vision, \nformulated by the Transport Ministry and \nrailway industry, and motivated by specific \nconcerns about local transport problems \n(noise, air pollution, parking, accidents) and \nexport potential. The vision broadened over \ntime and became linked to quality-of-life \nissues, climate change, and deeper urban \nreconfiguration (closing off city centres to \ncars, pedestrianisation, etc.).\n\n\n\n600\n\nDiffusion. In all three cases, the dissemination of \nradical innovations beyond initial niches required \nnot only innovation policy (which remained \nimportant for performance improvement, \ncost reduction, knowledge development and \nstabilisation), but also sectoral policies (e.g. \nenergy, agriculture, transport), as described \nabove under horizontal policy coordination. \nTherefore, the cases support the suggestion \nin the Commission\u2019s recent BOHEMIA report: \n\u2018Conditions for uptake of new solutions (...) are \noften defined by sectoral policies (e.g. regulation, \nstandards, procurement), and it is through \nalignment between sectoral and R&I policies \nthat change can be accelerated\u2019 (EC, 2018c: 30). \nAll three cases also demonstrate that diffusion \ninvolves processes in business, policy, cultural \nand user environments. The latter, however, \nwas not discussed in depth, which may be due \nto the characteristics of the cases, two of which \nwere about infrastructure systems and one \nconcerned supply-side electricity generation. \nDiffusion in all three cases was stimulated \nby: a) dedicated financial instruments that \nreduced business investment risks; b) positive \ndiscourses and visions (discussed above) \nthat legitimised policy support; and c) cross-\nministerial alliances and high-level political \nsupport (often from ministers).\n\n\u00dd\u00dd RET-diffusion in Germany\u2019s energy transition \nwas stimulated by: a) stable and attractive \nfeed-in tariffs because guaranteed minimum \npayments for 20 years reduced investment \nrisks for new entrants; b) positive green \ngrowth discourses; c) broad-based advocacy \ncoalitions; and d) top-level political support \n(from Chancellor Merkel after 2011) which \nhas weakened, however, in recent years \nbecause of concerns over rising costs and \nthe disruption of incumbent utilities.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd The diffusion of Austrian BMDH was \nstimulated by: a) knowledge aggregation, \ncodification and dissemination activities \nthat stabilised the innovation and reduced \n\nuncertainties; b) capital grants that reduced \ninvestment risks, which are often substantial \nfor infrastructure systems like BMDH; c) \nfinancial incentives (e.g. feed-in tariffs) that \ncreated attractive market conditions for \ncompany involvement; and d) broadening \nvisions and support coalitions.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd French tram diffusion was driven by: a) \nnew financing instruments (like versement \ntransport) which reduced investment risks; b) \nplanning and design support from technical \nbureaucracies; c) political support from \nlocal mayors (as trams demonstrated their \ncapacity to support electoral wins) and the \nTransport Minister Cavaill\u00e9; d) positive visions \nand discourses; and e) a broad-based support \ncoalition with growing export success.\n\n4.3  Messages for transformative \ninnovation policy\n\nInstruments from all three innovation policy \nframes (Figure 9-1) are important for \ntransformative innovation and socio-technical \ntransitions and should be strengthened to address \ngrand challenges. In addition to the well-known \ninstruments from the first two policy frames, the \nfollowing policy messages summarise important \navenues for transformative innovation policy \nwhich include, and go beyond, the five policy \nchallenges discussed above.\n\nEmergence of radical innovations\n\u00dd\u00dd Support a wide range of sustainability \n\ninnovations, not just technological but also \nsocial, infrastructural and business model \ninnovations (Figure 9-3).\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Support more real-world experiments, \npilots, demonstration projects and living \nlabs, which move innovations beyond the \nR&D phase and enable open-ended learning \nwith multiple stakeholders about technical \nperformance, market uptake, social accept-\nance and environmental impacts.\n\n\n\n601\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 9\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Build transformative innovation coalitions \nwhich not only include \u2018traditional\u2019 actors \n(universities, research centres, firms), but \nalso new entrants (NGOs, cities, startups, \npioneers) that are willing to challenge \nconventional wisdom and to think \u2018out of the \nbox\u2019.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Nurture new market creation (e.g. through \nsubsidies, public procurement, feed-in tariffs) \nand new business models so that radical \ninnovations can become economically viable.\n\nDiffusion\n\u00dd\u00dd  Insights and findings from local projects and \n\nexperiments should be shared, compared, \naggregated, codified and disseminated, \nwhich could be done by intermediary actors \nsuch as innovation or implementation \nagencies.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Research, development and innovation \npolicy can help improve price/performance \ncharacteristics of innovations, which \nstimulate diffusion.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Adoption by consumers can be stimulated \nwith targeted financial instruments (pur-\nchase subsidies, low-interest loans, tax \nexemptions), information provision (media \ncampaigns, labels, celebrity endorsements) \nand adjustments in economic framework \nconditions.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Uptake of innovations in businesses can be \nsupported with financial instruments that \nreduce investment risks (e.g. interest-free \nloans, capital grants, investment subsidies), \nregulations (e.g. renewable energy obliga-\ntions for utilities, electric-vehicle sales \ntargets for automakers, environmental \nstandards for home builders), and public \ninfrastructure investment.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Policymakers can support the social \nacceptance of innovations by developing \npositive visions and debates and by involving \nsocietal groups through public participation.\n\nDisruption and system reconfiguration\n\u00dd\u00dd  Reconfiguring entire systems should \n\ngo beyond technological \u2018silver bullets\u2019 \nand promote synergies among multiple \ninnovations.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Since transitions are full of surprises, non-\nlinearities and unintended consequences, \nadaptive governance approaches are \nrecommended, based on iterative cycles of \npolicymaking and planning, implementing, \nevaluating and learning.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd To mitigate potential resistance from \nincumbent firms, policymakers could assist \nthem in strategic reorientation processes or \nprovide compensation (e.g. sunset clauses).\n\nCross-cutting policy recommendations\n\u00dd\u00dd Horizontal coordination between policy \n\ndomains (innovation, transport, energy, \nindustry, education, skills) is important, \nespecially in the later phases.\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Meeting the large investment needs \nfor diffusion and infrastructure change \nwill require policies that change market \nincentives, reduce risks and uncertainties, \nand incentivise private investment, as \nwell as more fundamental reforms of the \nfinancial system. \n\n\u00dd\u00dd  Long-term change and directing innovative \ntrajectories towards grand challenges \nshould be promoted through ambitious \nvisions, missions and targets.\n\n\n\n602\n\n5.

Introduction\nThe productivity gap between successful firms \nand the rest of businesses within the same \nindustries has been increasing since the 2000s \nacross OECD countries (Andrews, Criscuolo \nand Gal, 2016; Berlingieri, Blanchenay and \nCriscuolo, 2017). Productivity developments \nat the firm level point to impediments to \ntechnology diffusion from the productivity \nfrontier to the rest of the distribution, with \ntoo many firms stuck at the bottom \u2013 the so-\ncalled \u2018laggards\u2019. The evidence suggests that \nthe increase in the productivity gap has come \nmainly from the bottom half of the distribution, \nwhere the distance in terms of performance \nbetween the very bottom and the median firm \nhas increased more over time than at the top \nof the distribution (Berlingieri, Blanchenay and \nCriscuolo, 2017). Yet, this does not imply that \nthe left tail of the productivity distribution only \nincludes zombie firms that survive due to weak \nmarket selection. Rather, the evidence shows \n\nthat a substantial share of low-productivity \nfirms are businesses at an early stage of \ntheir development and operating below their \nefficiency level (Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo \nand Verlhac, 2019). While allowing for the exit \nof zombie firms, efficient bankruptcy legislation \nis key; a dynamic business environment with \nproductivity-enhancing creative destruction is \nkey to enabling these young, small and dynamic \nfirms to achieve their growth potential. \n\nImportantly, the productivity divergence seems \nto be larger in sectors providing information \nand communication technology services (e.g. \ncomputer programming, software engineering \nand data processing) and in industries \nthat are intensive in intangible assets (e.g. \ndata, proprietary software, human and \norganisational capital). The increasing potential \nof digital technologies to create global winner-\ntakes-most dynamics might have helped \n\nSummary\n\nResearch into the slowdown in global produc-\ntivity has brought to the forefront of the policy \ndebate the importance of understanding the \nnature of firm-level productivity developments. \nThis has become particularly relevant follow-\ning evidence showing a significant  increase in \nthe productivity gap between highly product-\nive firms and the rest of businesses within the \nsame industries since the 2000s. This diver-\nging trend in productivity performance would \neventually lead to broader social implications \nin terms of wage inequality and inclusiveness.\n\nThis chapter provides an overview of recent \nand ongoing analysis of these issues and \ndiscusses policies that affect the catch-\nup by laggards in the context of the digital \n\ntransformation. First, it introduces productivity \ndivergence in the context of the global \nphenomenon linked to digital transformation \nand the knowledge economy. Later, it examines \ntrends in productivity divergence and business \ndynamism, respectively, with a focus on the \nbottom of the productivity distribution. Beyond \ncommon trends, a few examples highlight \ncross-country and cross-sector heterogeneity. \nThe descriptive sections conclude with firm and \nsector characteristics and discussions about \npossible explanations behind the documented \ntrends at the bottom, including the role of \nopenness. The final analytical section provides \na framework and summarises the main results \nof the analysis of the role of policies on the \nspeed of catch-up by laggards.\n\n\n\n611\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nfrontier firms to increase their performance \ndisproportionally more than laggards within \nthese industries (Criscuolo, 2019) and gain \nlarger market share (Andrews et al., 2016, \nand Bajgar et al., 2019). Ongoing OECD work \nsuggests that intangible assets are associated \nwith productivity dispersion through their \ncomplementarity with digital technologies, \nand that the effect arises from laggards\u2019 \nworsening productivity performance vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe median firm (Berlingieri, Corrado, Criscuolo, \nHaskel, Himbert and Iona Lasinio, 2019). \nIntangible assets are also linked to increased \nconcentration, especially in sectors that are \nopen and digital intensive (Bajgar, Criscuolo \nand Timmis, 2019). The rise of the intangible \neconomy exacerbates productivity dispersion, \nas laggards may not be able to afford and \nfinance the necessary intangible investments \nto reap the benefits of technological change \n(Berlingieri et al., 2019). \n\nThis chapter provides an overview of recent and \nongoing analysis on these issues and discusses \npolicies that affect the catch-up of laggards in \nthe context of the digital transformation. It is \norganised as follows: section 2 briefly puts the \nproductivity divergence in the context of other \nmanifestations of the same multifaceted global \nphenomenon linked to digital transformation \nand the knowledge economy. Sections 3 and \n4 document trends in productivity divergence \nand business dynamism, respectively, with \na focus on the bottom of the productivity \ndistribution. Beyond common trends, a few \nexamples highlight cross-country and cross-\nsector heterogeneity. Section 5 identifies firm \nand sector characteristics that may explain the \ndocumented trends at the bottom, including \nthe role of openness. Section 6 provides \na framework and summarises the main results \nof the analysis on the role of policies on \nlaggards\u2019 rate of catch-up. Section 7 concludes \nwith a policy discussion.\n\n2.  A multifaceted phenomenon \n\nThe global productivity slowdown has brought \nto the forefront of the policy debate the \nimportance of understanding the nature of \nfirm-level productivity developments. Recent \nOECD research has documented the significant \nincrease in the productivity gap between \nsuccessful firms and the rest of businesses \nwithin the same industries since the 2000s, \nboth at the global level and within countries. \nThe divergence in productivity performance \nhas implications in terms of wage inequality \nand inclusiveness. Indeed, increases in wage \ninequality and in productivity dispersion are \nlinked. Therefore, policy responses to the \nincreasing productivity divergence could \npotentially produce a \u2018double dividend\u2019 in terms \nof both greater productivity growth and reduced \nincome inequality (see Criscuolo, 2018 and \n\nreferences therein). Importantly, productivity \npolicies need to account for local and sectoral \nspecificities as countries and industries have \nexperienced heterogeneous productivity and \nwage developments beyond well-established \ncommon trends (Box 10-1).\n\nProductivity divergence is observed in the \ncontext of ongoing digital transformation that \nradically alters the way firms produce, upscale \nand compete. In particular, digital technologies \nmay affect the two microeconomic processes \nthat shape aggregate productivity trends. \nFirst, they impact within-firm productivity \ngrowth, thanks to the efficiency gain that firms \ncan achieve by adopting digital technologies \nand enhancing their innovation capabilities \n\u2013 if they have the necessary complementary \n\n\n\n612\n\nBOX 10-1 Heterogeneity in productivity developments \nacross countries and sectors\nRecent OECD research has documented common \ntrends in productivity and wage divergence within \nindustries across advanced economies since the \nearly 2000s. Yet, beyond these general trends, \ncountries have experienced specific productivity \nand wage developments. The OECD MultiProd \nproject gathers harmonised productivity-related \ndata enabling cross-country comparisons of \nproductivity developments over time at a fine \nlevel of disaggregation. The MultiProd data \nuniquely inform researchers and policymakers \nabout country-specific productivity patterns \nand enable them to compare the nature of \nproductivity developments across countries. \nThis box gives a few examples: \n\nProductivity dispersion across \nindustries in Austria\n\nTrends in labour productivity dispersion in \nAustria have been comparable to developments \nin other OECD economies since the Great \nRecession (OECD, 2019a). However, the level of \nwithin-industry productivity dispersion is lower \nin Austria than in other countries. Remarkably, \naverage labour productivity dispersion is lower \nin every manufacturing and service industry \nover the period 2008-14 (Figure 10-1). \n\nFigure 10-1 Average labour productivity dispersion, Austria, 2008-14\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n90\n-1\n\n0 \nra\n\nti\no\n\nFu\nrn\n\nitu\nre\n\n &\n ot\n\nhe\nr\n\nMe\nta\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\ncts\n\nRu\nbb\n\ner\n &\n\n pl\nas\n\ntic\ns\n\nEle\nctr\n\nica\nl e\n\nqu\nipm\n\nen\nt\n\nMa\nch\n\nine\nry\n\n an\nd e\n\nqu\nipm\n\nen\nt\n\nWo\nod\n\n &\n pa\n\npe\nr p\n\nro\nd.\n\nFo\nod\n\n &\n be\n\nve\nra\n\nge\ns\n\nTe\nxti\n\nles\n &\n\n ap\npa\n\nre\nl\n\nCo\nmp\n\nut\ner\n\n &\n el\n\nec\ntro\n\nnic\ns\n\nTr\nan\n\nsp\nor\n\nt e\nqu\n\nipm\nen\n\nt\n\nPh\nar\n\nma\nce\n\nut\nica\n\nls\n\nManufacturing\n\nAustria Benchmark\n\n\n\n613\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: OECD (2019a)\nNote: This figure reports the average dispersion in labour productivity within industries in Austria and within country-industry \npairs in a set of benchmark countries.

While there is evidence \nthat the pace of diffusion has decelerated across \ncountries, Belgium seems to have experienced \n\na significantly more pronounced slowdown \n(OECD, 2019c). The productivity gap between \nthe domestic frontier and laggards has increased \ntwice as much in Belgium as in other countries \nover the period 2000-2012 (Figure 10-3).\n\nFigure 10-3 Cumulative change in the productivity gap between laggard and \nfrontier firms, Belgium\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: OECD (2019c)\nNote: This figure reports the estimated year dummies of a panel data regression of the average labour productivity gap between \nlaggards and the domestic productivity frontier within industry-productivity performance group pairs in Belgium, and within \ncountry-industry-productivity performance group triplets in the set of benchmark countries. Laggards are firms belonging either \nto the bottom decile of the productivity distribution (0 to 10th percentile) or to the medium-low performance group (10th to 40th \npercentile). The domestic productivity frontier is defined as the top 10 % of the productivity distribution in each country-industry-\nyear triplet. The labour productivity gap is defined as the distance between (log) labour productivity in each country-industry-\nproductivity performance group-year among laggards and (log) LP of the domestic frontier in the corresponding country-\nindustry-year.

The \nresulting increase in productivity disparities \nbetween the most- and the least-productive \nfirms could partially explain the productivity \nslowdown observed at the macroeconomic \nlevel. In addition, these now well-established \nproductivity patterns hint at potential causes of \nthe slowdown, namely insufficient technology \ndiffusion from the frontier to laggards \n(Berlingieri et al., 2019) and slowing business \ndynamism (Calvino and Criscuolo, 2019) which \nslackens the process of creative destruction \n(Berlingieri, Blanchenay and Criscuolo, 2017).\n\nConcomitant with this increase in productivity \ndispersion, advanced economies \u2013 and digital-\nintensive sectors within them, in particular \n\u2013 have experienced other major changes in \ntheir business dynamics and industry structure \n(Criscuolo, 2019). Against the backdrop of the \nproductivity divergence, there has been: (i) \na decline in business dynamism, measured as \nentry rates and jobs reallocation across firms \n(Calvino and Criscuolo, 2019); (ii) an increase \nin mark-ups, i.e. in the wedge between unit \nprices and marginal costs (Calligaris, Criscuolo \nand Marcolin, 2018); (iii) a rise in industry and \nrevenue concentration (Bajgar et al., 2019); \nand (iv) a decline in the labour share of income \n(OECD, 2018). Taken together, these elements \nsuggest that something is changing about \ncompetitive dynamics more generally, driven \nby common structural factors linked to the \ndigital transformation. The remainder of this \nsection briefly discusses these factors.\n\nThe digitalisation of the economy magnifies the \nimportance of knowledge assets. The intensive \nuse of intangible assets such as data analytics \nand the difficult replication of successful \nbusiness models, together with declining IT \ncapital prices, allow few firms, especially in \ndigital-intensive sectors, to benefit from high \nand increasing mark-ups and to gain a large \nmarket share. These in turn may help industry \nleaders to sustain and advance their position \nleaving competitors behind.\n\nIn line with similar findings for the United \nStates (De Loecker, Eeckhout and Unger, 2018), \nCalligaris, Criscuolo and Marcolin (2018) point \nto firm-level evidence of significant changes \nand increasing differences across companies \nwhen looking at firm mark-ups in advanced \neconomies since the early 2000s. Moreover, \nthis works provides novel evidence of a link \nbetween the increase in firm-level mark-ups \nand the digital intensity of firms\u2019 production \ntechnology, suggesting that, on average, firms \noperating in digital-intensive sectors have \nhigher mark-ups (Figure 10-4).\n\n\n\n617\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nFigure 10-4 Average mark-ups in digital-intensive sectors are higher \nand even more so today\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Elaborations on Calligaris, S., Criscuolo, C. and Marcolin, L. (2018)\nNote: The figure illustrates the increasing wedge in mark-ups between firms in digital-intensive and less-digital-intensive industries, \n2001-03 and 2013-14. It reports the average percentage differences at the beginning and at end of the sample period, estimated \nfrom a pooled OLS regression explaining firm log mark-ups in the period, on the basis of the firm\u2019s capital intensity, age, productivity \nand country-year of operation, as well as a dummy variable with value 1 if the sector of operation is digital-intensive vs. less-digital-\nintensive (specifications on the left in the graph), or if the sector of operation is among the top 25 % of digital-intensive sectors vs. \nnot (specifications on the right in the graph). Sectors are classified as 'digital-intensive' or 'highly digital-intensive' according to the \ntaxonomy developed in Calvino et al. (2018). Mark-ups are estimated from a Cobb Douglas production function. With respect to \nCalligaris et al. (2018), in this elaboration the parameters of the production function have been estimated at the 3-digit industry level \n(rather than 2-digit), and including year dummies. Moreover, mark-ups lower than 1 but greater than 0.95 have been winsorized (rather \nthan trimmed) to 1. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level.

Therefore, \nthey can be used in many markets at near-zero \nmarginal cost, which gives larger companies an \ninherent advantage when leveraging intangible \ninvestments over higher sales and more markets. \nRecent OECD work finds that intangible assets \nplay a key role in enabling large firms to scale \nup, thereby increasing industry concentration \n(Bajgar, Criscuolo and Timmis, 2019, and \nFigure 10-5). Moreover, ongoing work suggests \nthat laggard firms may not be able to transform \ndigital technologies into productivity gains \nbecause they cannot afford complementary \ninvestments in intangible assets and skills \n(Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac, \n2019; Berlingieri, Corrado, Criscuolo, Haskel, \nHimbert and Iona Lasinio, 2019). \n\nTechnological progress also affects labour, \nboth by extending the range of existing tasks \nthat can be performed by capital assets and \nby creating new tasks related to the use of \nthese assets (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018). \nOver the past couple of decades, information \nand communication technologies seem to have \ndisplaced labour and facilitated the emergence \nof \u2018superstar firms\u2019 with very low labour shares \n(Autor et al., 2017; OECD, 2018). The increasing \nweight of these very large and productive firms \nin the digital economy may help explain the \ndeclining labour share of income across the \nOECD. Consistent with the decline in the labour \nshare, the increasingly large pay differentials \nacross firms account for a large share of the \nincrease in wage inequality in recent decades \n(Berlingieri, Blanchenay and Criscuolo, 2017; \nOECD, 2018). \n\n\n\n619\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nFigure 10-5 Top 8 concentration by potential concentration drivers \u2014 \nchange since 2002\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Bajgar, Criscuolo and Timmis (2019), 'Supersize me: intangibles and industry concentration', Mimeo\nNote: The countries include BE, DK, ES, FI, FR, UK, EL, IT, JP, PT, SE and US.

Divergence at the bottom\n\nWhile the emergence of superstar firms points \nto the rising performance of firms at the top \nof the distribution as a source of the observed \nproductivity divergence, the rising divergence \nat the bottom of the distribution suggests \nthat the disappointing performance of laggard \nfirms might also be at play. However, little is \nknown about the characteristics of firms that \noperate at the bottom of the productivity \ndistribution and what drives their performance, \nalthough understanding how their performance \naffects aggregate productivity growth is of \nprime interest. Recent OECD work bridges \nthe gap by specifically focusing on the 40 % \nof least-productive firms, the so-called \nlaggards (Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and \nVerlhac, 2019). It highlights the characteristics \nof laggard firms, their contribution to the \neconomy and the determinants of their \nproductivity performance. \n\nThe analysis splits the business population into \nfive groups of firms with different productivity \nlevels in each country and two-digit industry \nacross 13 countries:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd \u2018Bottom performers\u2019: firms with \na productivity level lying below the 10th \npercentile of the productivity distribution, \ni.e. the bottom 10 % in terms of productivity \nperformance;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd \u2018Low performers\u2019: firms with a productivity \nlevel lying between the 10th and the 40th \npercentile, i.e. firms with a relatively low \nproductivity level, just below the median \ngroup, the \u2018typical firms\u2019 group (see below). \nThey account for about 25 % of employment \nand 12 % of revenues in the sample;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd \u2018Typical firms\u2019: firms with a productivity \nlevel lying between the 40th and the 60th \npercentile, i.e. firms located around the \nmedian productivity level;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd \u2018High performers\u2019: firms with a productivity \nlevel lying between the 60th and the 90th \npercentile, i.e. firms with a relatively high \nproductivity level, yet lower than the best \nperforming firms, and accounting for 30 % \nof the population;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd \u2018Top performers\u2019: firms with a productivity \nlevel lying between the 90th and the 100th \npercentile of the distribution, i.e. the top \n10 % in terms of productivity performance.\n\nThe group of laggards comprises firms \nbelonging to either the bottom performers \nor the low performers. This classification \nallows for an analysis of firms based on their \nrelative position in the productivity distribution. \nThe relative average productivity in each \nproductivity group provides evidence about \nthe shape of the distribution and appears \nparticularly relevant for analysing frontier \nfirms and firms at the very bottom.\n\n\n\n621\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nFigure 10-6 Average productivity by performance group \nrelative to the 'typical firms' group\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019), 'Last but not least: laggard firms, technology diffusion and its \nstructural and policy determinants', Mimeo\nNote: The figures plot the weighted average labour productivity (top panel A) and multifactor productivity (bottom panel B) in \ndifferent groups of the productivity distribution with respect to the median bin.

On the one hand, \ntop performers exhibit much higher levels of \nproductivity, on average around 3.5 times as \nhigh as that of typical firms, which serve as the \nreference point. On the other hand, the average \nproductivity of firms in the bottom performers \nis around one fifth of the average typical firm. \nLow performers exhibit productivity that is \nroughly 60 % of a typical firm\u2019s productivity. \nPanel B in the same figure reports similar \ncomparisons when productivity is measured as \nmultifactor productivity (MFP).\n\nAnother way to look at the contribution from \nlaggards is to focus on their contribution \n\nto aggregate productivity. The contribution \nof firms with different labour productivity \nperformance (i.e. in different productivity \nquantiles) to aggregate labour productivity \nis determined by both the level of labour \nproductivity and their employment. The data \nshows that the bottom performers account \nfor less than 1 % of total productivity in the \naverage two-digit industry, whereas the low \nperformers account for about 10 % (Berlingieri, \nCalligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac, 2019). This is \nthe result of both low levels of productivity and \nrelatively low employment shares driven, in \nturn, by the small average size of firms in these \ngroups. However, the potential productivity \ngains resulting from a hypothetical situation \nwhere the (weighted) average productivity \nin these two groups is equalised to the level \nof the (weighted) average productivity in the \ntypical firms group are significant.\n\nFigure 10-7 Share of gross output, value added and employment by productivity group\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019)\nNote: The figure reports the share of gross output (GO), value added (VA) and employment (L) in each group of the productivity \ndistribution (LP in top panel; MFP in bottom panel).

To \nanswer this question, it is necessary to better \nunderstand the characteristics of firms that are \nat the bottom of the productivity distribution, \nin particular in relation to firms at the top of \n\nthe distribution. The richness of the MultiProd \ndatabase, described in detail in Box 10-2, \nenables an investigation into the differences \nbetween firms in different productivity groups \nalong multiple dimensions. Two characteristics \nare found to be particularly informative of the \nnature of laggards: the firms\u2019 age and size.\n\nBOX 10-2 MultiProd: distributed microdata suitable \nfor the analysis of the entire productivity distribution\nImplementation of the MultiProd project, \nundertaken by the OECD, is based on \na standardised STATA routine that micro-\naggregates confidential firm-level data from \nproduction surveys and business registers, \nvia a distributed microdata analysis. This \nmethodology was pioneered in the early \n2000s in a series of cross-country projects \non firm demographics and productivity \n(Bartelsman et al., 2005; Bartelsman et \nal., 2009). The distributed micro-data \nanalysis involves running a common code in \na decentralised manner by representatives \nin national statistical agencies or experts in \ngovernments or public institutions who have \naccess to the national micro-level data. The \ncentrally designed, but locally executed, \nprogram codes generate micro-aggregated \ndata which are then sent back to the OECD \nfor comparative cross-country analysis.\n\nThe MultiProd programme relies on two \nmain data sources in each country. First, \nadministrative data or production surveys \n(PS) which contain all the variables needed \nfor productivity analysis but may be limited \nto a sample of firms. Second, business \nregisters (BR) which contain a more limited \nset of variables but for the entire population \nof firms. The BR is not needed when \nadministrative data on the full population \nof firms are available. When data come \nfrom a PS, however, the availability of the \n\nbusiness register substantially improves \nthe representativeness of results and, \nthus, their comparability across countries. \n\nIndeed, census and administrative data \nnormally cover the whole population of \nbusinesses with at least one employee. \nStill, these datasets do not always exist \nnor include all the information needed to \ncalculate productivity. In these cases, PS data \nmust be used. One of the big challenges of \nworking with firm-level production surveys \nis that the selected sample of firms might \nyield a partial and biased picture of the \neconomy. Thus, when available, BRs, which \ntypically contain the whole population of \nfirms, are used in MultiProd to compute \na population structure by year-sector-size \nclasses. This structure is then used to re-\nweight data contained in the PS in order to \nconstruct data that are as representative as \npossible of the whole population of firms \nand comparable across countries.\n\nMultiProd is one of the few datasets to \ninclude the population of firms for a large \nnumber of countries and therefore to be \nhighly representative of all parts of the \nproductivity distribution. This peculiarity \nmakes it particularly suitable to analyse the \nbottom part of the productivity distribution \nand allows for a closer look at laggard firms\u2019 \ncontribution to productivity slowdown. \n\n\n\n624\n\nIn terms of size, Figure 10-8 shows a positive \nrelationship between firm size and productivity, \nconfirming the theoretical prediction from \nMelitz (2003), and the empirical finding by \n\nBerlingieri et al. (2018) for manufacturing. \nIndeed, typical firms are 2.5 times bigger on \naverage than the bottom performers and \n1.3 times bigger than low performers. \n\nFigure 10-8 Average size by productivity (LP) groups\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019), 'Last but not least: laggard firms, technology diffusion and its \nstructural and policy determinants', Mimeo\nNote: The figure plots the average size (employment) in different groups of the LP distribution.

There may be \nseveral reasons why firms have a productivity \nlower than the typical firm. Firms at the bottom \nmay indeed be: (i) low-productivity firms that \nwould typically exit in a competitive market, \nthe so-called zombie firms (e.g. Caballero et \nal., 2008; Adalet McGowan et al., 2017); (ii) \nSMEs that by the nature of their governance (or \na life-style choice) are likely to remain small \nand have limited scope for productivity growth \n\n(e.g. local services); but also (iii) firms entering \nthe economy, which are likely to operate below \ntheir productivity potential during the first \nstage of their development.\n\nThe characteristics illustrated above are \naverages within the groups and thus highlight \ndifferences across groups but mask such within-\ngroup heterogeneity. However, they illustrate \na key point for the analysis of laggards: the \nlow tail of the productivity distribution is \npartly composed of young and small firms \n\nIn terms of age, laggards are younger than \nfirms in the median group, as illustrated in \nFigure 10-9. In addition, Berlingieri, Calligaris, \nCriscuolo and Verlhac (2019) confirm these \n\ndifferences in a regression framework allowing \nfor a comparison of firms in the same country, \nindustry and year.\n\nFigure 10-9 Average age by productivity (LP) performance groups \n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019), 'Last but not least: laggard firms, technology diffusion and its \nstructural and policy determinants', Mimeo\nNote: The figure plots the average age in different groups of the productivity distribution.

Therefore, the \ngroup of laggards is partly composed of firms \nthat might only transit through the bottom \nof the productivity distribution to become \nhigh performers in the future. Pointing to the \ncoexistence amongst laggards of firms with \npersistently low productivity (type (i) and \n(ii) above) and firms with temporarily low \n\nproductivity but with high potential (type iii) \nis of primary importance for policy. It suggest \nthat policies which aim to raise the productivity \nof laggards could matter for aggregate \nproductivity and could be complementary to \npolicies that allow the exit of zombie firms, \ne.g. efficient bankruptcy legislation, efficient \nfinancial systems, etc. \n\n4.  The role of business dynamism in the \nproductivity gap\n\nThe age difference between laggards and \nmore-productive firms raises the question \nabout the connection between the existence \nof a large tail of low-productivity firms and \nbusiness dynamism in the economy.\n\nTo answer this question, Berlingieri, Calligaris, \nCriscuolo and Verlhac (2019) apply the Melitz \nand Polanec (2015) dynamic decomposition of \nproductivity growth to each productivity group. \nIn this approach, the productivity growth of \neach group is decomposed into the following \ncomponents: the contribution of incumbent \nfirms (further decomposed into the change \nin the unweighted average productivity of \nincumbents and the change in the efficiency of \nresource allocation), and the contributions of \nentering and exiting firms. \n\nResults of this decomposition are reported \nin Figure 10-10. The main take-away is that \nentry and exit account for a significant share \nof the laggards\u2019 productivity growth. Entrants \nand exiting firms transit through the group of \nlaggards when entering and exiting the economy \nand, therefore, most of the firm churning occurs \nat the bottom. While for more productive groups \nthe most important contribution comes by the \naverage growth of incumbents\u2019 productivity, \n\nthe reallocation term accounts for most of the \ngrowth of the bottom performers. In addition, \nwhile in the rest of the distribution, entry and exit \nplay a very marginal role, in the bottom tail of \nthe productivity distribution they are significant \ncomponents of the overall productivity growth. \nThe positive contribution of exit reveals that \nfirms exiting the economy are generally less \nproductive than the average surviving firms, \nsuggesting a healthy market selection. In the \nsame way, the negative contribution of entry \nsuggests that newly created firms are also less \nproductive than surviving ones, which explains \nthe age difference observed previously.\n\nOverall, the results presented so far stress \nthe peculiarities of the bottom part of the \nproductivity distribution, i.e. A more diverse \nenvironment with respect to the rest of the \ndistribution, given the higher importance \nof entry, exit and reallocation of resources. \nThese results provide a new insight into the \nnature of laggards and convey important \npolicy implications. However, the importance \nof business dynamism for laggards suggests \nthat the secular decline of business dynamism, \nthe productivity slowdown and the poor \nperformance of productivity growth observed \nover the last decade may be interrelated.\n\n\n\n627\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nThe secular decline in business dynamism \ntakes various forms, but numerous studies \nhave highlighted declining trends in entry \nrates, and this is considered as one of the \ntop signs of such a decline (Haltiwanger et \nal., 2015). In particular, declines in entry \nrates have been prominent in the USA, as \ndocumented by Decker et al. (2016) (and \nby a number of subsequent publications) \nusing the US Census Bureau\u2019s Longitudinal \nBusiness Database (LBD). Decker et al. (2016) \nshow a marked decline of entry rates over \nthe period 1980-2012. Other countries, \nsuch as Australia, Canada and Portugal, \nhave experienced declines in entry rates. In \nparticular, Bakhtiari (2017) reveals patterns \n\nof declining dynamism in Australia over the \nperiod 2002-2015, which entail a decline in \nentry rates. Focusing on entry and exit rates \nover almost 30 years (1984-2012), Macdonald \n(2014) reveals a downward trend in entry \nrates in industries in Canada. Sarmento and \nNunes (2010) evaluate the entrepreneurship \nperformance of Portugal, highlighting that \nthe country has also experienced a relevant \ndecline in dynamism.\n\nCalvino, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019) provide \nadditional evidence of declining entry rates, \n reported in Figures 10-11 and 10-12. These \n figures illustrate two key facts: (i) overall, busi-\nness dynamism has been steadily declining in \n\nFigure 10-10 Melitz and Polanec decomposition by LP performance group\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019), 'Last but not least: laggard firms, technology diffusion and its \nstructural and policy determinants', Mimeo\nNote: The figure plots the Melitz and Polanec decomposition in different groups of the productivity distribution. In particular, the \nproductivity distribution has been split into five groups: 1st to 10th percentile, 10th to 40th, 40th to 60th, 60th to 90th, and 90th to 100th. \nManufacturing and non-financial market services only.

The bars in \nthis figure are computed in the following way: first gains are aggregated across industries within country and productivity bins using \nemployment shares of the industry in the economy. Subsequently, a simple average is computed across years within each country-\nproductivity bin. Finally, the median is computed over countries, separately for each group.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter10/figure_10-10.xlsx\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\nWithin-growth Covariance term Entry component Exit component \n\nBottom performers Low performers Typical firms High performers Top performers\n\nCo\nnt\n\nri\nbu\n\nti\non\n\n t\no \n\nLP\n g\n\nro\nw\n\nth\n (p\n\ner\nc.\n\n p\noi\n\nnt\ns)\n\n\n\n628\n\na large number of countries; and (ii) this phe-\nnomenon is pervasive, affecting most industries \nto some extent. In addition, the authors explore \npossible drivers of the decline in business \ndynamism and highlight four groups of causes \u2013 \nin addition to cyclical factors affecting dynamism \nin the short run. Globalisation, demographic \nfactors, technological change and changes in the \nregulatory framework are all likely to contribute \nto declining business dynamism.\n\nDeclining entry rates are of particular concern \ngiven the importance of firm dynamics for \nproductivity growth, especially at the bottom \nof the productivity distribution. A corollary of \nresults presented in Figure 10-10 indicates that \nthe process of firm churning, i.e. firm entry and \nexit, determines the nature and composition of \nthe group of laggards. Firm entry is profoundly \n\nassociated with experimentation, enabling \nnew firms to compete with incumbents, \nintroduce innovation and gain market shares \nwhen successful. Market selection induces low \nproductivity and non-profitable firms to exit the \nmarket so that resources can be used in more \nproductive firms. Dynamic markets can be \ncharacterised by a high degree of experimen-\ntation, the productivity-enhancing selection of \nprofitable firms and the scale-up of these firms \n(in terms of productivity, market shares and/\nor employment). Therefore, another facet of \neconomic dynamism, of particular importance for \nthe future of productivity, can be characterised \nby the extent to which the improvement of \nproductivity by firms at the bottom of the \nproductivity distribution is conditional on \nsurvival, through innovation, as well as imitation, \ntechnology adoption and knowledge diffusion.\n\nFigure 10-11 Contributions to changes in entry rates\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Calvino, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019), 'Declining business dynamism', Mimeo\nNote: This figure reports, for each country, changes in entry rates between 2000-2015 due to variations within sectors ('within sector' \ncomponent), due to changes in the share of industries with different levels of dynamism ('between-sectors' component), and due to the \ncovariance between changes in a sector weight and its level of dynamism ('cross-change' term).

Laggards catching up\nThe capacity of laggards, generally smaller and \nyounger, to improve their productivity over time \nis a potential driver of future productivity growth. \nYoung firms in their first stage of development \noperating below their efficiency levels are indeed \nmore responsive to productivity shocks (Decker \net al., 2018) and some may have the potential \nto become the future productivity frontier. \nHence, the rest of this section evaluates the \nextent to which laggards are catching up with \nthe national frontier.\n\nNeo-Schumpeterian growth theory (e.g. Aghion \nand Howitt, 2006; Acemoglu et al., 2006) and \nmodels of competitive diffusion (e.g. Jovanovic \n\nand MacDonald, 1994) predict productivity \nconvergence: laggard firms should grow \nfaster, given the larger stock of unexploited \ntechnologies and knowledge that they can \nreadily implement. Yet, the rising productivity \ngap between frontier firms and the rest, and \nespecially laggards, questions whether ongoing \ntransformations of the economy have affected \nthe strength of this catch-up effect. A lack of \ndiffusion stemming from relatively high costs \nfor laggard firms to adapt to the new digital/\nknowledge-intensive economy, or from rising \nbarriers in adopting technology due to a lack of \nabsorptive capacity, may be a significant driver \nof the productivity divergence.\n\n\n\n630\n\nBOX 10-3 Measuring the strength of the neo-\nSchumpeterian catch-up effect and its determinants\nThe \u2018catch-up effect\u2019 has been widely \ndocumented in the literature (e.g. Griffith \net al., 2004; Bartelsman et al., 2008). \nEmpirical studies have confirmed the \nexistence of a catch-up effect both at the \nfirm level (Griffith et al., 2009; Bartelsman \net al., 2008; Andrews et al., 2015; \nAndrews et al., 2016) and at the industry \nlevel (Nicoletti and Scarpetta, 2003; Saia \net al., 2015). \n\nTesting the existence of the catch-\nup effect implies testing for a positive \nassociation between the distance to the \nfrontier at time t - 1 and productivity \ngrowth between t - 1 and t, for surviving \nfirms. The following specification is the \nstarting point of the analysis: \n\n\u00dePcjq,t = \u03b1 + \u00df\u2081g\u03b1pcjq,t-1 + \u03bb\u00dePFcjq,t + \u0431ct + \n\u03c4j + \u0404cjq,t\n\nPcjq,t denotes the measured average \nproduc-tivity (LP or MFP) in country c, \nindustry j, productivity performance \ngroup q (productivity bins (p(0-10) and \np(10-40)) and year t. \u00dePFcjq,t is then \nthe annual (log) productivity growth \nof firms belonging to the bottom 40 % \nof the productivity distribution at time \nt - 1, whereas \u00dePFcjq,t the annual (log) \nproductivity growth of firms at the \nnational frontier in t, defined as the top \n\n10 % of the productivity distribution \nin each country-2-digit industry-year. \nMoreover, g\u03b1pcjq,t-1 is the productivity gap \nat time t - 1, modelled as the distance \nin the level between (log) productivity in \neach country-industry-productivity bin-\nyear in the bottom 40 % of the productivity \ndistribution and (log) productivity in the \ncorresponding country-industry-year in \nthe top 10 %. Productivity growth can \nbe affected by macroeconomic shocks \nat the country level and by industry \ncharacteristics, possibly correlated with \nthe explanatory variables. To control for \nthem, the error term in (12) is allowed to \ninclude country-year and industry fixed \neffects: \u0431ct + \u03c4j. The existence of a catch-\nup effect is confirmed if \u00df\u2081 > 0. \n\nBerlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and \nVerlhac (2019) extend this equation to \nuncover factors that can affect the catch-\nup. The following equation is estimated: \n\n\u00dePcjq,t =  \u03b1 + \u00df\u2081g\u03b1pcjq,t-1 + \u00df\u2082 (g\u03b1pcjq,t-1 x \nXcjq,t-1) + pXcjq,t-1 + \u03bb\u00dePFcjq,t + \u0431ct + \n\u03c4j + \u0404cjq,t\n\nXcjq,t-1 includes all main variables of interest, \nreflecting either firms\u2019 characteristics or \nstructural factors affecting the strength. \nThe paper focuses mainly on structural \nindustry characteristics Xj. \n\nBerlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac \n(2019) confirm the existence of a catch-up effect \nfor laggards and focus on the determinants of \nconvergence forces and undermining factors. \nMore specifically, based on an econometric \n\nframework derived from the neo-Schumpeterian \nconcept of convergence, they confirm that \nlaggards catch up with the national frontier. The \nmethodology is outlined in Box 10-3. \n\n\n\n631\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nThe analysis in the study confirms a positive \nrelationship between the productivity gap and \nthe productivity growth of laggards, indicating \nthe existence of convergence among firms, even \nat the bottom of the distribution. The existence \nof a catch-up effect is a necessary condition for \nlaggards to exit the group of low-productivity \nfirms and confirms that, on average, laggard \nfirms have the potential to significantly improve \ntheir productivity. The results also show that \nyounger laggard firms catch up more rapidly \n(although this result is only available for \na subset of countries and the age variable is \nonly available for 7 out of 13 countries). This \n\nsuggests that the younger the group of laggards, \nthe higher the potential for productivity growth \nat the bottom of the distribution through \nknowledge and technology diffusion.\n\nFocusing on spillovers from the global \nproductivity frontier, Andrews et al. (2016) \ndocument a decline in the speed of catching \nup, pointing to a breakdown in the diffusion \nmachine (see also the discussion in Criscuolo, \n2018). Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and \nVerlhac (2019) also find that convergence \nforces driving productivity gains of laggards \nhave weakened over time (Figure 10-13). \n\nFigure 10-13 Catch-up over time\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019)\nNote: The figure represents the estimates for catch-up effect over time.

While the neo-\nSchumpeterian catch-up effect is a significant \ndriver of productivity growth, the diffusion \nof innovation does not occur automatically, \nbut requires a costly process of adoption, \nconditioned by firms\u2019 capabilities and incentives \nto learn from the most innovative ones (see \nGriffith et al., 2004, for instance). In addition, \nthe digital transformation and transition to \nan economy based on ideas seem to have \nintensified the role of firms\u2019 capabilities and \nincentives (Andrews et al., 2016), thus raising \nadditional obstacles to a broad diffusion of \ntechnology and knowledge. This transformation \nof the economy expands the scope for \nproductivity growth but also brings with it \nseveral challenges. It increases the average \nlevel and the composition of skill requirements \nand the need for complementary investments \nin both tangible and intangible assets (software, \ndatabase, management, etc.), and it requires \nhigher levels of absorptive capacity for adopting \nmore complex technologies and innovations.\n\nTo test whether this transformation may be \nlinked to the slowdown in diffusion, Berlingieri, \nCalligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019) \ninvestigate differences in the speed of catch-up \nbetween sectors characterised by different levels \n\nof digital and skill intensity. Several dimensions \nare explored: First, industries are classified into \ndigital- and non-digital-intensive, based on the \ntaxonomy proposed by Calvino et al. (2018). \nSecond, a number of sub-indicators of digital \nintensity are considered: (i) investment intensity \nin ICT equipment; (ii) investment intensity in \nsoftware and databases; (iii) ICT goods as \nintermediate inputs; and iv) ICT services as \nintermediate inputs. Third, sectoral differences \nin skill requirements are also explored using \nindicators of: (i) ICT skill intensity; and (ii) the \nshare of hours worked by high-skilled workers. \nFinally, services are divided into knowledge-\nintensive (KIS) and less-knowledge-intensive \nindustries (LKIS). The association of industry \ncharacteristics and the speed of diffusion is \nevaluated using the methodology presented \nin Box 3. All results overwhelmingly point in \nthe same direction: in more digital-intensive \nand more knowledge-intensive industries, \nlaggards catch up with the productivity frontier \nmore slowly. While a greater use of digital \ntechnologies and knowledge may be beneficial \nfor overall productivity growth, nonetheless they \nseem to push towards divergence in productivity, \nespecially in digital- and knowledge-intensive \nindustries. On the contrary, laggards belonging to \nless digital- and knowledge-intensive industries \nare catching up faster with the frontier.\n\nTo summarise, laggard firms catch up at a lower \nspeed in industries characterised by a high \nlevel of digitalisation and knowledge intensity, \nsuggesting that they face higher obstacles to \ngrowth. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest \nthat digitalisation and the transition to an \neconomy based on ideas, although potentially \nbeneficial for overall growth, may not benefit all \nfirms equally. This in turn points to the existence \nof barriers to technology and knowledge \ndiffusion raised by these recent mega-trends. \nNot having the necessary absorptive capacity to \nlearn from the frontier, laggards struggle more \nto catch up in industries where digitalisation, \nintangibles and knowledge matter the most.\n\n\n\n633\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nInterestingly, Berlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and \nVerlhac (2019) emphasise the direct connection \nbetween slower diffusion and productivity \ndispersion and show that industries characterised \nby a slower catch-up also display higher levels \n\nof dispersion. These results also echo the finding \nby Calvino and Criscuolo (2019) who show \nthat entry rates, and more generally business \ndynamism, have been declining faster in digital-\nintensive sectors, as illustrated in Figure 10-14.\n\nFigure 10-14 Trends in entry rates for digital-intensive vs. other sectors\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Calvino and Criscuolo (2019)\nNote: The figures report average within country-industry trends, based on the year coefficients of regressions within country-\nsector, with and without interaction with the digital-intensity dummy.

A framework and analysis of the role of policy\n\nDigital-intensive sectors experience faster \ndeclines in entry rates, and laggards in these \nsectors catch up with the national frontier more \nslowly than less-digital-intensive industries. \nGiven the importance of young firms\u2019 scale-up \nfor the future of productivity, this calls for an \ninvestigation into the potential role of policies \nin helping laggards overcome such obstacles. \nThis section provides a framework for policy \nresponses, focusing first on policies that can \ninfluence entry rates in digital-intensive industries \n\nbefore outlining policy areas that could influence \nthe speed of diffusion and catch-up.\n\n6.1 Policies and business dynamism\n\nCalvino and Criscuolo (2019) review policies that \ncan encourage entrepreneurship and propose \na guiding framework for policymakers. This \nframework and the methodology are presented \nin Box 10-4. Entry rates are related to the \nsupply (quantity) and quality of entrepreneurs \n\n\n\n634\n\nin a country. In this context, human capital, \neducation \u2013 in terms of educational attainment \nbut also of quality of the education system \u2013 \nand training workers play an important role and \npolicymakers can influence these outcomes with \nthe appropriate policy instruments. \n\nThe availability of capital, especially seed \nand early-stage financing but also to some \nextent bank loans, is crucial as it enables those \npotential entrepreneurs with the financial \nmeans needed to start their venture. In order \nto enter the market, such entrepreneurs need \nto have the right incentives and expected \npositive returns on their project. This is also \nlinked to the possibility of successfully listing \ntheir company on the stock markets. \n\nPotential entrepreneurs also need to be \nable to set up their business easily, which is \npossible when regulatory entry barriers and \nadministrative burdens are low. Once entry has \noccurred, new firms need to face a level playing \n\nfield and be given equal opportunities with \nrespect to other incumbent firms. Important \nlevers in this context are related to business \nregulations, efficiency in the enforcement of \ncontracts, and innovation support measures. \nFinally, entrepreneurs must be able to \nexperiment as this is a key feature of the creative \ndestruction process. Policy related to the cost \nof reallocation (such as employment protection \nlegislation) and to the cost of failure (efficiency \nof bankruptcy regulation) are important levers \nthat policymakers can influence.\n\nA summary of the econometric results of the \nstudy is presented in Figure 10-15. A positive \n(negative) coefficient is to be interpreted as an \nindication of the fact that the particular policy \nunder investigation is positively (negatively) \nrelated to entry rates in digital-intensive \nsectors. In other words, an improvement along \nthe particular policy setting examined are \nfound to have a positive (negative) association \nwith business dynamism in these sectors.\n\nBOX 10-4 Policies and entry rates: \nmethodological framework \n\nThe main approach used to estimate the \nextent to which policy and institutional \nfactors influence business dynamism \nin digital-intensive sectors follows the \nmethodology proposed by Rajan and \nZingales (1998). In particular, the basic \nintuition of this approach is that some \nsectors may be more exposed than \nothers to the effect of certain national \npolicies or framework conditions due to \nsome of their (technological or structural) \ncharacteristics. Identifying the impact \nof policies is therefore based on this \ndifferential exposure of sectors to policy. \n\nIn this context, the approach is adapted \nusing as the exposure variable the same \n\ndigital-intensity measure used in the rest \nof this paper. This allows for an assessment \nof the extent to which different policies \nhave a differential role for business \ndynamics mediated by digital intensity. \nThe main model estimated becomes: \n\nEntryRatec,s,t =  \u03b2 x Policyc,t x Digitals +  \nKc x \u0398t + Ys + \u03b5c,s,t\n\nwhere EntryRate identifies the log of entry \nrates, Policy refers alternatively to each of \nthe policy variables described above, Digi-\ntal is the digital-intensity indicator used in \nthe rest of the paper; c indicates countries, \nt year, and s sectors.\n\n\n\n635\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nFigure 10-15 Entry rates and policies\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Calvino, F. and Criscuolo, C.

Potentially significant \nbarriers to adoption \u2013 hindering a wide diffusion \nof the benefits associated with technological \nprogress \u2013 include the rapidly changing demand \nfor skills in the economy inducing skill shortages \nin high-skilled jobs, costly complementary \ninvestments to technology, and a lack of \nabsorptive capacity.\n\nBerlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac \n(2019) explore three policy areas where policies \ncould be effective in increasing the speed of \ncatch-up: skills, finance, and R&D support. First, \nthe analysis focuses on policy objectives and \ninstruments related to changing skill needs in the \neconomy, by looking at skill mismatch, under-\nqualification, the share of adults participating \nin training and expenditure in training targeting \nthe unemployed. A good match between skills \ndemand and supply is associated with a faster \nrate of catch-up, and there is evidence that this \npositive association is stronger in digital- and \nskill-intensive industries. Conversely, a higher \nshare of underqualified workers in the economy \nis associated with a lower speed of catch-up, \nespecially in industries that are more digital- and \nskill-intensive. The results also provide evidence \nthat training adults may be effective in increasing \nthe speed of catch-up, and that training the low-\nskilled may be particularly effective.\n\nNext, SMEs\u2019 access to finance is investigated, \nas it can be informative about the financial \nconditions that laggards are facing \u2013 given \nthe correlation between size and productivity. \nThe results show that diffusion is more rapid \nin countries where a larger share of lending is \ndirected towards SMEs and more specifically \nin industries where investments in digital \ntechnologies are more prevalent. Conversely, \nless-favourable financing conditions for SMEs, \n\nrevealed by a higher interest rate spread \nbetween SMEs and large firms, are associated \nwith a lower speed of catch-up only in \nsectors that require higher investment in ICT \nequipment and software and databases. These \nresults suggest that appropriate financial \nsupport relaxing financial constraints could \nhelp unleash the potential of laggards to catch \nup. However, given the heterogeneity of this \ngroup, care should be taken over the design of \nsuch policies. \n\nFinally, suggestive evidence shows that \nsupport to business R&D through direct \ngovernment funding may encourage diffusion \nin digital- and skill-intensive industries. While \nfurther research is needed to confirm this \nlink, it seems in line with the \u2018second face of \nR&D\u2019 unveiled by Griffith et al. (2004). Not \nonly does R&D foster innovation, but it also \nenhances technology transfers by increasing \nfirms' absorptive capacity. By engaging in R&D, \nfirms accumulate a tacit knowledge that allows \nthem to understand and assimilate existing \ntechnology and innovations.\n\n6.3  Trade, trade openness \nand catch-up\n\nThe theoretical and empirical economic \nliterature has extensively discussed the role \nof international trade on economic growth, \nconvergence and catching up at the macro level. \nInevitably, the dynamics are more complex when \nlooking at the issue at the micro (i.e. firm) level. \n\nFirst, empirical research has shown that firms \nwhich engage in exports are more productive \nthan non-exporting firms, for two alternative \n\u2013 but not mutually exclusive \u2013 reasons. First, \nengaging in trading activities involves both per-\nunit and fixed costs; as a result, there is a self-\nselection into exporting, so that only the most \ncompetitive firms engage in export activity \n(Melitz, 2003). Recent analysis of EU firms has \nshown that new exporting firms (i.e. those that \n\n\n\n637\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nHowever, exporting firms are different from non-\nexporters in other dimensions, too. Mayer and \nOttaviano (2008) showed that exporters are \ngenerally bigger, more profitable, more capital-\nintensive and more productive than non-exporters \n(Mayer and Ottaviano, 2008). Figure 10-16 shows \nthat this is indeed the case in the EU1. According \n\n1 Data come from the CompNet Database. This database provides sectoral distributions for a number of variables and indicators \nbased on firm-level data provided by national sources (statistical institutes or national central banks). The 6th vintage of the \nCompNet Database, released in November 2018, covers 19 EU countries. Of these countries, 13 also have data on the export \nstatus of firms which are relevant in this section. For more information: http://www.comp-net.org\n\nto CompNet data, over the period 2002-2016, \nexporting firms in the countries covered here \nare bigger, on average (in terms of both number \nof employees and turnover), approximately \n30-40 % more productive (in terms of labour \nproductivity and total factor productivity), and \nmore capital-intensive than non-exporting firms. \n\nhave just started to export) are, on average, \nabout 15 % more productive than non-exporting \nfirms in the same sector (ECB, 2017). Second, \nfirms \u2018learn by exporting\u2019 and are more likely \nto innovate; they also have access to cheaper \n\nand higher-quality inputs (Mayer, Melitz and \nOttaviano, 2014). In addition, exposure to \ntrade leads to reallocation of resources across \nfirms towards the most productive ones, with \na positive impact on aggregate productivity.\n\nFigure 10-16 Premia of exporters over non-exporters in selected EU countries, \n2002-2016\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Commission, DG for Economic and Financial Affairs based on CompNet Database\nNote: The chart shows the coefficient of the export dummy, indicating whether the firm is an exporter or not, from OLS \nregressions where the dependent variable is the log of the performance indicators, controlling for country, time and sector \ndummies.

Recent research has shown that GVC \nparticipation can stimulate productivity growth \nthrough different channels. These include: (i) \nspecialisation in the activities where they are \nmost productive and outsource the others; (ii) \naccess to a larger variety of cheaper, higher-\nquality and higher-technology goods as inputs; \n(iii) knowledge spillovers from foreign firms; and \n(iv) access to larger markets and competition \nlead to the growth of the most productive firms \n(see Criscuolo and Timmis, 2017).\n\nNot only are exporters profoundly different from \nnon-exporters, even in the same sector, as shown \nin Figure 10-16, but a large share of exports \ncan be accounted for by just a handful of firms \n(\u2018the happy few\u2019 in Mayer and Ottaviano, 2008), \nwhich therefore also have great influence on the \naggregate performance and growth potential of \nregions, countries and sectors4. \n\nAs mentioned above, there is a self-selection \ninto exporting, implying that only those firms \nthat are productive enough to overcome the \ncosts associated with engaging in trade will \nstart exporting. Therefore, there is a \u2018productivity \nthreshold\u2019 below which firms would not engage \nin trade, and this differs across countries and \nis related to a number of macroeconomic and \ninstitutional factors5. Such \u2018new exporters\u2019 \nproductivity premium\u2019, in particular, tends to be \n\n2 For this reason, this rough estimate is also not comparable to the 15 % premium mentioned at the beginning of this sub-\nsection, which referred to new exporters only.\n\n3 In this respect, GVC participation does not refer only to offshoring and trading intermediate goods but also to indirect \nbackward and forward linkages.\n\n4 Meyer and Ottaviano (2008), cit. and Altomonte, C. and B\u00e9k\u00e9s (2016) Measuring competitiveness in Europe: resource \nallocation, granularity and trade, Bruegel Blueprint Series, Brussels, Belgium.\n\n5 See ISGEP (2008) \u2018Understanding cross-country differences in exporter premia: comparable evidence for 14 countries\u2019, \nReview of World Economics 144(4) pp. 596-635 and Hallward-Driemeier, M., Iarossi, G. and Sokoloff, K.L.

The explanation is intuitive: first, GDP per \ncapita is correlated with productivity; therefore, in \ncountries with higher average productivity, non-\nexporting firms are closer to the \u2018benchmark\u2019 set \nby internationalised firms. Second, converging \neconomies usually have less-integrated markets \nwhich allow low-productivity non-exporters to \nstay in the market. Moreover, better institutions \nreduce the trade costs firms face (in particular, \nfixed costs, which particularly affect self-\nselection into exporting), and institutional quality \nand efficiency are generally correlated with GDP \nper capita. As a result, in countries with lower \nGDP per capita, highly productive export-oriented \nfirms (that can afford the costs associated with \nexporting) will coexist in the same sector with \nlow-productivity domestically oriented firms.\n\nWhat are the implications of the discussion above \non firms\u2019 productivity divergence and catch-up? At \nleast within sectors, increases in trade exposure \n(for example, as a result of trade liberalisation or \nother measures facilitating firms\u2019 and markets\u2019 \ntrade openness) should induce reallocation of \nlabour and capital towards the most productive \nfirms, while gradually driving less efficient firms \nout of the market. In principle, this would reduce \nwithin-sector productivity dispersion and foster \nhigher productivity. However, if policies hinder \nproduct, labour and capital market flexibility, \nthe result might be less clear cut since the \nreallocation process might not take place. \n\nAs regards global value chains, not only \nparticipation in GVC but, in particular, higher \ncentrality in the production networks appears to \n\n\n\n639\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nbe associated with higher productivity growth; \nthis is especially true for non-frontier firms \nand economies6. At the same time, the actual \nstructure of GVC has been evolving over the \nlast couple of decades, and the centrality and \nimportance of eastern European countries in \nparticular has increased since their accession \n\n6 \u2018Centrality\u2019 in GVC measures influence within a production network due to both direct and indirect trade linkages.\n7 Criscuolo, C. and Timmis, J.

This implies that higher integration \nand influence in GVC can foster firms\u2019 catch-\nup process and might suggest that it can also \nexplain, at least in part, the ongoing catching \nup of eastern European countries in terms of \nproductivity and GDP per capita. \n\nFigure 10-17 New exporters\u2019 productivity premium and GDP per capita in selected \nEU countries, 2002-2016 \n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: European Commission, DG for Economic and Financial Affairs based on CompNet Database and Eurostat\nNote: The new exporters\u2019 productivity premium is defined here as the difference between (log) labour productivity of new \nexporters (defined as the group of firms which exported in year t and t+1 but did not export in t-1) and non-exporters.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter10/figure_10-17.xlsx\n\nHR CZ\n\nFI\n\nFR\n\nDE\n\nHU\n\nIT\n\nLT\n\nPL\n\nRO\n\nSK\nSI\n\nSE\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n6 26 46 66 86 106 126 146\n\nEx\npo\n\nrt\ner\n\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n\niv\nit\n\ny \npr\n\nem\niu\n\nm\n\nGDP per capita (PPS)\n\n\n\n640\n\n7.

At \nthe same time, they should promote innovation \nat the frontier and diffusion of technological \nadvances from leaders to laggards.\n\nThis subsection will focus on product and labour \nmarket policies as tools to foster business \ndynamism. The next subsections will focus on \ninnovation and skills policy as a tool to promote \ninnovation and technological diffusion, and we \nwill conclude with regulation and competition \npolicy as a tool to ensure a level-playing field.\n\nFostering business dynamism implies facili-\ntating business creation and firm growth and \n removing the obstacles to the exit of non-prof-\nitable firms. Facilitating business creation is not \nonly about reducing the time, cost and number \nof procedures to create a business \u2013 where EU \ncountries have made important improvements \nin recent years, although many still underper-\nform compared to their main competitors8 \u2013 but \nalso about improving the chances of survival \nand growth of young and promising startups. \n\nTo this end, improving access to finance is one of \nthe key priorities. Sources of funding alternative to \nbank finance (e.g. crowdfunding, venture capital, \nprivate equity, private placements and issuance \nof debt) are especially important for SMEs, young \ninnovative firms and startups. These firms in \nparticular often struggle to get funding for their \ninvestments from banks due to higher perceived \nrisks, and thus can benefit from better access \nto market-based sources of finance. Innovative \nfirms with high potential might be driven out of \nthe market \u2013 or not enter at all \u2013 not as a result of \na well-functioning resource-reallocation process \nbut because of existing barriers. However, the \nmarket for alternative sources of finance is \nstill underdeveloped in Europe compared to its \nmain competitors: for instance, in 2016, total \nventure capital investments in the EU equalled \napproximately EUR 4 billion compared to EUR \n2.15 billion in Canada and over EUR 60 billion in \nthe USA9. Moreover, recent survey data confirm \nthat access to finance is seen as a barrier to \ninvestment more by younger companies than by \nestablished businesses10. \n\nTo address these issues, in September 2015, \nthe European Commission launched the \nCapital Markets Union (CMU) which will provide \nbusinesses with a greater choice of funding at \nlower costs, offer new opportunities for savers \nand investors and make the financial system \nmore resilient. The initiatives approved under the \nCMU include VentureEU, a pan-European venture \ncapital programme supported by the European \nCommission and the European Investment Fund \nand aimed at boosting investment in innovative \nstartups and scale-up companies across the EU. \n\n\n\n641\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nAddressing barriers to firm entry and growth, \nwhile further opening up to trade and foreign \ndirect investment (FDI), is important to promote \ncompetitive domestic markets. Pro-competitive \nproduct and service markets regulation \ncontributes to the efficient allocation of resources \nand functioning of supply chains. In addition, \nempirical studies have shown that growth in \nsales is a prime determinant of firm growth (in \nterms of employment)11. As a result, policies \nthat open up markets and facilitate access to \nconsumers can foster firm growth and avoid \nthe \u2018small firm trap\u2019. Moreover, there is a trade-\noff associated with policies, laws and measures \nthat are size-dependent (e.g. legal thresholds \nimposing different employment rules based \non firm size; investment support for SMEs and, \nmore generally, preferential tax treatment). On \nthe one hand, these are important because of \nthe competitive disadvantage often faced by \nSMEs, especially micro firms. On the other hand, \nhowever, they might discourage firm growth. \n\nThe growth of the most efficient firms \u2013 and exit \nof the least efficient or \u2018zombie\u2019 ones \u2013 occurs \nthrough reallocation of capital and labour in \nthe economy. Hence, well-functioning labour \nmarkets and insolvency frameworks also play \na role. Labour market institutions that foster this \nreallocation not only have to deal with flexibility \nat the entry or exit, but also with a broader range \nof policies that facilitate geographic and industry \nmobility of workers. These include housing \nmarkets, well-functioning infrastructure services \nfor commuters, lifelong learning and retraining, \nto name but a few. Inefficient insolvency \nframeworks can instead trap resources in zombie \nfirms. Therefore, bankruptcy legislation and \njudicial efficiency also play an important role, \nas does the treatment of business failures by \nlegislation (e.g. second-chance rules). \n\n11 OECD (2017) Business Dynamics and Productivity, OECD Publishing, Paris.\n\nThe recent EU Directive on business insolvency \nwill contribute to improving insolvency frame-\nworks in the EU. It includes, among other things, \ncommon principles on early restructuring (which \nmay result in better recovery rates for lenders \nas well as helping companies to continue \ntheir activity); rules for a second chance for \nentrepreneurs (by reducing the period after \nwhich they can make a fresh start); and targeted \nmeasures for Member States to increase the \nefficiency of insolvency frameworks. \n\nPolicies facilitating trade have an important role \nto play for business dynamism and resource \nreallocation. Reducing trade barriers, including \nadministrative procedures at customs, facilitates \ntrade integration and is especially relevant to GVC \nintegration, where intermediate inputs are traded \nseveral times. In this respect, in the case of the EU, \nthis concerns not only the completion of the Single \nMarket but also agreements with third countries. \nMoreover, to avoid reinforcing existing gaps, policy \nshould not focus on the national champions and \nincumbent superstars, but rather promote intra-\nindustry competition and access to markets. \nOver the past five years, the EU has finalised \n(and, in some cases, started to implement) trade \nagreements with 15 countries, including Canada, \nSingapore, Japan and the Mercosur countries.\n\nIt must be highlighted, however, that there is \nno silver bullet for business dynamism, since \nsimilar policies can have very different impacts \non firms both across and within countries. \nAcross countries, different sectoral composition, \ninstitutions and even cultural differences \nmatter. Within countries, there can be important \nregional differences and specificities; in addition, \nthe business environment can weigh differently \non the operation and growth prospects of firms \nof different sizes. In this respect, for example, \nmedium and large businesses appear to be \nrelatively less affected than SMEs by a lack of \n\n\n\n642\n\naccess to, and the cost of, financing, as well as \nby crime, corruption and the anti-competitive \neffect of firms operating informally12. \n\n7.2  Fostering catching up: the role of \npublic expenditure in R&D\n\nAn additional policy area that can be \ninvestigated relates to innovation policies, \nand more specifically to government support \nto R&D. Griffith et al. (2004) unveil a \u2018second \nface of R&D\u2019 showing that it not only fosters \ninnovation, but also enhances technology \ntransfers because it increases firms\u2019 absorptive \ncapacity. By engaging in R&D, firms accumulate \na tacit knowledge that enables them to \nunderstand and assimilate existing technology \nand innovations. However, the concentration of \nbusiness expenditures in R&D (BERD) suggests \nthat low-productivity firms \u2013 generally younger \nand smaller \u2013 may also lag in terms of their \nefforts devoted to R&D. Accordingly, policies \nsupporting R&D expenditures could help \nlaggard firms develop their absorptive capacity. \n\nBerlingieri, Calligaris, Criscuolo and Verlhac (2019) \nlook at the role of government direct funding of \nbusiness expenditures in R&D (with contracts, \nloans, grants and subsidies) using two different \nmeasures. First, such direct funding is normalised \nby GDP to provide a comparable measure of the \nlevel of support across countries and over time. \nSecond, a measure of the composition (the source) \nof R&D funding is used, defined as the share of \nbusiness expenditure financed by the government \nover total BERD. In a nutshell, the authors\u2019 results \nshow that direct government support to busi-\nness expenditure in R&D is associated with faster \ncatch-up, providing evidence that direct funding \nof R&D projects through grants, subsidies or pro-\ncurements may effectively raise firms\u2019 absorptive \ncapacity as these might be more effective policies \nfor firms with growth potential to access support. \n\n12 Bartelsman et al. (2010), Cross-country and within-country differences in the business climate, International Journal of \nIndustrial Organisation 28.\n\nDirect public funding of business expenditure in \nR&D takes various forms, such as competitive \ngrants, debt financing (loans), risk-sharing \nmechanisms or public procurements, which \nmay be particularly relevant for laggards. \nFor instance, grants, loans and risk-sharing \nthrough credit guarantee schemes can reduce \nthe cost of R&D and improve access to finance \nfor otherwise financially constrained firms.\n\nR&D procurement creates a demand for \ntechnologies and services that might help young \ninnovative firms and can also provide early-stage \nfinancial support before the commercialisation \nphase (pre-commercialisation procurements \nof R&D). Each of these instruments may be \nefficient in promoting R&D business expenditure \nfor firms with growth potential, but such policies \nare also part of a broader policy mix that can \nreinforce the effectiveness of these instruments \nby exploiting their complementarities.\n\n7.3  Fostering catching up: the role \nof skills\n\nRecent OECD work investigates the effect \nof the allocation of human resources, using \nthe proportion of workers whose educational \nattainment level is well matched to the level \nrequired in their job. Results show that a good \nmatch between skills demand and supply is \nassociated with a higher speed of catch-up, and \nthere is evidence that this positive association is \nstronger in digital- and skill-intensive industries.\n\nThe study then focuses on the share of \nworkers who are underqualified, measured as \nthe proportion of workers whose educational \nattainment level is lower than that required \nin their job. Thus, this particular dimension of \nskills mismatch focuses on skills shortage. \nResults show that a lack of appropriate skills \n(as measured by educational attainment) in the \n\n\n\n643\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\nlabour force reduces the speed of catch-up and \nmight contribute to the widening productivity \ngap, possibly reflecting the fact that low-\nproductivity firms may struggle when competing \nfor talents. This negative association between \nskills mismatch and the strength of the catch-up \neffect is particularly strong in digital- and skill-\nintensive industries. This result corroborates \nthe view that changing skills requirements \nassociated with digitalisation of the economy \nand the growing importance of knowledge in the \nproduction of goods and services erect barriers \nto diffusion when such skills are in short supply.\n\nThe previously mentioned results suggest that \npolicies addressing skill mismatches through \nthe better allocation of workers and a greater \nsupply of appropriate skills could thus alleviate \nobstacles to diffusion. The same report focuses \non the effect of training employed adults, \nproxying for lifelong training, as well as that \nof targeted training provided in the context of \nactive labour market policies (ALMP). It shows \nthat both lifelong training and education support \ndiffusion, but without a significant difference \nin digital- and skill-intensive industries. In \naddition, it points to a positive relationship \nbetween training expenditure (from ALMP) and \nthe speed of catch-up, particularly for digital- \nand skill-intensive sectors.\n\nThe stronger association between the speed of \ndiffusion and higher spending in adult training \nin the context of ALMP rather than training \nworking adults could reflect the need for targeted \ntraining. Indeed, the results confirm that under-\nqualification of the workforce is hampering the \nprocess of diffusion. The higher participation \nof working adults in training allows them to \nadapt their skills to continuously changing skill \nrequirements. However, there is evidence that \nlow-skilled workers are less likely to participate \nin on-the-job training than other workers \n(Nedelkoska and Quintini, 2018). Conversely, \ntraining targeted at the unemployed or closely \nrelated groups (e.g. people who are inactive but \n\nwould like to work, and employed people who are \nat known risk of involuntary job loss) might better \ncontribute to reduce skills mismatch and might \ndisproportionately benefit low-skilled workers. \nPolicies aiming at enrolling low-skilled workers in \ntraining, as well as policies specifically designed \nto improve their literacy and numeracy skills (see \nWindisch, 2015, for a survey of such policies), \nmight contribute to lifting barriers to diffusion. \nIn addition, other instruments are available to \npolicymakers to reduce the incidence of skills \nmismatch. For example, McGowan and Andrews \n(2015) find that framework conditions, such as \nwell-designed product and labour markets and \nbankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise \nbusiness failures, are associated with lower skills \nmismatches, possibly because they reduce hiring \nand firing costs and allow smoother transition \nacross jobs and, thus, better reallocation of \nresources across firms. The digital transformation \nnot only alters the bundle of skills that is required, \nbut also changes more broadly the relative \ndemand of occupations, with some occupations \nbecoming more prevalent and in high demand \nwhile others decline. This requires training and \neducation policies that may be costly, reinforcing \nthe need to define possible and acceptable \ntransitions towards other occupations, while \nminimising the cost of such policies (Andrieu et \nal., 2019; Bechichi et al., 2019). \n\n7.4  Fostering supporting \nframework conditions\n\nPolicy has an important role in addressing \nmarket failures and, more generally, fostering \nsupporting framework conditions. High-quality \nregulation together with effective competition \npolicy can complement flexible product and \nlabour markets and innovation and skills policy \nby creating a level playing field.\n\nImproving the quality of regulation implies \nsimplifying and reducing regulatory costs \nwithout undermining the aims or benefits of \nthe legislation, whereas badly designed laws \n\n\n\n644\n\nand fragmented regulations act as a drag on \nthe business environment. Services markets in \nthe EU still present a number of inefficiencies \nthat are closely related to the fragmentation \nof product market regulation13. Policy reforms \naiming at simplifying product market regulation \nand completing the Single Market for services \nin the EU could help to unlock European growth \npotential notably by improving conditions for the \nservices sector to make a greater contribution \nto productivity growth. For instance, ensuring \nbetter homogeneity in regulation could allow \nICT to enter into non-digital sectors, thereby \nfostering the improvement of business models \nand potentially resource allocation14. \n\nMoreover, since investment in intangible capital \nis more sensitive to the regulatory framework \nthan investment in tangible capital (i.e. labour \nand product market regulation)15, improving \nregulatory quality could be particularly relevant \nfor the most innovative firms which also invest \nmore in intangibles. Indeed, Europe suffers \nfrom a persistent business innovation gap vis-\n\u00e0-vis the main competitors. For instance, new \nfirms fail to play a significant role in European \nindustry, especially in the high-tech sectors16. In \naddition to improving the regulatory framework \nand sound R&D and skills policies (as discussed \nin the previous section), strengthening the \ncooperation between academia and the \nbusiness economy could then help to turn high-\nquality research into business ideas. \n\nOne of the key elements for supporting \nframework conditions is sound and effective \ncompetition policy.

(2019). \u2018Competition policy for the digital era\u2019, European Commission, \n\nDirectorate-General for Competition.\n\nlandscape still presents many industries with \nexcessively high mark-ups, with persistent \nbarriers to the entry of new competitors, \nstressing the importance of strengthening \ncompetition policy17. In addition, although the \nEuropean framework of competition law has \nso far provided evidence of being sound and \nsufficiently flexible to protect competition in the \ndigital era, the very evolving nature of digital \nmarkets calls for vigilance18. There are at least \ntwo types of challenges for competition policy \nin the data economy: (i) the identification of the \nmarket to regulate (i.e. regional, national, EU \nSingle Market); and (ii) the presence of winner-\ntakes-all dynamics, since the first movers tend \nto have a substantial advantage over potential \nnew entrants, based on their learning. Without \nintervention, the market dynamics may lead \nto the creation of monopolies, while positive \nexternalities may reinforce this trend further. \n\nIt is therefore essential to protect competition \n\u2018for\u2019 the market and \u2018on\u2019 the market. To protect \nit for the market, policy should make sure that \nincumbents do not enjoy an unfair advantage and \nerect barriers to the entry of new competitors. \nIn the data economy, for example, this implies \nworking towards multi-homing, protocol and \ndata interoperability, and differentiation. To \nprotect competition on the market, policy must \nensure a level playing field so that firms enjoying \na dominant position do not use their rule-setting \npower to determine market outcomes. In sectors \nthat are open to international competition, \nthis also implies that safeguarding, inflating, \nor helping incumbents just because they are \n\u2018national champions\u2019 should be avoided. \n\n\n\n645\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 10\n\n8.

I consider these issues below.\n\n1.  The nature of the discussion\n\nBefore considering the arguments and \nassertions about the implications of evolving \nIT, it is worth thinking through the context in \nwhich those stories take place. Followers of the \n\nmedia are well aware that there is a bias toward \nreporting stories that represent something new, \nespecially something new and dramatic. That \nincludes claims about developments that will \n\nSummary\n\nThis contribution follows the recent public \ndebate on the changes across industrial \ncountries that stem from information \ntechnology, including notions of artificial \nintelligence and its implications for how work \nis performed. While acknowledging the size \nand pervasiveness of these discussions, the \narticle discusses the core arguments related \nto the impact of information technology on the \nway businesses and organisations operate, \nhow these changes could translate to the \nlabour market, and other potential outcomes \nsuch as lower wages or unemployment.\n\nThe argument begins with an introduction \nto the two ways in which people tend \nto anticipate future developments. This \neither happens through estimates based \non prior experience (commonly known as \nforecasting) or through a belief in a real \nuncertainty of future developments and \nreliance on other kinds of evidence besides \n\ntraditional forecasts. The article maps the \nprojected impact of technological uptake \non the labour markets and reviews the \nempirical evidence. It touches upon many \nof the above-discussed trends, such as \nskill-biased technological change or routine-\nbiased technological change, and their \nimplications for skills demand. Applying an \nhistoric perspective, the article argues that \npredictions based on the past may be less \nrelevant in the current context. Although \nnew equipment and practices could \neliminate certain jobs, on balance they do \nnot necessarily destroy jobs because their \noverall effects on improving productivity and \noverall wealth create jobs elsewhere. \n\nTo understand why assumptions claiming \nthat the future is like the past are not correct \nand extrapolations from prior experiences \nare unlikely to be accurate predictors of the \nfuture, read this chapter.\n\n\n\n653\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\nhappen, even if there is little or no evidence of \nthem yet. We may notice these stories especially \nwhen they relate to health, e.g. epidemiological \nstudies showing that some particular food group \nis associated with either remarkably better or \nworse life outcomes. It is extremely difficult to \nrun a story that says, for example, \u2018still nothing \nnew in effective weight loss\u2019. A first question \nto ask is whether the apparent magnitude of \nthe stories of technological change reflects \na change in the nature of the media and public \ndiscourse rather than reflecting something \nabout the merits of the arguments themselves. \n\nThere have been changes in the media that might \nhelp create the impression that particular stories \nare more important than would have been the \ncase in the past, such as the fact that there are \nnow many more outlets for stories, including \n\nsocial media, where surprising or frightening \naccounts are repeated and reinforced over and \nover. There is also considerable expansion of \norganisations focused on public policy, especially \nthose businesses which advocate ideas that \nare important and support those that attract \nattention. Hosting discussions, producing reports, \ncommenting on media stories are standard \npractices for such organisations. Every major \nconsulting company now produces reports and \nmarkets their views on policy-related stories, \nincluding technology and workplace topics. \n\nThe fact that there is a great deal of discussion \nabout IT certainly suggests that it is a topic \nworth investigating, although it is not prima \nfacie evidence that the arguments which \nprovoke that discussion are correct. The truth \nis typically more boring than the speculations.\n\n2.  Anticipating the future\n\nAssessing the merits of arguments about \nthe potential effects of IT in the workplace or \nelsewhere should begin with thoughts about \nepistemology: what is it that we know, and \nhow can we know it? Specifically, how can \nwe distinguish reasonable belief from mere \nopinion? What constitutes knowledge is always \na pertinent question, but it is especially important \nin this context because of the unique nature of \nthe claims being made. They are claims about \nthe future rather than the present, although \nthey may well be informed by the present. \n\nThere are at least two quite different types of \nclaims about the future that are made in the \nsocial sciences. The first concerns probabilities \nand risk: we have very little idea about, for \nexample, whether my house will burn down but, \nbased on prior experience of houses like mine, \nwe can estimate with considerable accuracy \nwhat the odds of that are. \n\nForecasts move us from predictions about \ncommon events and about individual units in \na population to anticipating events that have \nnot happened before. They go a step further \nthan identifying average experiences in the \npast to extrapolate from the past. To predict, \nfor instance, the unemployment rate in a year\u2019s \ntime, they look back to previous unemployment \nrates and to variables that determined them \nor at least were associated with them. If \nthe model using those variables explained \na reasonable amount of the variation in \nprevious unemployment rates then we will \ntry to use it to extrapolate into the future. \nWe do so by assuming that the structure of \nthe model remains the same going forward \nor, in practical terms, that the coefficients of \nregression-related models in the future will be \nthe same as they are in the model. Assuming \nwe have more recent values for the variables \nin the model, we apply them to that model and \n\n\n\n654\n\ngenerate an estimate or forecast as to what \nthe unemployment rate will be in the future. \n\nA great advantage of this approach in terms of \nepistemology is that we have some ability to \nassess how accurate our forecast of the future \nis, based on how well our model has predicted \noutcomes in the past. \n\nThe downside of the approach is that the \nassessment of accuracy does not work, nor will \nthe model produce an accurate forecast, if the \nmodel\u2019s underlying structure (the relationship \nbetween the variables and the outcome being \nforecast) changes from the earlier period. \nFor example, economic forecasting models \nin the United States that proved remarkably \npredictive in the 1960s stopped being very \naccurate in the 1970s and after, apparently \nbecause of changes in the structure of the \neconomy. It took some time to recognise that \nchange, and the accuracy of the models never \nrecovered to their previous levels.\n\nThe second type of claim is one where we \nbelieve that there is true uncertainty about the \nfuture, where average experience in the past \nis not likely to continue into the future, and \nthe structure of forecasting models changes \nin ways that are not clear a priori. In this \ncontext, the concerns of epistemology become \nmuch more important. Other kinds of evidence \nbesides traditional forecasts also become \nmore important. For example, explanations \nthat have predicted well in the past, perhaps \nin different contexts, might be useful. The role \nof theory that has been supported over time \nby evidence becomes important. We might not \nnow have a good idea what the effects of new \ntechnologies will be in the future, for example, \nbut we might well believe that the effects of \nprevious technologies would be informative and \nthat principles like supply and demand will still \nbe relevant in explaining what they will be. Other \nevidence might include examples consistent \nwith the prediction in subsets of the population \n\nor trends in the direction of the prediction \n(e.g. leading companies are doing this).\n\nThe complication in assessing claims about \nthe influence of IT and AI is that most of the \nattention-getting claims are based on the \nassertion that the future is not like the past, \nthat the new developments in AI will change \nthe structure of the relationships such that \nextrapolations from prior experiences are \nunlikely to be accurate predictors of the future. \nWe might think of this as a double uncertainty: \nwe cannot say with any certainty what IT \ninnovations will look like in the future, let \nalone how they will affect the economy. Such \nclaims are difficult to assess in traditional ways \nbecause they do not have an empirical basis. \nWhen we cannot test how well explanations \nactually work \u2013 in this case because the events \nbeing explained have not yet happened \u2013 we \nare forced to use other kinds of assessments. \n\nThese other approaches rely on the structure \nof the arguments being made. A common \nstandard is whether the explanations are \ndeduced appropriately from principles that \nhave already been established, the standard \ndeductive-normative format for generating \nnormal science hypotheses. Beyond that, we \noften use criteria that are not well justified, \nsuch as ad hominem arguments \u2013 the person \nmaking the case has been right before or they \nare an \u2018expert\u2019 on the topic.\n\nIn recent decades, one of the more important \ndevelopments in business has been to come \nto grips with the problem of uncertainty. On \nthe one hand, we can never be certain about \nany aspect of the future, although we may \nbe confident that some aspects are good \nenough to plan on, such as the sun coming up \ntomorrow. But what can we do when we are \naware that our predictions or forecasts are \nnot very good? We use these concepts below \nto consider the merits of the arguments about \nthe future impact of AI.\n\n\n\n655\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\n3.  The nature of the claims\n\nA major complication in assessing the claims \nabout what AI might do to the workplace and \nto employment in particular is that there are \nso many of these claims. In many cases, the \nsame individuals have made quite different \nclaims over time, requiring some condensing \nand organising of them.\n\nThe place to begin is with a definition of AI. \nA standard for determining what a term \nmeans is that it should not overlap with other \nterms that refer to similar concepts. The \ncommon and arguably standard definition of \nAI in dictionaries and elsewhere dates from \na 1956 symposium of cognitive scientists who \nproposed a research programme to investigate \nit (Minsky, 1994). The general idea at the time \nwas that AI is machine-based thinking that \nmimics what humans can do. \n\nHowever, defining what thinking actually is \ncontinues to be elusive. Alan Turing (1950) \nproposed a simple test of AI which is whether \na machine could fool a person into believing \nthat its responses to questioning were actually \nfrom a person. More sophisticated and didactic \ndefinitions focus on thinking that only humans \ncan do, which includes reasoning, judgment \nand learning. By that definition, AI would \nseem to be a continually shrinking domain as \nmachines become capable of more and more \ntasks: computing power and programs that \nformalise decision-making enable computers \nto solve more problems. Calculations that only \nhumans could do generations ago can now be \ndone on pocket calculators. \n\nDefinitions of AI continue to change as practice \nchanges. At least some observers have \nabandoned the notion that AI is about distinctly \nhuman intelligence and describe it as the study \nof any kind of intelligence; others differentiate \nbetween \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018narrow\u2019 AI, focused on solving \n\nparticular problems, and \u2018strong\u2019 or \u2018general\u2019 AI \nthat can solve problems across domains. \n\nWhether one sees these debates over the \nnature of AI as semantic, practical, reacting \nto developments in practice, or conceptual \n\u2013 ultimately turning on epistemology and \nnotions of knowledge \u2013 securing agreement on \na definition is difficult. Fortunately, it is probably \nnot necessary for the task at hand to have \na clear differentiation about what AI means as \nthe claims about effects on the labour market \nare mainly about IT as it is conceptualised now. \n\nArguably, the most useful applications of \ncomputers today are in data science with \nthe most immediate implications for jobs. \nHere, many of the new applications do not \nnecessarily involve reasoning, judgment, \nlearning or anything like thinking. \u2018Big data\u2019, for \nexample, is simply software to handle statistical \nprocesses with data sets that had been too \nlarge for traditional programs to handle; \nmachine learning, at least in its general format, \nis a technique for finding relationships between \nvariables; and algorithms are just decision rules \nderived from evidence that do not necessarily \nrequire computer power, while those derived \nfrom machine learning make predictions that \ncan be validated. Natural language processing \nand speech recognition are, in essence, pattern-\nrecognition problems that become possible for \nmachines to do as computing power increases. \nMost of the claims concerning the effects of AI \nare, in fact, assertions about data-science tools \nlike those above. \n\nThe next step in beginning our analysis is \nmuch more straightforward: i.e. to consider the \noutcomes of IT that are of interest. Following \nthe debate in the popular press, we are \nconcerned with the effects of AI on jobs \u2013 in \nparticular, whether it increases or reduces the \n\n\n\n656\n\nnumber of them \u2013 and, to a lesser extent, how \nit might change the tasks required of jobs, the \nskills needed to perform them, and the quality \nof jobs widely considered.\n\nThat leads directly to the claims about the ef-\nfects of AI that are currently the focus of atten-\n\ntion. The most important of these are assertions \nthat developments in AI will eliminate large \nnumbers of jobs and, in the process, create \nlong-term structural unemployment and lower \nwages, especially for lower-skilled individuals.\n\n4.  A brief history of research on AI and \nthe labour market \n\nConcerns that modern technology will lead to \nunemployment go back to the early days of \nindustrialisation, at least to the Luddites in the \nearly 1800s who protested against the new \nfactory system that threatened the income \nof more skilled workers (Thomas, 1970). The \npossibility that new industrial technology \nwas eliminating jobs became a long-standing \npolitical question thereafter in the UK and \nin much of Europe, but less so in the United \nStates where unemployment, at least until the \nGreat Depression, was less of a concern. In all \nindustrialising countries, the mechanisation of \nfarming, along with new agricultural techniques, \nwere displacing workers and the concern \narising from looking at projections was that the \nmanufacturing economy could not accommodate \nall those soon-to-be displaced workers (Fano, \n1991). The Great Depression kindled the debate \nabout the role of technology in jobs, not just \nbecause unemployment was so high but because \nthe evidence even then suggested that, in the \n1930s, the United States experienced a massive \njump in productivity (Bix, 2000) that was seen as \ncontributing to job losses.\n\nNevertheless, in the 1960s, a period of dramatic \neconomic growth and low unemployment, \nconcern that technology and automation were \ncausing unemployment was a political concern \nbecause of the perception that technology was \nand would be advancing quickly. America\u2019s \n\nPresident Johnson set up a commission to \ninvestigate the evidence for that concern, which \nsubsequently concluded that there was little \nevidence for it (Automation Commission 1966).\n\nThe concern about computers and jobs per se \ndeveloped later, partly because the rise of \ncomputers became quite gradually. Perhaps \nironically, initial concerns appeared to be \ndriven by a question of financial accountability \nwhen investments in computers and IT \ngenerally began to increase. Complaints from \nthe world of investors questioned these \ninvestments because there did not appear to \nbe an associated pay-off from them in terms \nof operating efficiencies (e.g. Straussman, \n1997). The famous quip from economist \nRobert Solow \u2013 \u2018we can see the computer age \neverywhere but in the productivity statistics\u2019 \u2013 \ncaptured the difference between the rhetoric \nabout the value of IT and the apparent reality. \nThat apparent reality became known as \u2018the \nproductivity paradox\u2019. \n\nFor our purposes, the evidence on IT investments \nand productivity matters because productivity is \ntypically measured in terms of labour, output per \nemployee. The most straightforward manner in \nwhich productivity increases is when firms use \nfewer workers for the same output, or a smaller \nproportion of workers for greater output. Dedrick \net al. (2003) review the earlier literature on \n\n\n\n657\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\nthis topic and note that initial studies, through \nthe mid-1990s, did not find evidence of any \nsignificant return on the investment in IT.\n\nResearch into labour economics about \ncomputers had been energised by Krueger\u2019s \n(1993) finding that wages were higher, other \nthings being equal, for individuals who used \ncomputers at work. This finding helped to kick \noff a number of arguments that are continuing \ntoday, suggesting that using computers \ncontributes to better-paying jobs, presumably \nbecause such jobs require more skill. (It should \nbe noted that this is the opposite of most \ncontemporary claims that computers will make \noutcomes worse for workers.) The implications \nwere that jobs that did not require computers \nwould fall behind in pay, helping to explain \nan aspect of the \u2018digital divide\u2019, inequality of \nvarious kinds but especially in pay associated \nwith access to IT and the internet.\n\nCold water was thrown on this conclusion \u2013 \nalthough frankly only in the academic world \u2013 \nby DiNardo and Pischke\u2019s (1997) finding that \nworkers who used pencils also earned higher \npay. Their tongue-in-cheek title about pencil \nuse referred to their finding that workers who \nwere using tools associated with working at \na desk earned more, suggesting that it may \nnot have been the use of computers that was \nassociated with higher wages but simply doing \nthe kind of jobs for which computers would be \nuseful that paid off. The study illustrated the \ncommon problem of omitted variables, in this \ncase that what was associated with computer \nuse also mattered. \n\nBy the 1990s, there were two different streams \nof research interested in the relationship \nbetween computer use and employment \noutcomes: economists studying the effects of \nIT on business, whose interest was looking for \nproductivity improvements, and economists \nand some sociologists, whose interest was \nlooking for explanations for wage differences. \n\nAs Dedrick et al. (2003) note, the former stream \nof research shifted for the analysis from the \nnational and industry-level down to individual \nfirms where they began to find evidence of \ngreater business outcomes associated with IT \ninvestments. These results were replicated in \nEurope although not in developing countries, \nwhile the size of the effects appeared crucially to \ndepend on accounting decisions that determine \nwhich costs are associated with IT investment \nmeasures: is it just the hardware and software, \ndoes it include the training costs of employees, \nthe reorganisation costs, and so forth.\n\nAn important finding in many of these studies \nwas the considerable variation in the relationship \nbetween IT and performance across organisations. \nBresnahan (1999) helped kick off a new direction \nin the IT productivity debate related to that \nvariability by focusing on the changes in business \norganisation \u2013 more commonly referred to \ntoday as restructuring \u2013 that are associated with \nthe successful introduction of IT investments. \nBresnahan, Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2002) and \na string of subsequent studies identified the \nsynergies between investing in IT and changing \nthe organisation of work to explain performance \nimprovements. This research relates to the \nDiNardo and Pischke notion that it may not be the \ncomputers per se that are driving the outcomes \nof interest but rather the changes in existing \npractices that they produced. \n\nOn the labour economics front, Autor, Katz and \nKrueger (1998) found that skill upgrading was \ngreatest in those industries that had made \nlargest investments in IT, suggesting a different \ncomplementarity between labour and IT. This \nresult is related to the earlier Krueger (1993) \nfinding \u2013 the idea that computer use raises \nskill requirements and, in turn, wages. Autor, \nLevy and Murnane (2003) examined the \napparent association between the introduction \nof computer-based systems and more college-\nbased labour with an explanation that computers \ntake over repetitive, lower-level tasks and \n\n\n\n658\n\ntherefore eliminate lower-paid jobs and provided \nevidence at the economy level to support it. These \nstudies align with others about the rising relative \nwages of college graduates compared to those \nwith qualifications less than college degrees to \nreinforce a notion that became known as \u2018skill-\nbiased technology change\u2019. This view of the \nworld articulated by the labour economic studies \nremains dominant in the popular press although, \nas is shown below, the evidence related to it \nincreasingly counters that view. \n\nBefore turning to the extensive body of research \ncarried out since then, virtually all done in \neconomics, it is important to understand some \nof the assumptions that underlie that research. \nFirst, when economists talk about \u2018technology\u2019 \nin the broad sense, they mean anything \nthat changes the production function \u2013 new \nmanagement techniques, capital investments \nin equipment or IT, presumably even new \npriorities, and so forth (see Auto, Katz and \nKearney 2008 for an explicit statement on \nthis). Observers often assume that conclusions \nabout the effects of technology refer to IT, but \nunless the studies are measuring IT explicitly, \nthat is not the case. \n\nSecond, with few exceptions, studies that \nmeasure computer investments claim to be \ncapturing the influence of IT per se and not, \nas Bresnahan and others found, a mix of \norganisational transformation and new ways \nof organising work which are associated with \nthe introduction of computers. This relates to \nthe ceteris paribus assumption and, when it is \nviolated, to the problem of omitted variables.\n\nThird, the assumption is that the educational \nqualifications of those in jobs are an accurate \nmeasure of the requirements of those jobs. The \npractical reason for this assumption is that it is \nrelatively easy to access data on the education \nof individual employees but quite difficult to get \ndata on the requirements of jobs. As a result, \nchanges in the percentage of individuals with \ncollege degrees and in the wages associated \nwith those jobs are interpreted as changes in \nskill requirements and in the demand for skill. \nCareful observers, especially those outside \neconomics, question the reasonableness of that \nassumption (see, e.g. Liu and Grusky, 2013).\n\nFinally, economists, indeed all social scientists, \nattempt to advance arguments associated with \ntheir paradigm typically at the expense of other \nexplanations. It is often heard that historians \nattempt to provide a complete explanation \nof the phenomena they are studying, but \nthere is no credible claim for that in the social \nsciences. A simple explanation, consistent with \nthe underlying paradigms, is far preferable \nin our respective disciplines to a complicated \nexplanation that includes multiple and particularly \nunrelated components, even if the latter explains \nmuch more of the phenomenon. Evidence for this \nis easy to see in any empirical study, where the \namount of variation explained by the explanations \nsubmitted is only a fraction of the total variation. \n\nThis last point is especially important in making \nsense of the research on IT where it is often \nclaimed that x is the cause of y when, in fact, \nthe best we can claim is likely to be that x is \none factor associated with y.\n\n5.  Skill-biased technological change\n\nAlthough not related to IT per se, the notion of \nskill-biased technological change is often used \nto explain or at least support the claims about \n\nhow IT is changing outcomes in the job market. \nAt its heart is an older theoretical argument \noften credited to Polanyi (1944) which asserts \n\n\n\n659\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\nthat new technology inevitably raises skill \nrequirements, because higher skills are needed \nto use the new technology1. The inevitability \nassertion is manifestly not true as the thrust \nof modern industry and techniques such as \nscientific management were designed precisely \nto reduce the skill requirements in individual jobs, \ne.g. by breaking them up into simpler sub-tasks. \n(It may well be true that the initial introduction \nof a new technology, such as computers, \nrequires considerable skill to use them, but later \nmodifications make them easier and easier to use. \nFor example, cash registers with pictures on them \nare computers for checkout assistants that do not \neven require literacy. \u2018Technology\u2019 in these studies \nis not measured directly but is assumed as an \nunderlying development of modern economies. \n\nKatz and Murphy\u2019s (1992) extremely influential \nstudy arguably kicked off the contemporary \nversion of this idea by finding that the \u2018college \npremium\u2019 \u2013 the ratio of what an average college \ngraduate earned in the economy to what the \naverage high-school graduate earned \u2013 rose \nsharply in the United States at a time when the \nproportion of the labour force with a college \ndegree was also rising. Despite the rising supply, \nthe apparent price of skill had also been rising, \nas measured by the college wage premium. The \nauthors argued that changes in demographics \nand, more generally, on the supply side did \nnot account at least for the recent rise in the \ncollege premium, so the explanation must lie \nwith an increase in demand.\n\nSomething of a consensus developed among \nmany that new technology, particularly \ninformation technology, caused an increase in \nthe demand for skill. The topic was particularly \npopular because it was seen as an explanation \nfor the dominant issue of the early 2000s, \nwhich was rising wage inequality. Many studies \nfollowed the Katz and Murphy paper in exploring \n\n1 Polanyi actually says very little about technology as his arguments focus on the relationship between markets and \ninstitutions in the transition to industrial economies.\n\nchanges in the college wage premium. A broader \nand more general study of the relationship \nbetween education, technology and wages \nmakes a similar claim over a much longer period \nof time, suggesting that surges in the supply \nof college graduates moderated the fairly \ncontinuous increases in the demand for skill in \nAmerican economic history (Goldin and Katz, \n2008). The phrase \u2018skill-biased technological \nchange\u2019 emerged from these empirical studies.\n\nAlthough they received less attention, \nmany studies questioned the skill-biased \ntechnological change idea. In particular, the \noccupational shifts that seemed to be the \nbasis of the evidence of skill upgrading had \nbeen under way for at least a decade before \nIT investments became substantial. Card and \nDiNardo (2001) noted that the college wage \npremium did not track measures of actual \ntechnological change well and concluded \nthat it was not a very helpful concept for \nunderstanding changes in wage structures. \nCard and Leimuix (2001) found that, in the \n1990s, the sharply rising college premium was \nnot true across the labour force but was mainly \nattributable just to the experience of young \npeople. (Mishel and Bernstein (1994) present \na sweeping critique of the IT explanation.)\n\nDespite the lack of correspondence with much \nof the evidence, skill-biased technological \nchange had a great deal of appeal because it \nwas useful in understanding growing wage \ninequality, a topic of enormous policy interest, \nand the related issue of the apparent growing \nwage premium for college graduates over non-\ngraduates. Later critiques further weakened \nempirical support for the idea, however. Schmitt, \nShierholz and Mishel (2013) presented a series \nof examples in which the notion of skill-biased \ntechnological change is inconsistent with the \nevidence. This included the fact that it was \n\n\n\n660\n\ninconsistent with wage trends after 2000. More \nrecently, Beaudry, Green and Sand (2014) found \nthat the demand for higher skill appears to have \ndeclined since the early 2000s. Valetta (2017) \nalso found that the college premium has been \ndeclining. \n\nAcemoglu and Autor (2012) signalled a pivot \naway from the simple view of skill-biased \ntechnological change. They noted that it did not \nwork outside of the 1963-1987 period which was \nthe basis for the Katz and Murphy study. They \ncalculated workers\u2019 average weekly, with inflation \ndiscounted, over time and by education level \u2013 \nhigh-school dropouts, high-school grads, those \nwith some college background, college grads, and \nthose with graduate degrees \u2013 and found that the \nwage gap between those different groups in the \nearly 1960s and then again in the mid- to late \n1970s was quite small, as Richard Freeman had \nnoted earlier. Then right after the 1981 recession, \nreal wages for everyone with less education than \na four-year college degree started to collapse and \ncontinued to decline through the early 1990s. The \nrapid decline in high-paying, union manufacturing \njobs and the rise of low-wage competition from \nChina in particular certainly played a big part in \nthe explanation. Although wages for college grads \ndid not take off, they did eventually recover some \nof their lost ground. \n\nThe result of these two movements \u2013 the decline \nof real wages for everyone, the continuing \ndecline for high-school graduates, and the \nmodest improvement for college graduates \u2013 \ncreated the wide gap between the groups and \na sizeable wage premium for college graduates \nwhich started in the 1980s. The fact that the \ncollege premium appeared to be caused more \nby the decline in high-school wages than by the \nrise of college wages did not fit the demand-\nside explanation of skill- biased technological \n\n2 The fact that the studies from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) attack so consistently the simple explanations for changes \nin wages and jobs may be seen by some as reflecting an interest in focusing the discussion on the role of policy in shaping \nlabour market outcomes. However, but it is also fair to note that, unlike the paradigm-based research articles, they are \nfocused on explaining the phenomena per se rather than advocating a conceptual explanation. \n\nchange. It appeared to be a story about which \ngroup lost the fastest as both high-school \nand college graduates have seen a fall in real \nwages since 2002 (Shierholz, Davis and Kimball, \n2014). Demographic trends also had a big \neffect on wages across age cohorts (Jeong, \nKim and Manovskii, 2014) which affected the \ncollege premium across cohorts; the college \npremium for students from poorer families is \nabout half of that for wealthier families (Bartik \nand Hershbein, 2018), partly reflecting the \ngraduates\u2019 unobserved attributes. More than \none-fifth of the college wage premium also \nappears to be associated with cost of living \ndifferences because college graduates tend to \nlive in more expensive places than high-school \nonly graduates (Moretti, 2011). \n\nAcemoglu and Autor (2012) moved the \ndiscussion back towards a different explanation \nof technology that was consistent with \nAutor\u2019s earlier studies \u2013 i.e. that computers in \nparticular eliminate routine jobs. The difference \nnow is the assertion that those routine jobs \nwere in the middle of occupational and wage \nstructures. We could call this the \u2018hollowing \nout\u2019 view. From this point on, most research \nabandoned the simple notion of skill-biased \ntechnological change that economic growth \ninevitably generated higher skill requirements. \n\nSchmitt, Shierholz, and Michel (2013) \npresented a sweeping critique of the hollowing-\nout notion as well, noting that it does not \nexplain changes in occupational distribution \nafter 2000 (in particular, low-wage jobs have \nbeen growing), that occupational changes have \nnot driven changes in the wage distribution, \nand perhaps more importantly, that changes \nin the occupational distribution associated \nwith a shrinking middle began long before \nthe modern computer age2. Barany and Siegel \n\n\n\n661\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\n(2018) document that the declining middle in \nthe US occupational structure was under way \ndecades before the IT expansion of the 1990s \nand appears to be related in the economy as \na whole to the shift from manufacturing jobs to \nservice jobs. We consider more studies below \non IT per se that also contradict this notion. \n\nWhat should we conclude about the skills- biased \ntechnological change idea? First, the original \nincarnation of the argument, that technology \ninexorably increases skill requirements and, \nin turn, alters the demand for skill and wages, \nhas been largely abandoned by researchers. \nSecond, the job-polarisation version differs \nfundamentally from the original \u2013 in particular, \nthere is no assumption of ever-increasing skill \nrequirements \u2013 and mainly only shares an \nunderlying supply-and-demand mechanism.\n\nAs Howell and Kalleberg (forthcoming) note in \ntheir extensive review of explanations for recent \nwage and occupation changes, there are other \n\nexplanations at least equally \u2013 and arguably \nmore \u2013 compelling than job polarisation for \nlabour market outcomes. These focus on \nchanging power relationships which have \nallowed employers to squeeze lower-skilled \nworkers and the highest earning individuals \nto secure more income. For example, Kristal \n(2013) finds that the introduction of computers \nmade workers more replaceable which lowered \ntheir wages. These arguments do not have \nthe advocacy the job-polarisation idea and \nits supply-and-demand underpinning have, at \nleast among a large number of economists \nstudying labour market outcomes.\n\nAs shown below, there is certainly some evidence \nfor IT changing occupational structures, although \nhow much of the change is truly driven by IT \nas opposed to coinciding with trends already \nunder way, and how much is caused by factors \nassociated with IT, such as the associated \nrestructuring of organisations, is not clear.\n\n6.  Forecasting the effects of IT on jobs\n\nAlthough the above-mentioned research has \nhad considerable influence on popular thinking \nabout the effects of IT, more important for our \npurposes are the studies concentrating on the \ntopic of IT use. Recently, much and arguably most \nof the research on the relationship between \nIT and jobs has been motivated by the practical \nconcern as to whether IT will eliminate jobs. \nThis stream of research has been motivated \nlargely as a reaction to forecasts, specifically \npessimistic forecasts, about the likely effects \nof continuing advances in IT which claim that \nnew and emerging developments in computing \npower, in software, and in data science are \nfundamentally different from those seen before. \n\nArguably the most important of these \nprediction arguments is from Brynjolfsson \nand McAfee (2011) who argue that the IT \ntechnology emerging now is fundamentally \ndifferent from what has been seen before and \nwill affect the workplace differently than what \nhas been seen before. The most attention-\ngrabbing claim in their book, which appeared \nat a time of substantial unemployment in the \nUnited States, is that this new technology will \nlead to substantial job loss. Schwab (2016) \nessentially adopted this view, as did many \nreports written by consulting companies. \n\nIt is not possible here to review or even \ncatalogue all the reports from outside the \nacademic and policy world, although they \n\n\n\n662\n\nhave some common themes. First, in terms \nof approach, they are typically authored by \npractitioners outside IT fields. They tend to \nrely on surveys that ask executives what they \nbelieve about the future. Second, in terms of \nconclusions, none of them appear to claim \nthat the future will look more or less like the \npast or that the changes associated with IT \nare similar to those experienced before. The \ntypical conclusions repeat assertions that IT \nwill \u2018disrupt\u2019 the way business is done and \nthat businesses need to figure out how to \ndeal with these developments. Many of these \nconclusions are dramatic: Bain, for example, \nforecasts that half of all current jobs in the \nUnited States could be eliminated in 15 years \nand that US employers will need 30 to 40 \nmillion fewer workers by 2030 (Harris, Kimson \nand Schwedel, 2018).\n\nBy contemporary research standards, these \nclaims contradict evidence which has been \nconsistent since the Industrial Revolution that \nwhile new equipment and practices eliminate \ncertain jobs, on balance, they do not destroy jobs \nbecause of their overall effects on improving \nproductivity and overall wealth create jobs \nelsewhere. Autor (2018) articulates the many \npaths through which technology that increases \nproductivity boosts economic growth and why, \nin modern history, it has not yet led to job losses.\n\nAs noted above, the epistemological problem \nraised in assessing these reports is how to \nseparate assertions that we might dismiss as \nmere opinion from something that we would \nconsider a true belief. If it is reasonable to \nconclude that future developments in IT are \nso unlike the past that we cannot use prior \nexperience to assess them, then we cannot use \nevidence to assess those assertions. \n\nOne approach, adopted below, is to dismiss the \nclaim that when new IT developments come \nthey will be so distinctive that we cannot learn \nanything about their likely effects from prior \n\nexperience with technology. When we think \nabout historical developments in transformative \ntechnology, such as the rise of steam power, \nelectricity, the first computers, and so forth, it \ndoes not seem credible to suggest that nothing \ncould be learned from such experiences. If \nwe have yet to see these technologies, then \nassertions about whether their effects will be so \ndifferent from anything seen before seems very \nmuch like opinion rather than a true belief. \n\nThere are areas of inquiry where predictions \nare made consistently about events for which \nwe cannot generate traditional forecasting \nmodels because in the past there were not \nenough similar circumstances \u2013 possibly none \n\u2013 to use as a basis. We could consider these \nsui generis predictions. Concerns about how \na political leader will react to a challenge, \nwhether countries will go to war at a particular \nmoment, or whether \u2018society has changed\u2019 \nmay fit this prediction category. It is also the \ncase that we have to make predictions where \nforecasting models are at least conceptually \npossible although, for a variety of reasons, \nsuch as time pressure or lack of resources, \nthey cannot be constructed. \n\nWe might describe the effort to make such \npredictions as \u2018expert judgment\u2019. Tetlock \n(2017) studied the phenomenon of predictions \nby experts extensively, in particular with \nrespect to political events. He found that \nexperts\u2019 accuracy in making these predictions \nbarely surpassed \u2018monkeys tossing darts at \na dartboard\u2019 or, less creatively, were no better \nthan chance. Predictions of societal and political \nevents are perhaps not common enough to be \nable to tell if those who are \u2018good\u2019 at predicting \nhave just been lucky. However, Tetlock and \nGardner (2018) engaged in a sizeable exercise \nto see what makes some individuals better \nthan others at actually predicting events that \ncould be confirmed later. Their conclusions \nare important to bear in mind when looking at \nforecasts concerning the future of IT.\n\n\n\n663\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\nThose who are worse at predicting are highly \nconfident of their abilities \u2013 over-confident; \nexperts who are deeply focused on their \nsubject, \u2018hedgehogs\u2019 according to Isaiah Berlin, \nare also worse when compared to those with \nwider expertise, the \u2018foxes\u2019. Followers of grand \ntheory, which would include the economics \nparadigm, are worse at predicting. Conversely, \nthose who question assumptions, who look for \ncomparable situations and events elsewhere, \nand who consider the counter arguments to \ntheir positions do better at predicting. \n\nThe reports above tend to assume the most \nimportant conclusion \u2013 that IT developments \nwill be transformational \u2013 and from there \npursue implications that sometimes extrapolate \nfrom current circumstances. Applying Tetlock \nand Gardner\u2019s (2018) criteria, the studies \nrarely, if ever, question or even identify their \nassumptions, consider counter arguments, \nor believe that much could be learned from \nother circumstances. It is also worth noting \nthat consulting companies in particular have \na material interest in securing business that is \nnot always perfectly aligned with presenting the \nmost accurate story. These reports are marketed \naggressively and have considerable influence \non business leaders who, in turn, are often the \nempirical source for the next set of studies.\n\nOne of the most influential predictions about the \nimpact of IT, especially among practitioners, was \nconducted by Frey and Osborne (2017). It asked \ncomputer experts to assess whether, under the \nbest circumstances, it was possible for computers \nto take over the central tasks of a set of jobs or \nif it will be possible to do so soon. Their assertion \nthat almost half of the jobs could be taken over \nby computers forms the basis for the conclusion \nin many of the practitioner reports that those \njobs will be taken over by computers and soon. \n\nUnfortunately, the prediction stopped there. The \nquestion did not ask for a prediction of what \nwill actually happen in the real world. There is \n\nan enormous gap between what is technically \npossible to do, the question asked of computer \nexperts, and what is practically useful or \nfinancially viable to do. We can, for example, \ngo to construction sites almost anywhere in \nthe world and find tasks being performed by \nhand that could easily be performed by existing \nmachines. The fact that loads are carried by \nhand and holes dug using shovels in many \nparts of the developing world reflects the fact \nthat labour is so much cheaper than equipment, \nnot that the workers are unaware of trucks or \nbackhoes. Then there are tasks that IT and robots \ncan perform now, although they are not good at \nthem. Mechanical robots can create alcoholic \nmixed drinks the same way as bartenders do, \nbut a colleague who observed this indicated \nthat the quality of the drinks was poor and it \ntook two employees to support and service the \nrobot whenever it was in operation. The machine \ndid the task, poorly, and at incredible expense. \n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD) (2018) took the Frey \nand Osborne estimates at face value and then \nused estimates of job requirements from the \nProgramme for the International Assessment \nof Adult Competencies (PIAAC) skills survey \nand concluded that roughly 14 % of jobs met \nthe criterion that machines could or soon would \nbe able to perform them \u2013 i.e. A much smaller \nnumber. Whether they will take over those \ntasks and whether doing so will eliminate jobs \nis another question considered below. Arntz et \nal. (2016) had earlier conducted an estimate \nsimilar to that of Frey and Osborne and \nconcluded that 9 % of employees were in jobs \nthat were likely to be automated.\n\nForecasts for the effects of technology have \nbeen more difficult to predict than the political \nand social events studied by Tetlock (2017) \nand Tetlock and Gardner (2018). In fact, there \nis something of a sport in reminding us of how \npoorly we have been able to anticipate not only \nwhich technologies will succeed and when they \n\n\n\n664\n\nwill arrive but what their influence will be when \nthey do. For example, Funk (2017) revisited \nthe technology predictions of MIT\u2019s Technology \nReview and found few examples of success, \nwhile management scholar Joseph Switter \n(1965) predicted that, by 1985, computers \nwould take over most management tasks. \nPredicting the implications of technology was \na hot topic in the 1960s, when researchers \nwere aware of the many factors outside of \n\ntechnology per se that affect its introduction, \nsuch as actual demand for it, especially \nrelative to competing solutions, social and \npolitical implications of using the technology, \nand so forth. They articulated techniques for \nmaking such predictions that include analysing \nswitching costs to new technologies (see Quinn \n1967 for an example), none of which seem to \nbe used in the current forecasts.\n\n7.  Evidence of the effect of IT on jobs\n\nWe turn now to recent empirical evidence that \nrelates to the predictions above. Beginning with \nthe Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011) assertion \nthat new IT technology is fundamentally \ndifferent and will lead to a net reduction \nin jobs, the current economic environment, \nat least in the United States with record \nlow unemployment, offers that notion less \nsympathy than when it was articulated during \nthe Great Recession. More recent research \ngives it no support. The job-polarisation \nhypothesis \u2013 that IT is eliminating and will \ncontinue to eliminate more routine jobs \u2013 also \nreceives little support in more recent research.\n\nBessen (2016) looks at US data and finds \nthat increased IT use is actually associated \nwith more jobs. He also finds no evidence of \njob polarisation associated with greater IT \nuse. Aum, Lee and Shin (2017) found that IT \ninvestments were actually smaller for lower-\nlevel jobs doing routine work than for higher-\nlevel jobs, which is inconsistent both with an \nearlier view that IT eliminates lower-level jobs \nand with the notion that it disproportionately \ntargets middle-level jobs. Gregory, Salomons \nand Zierhn (2016) also conclude that there is \nno evidence of IT use reducing employment in \nEurope. Boreland and Coelli (2017) examine \nIT use and employment in Australia and find \n\nno evidence that greater IT use has reduced \nemployment or has it decreased employment \nin jobs that would seem to be routine in terms \nof skill. In fact, there is no evidence that greater \nIT use has been associated with greater \nchanges in sectors of the economy where IT \ninvestments have been the greatest. \n\nThe underlying logic behind the job-loss \nidea is that where IT does not eliminate jobs \naltogether, it changes skill requirements, \nrendering incumbents unqualified for further \nemployment and costing them their jobs. \nAllen and de Grip (2012) examine the general \nquestion of whether skill obsolescence \nincreases the probability that individuals will \nlose their jobs and conclude that, in practice, \nit does not. One explanation for that lack or \nrelationship is that individuals and employers \nrecognise when skills may become obsolete \nand respond accordingly, through retraining \nand other ways. \n\nAn important issue in understanding the \noutcomes of IT on jobs and labour outcomes \nin general is the distinction between tasks and \njobs. Jobs are typically defined as a collection \nof tasks. Except for the very simplest assembly-\nline work, most jobs include many tasks: virtually \nevery job description and employee handbook in \n\n\n\n665\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\nthe United States ends the description of any \njob with the phrase \u2018and tasks as assigned\u2019, \nwhich means that supervisors can add virtually \nany task to the job of any employee. \n\nThis simple fact that jobs comprise many tasks \ngets to the heart of many misunderstandings \nabout the effects of IT on employment. The \napplications of IT to work are typically task-\nby-task: at the lower-skill end, dispensing cash \nthrough ATMs, at the higher end, reading x-rays \nand digital images. The reason the pundits were \nwrong in expecting that ATMs would eliminate \nbank teller jobs is that tellers have many tasks \nbesides simply dispensing cash. Radiologists \ndo read x-rays, but they also have many other \ntasks, including consulting with other doctors \nand patients, advising on treatment, and so forth, \nwhich means that algorithms which \u2018read\u2019 x-rays \ndo not eliminate their job (Brynjolfsson, Mitchell \nand Rock, 2018 acknowledged this complication).\n\nThe fascination with autonomous or self-\ndriving vehicles that swept the business press \na few years ago fixated on the prediction that \nsuch vehicles would eliminate the job of truck \ndriver: the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 \nAssociation (2017) predicted, for example, that \nhalf of all trucking jobs would be gone within 10 \nyears. That conclusion ignored the reality of what \nmost truck drivers do, which is to make deliveries, \nonly one part of which is to drive to the locations \nin question. No sensible business would pay for \nself-driving trucks and then hire a worker just to \nride along until they arrived at a delivery point \nunless the cost of such trucks became negligible. \nGittleman and Monaco (2019) calculate that \nif autonomous trucks do arrive, the job losses \nassociated with them are roughly one-tenth of \nwhat popular accounts are claiming because of \nthe above-mentioned caveats. \n\nRemus and Levy (2016) examine how IT \nand data-science technologies are affecting \nthe practice of law. This is relevant because \nthe ability to search cases and build legal \n\narguments can now be done electronically. \nThey conclude that these technologies are \nnot eliminating lawyers \u2013 they are simply \nautomating one research-related task, allowing \nlawyers to focus more time on others. As an \nexample, consider situations where IT simply \nprovides new information used in decisions. As \nnoted above, machine-learning algorithms that \nread x-rays to look for tumours or interpret \nother medical tests are not eliminating \nthe doctors who make the diagnosis about \na patient. They provide a new and important \nset of information that is combined with other \ninformation \u2013 patient histories, blood and \ngenetic tests, and so forth \u2013 that doctors use \nto make diagnoses. It is possible to imagine \na future where the entire judgment process is \ntaken over by robots, but that vision is so far \naway at this point that we are simply projecting \nit. Autor (2015) also notes that even when new \ntechnologies do eliminate tasks, and possibly \njobs, the changes take place quite gradually. \n\nBresnahan and Yi (2016) offer the most \nsweeping refutation of the notion that new \nIT will eliminate jobs by reminding us that \nIT and technology generally alter products \nand services in ways that give customers \nadditional benefits and features rather than \nsimply automating existing features. They \nare typically not producing the exact same \nproduct or service. As a result, tasks are not \nnecessarily eliminated. The technology itself \ncreates new products and services or aspects \nof existing services that create new tasks. One \nsuch example is the now common experience \nof shopping online where the website suggests \nother products and services the shopper \nmight purchase. Some of those products \nand services may require connection to an \nemployee. Online travel bookings may lead \nto recommendations for insurance purchases \nor requests for advice on health issues \nassociated with travel, such as vaccinations. \nIn that case, the new technology has created \nnew services that did not previously exist and \n\n\n\n666\n\nnew tasks for humans, thereby increasing the \ndemand for human labour.\n\nWe also know that many tasks that appear to be \ndone by IT actually involve workers behind the \nscenes. Gray and Suri (2019) document an entire \nworkforce that has been created to support \u2013 \nunseen \u2013 tasks associated with doing business \n\non the internet, such as matching individuals\u2019 \nimages to their security photos or editing social \nmedia content. No doubt at some point those \ntasks might become automated, but at present \nit is cheaper and easier to have them done by \npeople. (The jobs are low wage and performed \nby arms-length contractors so we should not \nimply that good jobs have been created.)\n\n8.  Robotics and automation\n\nRobotics \u2013 the field associated with robots \n\u2013 is the arena where we might expect to see \nthe greatest effects on jobs. It seems quite \ndifficult to come up with an exact definition \nof a robot, but it is clear that it relates to the \napplication of computer-science techniques to \ntasks that mimic human behaviour, typically \ninvolving the physical world. What differentiates \nrobots from machine tools is that robots have \nsome autonomy: their programming allows \nthem to adapt or adjust to change how it \nresponds to circumstances. A metal press may \nbe a sophisticated and expensive tool that \nincreases labour productivity but it is not a robot. \nIf we add computer programming to it so that \nit can adapt its performance to the differences \nit perceives in the metal coming into contact \nwith it, then it may well be. Similarly, \u2018chat bots\u2019 \nthat answer questions asked by individuals in \nconversation form are typically seen as a type of \nrobot even though they do not engage with the \nphysical world. Although the ability to process \nnatural language in the form of human voices \nis impressive, their ability to adapt \u2013 which is \ncentral to robotics \u2013 rather than simply respond \nto an array of questions is quite limited. \n\nBecause robots are a specific application of \nIT to human tasks, we might expect their use \nto be particularly associated with changes in \njobs. However, as with other forms of IT, the \nability to take on individual tasks does not \n\nnecessarily correspond to a complete job. Like \nthe more general aspects of IT noted above, \nthe robotic industry appears to have shifted its \nfocus from efforts to take over complete jobs \nto efforts to assist workers in jobs by taking \nover individual tasks, a much simpler outcome \nthan attempting to take over all the tasks an \nindividual has to perform. In this context, it is \nuseful to note that the set of tasks assembled \nto create jobs that people do is based on both \nthe logic of what humans can do as well as \nwhat organisations need. That logic is not the \nsame as what machines and IT can do, so the \nnotion that IT will somehow will neatly map on \nto existing jobs is mistaken.  \n\nAssessing the possible effects of robots on jobs \nis essentially the same exercise as assessing the \neffects of IT in general on jobs. There have been \nsome specific efforts to examine investments \nin robots per se, with Acemoglu and Restrepo \n(2017) attracting the most attention with their \nstudy on spending on robotics showing a negative \nrelationship with regional employment. As Mishel \nand Bivens (2017) point out, such results do not \nhold for automation other than robots which \nhad a positive relationship with employment. \nGraetz and Michaels (2018) use evidence across \n17 countries and find that a greater use of \nrobots did not have a significant negative effect \non employment. Dixon, Hong and Wu (2019) \nconduct one of the very few studies at the firm \n\n\n\n667\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\nlevel, using data from Canada on computer use \nmatched to data on firm practices and outcomes. \nThey found that greater computer use was \nassociated with greater employment growth but \na reduction in managerial employment as the \nintroduction of robots appears to lead to changes \nin work organisation. Borjas and Freeman \n(2019) compare the effects of the introduction \nof industrial robots (i.e. larger machines and \nassociated with substituting routine labour \ntasks) vs. immigrants in US manufacturing \nindustries and conclude that the introduction \nof these robots is associated with a far greater \nreduction in total employment than the increase \nin immigrants, as much as two to three workers \nfor each industrial robot. \n\nTo summarise, the evidence is mixed. The stud-\nies focus on manufacturing per se and would \nnot necessarily capture employment effects \nelsewhere, where increased productivity and \nrobotic sales and service may generate jobs \nin other contexts. Given that, it is surprising \nthat the studies do not find negative effects on \nemployment. The fact that as many find posi-\ntive as negative effects leads to the conclusion \nthat, as yet, clear evidence of negative employ-\nment effects cannot be seen. \n\nThe term \u2018automation\u2019 has surfaced recently \nin discussions about the potential effect of AI \non jobs, presumably related to the robotics \nidea of applications specifically designed to \nreplace workers in jobs. In the United States, \nthe discussion on automation first came to the \nfore while trying to explain the slow growth \nof employment in US manufacturing after the \nGreat Depression. The fact that productivity \nappeared to have jumped in manufacturing \nwas seen as consistent with the possibility \nthat IT had ramped up productivity there. As \na result, the claim was that investments in \ntechnology held down jobs in manufacturing \n(see, e.g. Perry, 2017).\n\nThe problem with this argument is that closer \ninspection suggested that it was just not \ntrue. The apparent jump in productivity in US \nmanufacturing was attributable in part to changes \nin what counts as manufacturing: companies \nlike Caterpillar that manufacture expensive \nheavy equipment have also moved into services \n\u2013 repairing and financing equipment. The income \nfrom those service operations has been counted \ntowards manufacturing because the company \nitself is a manufacturing company. To the \nextent that the sharp increase in manufacturing \nwas real, it seems attributable largely to one \nindustry \u2013 computer manufacturing \u2013 and that \nhas not continued. \n\nHouseman (2018) explains these develop-\nments and notes there is little support for \nthe idea that increasing productivity was \neliminating manufacturing jobs. Furthermore, \nthe jump in productivity in the computer \nindustry was not because of improvements in \nlabour productivity of the kind that is evident in \ntypical industries \u2013 i.e. fewer workers required \nto build the same computer or less labour input \nin the construction of a computer. It is because \nchanges in computer design, especially in \ncomputer chips, make the same computer \nconsiderably more valuable when productivity \nis measured in terms of revenue per employee. \n\nA different kind of argument about IT and \nproductivity surfaced in popular discussion \naround the publication of Robert Gordon\u2019s \n(2016) contemporary history of economic \ngrowth in the US and what it suggests about \nthe future. The history itself is not controversial \nalthough surprising to non-experts: productivity \ngrowth in the United States hit its contemporary \npeak in the 1930s as machine-age innovations \nwere adapted to more everyday uses. Since \nthen, productivity growth and the technological \nchange that drives much of it at least have \ndeclined, despite repeated claims in the \nbusiness and policy world that we are always \nliving in a time of unprecedented change. \n\n\n\n668\n\nThe part of the argument that generated \ncontroversy is Gordon\u2019s assertion that, at \nleast in the foreseeable future, there is little \nevidence of technological changes that will \ndrive faster rates of productivity and economic \ngrowth. This argument is essentially a forecast \nbased on how growth came about in the past \nand looking at the current state of play. \n\nThis forecast is quite pessimistic and not \nparticularly popular with the public, although \nothers have made similar claims. Summers \n(2015), for example, coined the term \u2018secular \nstagnation\u2019 to describe the low current growth \nrates, in his view driven by policy mistakes. Other \n\n3 This \u2018debate\u2019 derives from a TED talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofWK5WglgiI\n4 Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) go further and argue that some productivity improvements may be more labour-saving and \n\nless demand-creating than others. They claim that in the face of lower overall productivity growth in recent decades, there \nhas been a shift towards the kind of growth that has less impact on jobs, although they have no direct way of measuring \nthat change and inferring it from lower wage growth which, of course, could have many other causes. \n\neconomists are more optimistic about future \ngrowth, including the role that new technology \nmight play (see Teulings and Baldwin, 2014, for \nthese debates). Brynjolffson presents a counter \nview from his popular writings, that paradigm-\nbreaking IT developments which do not follow \nthe usual rules for growth are on the horizon3. \n\nThis discussion about the future of growth \nmight be described as two views talking past \neach other: Gordon and others saying that \ncurrent evidence leads to a pessimistic view \nof future growth; the sceptics saying, beyond \nwhat we can see with our current approach, \ngrowth will return and may be considerable.\n\n9.  Looking past empirical evidence on IT effects \n\nRecent studies by Autor (2018) and by Acem-\noglu and Restrepo (2019) have articulated in \nmore formal terms the traditional explanation \nabout why improvements in technology and \nlabour-saving techniques do not lead to fewer \njobs: productivity increases fuel demand in \nthe economy as a whole, which in turn creates \nmore jobs, albeit typically in other areas than \nwhere the initial productivity improvements \ntake place. There are many paths through \nwhich the connection between productivity \nimprovements and demand can take place4.\n\nWhen we review the empirical evidence from \nstudies of IT use and jobs, there is no support \nfor the view articulated by Brynjolffson and \nMcAfee (2011; 2014) that IT and associated \nAI advances contributed to lower job growth. \nAt least in the United States, during the Great \nRecession the slack labour market that gave \n\nsupport to such an argument has turned \naround now and undercut it. The more complex \nargument that IT use has led to automation of \nthe most routine jobs and expansion of more \nsophisticated jobs has greater face value, but \nempirical evidence for it is at best mixed, and \nthere are several studies with results that \ndirectly contradict it. \n\nThat leaves one more set of arguments where \nthe usual forecasts are left behind. Here the \nidea is that something is coming in IT and \nrelated AI developments that will be different \nin its effects on jobs than anything we have \nseen so far. It is not just the technologies \nthemselves that will be different, but how they \nwill interact with jobs will also be different. As \nnoted above, these are not forecasts because \nthey claim explicitly that the future will not \nlook like the past. As such, projections are \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofWK5WglgiI\n\n\n669\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\nnot relevant. Furthermore, the construction of \nthose arguments is inconsistent with what we \nknow about what makes for good predictions, \nnot just in suggesting that prior experience \nis not a guide to them but also that current \nexamples do not provide a guide. \n\nThe examples given by Bresnahan and Yi \n(2016) show that current data-science tools \nwhich generate algorithms for decisions do not \nnecessarily eliminate jobs even in the areas \nwhere they are applied. They seem closest \nto the type of IT innovations that proponents \nclaim will eliminate jobs. \n\nNordhaus (2015) takes a novel and quite \ndifferent approach to test directly the claim \nof a forthcoming, paradigm-breaking advance \nin IT that will transform business and jobs. He \naddresses Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) \nexplicitly, which is more or less an extension of \ntheir 2011 argument. He asks what we would \nsee in the economy if such a development \noccurred in terms of developments such as the \nshare of capital devoted to IT in the economy. \nAt least in the contemporary economy, he sees \nlittle evidence that we are on the way towards \nsuch a development. \n\nIt might be fair to describe arguments about \nthe future of IT as researchers limiting their \ninterest to analyses of the present, on the \n\none hand, and \u2018expert judgment\u2019 prediction of \na future fundamentally different from the past, \non the other. It is virtually impossible to refute \na claim about something that might happen \nin the future, especially when the claim itself \n(effects on jobs) relies on something that has \nyet to exist (path-breaking IT). There is a joke \nin the field of forecasting that we are safe in \nmaking any claim about the future so long as \nwe do not have to specify when it will come true: \nwe cannot rule out events that may happen in \nthe future, which few people remember, or hold \naccountable, claims that eventually turn out to \nbe false, and, as noted above, there are short-\nterm benefits in the attention that authors can \nsecure with spectacular claims.\n\nThe fact that the current evidence is inconsis-\ntent with the general notion that IT innovations \nwill have dramatic effects on jobs does not \nprove that it is impossible for IT innovations of \nsome kind to ever have such an effect. However, \nit should considerably lower our estimate as to \nwhether such a scenario is likely. Furthermore, \nthe fact that, as yet, there is no clear evidence \nfor the simple explanations as to the kind of \neffects that IT is having on the labour force \n\u2013 e.g. eliminating low-wage or mid-level jobs \n\u2013 does not mean that a consensus view will \nnever emerge about such changes. It does \nmean that acting now on any of those views is \nnot advisable. \n\n10.  What to do about an uncertain future\n\nThe notion that the future is uncertain is hardly \nnovel, not just with respect to the workplace \nbut related to almost any aspect of human \nendeavour. It is also wholly unsatisfying not to \nbe able to know with any certainty what to do \nabout the future. \n\nIt is common and, in some circles, to still \nhear people say that we should take our best \nguess about the future and go with it, even if \nwe know that guess is not very good. In some \ncircumstances that must be right: the building \nis on fire, there are two different exits, and \neven delaying the choice until we are more \ncertain is not a smart strategy. But there are \n\n\n\n670\n\nalso circumstances where we are not forced \nto choose, the consequences of being wrong \nare great, and the consequences of waiting \nare minimal. If we are climbing a mountain, \nfor example, we will probably wait to get an \naccurate weather forecast before ascending \ntowards the summit because the cost of \nwaiting is small compared to the cost of \nmaking the wrong decision.\n\nWith respect to economic and workforce \nplanning, the track record has not been \nvery good at predicting which jobs will be \nin high demand far into the future. Even if \nwe are reasonably sure that some jobs will \ndecline in importance in the future, retraining \nprogrammes are difficult to put in place unless \nwe are also reasonably sure which jobs will \nbe in demand then. A sensible alternative, \ntherefore, is to wait for better information \nbefore acting and shortening the time period \ninvolved because forecasts are dramatically \nbetter the shorter they are. \n\nIt is true that government policies often take \na long time to set up and execute, and that \nmakes longer-term efforts more attractive. \nBut in that context, our policy attention might \nbe better spent on designing procedures that \nallow us to respond faster rather than going \nwith longer-term forecasts that have a poor \ntrack record. \n\nOne approach to faster and more accurate \nforecasts might be to think about programmes \nthat are executed at the level of the individual \nemployer rather than the economy as a whole. \nParticularly with respect to changes associated \nwith technology, we know that the spread of new \ntechniques is not instantaneous: businesses \nwith more resources or with strategies better \nsuited to new approaches will go first, while \nothers may never adopt the changes because \nof their unique cost structures or business \napproaches. Estimating what will happen to \njobs in a given organisation two years on is \n\nfar easier and more accurate than estimating \nwhat will happen to jobs in the economy as \na whole because at least some of the factors \nthat drive outcomes in a given organisation \nare known and indeed determined by decisions \nmade within that organisation.\n\nFurthermore, if we believe that IT-related \ntechnologies may eliminate jobs, intervening \nwhen those developments actually do so \n\u2013 within individual employers \u2013 is a far \nbetter use of resources than putting in place \neconomy-wide programmes that may only \nbe used by a small group of employees at \nany specific time. We also know that where \nindividuals must transition from one job \nto another, the easiest way to make those \ntransitions is within the same organisation \nwhere their organisation-specific skills remain \nrelevant. Retraining policies that operate within \nindividual employers may also make sense for \nthat reason. \n\nAnother general approach to addressing \nthe problem of uncertainty begins with the \nrecognition that even good forecasting models \nsimply tell us the most likely outcome, or in the \nwords of modellers, the \u2018point estimate\u2019 of the \noutcome in question. In most cases, the most \nprobable outcome may not be all that likely, \nso it is important to know what the second \nmost likely outcome is, as well as the third. \nSometimes the second and third outcomes are \nsimilar in their implications, in which case it is \nsafer to bet on them than on the most likely \noutcome. Scenario planning is one technique \nused to address these situations. Simulations \nare another, where we have a forecasting \nmodel and we change the assumptions or the \nvalues of the variables to see what happens. \n\nOnce we have a better sense of the outlines of \nthe uncertainty we face, a reasonable approach \ninvolves hedging our bets. The world of finance \nhas formalised this practice in the form of \noptions, and the world of management has done \n\n\n\n671\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 11\n\nsomething similar with the idea of \u2018real options\u2019, \nplacing bets to hedge against real phenomenon. \nFor example, the probability might be extremely \nhigh that there will not be a pandemic, but the \nconsequences if it does happen are high enough \nthat we might at least put plans in place to \ndeal with it should it happen. If it turns out that \nevidence of dramatic IT-related job changes \nbecomes stronger, it may make sense to place \nsome bets about it occurring even if the odds \nare still small that those changes will occur. An \nexample of such a bet might be more detailed \nand fine-grained monitoring of how IT is being \nused in the workplace. \n\nEven if we were to believe that new IT \ntechnologies, whatever they may be, are unlike \nany we have seen before, that would not \nsuggest that the process through which any \nsuch technologies will be introduced is without \nprecedent. The introduction of electricity, for \nexample, was a path-breaking and \u2018disruptive\u2019 \ntechnology with little precedent. We learned \na great deal over time about why it took so long \nto spread and what determined its advance. If \nwe look at manufacturing, where technological \nchange has been most obvious and studied, we \nknow that its introduction rarely has uniform \neffects everywhere. In the 1970s, the term \n\u2018productivity bargaining\u2019 was used to describe \nan approach which began in the UK whereby \nunions and management negotiated over the \nterms on which new technology and other \nproductivity-improving approaches would be \nintroduced that would protect as many current \njobs as possible and share some of the benefits \n\nof cost savings with employees (e.g. McKersie \nand Hunter, 1973). A simple accommodation \nwas to let labour-saving play out through \nattrition and buy-outs rather than mass layoffs.\n\nArguably, the first \u2018robotics\u2019 wave in manu-\nfacturing was the introduction of numerically \ncontrolled machines, taking over at least some \nof the most important tasks of machinists. \nHere, organisations faced a choice as to \nwhether to get rid of their machinists who had \nperformed those tasks, replacing them with \nengineers proficient in computer programming, \nor to retrain their existing machinists to take \nover the programming tasks. Productivity was \nactually higher in the latter case (Kelley, 1994). \nThe former approach is massively disruptive for \nemployees; the latter much less so (see Keefe, \n1991 for an assessment of overall effects \non jobs), and employers had considerable \ndiscretion as to which one to choose. The policy \napproach learned from that is first that these \ntwo options have very different implications for \nsociety and for employees and second that it \nwould have been possible to shape the choices. \n\nThe assertion that we should initiate massive \nretraining programmes now on the chance \nthat new IT innovations will be massively \ndisruptive is not the only option, even if it \nwas feasible to do, nor even the best given \nwhat we know first about the lack of evidence \nfor such a disruption and second about how \ntechnological change actually plays out. \nFortunately, there are better options. \n\n\n\n672\n\n11.

The policy challenge \n\nOne of the main aims of the European Union is \nto enhance the competitiveness of all European \neconomic actors in what has become an \nincreasingly integrated world. Given Europe\u2019s \nhistory, economic structure and social model, \nthere is a consensus that this cannot be \nachieved by cutting costs and reducing workers\u2019 \nrights. If Europe is to keep and improve its place \nin the world, a different route is required. And \nthis route needs to rely on inventiveness and \ncreativity, rather than cheap labour. For the EU, \nincreasing competitiveness and preserving the \nEuropean social model entails moving up the \ntechnological and innovation scale (EU, 2014). \n\nTo achieve this goal, both individual European \ncountries and the EU as a whole have put \n\nresearch and innovation (R&I) policy at the \nheart of their innovation efforts. Innovation \npolicies in Europe \u2013 both at the national and \nEuropean-wide scale \u2013 have, to a greater \nor lesser extent, remained anchored in the \nbelief that more investment in research and \ndevelopment (R&D) leads to greater innovation \nand that innovation triggers economic growth. \nConsequently, a considerable \u2013 and, until the \nbeginning of the crisis, growing \u2013 amount of \nresources has been devoted to R&D across \nEurope. Most of this effort has been aimed at \nachieving a quantitative target: securing an \nR&D investment of 3 % of GDP, of which two \nthirds are expected to be accomplished by the \nprivate sector. The 3 % of GDP target reflects \nnot just a belief in the benefits of greater R&D \n\nSummary\n\nThis contribution looks at the economic \nconsequences of the R&I divide across EU \nregions and highlights the policy challenge \nthey represent. It reviews the theoretical \nfactors behind current levels of territorial \npolarisation, maps the current state of this \ndivide, and presents an econometric approach \nto identifying the effects. \n\nThe core of the argument is that research \nand development (R&D) investment alone \ndoes not trigger the same returns on \ninvestment everywhere because of several \nfactors. These are linked to the cost of \ntechnology accessibility in different places, \nthe distance to the technological frontier, \npositive externalities from larger and denser \nregions, the quality of local institutions, and \nhampered knowledge sharing. \n\nMany of these factors disadvantage the less-\ndeveloped regions in their efforts to broaden \ntheir innovation capacities with the aim of \nunleashing greater economic activity and \ngrowth. Nevertheless, most of the R&D growth \nin less-developed regions has been in the \nhigher education sector, which has led to a \nsubstantial improvement in scientific output. \nThe chapter discusses how to improve the \nefficiency of investment in R&I systems and \nstrengthen innovation-driven economic growth. \n\nIn its conclusions, it not only diagnoses \nthe situation but also suggests elements \nof innovation policy for less-developed \nregions. These aim to close the innovation \ndivide between more- and less-developed \nareas in the EU while increasing the EU\u2019s \ncompetitiveness through a stronger role for \ninnovation as a trigger of economic dynamism.\n\n\n\n679\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\ninvestment but is also a political response to \nthe perception that the EU as a whole has \nbeen falling behind its main competitors in \ninnovative capacity. For most of the 1990s and \n2000s, investment in R&D in the EU languished \nat levels slightly below 2 % of GDP. Japan \n(generally over 3 %) and the US (just short of \n3 %) have been pulling ahead. At the same \ntime, emerging countries, such as South Korea \nand, more recently, China have caught up and \nsurpassed the EU in terms of relative R&D \ninvestment (Dosi et al., 2006; Crescenzi et al., \n2007). Hence, geopolitics and the fear of being \nleft behind has contributed to setting the 3 % of \nGDP objective as one of the main pillars of, first, \nthe Lisbon Strategy and, later, the Europe 2020 \nStrategy (Uppenberg, 2009). High hopes have \nbeen put on the economic impact of achieving \nsuch an objective: the Europe 2020 Flagship \nInitiative estimated the benefits of reaching an \ninvestment in R&D of 3 % of GDP by 2020 at \n3.7 million additional jobs and an annual GDP \nincrease of EUR 800 billion by 2025 (EU, 2014).\n\nNevertheless, the adequacy of such \na quantitative target has been questioned from \nalmost the very beginning (e.g. Kok, 2004; Van \nPottelsberghe de la Potterie, 2008). The target \nhas also proved elusive (Van Pottelsberghe de \nla Potterie, 2008). Europe as a whole has not \nonly failed to come close to it but has also been \nincapable of keeping up with the R&D drive \nof its competitors \u2013 from the United States \nto Japan, South Korea or China (Dosi et al., \n2006; Crescenzi et al., 2007, 2013). Over the \nlast 20 years, competitor countries have either \nconsistently invested more in R&D (e.g. Japan, \nSouth Korea and the United States) or, as in the \ncase of China and South Korea, increased their \ninnovation efforts to a far greater extent than \nthe EU as a whole. \n\nIn addition, the overall pursuit of R&D and \ninnovation at the European level has not been \nwithout victims. Investment in R&D, despite \nsome geographical catching up, has not become \n\nmuch more territorially even than three decades \nago. In the name of excellence, scarce public \nand private R&D resources have become highly \nconcentrated, both within countries and across \nthe EU. This is an outcome of targeting R&D \ntowards those economic agents considered \nto have the greatest capacity to generate new \nproducts and processes. The problem is that \nthe most innovative actors are geographically \nconcentrated in specific countries and in specific \ncities and regions within these countries (Usai, \n2011). Core countries and core urban regions host \nand attract a disproportionate share of innovative \nfirms and research centres and, consequently, \nscientists. The shift from an \u2018old\u2019 to a \u2018new\u2019 digital \neconomy \u2013 or from Industry 2.0 to Industry 4.0 \n(Schwab, 2017) \u2013 further fuels the clustering of \nresearch activities into large agglomerations and \nthe redesign of global innovation value chains to \nthe benefit of core areas (Brun et al., 2019). In \nthese core and innovation-prone environments, \npositive externalities from the agglomeration \nof R&I activities arise (Audretsch and Feldman, \n1996; Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 1999). This widens the \ninnovation divide as the dominant conviction is \nthat \u2013 following the endogenous growth theory \n(Romer, 1986; Lucas, 1988) \u2013 increasing returns \non investment in R&D will mainly happen in \ninnovation-prone areas. From this perspective, if \nEurope is to remain innovative and competitive, \nthe R&D effort should be concentrated in \nthose regions where the greatest returns can \nbe achieved. \n\nYet, conscious of the growing innovation divide, \nthe EU and European countries have tried for \nyears to prevent the scientific and knowledge \ngap between R&D rich and poor countries, \ncities and regions from growing. The public \nsector has deliberately channelled public R&D \ninto universities and public research centres in \nsome of the less-well-off areas with the aim of \nbringing them closer to the technological and \ninnovation frontiers and triggering the conditions \nfor innovation to take hold. In 2016, or the \nmost recent year for which data are available, \n\n\n\n680\n\nthe public sector (universities and government \nresearch sectors) was responsible for 100 % \nof all R&D investment in South-East Romania. \nIt represented more than 90 % of all R&D \nexpenditure in South-West Oltenia (Romania), \nthe Ionian Islands, the Aegean Islands, Crete, \nthe Peloponnese, and Thessaly (Greece), the \nOverseas Departments (France), and the Azores \n(Portugal). Furthermore, the number of relatively \nless-developed regions where the public R&D \ninvestment exceeds 80 % of the total remains \nhuge. It includes, among others, Trier and Leipzig \nin Germany, most of Greece outside Athens, \nExtremadura, the Balearic and the Canary Islands \nin Spain, Corsica in France, Molise, Calabria and \nSardinia in Italy, Lubelskie in Poland, or Nord-Est \nin Romania (DG Regio data). \n\nThe Great Recession, however, triggered \na reduction in the overall amount of public \nexpenditure in R&D, without necessarily \ndynamising the role of the private sector in \nthe innovation realm in lagging-behind areas. \nThe prolonged crisis, the hit it made on public \nfinances and local firms, and the ensuing \nausterity had an immediate knock-on effect \n\non the R&I effort. The first impact of the crisis \nwas a decline in R&D investment in whole \nswathes of Europe and, although a recovery \nhas ensued, it has been slow and territorially \nuneven. In 2016, R&D investment in the EU28 \nwas marginally higher than in 2006. The R&D \neffort across the whole of the EU jumped from \n1.76 % of GDP in 2006 to 2.03 % in 2016. \nHowever, some countries have yet to return to \nthe levels of R&D intensity witnessed in pre-\ncrisis times. This includes the two countries \nwith the highest levels of R&D intensity before \nthe crisis (Sweden and Finland) as well as that \nwith the lowest relative investment, Latvia \n(Figure 12-1). The post-crisis recovery of R&D \nintensity has been almost negligible in many \nMember States which, in 2006, registered \nlevels of R&D intensity at 1.2 % of GDP or \nlower. In Latvia, Ireland, Spain, Romania, \nMalta, Lithuania, Croatia, Cyprus, Italy and \nHungary, R&D intensity growth between 2006 \nand 2016 was below the EU average for the \nperiod (Figure 12-1). The highest growth in \nR&D intensity has occurred in countries such \nas Austria, Belgium, Germany and Denmark, all \nof which were above the EU average in 2006.\n\n\n\n681\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\nSince the crisis, the innovation-inducing effort \nhas tended to follow, to a far greater extent \nthan before, efficiency criteria at the expense \nof nurturing new innovation poles and creating \nthe right ecosystems for innovation to thrive \noutside the traditional innovation hubs. With \nthe exception of Sweden and Finland (which \nstill ranked first and fifth, respectively, in R&D \nintensity in the EU28 league in 2016), a certain \npolarisation in the R&D effort has ensued. In \nspite of significant improvements in a handful \nof some of the less-developed EU countries \n\u2013 and, especially in Slovenia, Czechia, Greece, \n\nand Poland \u2013 most less-developed countries \nand regions lag well behind the core of Europe \nin terms of both capacity to invest in R&D \nand innovation. Today, as is the case in other \nparts of the world (Carlino and Kerr, 2015) the \ninnovation divide in the EU remains far larger \nthan the gap for most other basic economic \nindicators, such as GDP per capita, employment \nor productivity. Such an R&D gap signals that \naddressing inequalities in wealth, employment \nor productivity may be made harder by the low \ninnovation capacity of many of Europe\u2019s less-\ndeveloped areas.\n\nFigure 12-1 Change in R&D intensity in the EU28 by country (2006-2016)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author's elaboration using Eurostat data\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter12/figure_12-1.xlsx\n\n-0.80 -0.60 -0.40 -0.20 0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80\n\nEU28\nEuro area (EA-19)\n\nAustria\nBelgium\n\nGermany\nDenmark\nSlovenia\nCzechia\nGreece\nPoland\n\nBulgaria\nPortugal\nSlovakia\n\nNetherlands\nHungary\n\nFrance\nItaly\n\nEstonia\nCyprus\nCroatia\n\nUnited Kingdom\nLithuania\n\nMalta\nRomania\n\nSpain\nIreland\nLatvia\nSweden\nLuxembourg\nFinland\n\nChange in R&D investment as a % of GDP\n\n\n\n682\n\nThis panorama derives mainly from the clash \nbetween conflicting principles at the heart of \nthe EU. The pursuit of excellence in innovation \nis at odds with the objectives of delivering \nharmonious development and territorial \ncohesion (Article 174 of the Treaty). This \nrepresents an important conundrum for the EU. \nOn the one hand, invention and innovation today \nincreasingly demand larger, more complex \nprojects, involving top research centres and firms \nand a critical mass of scientists that are mostly \nfound in a limited number of areas (Buzard et \nal., 2017). Thus, greater efficiency is regularly \nachieved via the territorial concentration of \ninvestment. On the other hand, innovation \npolarisation may imply that considerable talent \nfor innovation and ample research potential is \nbeing left untapped. It can also lead to brain \nand firm drain that can leave many areas of \nthe EU increasingly vulnerable and incapable of \nfacing competition (De Noni et al., 2018). Worse \nstill, the lack of innovation in less-developed \nareas can render many of them dependent on \ngovernment assistance and brewing social and \neconomic tensions. Thus, the R&I divide may be \n\ncontributing to a geography of discontent that \nthreatens to undermine the very system on \nwhich the pursuit of excellence in innovation is \nbased (McCann, 2019; Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2018).\n\nThis contribution to the Science, Research \nand Innovation Performance of the EU (SRIP) \nReport looks at the economic consequences of \nthe R&I divide across EU regions and highlights \nthe policy challenge this represents by con-\nsidering the opportunities and risks that the \nconcentration of the innovation effort and of \ninnovative outcomes entail for Europe\u2019s future \nposition in the world. First, this contribution will \nreview the theoretical factors behind current \nlevels of territorial polarisation in innovation. \nIt will then present the evidence and highlight \nhow the geographical gaps in R&D investment \nand in innovation affect both the production of \ninnovation and economic growth for the EU as \na whole and across its different types of regions, \naccording to the level of development. The final \nsection develops some policy implications and \ngeneral recommendations.\n\n2.  Why does innovation tend to concentrate \ngeographically?\n\nA somewhat oversimplified version of the linear \nmodel of innovation (Bush, 1945; Maclaurin, \n1950) assumes that innovation is a direct \nconsequence of investment in R&D (Balconi \net al., 2010). Places that invest more in R&D \ninnovate more and, as a result, experience \nincreases in productivity and greater economic \ndynamism and growth. From this point of view, \nthe logical policy for achieving greater innovation \nand economic growth is increasing investment \nin R&D. This is precisely what the EU and most \ncountries within it have done until recently.\n\nHowever, more recent theoretical developments \nsuggest that R&D investment alone does \nnot trigger the same returns on investment \neverywhere. There are several reasons for this.\n\nFirst, technology is not equally and ubiquitously \naccessible at similar costs. Moreover, invest-\nment in technology does not necessarily benefit \nfrom constant or decreasing returns to scale, \nas assumed by the neoclassical growth theory \n(Swan, 1956; Solow, 1957). This implies that, \nwhereas in certain areas investment in R&D \n\n\n\n683\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\nmay make a lot of sense in order to achieve \ninnovation, in others, similar investments may \nyield much lower returns or simply be wasted. \nAccording to the endogenous growth theory \n(Romer, 1986: Lucas, 1988), investment aimed \nat triggering greater innovation can produce \nincreasing returns to scale, especially in places \nwith better endowments in basic factors, \nsuch as infrastructure (which facilitates \naccessibility) and labour skills. Consequently, \none additional euro in locations with good \nphysical and human capital would result in \ngreater innovation than in areas where those \nendowments are far weaker.\n\nSecond, many lagging-behind areas cannot \nmake the most of any additional investment \nin R&D because they are too far away from \nthe technological frontier (Aghion and Griffith, \n2008). Distance from the technological frontier \nreduces the capacity of territories to develop \nand host innovative activity as they not only \nlack the necessary critical mass but are also \nfar less likely to have sufficient endowment \nin human capital and the adequate \u2018economic \nfabric\u2019 to transform R&D into innovation. Such \noften economically lagging-behind areas are \nregarded as less able to generate, import \nand absorb knowledge and, consequently, to \nmake the leap from investment to innovation, \nmeaning that most investment in R&D would \njust be money wasted (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2001).\n\nThird, larger and denser regions provide \u2013 \naccording to the new economic geography \napproach (Ottaviano and Puga, 1998; Fujita, \nKrugman and Venables, 2001) and to urban \neconomics (Glaeser, 2012) \u2013 the positive \nexternalities that facilitate the interaction and \nnetworking behind the exchange of knowledge. \nLarge and dense urban agglomerations \ncontain the suitably skilled human capital and \nknowledge infrastructure and the economies \nof scale, specialisation and diversification \n\nthat facilitate the generation and circulation \nof new knowledge. By having a large number \nof innovative actors co-located in one place, \nthe right environment is created for the \nformation and diffusion of new knowledge. \nMost of this new knowledge is in the form \nof \u2018tacit\u2019 knowledge which is knowledge that \nis distributed through non-codified channels \nwhich benefit from the co-location of economic \nactors and the proximity to innovation that \nlarge and densely agglomerated environments \nafford (Feldman and Florida, 1994; Gertler, \n1995). This is what Marshall (1895) described \nas \u2018something is in the air\u2019 and what Storper \nand Venables (2004) called the \u2018buzz\u2019 of the \ncity. Smaller and less-dense cities and regions \nlack these favourable ecosystems, making the \nfield of innovation an uneven one.\n\nFurthermore, the quality of local institutions \nalso plays an important role in defining the \ncapacity of different places to innovate. Larger \ncities and metropolises tend to innovate \nmore and not only because they benefit from \nconsiderable positive externalities. They also \nenjoy, as a whole, better institutional quality. \nAs indicated by Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Di Cataldo \n(2015: 693), \u2018knowledge production structures \nin lagging regions are massively affected by \nquality of government\u2019: the lower the quality \nof government, the smaller the chances to \ninnovate. Quality of government thresholds \noften prevent investment in R&D in lagging-\nbehind regions from yielding significant \neconomic returns.\n\nFinally, knowledge tends to be \u2018sticky\u2019 and \ntravels with great difficulty (Moreno et al., \n2005; Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Crescenzi, 2008; \nSonn and Storper, 2008). Thus, physical \nproximity becomes a fundamental driver of \nR&I. Agglomeration externalities and the co-\nlocation of innovative actors can result in the \ncreation of geographically bounded networks \n\n\n\n684\n\nor systems characterised by high degrees of \ntrust, collaboration and cooperation within \nwhich knowledge may be exchanged and \nshared. Physical agglomeration is considered \nto be at the root of frequent and repeated \ntransfers of information and knowledge, \nenabling the emergence of new ideas and \ntheir rapid transformation into economically \nviable activities (Duranton and Puga, 2001; \nStorper and Venables, 2004). This knowledge \ntransfer takes place in both a codified and \ntacit way (Storper and Venables, 2004; Leamer \nand Storper, 2014), facilitated by the frequent \nface-to-face interactions that the high density \nof innovative actors in core areas affords \n(McCann, 2007). The key role played by physical \nproximity can, therefore, justify an increasing \nconcentration of the R&I effort in core areas. \n\nWrapping up, it has often been argued that \nlarge and densely populated core areas \nprovide the most adequate ecosystems for \nnew knowledge to come to fruition and for \ninnovation to take hold (Duranton and Puga, \n2001; Puga, 2010). They have a considerable \nadvantage in R&I endowments vis-\u00e0-vis less-\ndeveloped regions, as they concentrate both \nthe largest knowledge infrastructure, ranging \n\nfrom public research centres, laboratories and \nuniversities to firms with the greatest capacity \nto invest in and conduct R&I activities. These \nfacilities, in turn, generate and attract large \nnumbers of researchers and skilled individuals.\n\nIn contrast, there is a dearth of innovative \nresources in less-developed areas which, in \naddition to their distance to the technological \nfrontier (Aghion and Griffith, 2008), can \nrepresent an insuperable barrier for the \ncreation of new knowledge, its circulation, and \nits transformation into viable and sustainable \neconomic activity. As a consequence, smaller \nand/or less-developed cities and regions are \ngenerally perceived to be less capable of \nhosting innovative activity.\n\nTo summarise, in the pursuit of R&I excellence \nand maximisation of the returns of R&D \nand innovation investment, core areas are \nnot only generally thought to be in a better \nposition to attract more resources because of \nthe sheer concentration of innovative actors, \nbut they are also perceived as more likely to \noffer considerably higher returns than when \ninvestment takes place in peripheral areas.\n\n3.  The innovation input and output divide in the EU\n\nTo what extent has Europe followed the dom-\ninant trend? Are innovation inputs geographic-\nally concentrated in order to potentially  deliver \nhigher economic returns? Figure 12-2 portrays \nthe geographical distribution of total R&D in-\nvestment (in 2005, euros) for the NUTS 2 re-\ngions of the EU28 during the period 2000 to \n2016. The different levels of expenditure by \nregion are expressed in quintiles. \n\nThree groups of regions can be distinguished \namong the top spenders on R&D. As expected \n\nfrom the theory, the first group comprises some \nof the largest agglomerations in the EU. Inner \nLondon, Paris, Madrid, the Randstad, Berlin, \nCopenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki belong \nto this category. Agglomerations of innovative \nfirms, skilled individuals and public research \ncentres and leading universities are behind the \nhigh levels of R&D expenditure in these regions. \nThe second group follows the so-called \u2018Blue \nBanana\u2019: a set of regions stretching from the \nnorthern Alps in Austria and Germany, along \nthe Rhine Valley into the southern and western \n\n\n\n685\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\nNetherlands and northern Belgium, to the south \nof England. This is the traditional industrial \nand economic motor of the EU. The third set of \nregions has its centre in the Nordic countries \u2013 \ninvolving the whole of Finland, numerous regions \nin Sweden and, to a lesser extent, Denmark. \nThese regions have the greatest degree of R&D \nexpenditure in the EU (Figure 12-2).\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, very \nlimited R&D investment took place in that same \nperiod in many central and eastern European \ncountries outside the national capitals and \nlargest agglomerations. That was the case \nfor Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia and, with \nlimited exceptions, Hungary and Poland. In \n2016, Latvia had the lowest R&D investment \nintensity in Europe, with just 0.44 % of GDP.\n\nFigure 12-2 Total intramural R&D expenditure in PPS per inhabitant,  \naverage 2000-2016 (EUR)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author's elaboration using Eurostat data \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter12/figure_12-2.xlsx\n\n\n\n686\n\nAre there differences in this distribution \nbetween the R&D effort in the private and the \npublic sectors? Figure 12-3 maps this difference \nby focusing on R&D investment by region in the \nbusiness sector and in higher education. The \nmap for the business sector follows closely \nthat of total R&D expenditure, as business-\nsector expenditure represents roughly two \nthirds of all R&D efforts in the EU. The three \ntypes of regions identified in Figure 12-2 are \nstill very much in evidence: large metropolises, \nBlue Banana, and Nordic regions. \n\nThe panorama is somewhat different when \nconsidering the higher education sector. While \nthe big spending regions still coincide with \n\nthose with the greatest agglomeration, and \nmost eastern European regions remain at \nthe bottom of the investment ladder, this is \nnot so likely to be the case in many southern \nEuropean regions. Investment in higher \neducation in a number of southern French \nregions, most regions in Spain and Portugal, \nareas of central and southern Italy, or \nWestern Slovenia is higher than their overall \nlevel of R&D investment might suggest. In \nmany of these cases \u2013 as in Andalusia and \nExtremadura in Spain, Centro and Alentejo in \nPortugal, or Campania and Puglia in Italy \u2013 \nthe government and higher education sectors \ncompensate for the absence of a private \nsector capable of pursuing R&D activities.\n\nFigure 12-3 Total intramural R&D expenditure in PPS per inhabitant,  \naverage 2000-2016, in the business (first map) and the higher \n\neducation (second map) sectors (in euros)\n\n\n\n687\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author's elaboration using Eurostat data \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter12/figure_12-3.xlsx\n\nThe concentration of innovation-leading \ninputs is not limited to R&D. The EU has set \nup a number of flagship research programmes \nwhose main aim is the pursuit of excellence \nin research.

As \n\nresearch capabilities are unevenly distributed \nacross the geography of the EU, the territorial \nallocation of research funding under these \nprogrammes is equally uneven.

Capital cities and large \nagglomerations (with the exception of London), \nregions around the Alps and along the Rhine \n(e.g. Upper Bavaria, Karlsruhe, Alsace, Cologne, \nAntwerp), and a number of Nordic regions \nattract the bulk of the funding. Despite some \nexceptions in central and eastern Europe, such \nas Athens, Bratislava, Crete, Estonia and Prague, \nthe lowest share of funding per capita is found \nwhen moving eastwards.

When mapping \n\n1 Patent applications are, however, a highly imperfect measure of innovation outputs. Patents tend to reflect more invention \nand radical product innovation than process, organisational, marketing or incremental product innovation. They also boost \nthe innovative capacity of areas specialising in manufacturing, relative to those whose economic structure is more reliant on \nservices. And, within manufacturing, they favour those areas specialising in sectors such as chemicals or pharmaceuticals \nthat routinely rely on patenting as a way of appropriating the returns on their innovation.\n\nthe only innovation output that is available \nover a considerable period of time for the \nwhole of the EU at a regional level \u2013 patent \napplications1 \u2013 a very uneven geography of \ninnovation emerges.\n\n\n\n690\n\nFigure 12-6 Patent applications to the European Patent Office (EPO),  \nper million of active population (2000-2012)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author\u2019s elaboration based on Eurostat data\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter12/figure_12-6.xlsx\n\nThere are some minor differences between \nthe geographical distribution of the groups \nof regions in terms of patenting and that \nderived from the innovation input maps. Both \nGermany and the north of Italy, the two areas \nin the EU with the largest manufacturing \nsectors, score well. The top 20 % of patenting \nregions are populated by southern German \nand northern Italian regions. Most capital \ncities in the EU\u2019s economic core, from Paris to \nLondon, Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen, \nto Amsterdam, Berlin and Vienna are also \nover-represented in the top category. However, \n\nthe former Iron Curtain is still very much in \nevidence. With very few exceptions (Budapest, \nWarsaw), regions in central and eastern Europe \ncluster in the bottom 40 % of EU regions in \nterms of patenting. From Estonia to Crete, \nfrom western Slovenia to north-east Romania, \npatent applications have remained well below \nthose found in most western European regions. \nOnly some regions in the Italian Mezzogiorno \nand the least-developed areas of the Iberian \nPeninsula have comparable low levels of \npatent applications to those found in most \ncentral and eastern European regions.\n\n\n\n691\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\nHowever, the patenting divide across EU \nregions has been gradually declining since the \nturn of the century. Regions in the Baltics, the \nVisegr\u00e1d countries, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, \nsouthern Italy and the Iberian Peninsula have \nbeen catching up, albeit starting from very \nlow levels in some cases, compared to the \ncore of the EU. Outside this group, only the \nItalian region of Alto Adige is in the top 20 % \nof catching-up regions. In contrast, some of \nthe lowest growth in patenting took place in \nregions in the United Kingdom, Wallonia in \nBelgium, Brunswick, Cologne, Darmstadt and \n\nRhine-Hesse-Palatinate in Germany, or North \nBrabant in the Netherlands. However, not all \nregions in areas lagging-behind in innovation \nhave caught up. Abruzzo, Sardinia and Sicily \nin Italy, Eastern Macedonia and Thrace and \nThessaly in Greece, North-eastern Bulgaria, \nthe Northern Great Plain in Hungary, the \nSouth-west of Czechia and Continental Croatia \nwere stuck in the bottom category of patent \napplication growth, which means these regions \nachieved much lower innovation progress than \nthe EU average.\n\nFigure 12-7 Patent application growth (2000-2012)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author\u2019s elaboration based on Eurostat data\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter12/figure_12-7.xlsx\n\nTop 20%\n60-80%\n40-60%\n20-40%\nBottom 20%\nNo data\n\n\n\n692\n\n4.  The R&D divide, innovation and \neconomic performance\n\nWhat are the consequences of the R&D and \ninnovation divide for innovation and economic \ngrowth, respectively, in Europe? Does the innov-\nation divide in the EU affect its overall economic \nprospects? Are the regions at the bottom of the \ninnovation scale particularly disadvantaged? This \nsection of the paper focuses on these questions. \nFollowing the basic logic of the linear model of \ninnovation, which has articulated the majority \n\nof innovation policies in Europe to date, the first \nquestion concerns the extent to which regional \ndifferences in innovation efforts affect innovation \nacross EU regions. This is then followed by an \nanalysis of how regional differences in innovation \ncapacity in the EU impinge on economic growth. \nTwo econometric models reflecting these two \nstages are proposed. The model for innovation \nadopts the following form: \n\nLn Pati,t = a + \u03b21GDPpci,t-1+\u03b22R&Di,t-1 + \u03b41Xi,t-1 + \u03b5i,t\nand\n\n\u03b5i,t = vt + ve\nwhere:\n\nPat depicts patent applications in region i per million active population;\n\nGDPpc is the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita;\n\nR&D represents total R&D investment in euros per person in region i during period t. Particular \nattention is devoted to the R&D effort in the less-developed regions, both in central and eastern \nEurope as well as southern Europe; \n\nX is a vector of the key factors which \u2013 according to the endogenous growth, new economic geography, \nand urban economics theories \u2013 should affect innovation. These include the region\u2019s total population, \nrepresenting agglomeration externalities; the population density; and the share of the adult population \n(25-64 years) with tertiary education; plus the overall government quality index at a regional level, \nas measured by the Quality of Government Institute at the University of Gothenburg (Charron et al., \n2014). This latter variable is also interacted with the share of R&D investment, as local government \nquality may affect the returns on R&D policy;\n\nvt ,ve vt capture time fixed effects; and ve the error term;\n\ni,t depict region and time, respectively. Depending on the regression, t can cover either 1991-2012 \n\u2013 for regression (1) with no controls, or 2000-2012, as the human capital control has only been \navailable since 2000. \n\nFor the second stage of the linear model, assessing the connection between innovation and economic \ngrowth, the regression adopts the following form:\n\nLn GDPi,t = a + \u03b21PATi,t-1+ \u03b41Xi,t-1 + \u03b5i,t\n\nand\n\n\u03b5i,t = vt + ve\nwhere:\n\nGDP represents GDP per capita in a given EU region;\n\nPat depicts the change in patent applications per million active population;\n\nX is a vector of the key factors which, according to the main theories of economic growth, are \nbound to shape regional growth. These include the four controls considered in equation (1), as \nwell as the interaction term involving regional quality of government and R&D investment;\n\nvt , ve vt capture time fixed effects; and ve the error term.\n\n\n\n693\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\nThe econometric analysis is conducted using \na static panel data estimation with fixed effects \n(FE), including interaction effects to explore \npotential differences in the association of the \nR&D and patenting variables on innovation \noutputs and economic growth, respectively, in \nless-developed regions, in general, and in the \nless-developed regions in central and eastern \nEurope and southern Europe, in particular. The \n\nuse of panel data analysis with FE requires \nthe use of levels in both depending variables \nto assess change in patenting and economic \ngrowth. The standard errors are clustered in \norder to control for arbitrary heterogeneity and \nautocorrelation. \n\nThe results for the innovation equation \n[Model (1)] are presented in Figure 12-8. \n\n1991-2012 2000-2012\n\nDep. variable: \nchange in regional  \npatent applications\n\n(1) \nFE\n\n(2) \nFE\n\n(3) \nFE\n\n(4) \nFE\n\n(5) \nFE\n\nGDP per capita (ln)\n-25.3613\n(15.966)\n\n-11.1401\n(11.849)\n\n-32.9371\n(25.121)\n\n-25.0009\n(24.257)\n\n-26.2811\n(23.392)\n\nInvestment in R&D\n2.03058***\n\n(0.202)\n1.97186***\n\n(0.213)\n2.59703***\n\n(0.398)\n2.61802***\n\n(0.402)\n2.61378***\n\n(0.405)\n\nLess-developed regions\n-0.9484***\n\n(0.253)\nLess-developed regions \n(eastern Europe)\n\n-0.8133*\n(0.479)\n\nLess-developed regions \n(southern Europe)\n\n-0.8133*\n(0.479)\n\nPopulation\n-0.00002\n(0.000)\n\n-0.00002\n(0.000)\n\n-0.00002\n(0.000)\n\nPopulation density\n0.06164***\n\n(0.017)\n0.06106***\n\n(0.017)\n0.06144***\n\n(0.017)\nShare of adults with \nhigher education\n\n2.03352**\n(0.876)\n\n2.21038**\n(0.880)\n\n2.15108**\n(0.895)\n\nGovernment quality\n28.0973*\n(15.051)\n\n27.0416*\n(14.996)\n\n27.9861*\n(15.022)\n\nInteraction R&D \ninv.*government quality\n\n-0.59242*\n(0.306)\n\n-0.59752*\n(0.308)\n\n-0.60771*\n(0.312)\n\nObservations 4 227 3 345 3 022 3 022 3 022\n\nNumber of regions 273 273 253 253 253\n\nR2 0.617 0.648 0.666 0.670 0.667\n\nAdjusted R2 0.615 0.646 0.664 0.668 0.664\n\nF test 14.54 18.14 19.05 19.33 19.38\n\nFigure 12-8 From regional R&D investment to patenting in the EU\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author's own calculations\nNote: Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter12/figure_12-8.xlsx\n\n\n\n694\n\nThe results highlight that innovation \u2013 proxied \nby patent applications to the EPO per million \nof active population \u2013 in the EU regions \nis fundamentally linked to four factors: \ninvestment in R&D, population density, a higher \nshare of population with tertiary education, and \ngovernment quality (Figure 12-8, equation 3). \nRegions in the EU that have invested the \nmost in R&D have, by and large, managed to \ntransform said investment into patents. This \nis valid for analyses covering both the period \nstarting in 1991 (equation 1) and that since \n2000 (equation 2). However, the transformation \nof R&D into innovation has been far more \nproblematic in the less-developed regions of \nthe EU2. In the latter regions, the returns in \nterms of patenting of additional investment in \nR&D were far lower than in more-developed \nareas (see also Sterlacchini, 2008). And the \ngreater difficulty to transform the science and \ntechnology effort into innovation affected less-\ndeveloped regions in central and eastern and in \nsouthern Europe in a similar way (Figure 12-8, \nequation 5). Investment in R&D in these regions \nyielded lower innovation returns. \n\nEducation also emerges as an important driver \nof innovation. Regions with greater educational \nendowment \u2013 proxied by the share of the adult \npopulation with higher education \u2013 innovated \nmore that those with weaker human capital \n(Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Crescenzi, 2008; Marrocu \net al., 2013; Faggian et al., 2017). Density \u2013 \ngenerally considered to be a fundamental \nfactor in the transfer of knowledge (Duranton \nand Puga, 2001; Storper and Venables, 2004; \nGlaeser, 2012) \u2013 also played an important \nrole in the generation of patents, relative \nto the contribution of sheer agglomeration \n(Figure 12-8, equations 4 and 5).\n\n2 Defined here as all those regions that qualified as less developed (Objective 1) during the programming period 2000-2006.\n\nFinally, government quality has a profound \nassociation with innovation, which is both direct \nand indirect. Directly, poor quality government \ndiscourages innovation (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose \nand Ketterer, 2019). Indirectly, marginal \nimprovements in R&D yield higher returns \nin terms of innovation in regions with better \ngovernment quality. In addition, the benefits \nfrom increases in the R&D effort linked to more \nefficient government institutions accrue, to \na greater extent, to regions with initially poor \ngovernment quality on the periphery of Europe \nthan to regions in the core that already enjoy \nfar better government institutions (Rodr\u00edguez-\nPose and Di Cataldo, 2015).\n\nHowever, the transition from innovation \ninto greater economic activity and growth \nin the EU has been less evident. Figure 12-9 \npresents the results of estimating the growth \nmodel, using an FE approach [Model (2)]. The \ncoefficients for patent applications show the \nlink between patenting over the last three \ndecades and regional economic growth in \nthe EU. These coefficients indicate that there \nhas been no evidence of a link between \npatenting and regional economic performance \nin the EU since the early 1990s (Figure 12-9, \nequations 1 to 3). Regions that have patented \nthe most have not grown faster. In contrast, \nthe endowment of human capital and the \ninstitutional quality at a regional level are \nstrongly and significantly connected to regional \neconomic growth. Regions with the best human \ncapital and government institutions have \ngrown considerably more rapidly than those \nwith greater shortages in these two domains. \nBoth agglomeration and density are negatively \nconnected with economic growth (Figure 12-9, \nequation 3).\n\n\n\n695\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\n1991-2012 2000-2012\n\nDep. variable: \nchange in GDP \nper head\n\n(1) \nFE\n\n(2) \nFE\n\n(3) \nFE\n\n(4) \nFE\n\n(5) \nFE\n\nPatent applications\n0.00004\n(0.000)\n\n0.00006\n(0.000)\n\n0.00017\n(0.000)\n\n0.00015\n(0.000)\n\n0.00002\n(0.000)\n\nLess-developed regions\n0.00094***\n\n(0.000)\n\nLess-developed regions \n(eastern Europe)\n\n0.01026***\n(0.002)\n\nLess-developed regions \n(southern Europe)\n\n0.00011\n(0.001)\n\nPopulation\n-0.0000***\n\n(0.000)\n-0.0000***\n\n(0.000)\n-0.0000***\n\n(0.000)\n\nPopulation density\n-0.0001***\n\n(0.000)\n-0.0001***\n\n(0.000)\n-0.0001***\n\n(0.000)\n\nShare of adults with \nhigher education\n\n0.00338** \n(0.002)\n\n0.00318** \n(0.002)\n\n0.00242* \n(0.001)\n\nGovernment quality\n0.07304***\n\n(0.025)\n0.07351***\n\n(0.025)\n0.06641***\n\n(0.023)\n\nInteraction R&D \ninv.*government quality\n\n-0.00017\n(0.000)\n\n-0.00016\n(0.000)\n\n-0.00004\n(0.000)\n\nObservations 4 227 3 345 3 022 3 022 3 022\n\nNumber of regions 273 273 253 253 253\n\nR2 0.612 0.434 0.511 0.519 0.553\n\nAdjusted R2 0.610 0.432 0.508 0.512 0.550\n\nF test 82.80 103.3 77.74 76.15 66.99\n\nFigure 12-9 From patenting to economic growth in the EU\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author's own calculations\nNote: Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter12/figure_12-9.xlsx\n\n\n\n696\n\nAs indicated in Figure 12-8, although less-\ndeveloped regions have had greater difficulties \nin transforming R&D into innovation, innovation \noutputs in these areas seem to be more \nconnected to economic growth than in more-\ndeveloped EU regions (Figure 12-9, equation 4). \nThis process, however, is entirely driven by the \nless-developed regions of central and eastern \nEurope, whereas those in southern Europe \nsuffer from the same problems of converting \ninnovation into economic growth as the average \nEuropean region (Figure 12-9, equation 5). \n\nOverall, across the EU regions, there is a positive \nconnection between R&D activities and \ninnovation, measured by patenting. However, \n\ntranslating innovation into economic growth \nis far less forthcoming (e.g. Bilbao-Osorio and \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2004). Likewise, Europe\u2019s less-\ndeveloped regions are less capable of generating \ninnovation from R&D inputs which, in turn, may \ncurtail their capacity to grow in the medium to \nlong term. Hence, the basic tenet of the linear \nmodel of innovation \u2013 that R&D investment leads \nto greater innovation and, in turn, innovation \nleads to growth \u2013 is challenged in the EU, in \nparticular across most of its less-developed \nregions. This evidence is graphically represented \nin Figure 12-10 which traces the transition from \nR&D investment in 2000 (measured in constant \n(2005) euros per capita) and regional economic \ngrowth between 2000 and 2012.\n\nFigure 12-10 From investment in R&D to economic growth in both less- and  more-\ndeveloped regions\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author\u2019s own elaboration\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter12/figure_12-10.xlsx\n\nMore developed Less developed\n\n-0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1 000\n\nG\nD\n\nP \npe\n\nr \nca\n\npi\nta\n\n g\nro\n\nw\nth\n\n (1\n y\n\nea\nr \n\nav\ner\n\nag\ne)\n\nTotal intramural R&D expenditure in all sectors, PPS per inh. 2005\n\n\n\n697\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\nAs indicated in the econometric analysis, more \ninvestment in R&D has resulted in virtually \nno additional growth. There is, however, an \nimportant difference between the connection \nbetween R&D and economic growth in both \nmore- and less-developed regions. In more-\ndeveloped regions, the regression line between \nR&D expenditure and economic growth has \na slightly positive slope. Regions in the core of \nEurope with a higher initial level of investment \nin R&D have achieved a marginally greater \ndegree of economic growth. However, this is \nnot the case in the less-developed regions. \nA negative regression line reinforces the idea \n\nthat, in many of these areas, the effort to \ngenerate greater innovation has not delivered \non the final objective of unleashing greater \neconomic activity and growth.\n\nTo what extent is this a consequence of the \ndifferent types of R&D investment being carried \nout in both less- and more-developed parts of \nthe EU? Figure 12-11 looks at the connection \nbetween R&D investment in the three main \nsectors \u2013 business, government and higher \neducation and economic growth \u2013 during the \nperiod of analysis. \n\nFigure 12-11 From investment in R&D to economic growth in less- and more-\ndeveloped regions, by sector of R&D investment\n\nMore developed Less developed\n\n-0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0 500 1 000 1 500 2 000\n\nG\nD\n\nP \npe\n\nr \nca\n\npi\nta\n\n g\nro\n\nw\nth\n\n (1\n y\n\nea\nr \n\nav\ner\n\nag\ne)\n\nTotal intramural R&D expenditure in business enterprise sectors, PPS per inh. 2005\n\n\n\n698\n\nMore developed Less developed\n\n-0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0 100 200 300 400\n\nG\nD\n\nP \npe\n\nr \nca\n\npi\nta\n\n g\nro\n\nw\nth\n\n (1\n y\n\nea\nr \n\nav\ner\n\nag\ne)\n\nTotal intramural R&D expenditure in government sector, PPS per inh. 2005\n\n-0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\nTotal intramural R&D expenditure in higher education sector, PPS per inh. 2005\n\nMore developed Less developed\n\nG\nD\n\nP \npe\n\nr \nca\n\npi\nta\n\n g\nro\n\nw\nth\n\n (1\n y\n\nea\nr \n\nav\ner\n\nag\ne)\n\n0 500 1000 1500\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author\u2019s elaboration based on Eurostat data\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter12/figure_12-11.xlsx\n\n\n\n699\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\nThree key factors may explain this mismatch. \nFirst and foremost, a large share of the \nuniversities in less-developed regions are far \nfrom being knowledge-generation leaders, \nwhich means it is often difficult for them to \nmake the most of R&D investment. Second, \nthose university departments in less-developed \nregions that do manage to produce frontier \n\nresearch often find that they have no viable \nbusiness partners in the local economy. The \nstructural composition of the economies in \nthese lagging-behind regions is key to this. The \nlack of a critical mass of innovative firms in \nmost eastern and southern European regions \nrepresents a fundamental barrier for the \ndevelopment of networks between universities \n\nWhile in more developed regions, R&D \ninvestment in the business, government, and \nhigher education sector is connected to slightly \nhigher growth, this is far from being the case for \nless developed regions. All the regression slopes \nare negative for the less developed category, \nmeaning that the lagging-behind regions that \ninvested the most in R&D have encountered \nconsiderable difficulties in transforming this type \nof innovation input into economic growth. The \ngreatest mismatch concerns the higher education \nsector. As many less-developed regions lack the \nadvanced business fabric capable of churning out \nnew knowledge generation activities (Rodr\u00edguez-\nPose, 2001), universities and higher education \ninstitutions have acted as substitutes. Indeed, the \nmajority of the growth in R&D investment in the \nless-developed regions of the EU has taken place \nin the higher education sector. This additional \n\ninvestment has contributed to an increase in the \nscientific output in these regions. Both central \nand eastern Europe and southern Europe have \nconsiderably narrowed the gap in scholarly \npublications relative to the scientific leaders in \nEurope. Whereas the countries in central and \neastern Europe produced only 16 % of the articles \nof the three European scientific leaders (the UK, \nGermany and France) in 2000, this share had risen \nto almost 27 % by 2018 (Figure 12-12). A similar \nimprovement in scientific output was witnessed \nacross southern Europe, where the shift was from \n34 % in 2000 to 52 % in 2018 (Figure 12-12). But, \nas highlighted by Figure 12-11, this considerable \nleap forward in scientific publications has not \nresulted in substantial improvements in economic \noutcomes. Most regions at the economic fringes \nof the EU have little to show for the increased \nR&D effort conducted mainly before the crisis. \n\nFigure 12-12 Scientific production in central and eastern and southern Europe \nrelative to the scientific leaders in Europe (%) (2000-2018)\n\n2000 2010 2018\n\nScientific leaders1 100 100. 100\n\nCentral and eastern Europe2 16.29 22.57 26.76\n\nSouthern Europe3 33.87 45.37 51.89\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author\u2019s own calculations\nNotes: Documents published in journals indexed in the Scimago country rankings.

Consequently, new \nknowledge being generated in these areas \ndoes either not percolate locally or, in the \nworst-case scenario, is lost from an economic \npoint of view. Therefore, the most successful \nresearch centres and departments in the EU\u2019s \nless-developed regions are pushed to reach \nout to business partners in distant locations. \nFinally, a large share of the research conducted \nby universities is basic in nature which \u2013 \nalthough fundamental in leading to innovation \nfurther down the road \u2013 has less immediate \ndirect impact than the more applied research \ngenerally performed by the business sector. \nWeaker universities and business fabrics in \nthe economic periphery of Europe thus prevent \nhigher education institutions from fulfilling \nthe same role as catalysts of innovation and \neconomic growth as they accomplish, for \nexample, in North America (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose \nand Wilkie, 2019).\n\nHence, a very modest transformation of R&D \ninto innovation and economic activity in the \n\nEU\u2019s less-developed regions contributes to \nwhat has been called the \u2018European innovation \nparadox\u2019: the lower capacity of the EU as \na whole, relative to, most notably, the United \nStates but also to the Asian Tigers, to convert \ninnovation inputs into greater economic \ndynamism (Dosi et al., 2006; Argyropoulou \net al., 2019). This is possibly because too \nmuch attention \u2013 especially in the less-\ndeveloped regions of the EU \u2013 has been put \non the \u2018supply-side\u2019 of innovation (knowledge \ngeneration) at the expense of the capacities of \ndifferent territories to absorb knowledge and \ninnovation. Similarly, the focus has been on the \nR (research-side) of R&D rather than on the D \n(development-side). While more investment in \nresearch and the development of the physical \nscientific infrastructure for it contributed to \naddressing an investment gap in the first \ninstance, overlooking the D side has contributed \nto the generation of a significant bottleneck \nthat prevents Europe from making the most, \nrelative to other economies, of its considerable \ninnovation effort (Dosi et al., 2006; Rodr\u00edguez-\nPose and Wilkie, 2019; Bianchini et al., 2019). \n\n5.  Towards a different innovation policy for the \nEU\u2019s less-developed regions \n\nOverall, the EU as a whole, and its economic \nperiphery, in particular, have failed to make the \nmost of policies that follow the linear model \nof innovation (see also Camagni and Capello, \n2013). Low levels of investment but, above all, \nstructural bottlenecks \u2013 including deficits in \nhuman capital endowments, brain drain, weak \neconomic fabrics, and inadequate institutional \necosystems \u2013 have resulted in a low capacity \nin the EU\u2019s less-developed regions to produce \nnew knowledge. But, more fundamentally, this \nhas led to a pervasive inability to translate \nknowledge into economically feasible innov-\nation. This raises questions about the wisdom \n\nof pursing a policy where the main focus is on \none aspect of the supply-side of innovation \neffort: R&D.\n\nMoreover, the incapacity of less-developed \nEuropean regions to transform new knowledge \ninto viable economic activity is undermining \nthe economic potential of these regions and \ncan lead to an exacerbation of the already \nsignificant inequalities in GDP, employment and \nproductivity further down the line. It also limits \noverall innovation in the EU, as considerable \ninnovation potential remains untapped. But \nthe consequences go well beyond unexploited \n\n\n\n701\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\npotential and spill over into the social and \npolitical realms. Lack of opportunities and \ncapacity to exploit innovation and, consequently, \nlimited economic growth is a source of tension \nand discontent on a continent that is naturally \naverse to inequalities. The outcome is growing \nsocial and political tensions, increasingly \nmanifested through the ballot box and the \noccasional outbursts of violence (e.g. the rise of \nthe \u2018gilets jaunes\u2019 in France), which threaten the \neconomic and political stability of the EU and \nwhich can ultimately also challenge innovation \nin core areas. Brexit has the potential to be \na fundamental example of this (through the \nflight of innovative firms, brain drain, reduction \nof investment in R&D, and greater social and \npolitical uncertainty) (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2018).\n\nHence, a change in politics in order to promote \neconomically viable innovation in the EU\u2019s \nless-developed regions is on order, as the innov-\native deficit in less-developed areas of the EU is \nnot necessarily a consequence of limited R&D in-\nvestment or one of a lack of new scientific know-\nledge production. Many less-developed regions in \nthe EU have levels of expenditure in R&D which \n\u2013 although still with margins of improvement \u2013 \nare broadly in line with their degree of economic \ndevelopment. Although the emphasis on the re-\nsearch side of R&D has expanded knowledge cre-\nation, the benefits in terms of greater economic \ngrowth, higher productivity and employment \ngeneration have been well below par. \n\nThere is therefore a need to go beyond \nR&D \u2013 without neglecting progress in this \nrespect over the last three decades \u2013 and \nto tackle head-on the bottlenecks related to \nthese areas\u2019 limited innovative capacity. This \nimplies, at the very least, considering the \nfollowing areas of intervention:\n\n1. Complementing the pursuit of \nexcellence in R&I needs with a greater \nemphasis on promoting innovation in \nthe EU\u2019s less-developed areas: Although \n\nexcellence should remain at the heart of the \nR&I effort, it should be acknowledged that \nthe territorial polarisation of R&I limits the \noverall innovation potential of the EU. This \nwould imply that unveiling and tapping into \nR&I potential specifically in the EU\u2019s less-\ndeveloped regions may need to become an \nexplicit and complementary policy objective.\n\n2. Putting innovation at centre stage in \nless-developed regions: So far, the R&D \neffort in less-developed regions has been \ndedicated mainly to improving research \noutcomes. As shown in Figure 12-12, \nthe less-developed countries of the EU \nperiphery have multiplied their scientific \noutput and \u2013 at least in number of outputs \n\u2013 closed the scientific gap with the core \nof the EU. However, improvements in \nresearch have not been matched by similar \nprogress in terms of innovation. With a few \nexceptions, less-developed regions in the \nEU struggle to transform research into \nnew processes and products developed by \nlocal firms \u2013 or, often, elsewhere in the EU \nas well \u2013 which means that the impact of \nthe greater research effort on the prosperity \nand well-being of society is limited. \n \nThis requires an innovation policy that \ngoes well beyond the simple funding of \nR&D or subsidies to firms in support of \nR&D and concentrates on: a) enhancing the \ninnovation capacity of firms in the region; \nand b) creating an adequate ecosystem for \ninnovation to emerge and thrive. More focus \non the role of production networks and value \nchains, as well as on triple and quadruple \nhelix strategies is thus warranted to cement \nthe foundations of favourable innovation \nsystems (Carayannis and Campbell, 2012).\n\n3. Promoting pan-European and interna-\ntional networks involving innovation \nactors: Recent research has emphasised \nthe importance of extra-local connectivity \n\n\n\n702\n\nas a source of innovation and change. \nInnovative actors which branch out to other \ninnovative actors outside the local territory \nnot only become more capable of creating \nnew knowledge and innovating themselves, \nbut also turn into catalysts of innovation in \ntheir local environments. According to the \nliterature, the results are greatest when \nthese connections are international \u2013 the \nso-called innovation \u2018pipelines' (Bathelt \net al., 2004). Such pipelines facilitate the \ncirculation of new knowledge and reduce the \nrisk of lock-in. There is increasing evidence \n\u2013 from research in Sweden, Norway, Finland, \nAustria, Portugal and Canada \u2013 that dynamic \nfirms in peripheral locations innovate \nin a different way from those in more \ninnovation-prone environments (Shearmur, \n2017; Eder, 2019; Eder and Trippl, 2019). \nFrequently, innovation is essentially achieved \nby compensating for the lack of critical mass \nand for the distance to the technological \nfrontier by engaging in international \ninteraction (Doloreux and Dionne, 2008; \nFitjar and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2011; T\u00f6dtling \net al., 2012; Grillitsch and Nilsson, 2015). \n \nYet the formation of networks for R&I \nin European policy has fundamentally \nbeen limited to the promotion of research \nconsortia within the different Framework \nProgrammes with very limited protagonism \nfor firms. Putting companies at centre stage \nof the formation of innovation partnerships, \nfirst, and networks, later, can represent \na huge boost in the innovation capacity of \nmany less-developed regions.\n\n4. Aligning EU policies with their \npotential effects on R&I and territorial \ninequalities (and better coordination \nwith national innovation policies): \nLack of an adequate horizontal alignment \nbetween the European policies that \naffect research innovation and territorial \ninequalities is limiting the impact on \n\ninvestment in innovation. This is not only \nreducing the returns on the European \nR&I policy and European Cohesion Policy, \nbut also concerns all efforts to improve \neducation and skills across the EU. \n \nIn addition to these improvements in \nhorizontal coordination, there is also a need \nfor better vertical coordination between \nEuropean and national R&I policies.\n\n5. Tackling poor institutions: Weak institu-\ntions, in general, and poor governance qual-\nity, in particular, are important barriers to \nR&I (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Di Cataldo, 2015). \nR&I policies in areas with weak governance \nare often misguided and almost always lead \nto significant waste of limited resources. \nTherefore, improvements in institutional \nquality must become essential components \nof any R&I strategy. Interventions targeting \ninstitutional bottlenecks, especially in terms \nof improving efficiency in delivering innovation \nprogrammes, increasing transparency and \naccountability, and combatting corruption will \nimprove the outcomes of any intervention to \npromote innovation, particularly in the less-\ndeveloped regions that tend to endure the \nworst of institutional bottlenecks.\n\nPutting all these factors together requires the \ndevelopment of new, place-sensitive policies: \nThat means policies that are based on strong \ntheory and solid empirical analyses, but which \nare sensitive to the conditions and problems of \nspecific groups of regions across Europe (Capello \nand Camagni, 2015; Crescenzi and Giua, 2016; \nIammarino et al., 2019). Only in this way can \nresearch and innovation policies become versatile \nenough to make sure that the contrasting \nobjectives of pursuing excellence and maximising \nthe returns on R&I investment, on the one hand, \nand of mobilising as much innovation potential \nas possible and achieving more territorially \nharmonious development, on the other, can be \nreconciled.\n\n\n\n703\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 12\n\n6.  Conclusions\n\nThe EU suffers from an important innovation \ndivide that is curtailing its capacity to increase \nits competiveness and economic presence on \nthe world stage, while also undermining the \ngoal of improving the welfare of Europeans \nregardless of where they live. The tendency of \neconomically viable innovation to concentrate \nin the more-developed areas is also having \nconsiderable consequences on the EU\u2019s \ncapacity to close the gap between its economic \ncore and its periphery, further sponsoring \na social and political discontent that can \nhave serious consequences \u2013 economic and \notherwise \u2013 for the future of Europe. And the \ndominant innovation policy emanating from \nboth the Lisbon Strategy (2000-2010) and \nEurope 2020 of raising the R&D effort to 3 % \nof GDP \u2013 despite non-negligible improvements \nin new knowledge generation \u2013 has, so far, \nfailed to trigger the economic dynamism to \nboth increase the competitiveness of the EU \nas a whole and to close the innovation divide \nbetween its more- and less-developed areas. \n\nThis demands a thorough re-examination \nof European innovation policy, especially in \nthe EU\u2019s less-developed areas. The R&D-\noriented one-size-fits-all, European-wide pol-\nicies of the past have not led \u2013 and, in all \nlikelihood \u2013 will not lead to improvements in \ncompetitiveness. Nor are they likely to yield \nsignificant improvements in economic growth, \nsustainable employment, and welfare in the \nEU\u2019s less-developed regions. As Sterlacchini \nemphasises: \u2018simply investing more public and \nprivate resources in the fields of knowledge and \n\neducation does not guarantee equal growth \nopportunities among EU regions\u2019 (Sterlacchini, \n2008: 1106). There is a need, therefore, to go \nbeyond the focus on R&D and adapt policies \nto the specific characteristics of different \nterritories: a place-sensitive innovation policy \nfor the EU. Such approach must put innovation \nand innovation absorption at its core, focusing \non the mechanisms that would facilitate the \ngeneration and absorption of innovation by \nindividual economic actors and firms and \ncontribute to the inclusion of these actors in \ninnovation-generating and diffusing value \nchains and knowledge, often extending well \nbeyond the local environment (Migu\u00e9lez and \nMoreno, 2015). \n\nRecent steps have been taken in this direction \nat both the EU and national level. In particular, \nsince the reform of the European Cohesion \nPolicy in 2014, the implementation of \nsmart specialisation strategies represents \nan important step in the right direction. But \nchanges should become bolder and more \ndaring in order to better realise the innovation \npotential of the whole of Europe and to narrow \nthe innovation and social and economic \ndivide within the EU. The stakes are high as, \nwithout better use of the talent and potential \nfor innovation across the entire EU, we will \nnot only be giving up on significant capacities \nto generate new knowledge, but will also be \nputting at risk the economic and social stability \nwhich has been at the heart of making Europe \none of the most prosperous and \u2013 despite \nappearances \u2013 equal societies in the world. \n\n\n\n704\n\n7.

The issue at stake\n\nSubdued productivity performance has \nemerged as one of the main challenges \nfacing Europe, and significantly so in the \naftermath of the last economic crisis. While \nthe slowdown in productivity growth can be \ntraced back to the second half of the nineties, \nits severity has worsened in the last decade \nwith zero or negative growth across Europe. \nEuropean countries have reversed the trend \nonly recently, and with unequal success across \ntheir regions, revealing different paths and \nhigh heterogeneity also within Member States \n(Iammarino et al., 2018).\n\nWhen science and technology are considered to \nbe the engines of growth, how can we rationalise \nthe recent productivity growth slowdown and the \nconcomitant boom in exciting new technologies? \n\nDifferent hypotheses have been put forward. \nThey range from techno-pessimistic views \u00e0 \nla Gordon (Gordon, 2012) \u2013 claiming that such \nslowdown is a permanent feature of modern \neconomies that are \u2018physiologically\u2019 unable to \nbring productivity performance back to previous \nheights \u2013 to more optimistic views, which argue \nthat the low growth countries are experiencing \nis due to the delay in the yet-to-unfold benefits \nfrom the digital revolution, caused by the slow \ntransition from a production-oriented towards \nan intangible-based economy (Brynjolfsson \nand McAfee, 2011). \n\nAnalyses of productivity dynamics at company \nlevel provide further insights. Indeed, while \nproductivity growth has generally slowed down, \nleading technological firms are still able to keep \n\nSummary\n\nThis chapter focuses on the dynamics of \ninnovation diffusion by analysing the impact \nof the regulatory framework on the gap \nbetween top firms and the followers. It \nexpands on the existing literature by explicitly \ninvestigating the relationship between the \nregulatory frameworks in the labour, goods \nand capital markets and innovation diffusion, \nboth directly and indirectly through the \nintermediate effect of business dynamism. \nThis is particularly relevant for small firms \nengaging in risky activities, such as innovation, \nfor which barriers to access to finance are \ntighter than for incumbent companies.\n\nThe authors developed an original index \nof potential technology diffusion following \na consolidated approach that uses the \ntotal factor productivity distance to the \n\ntechnological frontier as proxy, which accounts \nfor the potential transfer of knowledge and \ntechnology embodied in trade. The new \nproposed methodological approach informs \non both the mediating and moderating role \nof business dynamism in the relationship \nbetween regulation in product, labour and \ncapital markets and technology diffusion \nand thereby enriches existing literature on \nframework conditions and productivity.\n\nThis chapter produces evidence to inform \nreform efforts targeted at product, labour and \ncapital markets while also providing insights \non the impact of regulatory frameworks \non technology diffusion, the latter being \nacknowledged recently as a key factor behind \nproductivity dynamics. \n\n\n\n711\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 13\n\nup and continue to grow. A plausible implication \nof this trend can be the increasing concentration \nof knowledge and innovation creation among \na few actors and places and their lack of diffusion \n(Andrews et al., 2015; Andrews et al., 2016). \n\nMore specifically, innovation benefits are \nincreasingly concentrated among frontier \nfirms, a mechanism continually reinforced by \nthe process of globalisation, which contributes \nto increasing the productivity gap between \nthe best-performing companies and the rest. \nMarkets tend to be highly concentrated and \ndominated by a few superstar companies. \n\nAt the same time, the process of technology \ndiffusion has stalled, reducing the scope of \nlagging companies to catch up with the frontier \nleaders. On the one hand, this is driven by the \ngreater complexity of technology, demanding \nhigher absorption capacity in the form of prior \naccumulated knowledge and an adequate \nskills endowment, in order to be able to reap \nthe benefits of technological change. On the \nother hand, adverse framework conditions may \nprevent a broader diffusion of innovation across \nfirms, as they can hinder their capacity to invest \nand create barriers that affect the market \nentry of new innovative companies (Andrews \net al., 2015; Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2011). \nTherefore, the innovation gap between frontier \nfirms and the rest grows wider, contributing to \ndivergences in productivity performance. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, the existing literature has \nanalysed the impact of framework conditions \non total factor productivity (TFP) dynamics, \nfocusing mainly on the efficiency of labour, \nproduct and capital markets. The standard \nargument claims that excessive regulation in \nthe product market is constraining productivity \ngrowth, as the excessive burden on companies \ndiscourages investment (Scarpetta and Tressel, \n2002; Scarpetta et al., 2002). Similarly, stringent \nrestrictions regulating hiring and firing may \nslow down the reallocation of the labour force \n\nfrom less- to more-productive firms, creating \na negative effect on aggregate performance \nwhile also affecting hiring decisions, especially in \ndownturn periods (Martin and Scarpetta, 2012; \nMcGowan and Andrews, 2015; Thum-Thysen and \nRaciborski, 2017). Therefore, greater flexibility in \nthe labour market is usually found to be linked \nto better productivity performance. However, \na different perspective suggests that excessive \nderegulation may reduce firms\u2019 incentives \nto invest in human capital accumulation and \ntraining, with negative impacts in the medium \nand long term (Lucidi, 2012; Eg\u00e9rt, 2016). \nFinally, barriers to access to finance are singled \nout as a deterrent to companies' investments, in \nparticular for young firms engaging in innovation \nactivities (Hall and Lerner, 2010; Ag\u00e9nor and \nCanuto, 2017; European Commission, 2018).\n\nThis chapter focuses on the dynamics of \ninnovation diffusion by analysing the impact of \nthe regulatory framework on the gap between \ntop firms and the followers. It expands on the \nexisting literature by explicitly investigating the \nrelationship between the regulatory frameworks \nin the labour, goods and capital markets and \ninnovation diffusion, both directly and indirectly \nthrough the intermediate effect of business \ndynamism. The latter is defined as the sum of \nshares of firms leaving and entering the market \n(churn rate) on the total number of active \ncompanies. Excessive burdens and bureaucratic \nbarriers tend to discourage new companies from \nentering the market due to higher entry costs. This \nis particularly relevant for small firms engaging \nin risky activities, such as innovation, for which \nbarriers to access to finance are tighter than for \nincumbent companies (Scarpetta et al., 2002; \nAcs et al., 2009; Ag\u00e9nor and Canuto, 2017).\n\nThe emphasis on the role of firm dynamics (entry \nand exit) as the main channel through which \nregulatory reforms may increase productivity \ngrowth (European Commission, 2018; de Haan \nand Parlevliet, 2018), via a greater diffusion of \nknowledge, is not sufficiently reflected in the \n\n\n\n712\n\nexisting studies. Hence, this work contributes to \nthe literature in several ways.\n\nFirst, we develop an original index of potential \ntechnology diffusion following a consolidated \napproach that uses the TFP distance to the \ntechnological frontier as the proxy (Nicoletti and \nScarpetta, 2003; Buccirossi et al., 2013; Santacreu, \n2015; Santacreu, 2017). We account for the \npotential transfer of knowledge and technology \nembodied in trade, a dimension that is increasingly \nrelevant as new products, technologies and \ncomponents are used across different sectors \nand activities (e.g. dual-use technologies, key \nenabling technologies, etc.). Specifically, we use \na weighted average of the distance between the \nTFP of a firm i and the TFPs of all frontier firms in \nsectors that are trade-related to the sector of firm \ni. We use weights based on the intensity of trade \nin intermediate inputs between sectors. \n\nSecond, we contribute to the existing literature \non framework conditions and productivity with \n\n1 See also https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/growth-and-investment/structural-reforms/structural-reforms-\neconomic-growth\n\na new methodological approach that informs on \nthe mediating and moderating role of business \ndynamism in the relationship between regula-\ntion in product, labour and capital markets and \ntechnology diffusion.\n\nFinally, the analysis and its findings are relevant \nfor policy considerations in the European \ncontext. The slowdown in productivity growth \nhas affected all European regions, even if with \nheterogeneous intensity. Member States have \nbeen asked to implement structural reforms in \norder to promote growth in Europe, with a specific \nfocus on innovation as the main lever to boost \nproductivity gains1. These reforms target product, \nlabour and capital markets as crucial bottlenecks \nto the re-boosting of productivity and economic \ngrowth performance. This chapter produces \nevidence to inform those policies, whilst also \nproviding insights into the impact of regulatory \nframeworks on technology diffusion, the latter \nbeing a key factor behind productivity dynamics \n(Andrews et al., 2016).\n\n2.  Technology diffusion\n\nWhile research and innovation (R&I) are key \nengines of productivity growth, economies and \ncompanies can also grow by importing and \nadopting innovations produced elsewhere. This \nis particularly true for countries or regions that \nare far from the technological frontier and are \nless likely to produce innovation indigenously. \nHence, foreign knowledge is an important \nsource of productivity gains and a leverage for \ncountries\u2019 growth, as emphasised in the literature \non economic convergence. In his seminal work, \nAbramovitz (1986) highlighted how the potential \ngain from technology adoption is greater for \nthose who lag behind, whose potential \u2018leap\u2019 is \n\nlarger, as the technology imported would replace \nexisting capital technologically superannuated. \nThis is usually known as the advantage of \nbackwardness: 'the larger the technological and, \ntherefore, the productivity gap between leader \nand follower, the stronger the follower\u2019s potential \nfor growth in productivity; and, other things being \nequal, the faster one expects the follower\u2019s growth \nrate to be\u2019 (Abramovitz 1986, pp. 386-387). One \nof the caveats is that the recipient must be able \nto understand and use the technology, either \nimported or through technology spillovers. An \nadequate absorption capacity is needed, which \ncan be built via internal investment in R&I, skills \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/growth-and-investment/structural-reforms/structural-reforms-economic-growth\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/growth-and-investment/structural-reforms/structural-reforms-economic-growth\n\n\n713\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 13\n\nand human capital (Falvey et al., 2007; Fu et al., \n2011). The analysis in this chapter applies these \narguments at the company level.\n\nThe evolutionary economics literature led by, \namong others, Dosi (1982) and Malerba (2002), \nhas put forward the role of sectoral characteristics \nfor differences in productivity. These authors \nshow that productivity differentials are only \npartially related to innovation diffusion, and they \ndepend on a \u2018more complex set of structural \nfactors and sector-specific techno-economic \nconditions\u2019. Castellacci (2007) shows that \nsectoral differentials in productivity growth in \nEurope are related to cross-industry differences \nin terms of technological opportunities, human \ncapital, size of the market, degree of openness \nand appropriability conditions. In particular, \nwhen appropriability conditions are low, i.e. \nwhen it is more difficult to protect innovations \nfrom imitation, there is a greater opportunity \nfor intra-industry knowledge diffusion and \na positive effect on productivity growth.\n\nTechnology diffusion can occur via different \nchannels: one is foreign direct investment (FDI) \nand trade in intermediate goods and machines, \nin which technology is embedded. Knowledge \nis diffused and can be translated into products \nand services as long as the recipient firm has \nthe required absorptive capacity (Rivera and \nRomer, 1991; Grossman and Helpman, 1991; \nSantacreu, 2017). This channel is investigated \nin the international technology diffusion \nliterature, upholding the view that domestic \nproductivity growth is influenced by foreign \nsources of technology concentrated in a few \ncountries, regions and companies. These actors \nare responsible for expanding the technological \nfrontier. Countries that are farther from the \ntechnological frontier grow by adopting new \nforeign technologies, while economies closer to \nit grow by developing new technologies through \nresearch and development (R&D) investment \n(Santacreu, 2015). To this extent, international \ntechnology diffusion matters as it determines \n\nthe pace at which the world's technology frontier \nmay expand in the future (Eaton and Kortum, \n1999; Eaton and Kortum, 2001; Keller, 2002; \nComin and Mestieri, 2014) and the rate at which \nlaggards can catch up. For instance, Jung and \nLee (2010) find that TFP catch-up is more likely \nin sectors where technology is more explicit and \nembodied in equipment (such as electronics), and \nin sectors characterised by more monopolistic \nmarket structures. This allowed leading Korean \ncompanies to build innovation capacity to \nconverge with Japanese productivity levels. \n\nA second channel is the international knowledge \nspillovers that are not necessarily linked to any \nparticular transmission form but simply stem \nfrom the stock of technology. In other words, \ncurrent R&D builds on previous R&D performed \nglobally, creating a linkage between national \nresearch and the national and global stock of \nknowledge (Nadiri, 1993; Keller, 2004). Since \nspillovers cannot be directly observed, the \nmajority of empirical studies measures them \nby relating the firms\u2019 R&D investment to R&D \nactivities, TFP (Keller, 2002), patents (Jaffe et \nal., 1993; Verspagen, 1993; Mancusi, 2008), \nor inward FDI (Aitken and Harrison, 1999) of \nanother firm, conditional on the existence of \ntrade flows between the countries to which the \ntwo firms belong, in the case of international \nknowledge spillovers (Coe and Helpmann, 1995).\n\nHowever, the partially tacit, non-codified nature \nof technology makes its diffusion incomplete \nand more geographically localised (Von \nHippel, 1994). The larger the tacit component \nof knowledge, the harder it is to import \ntechnology from abroad. In addition, the costs \nand capabilities needed to absorb knowledge \nincrease with geographical distance. The \ntransfer of tacit knowledge and its positive \nspillovers are bounded to take place mainly \nlocally, building on personal interactions \nbetween or within firms and, as such, are \nstrongly dependent on proximity (Archibugi and \nFilippetti, 2018). \n\n\n\n714\n\nA trend is also observed when considering \ninnovation diffusion across economies. For \ninstance, Bahar et al. (2014), building on the \nevidence of the strong decline in knowledge \ndiffusion with geographical distance, empirically \ntest the localised nature of knowledge transfers \nand confirmed that neighbouring countries \nshare more knowledge and have similar static \npatterns of comparative advantage. \n\nKnowledge flows between companies, universi-\nties and research centres across countries and \nregions are another source of innovation diffusion. \nThe literature on R&D collaboration sparked by \nd\u2019Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) suggests \nthat cooperation among firms or between \ncompanies and universities leads to knowledge \n\nspillovers, provided that the collaborating parties \nhave a sufficient level of appropriation capabilities \n(Cassiman and Veugelers, 2002). Technological \ncollaboration allows small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) to close the innovation \ngap with firms at the \u2018frontier\u2019 (Nieto and \nSantamaria, 2010) and, overall, that 'higher R&D \ncollaboration is associated with a faster catch-\nup process of laggards firms very far from the \nnational frontier, while firms close to this frontier \nkeep pace with it\u2019 (Andrews et al., 2015, p.7). \nIn the case of Europe, the European Research \nArea initiative has aimed to improve the diffusion \nof knowledge by promoting its free circulation \ntogether with the mobility of researchers, in an \neffort to maximise the benefits from knowledge \nspillovers (European Commission, 2018).\n\n3.  Framework conditions\n\nBuilding on the above contributions, substantial \nliterature has explored the role framework con-\nditions have in shaping technology diffusion and \ndifferences in productivity and economic growth \n(Lynn et al., 1996; Nickell, 1993; Blanchard, 2004; \nAcemoglu et al., 2005; Buccirossi et al., 2013). \n\nThe institutions ruling the functioning of the \nproduct, labour and capital markets affect \ncompanies and their possibility to benefit from \ninnovation outcomes. Framework conditions \nimpact firms\u2019 decisions, including how much to \ninvest, how to invest and whether to enter or \nleave the market. Transaction and entry costs \nmay discourage small and young companies, \nwhich tend to be more innovative but are \nusually unable to get sufficient access to capital \nor to overcome cost and non-cost barriers to \nentry. Furthermore, framework conditions also \naffect the diffusion of technology, influencing \nthe allocation of resources, including skilled \nworkers and intangible capital, and hence \ncompanies\u2019 absorption capacity.\n\nFirst, restrictive product market regulations \nhinder technology transfer and have a negative \nbearing on productivity (Crafts, 2006; Scarpetta \nand Tressel, 2002). The study by Scarpetta and \nTressel (2002) explores the role of regulations \nand institutional settings in the products \nmarket in explaining TFP growth. They find that \nstringent regulatory settings in the product \nmarket have a negative impact on TFP and, \nalthough results are more tentative, on market \naccess by new firms.\n\nAs regards labour market regulation, the focus \nis on non-wage labour costs, wages setting and \nhiring and firing restrictions for companies. On \nthe one hand, the consensus seems to support \nthe view that regulation that is too strict has \nnegative effects on employment prospects, \nlabour reallocation and eventually on aggregate \nproductivity performance and growth. For \ninstance, Tressel and Scarpetta (2004) \nanalyse labour market institutions affecting \nlabour adjustment costs in 18 Organisation \n\n\n\n715\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 13\n\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD) countries, finding that high labour \nadjustment costs (proxied by the strictness of \nemployment protection legislation) decrease \nindustry-level productivity. They argue that, \nwhen non-wage labour costs (hiring and firing \ncosts) are high and labour market regulation \ndoes not allow for the flexible adjustment \nof wages, the incentives for innovation and \nadoption of new technologies are hindered, \neventually leading to lower productivity \nperformance. Moreover, these costs tend \nto discourage the entry of (especially small \nand medium-sized) firms into most markets \n(Scarpetta et al., 2002, p. 3). Consistent with \nthis view, Thum-Thysen and Raciborski (2017) \nfind that excessive restrictions in firing and \nhiring negatively affect TFP in the long term, \nwhile Balta and Mohl (2014) report that policies \naimed at reducing employment protection \nlegislation may foster productivity growth in \neconomies engaged in a catching-up process.\n\nOn the other hand, there is some evidence \nsuggesting that the opposite relationship may \nbe in place. For instance, Lucidi (2012) argues \nthat loose regulation in hiring and firing may \nprovide companies with disincentives to invest \nin technological upgrade and adoption, opting \nfor cost-competitiveness gains. Similarly, Egert \n(2016) reports evidence of a positive link between \nemployment protection and TFP, suggesting \nthat stricter restrictions in hiring and firing may \nincentivise companies to invest in human capital \nand preserve high-skilled employment. Last but \nnot least, reforms increasing the flexibility of the \nlabour market and reducing workers\u2019 bargaining \nposition may have harmful effects in terms of \ninequality, increasing the gap between the top \nincome shares and the rest (Jaumotte and \nBuitron, 2015; Dosi et al., 2017).\n\nAmong the framework conditions, constraints \nin accessing finance are singled out as a fun-\ndamental barrier to companies' investments, in \nparticular for young firms engaging in innovation \n\nactivities, and in the aftermath of the last eco-\nnomic crisis (Hall and Lerner, 2010; Ag\u00e9nor and \nCanuto, 2017; European Commission, 2018). \nThe innovation process is far from being linear \nand its intrinsically higher probability of failure is \na deterrent to provide innovative firms with cred-\nit (Mazzucato, 2013; Ag\u00e9nor and Canuto, 2017). \nInnovative companies may also face greater \ndifficulties in getting access to standard bank-\nbased sources of finance, given that their main \nvalue lies in intangible assets, such as human \ncapital and the knowledge created by R&D ac-\ntivities, which are a weak form of collateral (Hall \nand Lerner, 2010; Brown et al., 2012). Ag\u00e9nor \nand Canuto (2017) show that the lack of ac-\ncess to finance, together with the high costs of \nmonitoring innovative investments, negatively \naffect innovation activities whilst also providing \nfirms with adverse incentives to invest in skills, \nreducing the share of workers able to engage \nin research activities and the overall absorption \ncapacity. While this issue may be tackled by de-\nveloped financial markets, such as, for instance, \nequity markets that do not require collateral, the \noverall wedge between the rate of return ex-\npected by external investors and that required by \nthe entrepreneur may still be large, preventing \nthe financing of innovative investments (Hall \nand Lerner, 2010). Gorodnichenko and Schnitzer \n(2013) find that financially constrained compan-\nies in developing and transition economies are \nless innovative and less likely to catch up with \nthe innovation frontier compared to foreign \nfirms. They also reveal a link between financial \nfrictions and aggregate productivity indicators \nsuch as TFP and labour productivity.\n\nFinally, business dynamism, measured as entry \nand exit rates, drive productivity growth as \nthey contribute to the renewal of the business \npopulation, with new innovative firms entering \nthe market and challenging incumbents. In \nturn, these industry dynamics are strongly \naffected by the regulatory frameworks wherein \nfirms operate.\n\n\n\n716\n\nWhile studies on industry dynamics and produc-\ntivity show that the entry and exit of firms makes \na significant contribution to aggregate productiv-\nity growth (Foster et al., 2006), the available evi-\ndence is less conclusive concerning the relation-\nship between business dynamism and framework \nconditions. Correia and Fontoura Gouveia (2017) \nfind product market regulation has a negative \nimpact on labour productivity, but they reach \na different conclusion when employment pro-\ntection legislation is considered, for which they \nfind either a zero or slightly positive impact on \nlabour productivity growth. Acs et al. (2009) link \nfirms\u2019 entry decisions to knowledge spillovers \nand barriers to entrepreneurship, such as legal \nand bureaucratic constraints, and labour-market \nrigidities. Fuentelsaz et al. (2015) incorporate the \nrole of the framework conditions to explore dif-\nferences between incumbent firms and new en-\ntrants. In particular, they show how the informal \n\n2 The countries included in the final sample are BE, BG, CZ, DE, DK, EE, ES, FI, FR, UK, HR, HU, IT, LV, PT, SE, SI and SK. To con-\nstruct our final sample, we use the online version of Orbis and have restricted our selection to firms reporting balance sheet \ninformation on turnover, value added, capital, and employees for at least three consecutive years. Then we compare the \ncoverage of our sample to the official population statistics from Eurostat, in terms of country, year, sector of activity and \nsize class. To increase the representativeness of our data, we keep only those countries for which our sample accounts for \neither at least 50 % of total employment or 50 % of total gross output.\n\nadvantages of being incumbent firms (renowned \nby investors, trade associations and banks and \nholding central positions in knowledge networks) \nprovide them with a greater probability of surviv-\nal and market share advantages. This is especial-\nly true in the context of weak market-supporting \ninstitutions, including property rights protection \nor the presence of financial intermediaries fa-\ncilitating capital and information flows within the \nmarket. Indeed, \u2018in situations where market-sup-\nporting institutions are not sufficiently developed, \ninformal ties acquire an important role in sup-\nporting economic exchanges. When formal in-\nstitutions are weak, informal relationships have \na greater influence on driving firm strategies and \nperformance\u2019 (Fuentelsaz et al., 2015, p. 1782). \nThese mechanisms at play are linked to the phe-\nnomenon of the survival of zombie firms in the \nmarket, due to their advantage as incumbents \n(McGowan et al., 2017).\n\n4.  Empirical analysis\n\n4.1 Data \n\nThis chapter sets itself apart from the existing \nliterature by assessing the impact of regulatory \nframeworks on technology diffusion, both \ndirectly and indirectly through the mediating \nand moderating effects of firm dynamics. For \nthis purpose, we use balance-sheet information \nat the company level drawn from the Orbis \ndatabase (Bureau Van Dijk) to compute TFP. \nThe latter is the building block to construct our \nmeasure of technology diffusion. Firm-level \ndata on productivity is matched with country- \nand sector-level data on business dynamics, \nhuman capital, and regulatory frameworks, \n\ncovering the three dimensions of product, \nlabour and capital (access to finance) market \nregulation from different sources. Overall, to \naccount for all the dimensions we want to cover, \nwe use a number of datasets at different levels \nof aggregation: firm-, sector-, and country-level.\n\nTFP is our starting point to produce a measure \nof innovation diffusion. In order to compute TFP, \nwe use information on turnover, value added, \nfixed assets, and the number of employees from \nthe online Orbis database. Our final sample is \nan unbalanced panel of 1.4 million companies, \nfrom 2007 to 2017, belonging to 18 EU \nMember States2. Each company is associated \n\n\n\n717\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 13\n\nwith a main sector of activity, following the \nNACE rev.2 classification at the 2-digit level.\n\nSector-specific information about business \ndynamics (firm entry and exit rates) is provided \nby Structural Business Statistics (SBS, Eurostat), \ncovering the business economy for industry, \nconstruction, and distributive trades and \nservices. The data are reported at 2-digit level \nfor most of the economic activities, although \nsome are reported as groups (e.g. '05-09' mining \nand quarrying or '10-12' manufacture of food \nproducts, beverages and tobacco products). \n\nData on the three framework conditions \ndimensions (product, labour, and capital market \nregulations) are obtained from different data \nsources. \n\nTo measure the degree of regulation in the \nproduct market, we use the Regulatory Impact \nIndicator developed by Egert and Wanner (2016) \nfor the OECD. The indicator follows the same \nrationale of the Product Market Regulation \nindicator developed by the OECD itself, but has \nthe advantage of being disaggregated by sector \n(NACE rev.2, 2 digits)3. Values are normalised as \nbetween 0 (low regulation) and 1 (high regulation). \n\nTo measure labour market regulation, we use \nthe OECD\u2019s Employment Protection Legislation \n(EPL) indicators. The first one concerns individual \nand collective dismissals, while the other one \nis related to the regulation of wage setting. \n\n3 The indicator exploits input-output matrices to measure the relevance of regulation in upstream sectors for downstream \nindustries in each country. The rationale is that sectors using intermediate inputs from more regulated sectors are more \naffected by the rigidities in those sectors. We use the country-weighted version since we include country fixed-effects to \naccount for heterogeneity in the estimates.\n\n4 The three sub-indicators are part of the Financial Markets Development indicator in the Global Competitiveness Index, to \nwhich they contribute via a simple and weighted average. Since the three variables represent different forms of access to \nfinance for companies, in our preliminary analysis, we have used the three indicators separately. However, they all yield \nsimilar results to those reported in this chapter.\n\nBoth indicators take values between 0 and 6, \nwhere a higher value indicates stricter rules/\nprocedures for the termination of contracts or \nfor determining employees\u2019 wages. From these \ntwo indicators, we build a principal component-\nbased weighted index. \n\nLastly, we include three indicators for the \naccess to capital markets from the Global \nCompetitiveness Index developed by the \nWorld Economic Forum. They capture different \nfeatures of access to credit: (i) ease of access \nto bank loans; (ii) access to equity funding to \nfinance innovative and risky projects; and (iii) \naccess to finance by issuing bonds or shares on \nthe capital market. The three indicators can take \nvalues between 1 and 7, where the higher the \nvalue, the better the performance of the capital \nmarket. From these three indicators, we build \na principal component-based weighted index4.\n\nIn addition to the three dimensions of market \nregulation, we control for the availability of \nhuman capital and absorption capacity, proxied \nby the growth rate in tertiary graduates and \nworkers in science and technology. Country-level \ndata on human capital is drawn from Eurostat.\n\nFigure 13-1 includes a more detailed description \nof the variables and data sources, while \nFigure  13.2 reports the main descriptive statistics \nfor each group of variables.

Therefore, our measure of potential \nfor technology diffusion is defined as:\n\nTTijit = wjkt [In(Aikt) \u2014 In (\u0100jt)]  (1)\n\nwith\n\nwjkt = \nZjkt\n\n \n\n\u03a3j wjkt = 1\n\nWhere Aikt is TFP of firm i in sector k, \u0100jt is the \nTFP of the leader frontier firm in sector j, wjkt is \na weight measuring global intermediate use by \nsector k of products Z of sector j (of the leader \nfirm) at any time t5. \n\n5 Data on the use of intermediate inputs is extracted by the World Input-Output Tables from the World Input-Output Database: \nhttp://www.wiod.org/home\n\nEquation (1) can be decomposed as the sum of \nthe traditional distance to the frontier, plus all \nthe other distances to frontiers that are trade-\nrelated to firms in sectors that import products \nin the frontier\u2019s sector:\n\nTTijit =  wjjt [In(Aijt) \u2014 In (\u0100jt)] + \u03a3j\u2260k wjkt  \n[In(Aikt) \u2014 In (\u0100jt)]   (2) \n\nWhen there is no intersectoral trade (wjkt = 0), \nthe distance from the frontier is only given by \nthe gap with the leader firm in the same sector, \nas in the classical distance to the technological \nfrontier in the literature.\n\nUsing the intensity of trade in intermediate \ninputs to weigh the distances to sector-specific \nfrontiers provides a more appropriate measure \nof the technological gap, as it corrects for the \nbias arising when considering technologically \nunrelated sectors, such as, for instance, fishing \nand air transport. At the same time, it enables \nfirms and frontiers companies operating in \ntwo different sectors that are nevertheless \ntrading intermediate products with embodied \ntechnology to be related. To give an example of \nsector relatedness, the manufacturing sector \nof plastic and rubber products provides on \naverage 11 % of its products to the computer, \nelectronic and optical products manufacturing \nsectors and 12 % to the manufacturing of \nmotor vehicles.\n\nFigure 13-3 shows the differences, in 2016, \nbetween the trade-weighted and non-weight-\ned distributions of the distance to the techno-\nlogical frontier. Since both measures are based \non TFP gaps, observations closer to 0 identify \ncompanies with the smaller gap with respect to \nthe frontier. The traditional, non-weighted distri-\nbution is more dispersed, with more companies \non the two extremes, i.e. both closer (on the left) \nand farther (on the right) from the frontier.\n\n\u03a3jZjkt\n\n\n\n721\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 13\n\nOn the other hand, a distinguishing feature of \nour trade-weighted measure is the presence of \na \u2018bump\u2019 of companies closer to the frontier \nthan the rest.\n\nWhile the unweighted and weighted distances \nto the frontier have similar overall averages \n(14.54 versus 14.6), the traditional distances \nare more dispersed (higher standard deviation \nand inter-quartile range) than the trade-\nweighted ones, with variations across sectors. \nFurthermore, the less the frontier\u2019s sector \nexports intermediate inputs to the other \nsectors, the smaller the difference between the \ntraditional and the trade-weighted distances.\n\nThe evolution of the distribution of trade-\nweighted distance from 2008 to 2016 is shown \nin Figure 13-4. Two main features characterise \nthe latest distribution. First, the main mode \nmoves to the right, revealing an increase in the \naverage distance to the TFP frontier. This finding \nis consistent with recent firm-level studies \nhighlighting the rising gap between frontier \ncompanies and laggards which began at the \nbeginning of the 2000s (Andrews et al., 2015). \nSecond, in 2016, the density is characterised \nby a bump' emerging close to the bottom of \nthe distribution. This new group of companies \nis getting closer to the frontier, despite the fact \nthat the average economy-wide trend, i.e. the \n\nFigure 13-3 Weighted vs. traditional distance to the frontier, 2016 \n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 own calculations\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter13/figure_13-3.xlsx\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0 40302010\n\nD\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n o\nf \n\ndi\nst\n\nan\nce\n\n t\no \n\nfr\non\n\nti\ner\n\nWeighted TFP gap Traditional TFP gap\n\nx\n\n\n\n722\n\nrest of the population, is falling behind. Such \na trend may reveal the emergence of a new \ngroup of companies able to exploit and put into \nproduction cross-cutting technologies produced \nelsewhere, notably in related sectors or industry6. \n\n6 See, for instance, Xiao et al., (2018) for the concept of relatedness.\n\nIt is worth noting that this distinguishing feature \ncan only be captured when considering the \nmeasure of distance with intermediate input \ntrade correction (see also Figure 13-3).\n\nFigure 13-4 Evolution of distances from the frontier\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 own calculations\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter13/figure_13-4.xlsx\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0 40302010\n\nD\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n o\nf \n\ndi\nst\n\nan\nce\n\n t\no \n\nfr\non\n\nti\ner\n\n2008 2016\n\n25\n\nTFP gap\n\n*\n\nA first channel through which product, labour \nand capital market reforms may have an \nimpact on firms' productivity and the process \nof technology diffusion is companies\u2019 dynamics \n(entry and exit). The latter is often associated \nwith economic growth, as it facilitates the \nreallocation of resources from less-productive \n(and eventually exiting) firms to more \nproductive ones. Adverse framework conditions \nmay prevent the entry of adopters of superior \ntechnology, hindering innovation diffusion and \nproductivity growth.\n\nTo investigate the mediating role of business \nchurning and thus the direct and indirect \neffects of markets regulations on technology \ndiffusion, we use a mediated regression \nanalysis (Baron and Kenny, 1986; Preacher and \nHayes, 2008) which consists of the estimation \nof two separate regression models:\n\nTTit =  \u00df\u2080 + \u00df\u2081TTit-1 + \u00df\u2082Churnjt-1 + Reg'jct-1\u00dfR + \n\u00df\u2083HC + eit    (3)\n\nChurnjt = Reg'jct-1\u00dfR + ujt   (4)\n\n\n\n723\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 13\n\nWhere TT is the measure of potential for \ntechnology diffusion defined above, Reg includes \nthe three indicators of labour, capital and \nproduct market regulation (LabFlex, CapMkt, \nProdMarkReg), and HC is the growth rate of \nhuman capital. Both regression equations \ninclude sector, year, and country dummies. \n\nSuch an approach allows for identification \nof both the indirect (via the mediating effect \nof business dynamism, i.e. the churn rate in \nequation 4) and the direct effect of regulations \non technology diffusion. The indirect effect is \ngiven by \u00df\u2082\u00dfR, while the direct effect is given \nby \u00dfR. The sum of the two components gives \nthe total effect7.\n\n4.3 Results\n\nFigure 13-5 reports the results from the main \nmediated model (first column), and from \na moderating model (second and third column). \nFor the moderating model, we split the sample \ninto firms in low-churn rate sectors and high-\nchurn sectors in order to gauge the effects \nof regulation at different levels of business \ndynamism.\n\nOur results suggest that framework conditions \nhave both direct and indirect effects on \ninnovation diffusion. \n\nLabour-market flexibility is found to have \na negative direct impact on our measure of \ntechnology diffusion: a unit increase in the \nvalue of the composite indicator of labour-\nmarket flexibility corresponds to a 3.3 % \ndecrease in technology diffusion. The indirect \neffect is slightly positive, meaning the increased \nflexibility in the wage-setting regimes and fewer \nrestrictions on hiring and firing are positively \nrelated to business dynamism. However, the \nindirect effect is quite small, leading to a 0.1 % \n\n7 We estimate a system of simultaneous equations with a 3-stage least squares (3SLS), where the error terms eit and ujt are \nassumed to be correlated.\n\nincrease in technology diffusion, hence the \ntotal relationship is still negative (-3.2 %), \nbeing dominated by the direct effect.\n\nThe relationship between product market \nregulation and innovation diffusion is found to \nbe negative. This holds for both its direct and \nindirect effect, the former being the most relevant \nchannel. Results suggest that a 10 % increase in \nthe indicator corresponds to a 1.58 %, to which \nthe indirect channel contributes only 0.01 %.\n\nImproved conditions for accessing finance in the \ncapital market have a considerably positive and \ndirect effect on technology diffusion, leading to \na 10.9 % rise following a unit increase in the \nindicator. Even in this case, the direct channel \nis barely affected by the small negative indirect \neffect of capital accessibility on the churn rate. \nThe weak relationship between access to finance \nand the churn rate is not surprising, as although \neasy access to venture, equity or debt financing \nare related to higher entry rates, they are also \nnegatively related to exit rates. Indeed, if we \nconsider the correlation coefficients relating \naccess to capital markets with entry rate and \nexit rate separately, the latter is higher (-0.13) \nin absolute value than the former (0.008). \nThis suggests that, while access to capital is \nmoderately associated with the entry of new \nfirms, it corresponds to a lower churn rate as \nit increases the probability of survival, hence \ndecreasing the overall churn rate.\n\n*\n\n\n\n724\n\nFinally, business dynamism and human capital \ngrowth positively affect the diffusion of \ntechnology: a 10 % increase in the churn rate \nor in the human capital growth rate correspond \nto a 1.39 % or a 0.9 % increase in technology \ndiffusion, respectively.\n\nHow do the above results vary if we consider \nsectors with different rates of churn rates? \nColumns 2 and 3 report the results from an \nalternative specification estimated for two \n\n8 We obtain similar results from a classical interaction effect between each regulation indicator and the churn rate.\n\nsub-samples: firms in sectors (and countries) \nwith both low churn rates (below the median \nvalue) and with high churn rates. The two \nseparate regressions highlight the moderating \nrole of the firm dynamics8. \n\nFor low levels of churn rate, the elasticity of past \ntechnology diffusion is smaller, and firms drift \naway faster from the technological frontier, as \nsuggested by the lower elasticity of current-to-\npast innovation diffusion.

If labour \nrelationships are expected to be short-lived, \nthere is little incentive for firms to invest in \nboth the general and specific training of their \nworkforces [..] Workers, for their part, will be \nreluctant to acquire firm-specific skills if they \ndo not feel a long-term commitment to their \nemployers\u2019 (Lucidi, 2012, p. 266).\n\nIn addition, a more regulated product market \ncan stimulate innovation in sectors where \ntechnology may be lacking altogether \n(e.g. environmental technologies) or in sectors \nthat are dominated by a few firms, perhaps \ndue to high entry costs (low-churning sectors \ntend to be characterised by higher employment \ncosts) or larger economies of agglomeration.\n\nConversely, the results for firms in high-\nchurning sectors are in line with a more \ntraditional view. Less-regulated product, labour \nand capital markets increase technology \ndiffusion, especially product and capital \nmarkets regulation. \n\nOverall, the results on product (but also labour) \nmarket regulation relate to the theoretical \nframework linking competition and innovation \nin a non-linear inverted-U-shaped relationship \n(Aghion et al., 2005). Our findings for product \nmarket regulation in the low and high churn \nrate suggest that when business dynamism is \nhigh, markets may be characterised by stronger \ncompetition. In this case, more regulation in the \nproduct market discourages competition and \nhas a negative effect on innovation diffusion \n(column 3 in Figure 13-5). On the other hand, \nwhen the churn rate is low, a Schumpeterian \neffect dominates, as the rents appropriable by \nentrants are low. Therefore, more regulation \nhas a positive effect on technology diffusion \n(column 2 in Figure 13-2) as the innovation \nprocess is mainly driven by incumbent firms.\n\nFinally, more accessible financial markets are \nalways associated with more potential for \ntechnological diffusion, independently of the \nchurn rate or the specification used.\n\n5.  Discussion and policy implications\n\nIn an era of increasing globalisation and new \ndigital technologies that could allow faster-\nthan-ever international knowledge diffusion \nand technology transfers, the gap in productivity \nbetween frontier and other firms is widening, \nstimulating policy and academic debates on \nthe underlying causes, most notably on those \nbehind the stalling technology diffusion process.\n\nWhile most of the policy initiatives are aimed \nat improving technological capabilities and \nabsorption capacity, there are a few which \nare specifically aimed at changing the speed \nof technology diffusion, such as the European \nResearch Area, as innovation and knowledge \ndiffusion are strongly affected by public policy \n(Stoneman and Diederen, 1994).\n\n\n\n726\n\nThis chapter investigates the role of labour, \ncapital, and product market regulatory \nframeworks in technology diffusion, and also \naccounting for the role of business dynamism \nin mediating and moderating the impact of \nregulation on technology diffusion. Under \na standard empirical framework with no \nintermediate role for business dynamics, results \nmatch the general findings in the literature: \nmore stringent regulations are associated \nwith lower productivity and less technology \ndiffusion9 (Scarpetta and Tressel, 2003; Tressel \nand Scarpetta, 2004). However, the European \nCentral Bank highlights the causal link between \nbusiness churning, framework conditions and \ntechnology adoption/diffusion:\n\n\u2018Market competition and business churning \n(i.e. the rate of entry and exit of firms) \u2013 which \nare affected by country-specific framework \nconditions \u2013 influence the incentives and costs for \nfirms to invest in new technology or adapt existing \ntechnologies\u2019 (Masuch et al., 2018, p. 110).\n\nTherefore, accounting for both framework \nconditions and business dynamism, the results \nof this chapter suggest that greater flexibility \nin the labour market regulation may benefit \ntechnology diffusion as it promotes the \ncreation of new innovative firms and facilitates \nthe restructuring or exit of unproductive ones. \nHowever, the direct (and total) effect of labour-\nmarket flexibility is negative, suggesting \nthat a more regulated labour market might \ncreate incentives for firms to position their \nabsorption capacity and human capital as key \nelements in their ability to adopt innovations, \nsuch as, for instance, by investing in their \nworkers with, for example, on-the-job training \n(Lucidi, 2012; Egert, 2016). In addition, from \na Schumpeterian perspective, given that \na more stringent regulatory framework leads to \nhigher fixed costs, this could increase the entry \nrequirements and make competition tougher, \n\n9 This estimation has been performed but is not included because of a lack of space.\n\nigniting the process of creative destruction and \nfavouring the adoption of innovations by firms. \n\nConversely, access to capital markets has \na positive direct impact on technology diffusion, \nwhich is offset by the negative indirect effect \nvia business churning. Indeed, while access to \nsources of finance has been widely recognised \nas fostering entrepreneurship, it also increases \nfirms\u2019 survival rates, perhaps that of less-\nproductive ones as well, resulting in a slower \nreallocation of resources, thereby offsetting \nthe positive impact on technology diffusion.\n\nWhen considering the moderating role of \nbusiness churning (we estimate a separate \nmodel for a low and high level of churning), we \nfind that firms in high-churning sectors catch \nup faster than in low-churning ones. A faster \nhuman capital growth rate is associated with \nfaster technology diffusion for all firms, but \nparticularly for those in low-churning sectors, \nwhere human capital may be relatively more \nimportant than in high-churning sectors, and \nwhere less flexible labour-market regulation \nmay create a favourable environment to invest \nmore in human capital. Furthermore, in line with \nAndrews et al. (2015) and Aghion et al. (2005), \nwe find that more stringent product market \nregulation is associated with less technology \ndiffusion for firms in high-churning industries, \nwhile this is not the case for low-churning ones. \nA similar pattern is observed when considering \nlabour-market flexibility, even though the \nmagnitude of the effect is much less prominent, \nespecially when considering greater flexibility in \nmarkets with a high churn rate. These results \ncome somewhat in-between the traditional view \nsupporting deregulation of labour relationships \nin order to boost investment and the alternative \nargument, which suggests that more secure and \nregulated labour markets boost investment in \nskills, innovation and absorptive capacity.\n\n\n\n727\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 13\n\nOverall, this analysis offers an additional \nperspective to understand the uneven process \nof technological diffusion and the framework \nconditions needed to boost the pace of such \ndiffusion. Of course, some caution is needed in \ninterpreting the results as we do not fully control \nfor several factors \u2013 such as capital deepening, or \nthe technological or competition level of sectors \n\u2013 which are left for future avenues of research \nto deepen the understanding of these channels. \n\nIn terms of policy implications, our results \nsuggest that:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd a one-size-fits-all regulatory model does not \nlead to faster technology diffusion, but the \nspecific characteristics in the market and \nsectoral structure need to be accounted for; \n\n\u00dd\u00dd while excessive product market regulation \ntends to hinder technology diffusion, this only \nholds true in industries with vivid business \ndynamism and high rates of churn rates, \nwhere innovation is driven by new entrants;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd a similar argument holds for labour-market \nregulation, suggesting a more prudent \nview than merely advocating tout-court \nderegulation of labour-market relationships;\n\n\u00dd\u00dd human capital and access to finance are \nconfirmed as horizontal drivers of technology \ncatch-up and diffusion. While policies in this \ndomain do not specifically address diffusion \ndirectly, they are key in increasing the adoption \nrate of innovations, enabling local (research \nand) innovation systems to produce, absorb \nand implement new knowledge, to keep pace \nwith global technological change.\n\n\n\n728\n\n6.

Introduction \n\n2 Andrews, Criscuolo and Gal (2016) define global frontier firms as the top 5 % of firms in terms of labour productivity levels, within \neach two-digit sector and in each year, across all countries since the early 2000s. All other firms are defined as laggards.\n\nThe adoption of digital technologies in the \nbusiness sector is spreading rapidly. Because \nof its transformative impact on the economy \nand the labour market, from both a creative \nand a destructive angle, digitalisation is being \nvigorously discussed by economists and \npolicymakers. On the one hand, there have \nbeen numerous optimistic statements that \ndigitalisation will boost growth and productivity. \nYet, while digital technologies are expected to be \nthe drivers of economic growth and the Fourth \nIndustrial Revolution, so far there has been \nlittle hard evidence of a significant productivity \nboost. More than 30 years after Robert Solow\u2019s \n(1987) statement \u2018you can see the computer \nage everywhere but in productivity statistics\u2019, \nproductivity growth in advanced economies \nremains subdued. At the same time, many people \nfear that digital technologies can be a source of \n\ndisruption, leading to a more polarised economic \nstructure, with the benefits concentrated in a few \n\u2018superstar firms\u2019, while many firms and workers \nwill be on the losing side and will drop out. \n\nSeveral recent studies provide evidence of this \npolarisation and \u2018winner-take-all\u2019 markets linked \nto the use of digital technologies. Andrews, \nCriscuolo and Gal (2016) show an increasing \nproductivity gap between firms at the global \nfrontier and laggard firms2. The superstar firms \nat the global frontier are typically larger, more \ninnovative and have higher rates of digital-\ntechnology adoption. There is also evidence \nof rising concentration (Autor et al., 2017) \nand increasing firm mark-ups (De Loecker \nand Eeckhoudt, 2017). In particular, mark-\nups are rising among firms in the highest \ndecile of distribution of mark-ups within their \n\nSummary\n\nThe growing digital divide in the global \ncorporate landscape between the technology \nleaders and laggards has implications for \nrising productivity polarisation. This raises \nconcerns in policy debates that the EU may \nbe falling behind in the digital technology \nrace, although there is little large-scale, \nfirm-level evidence on digital adoption \nfor the EU and the US. With its innovative \napproach, this chapter tries to contribute to \na more evidence-based policy discussion on \nthe digital divide. \n\nUsing a new survey on digital adoption by \nfirms in the EU and the US, this chapter \nidentifies digitalisation profiles based on \nthe current use of digital technologies and \nfuture investment plans in digitalisation. The \nanalysis confirms the trend toward digital \npolarisation and a growing digital divide in \nthe corporate landscape with, on one side, \nmany firms that are not digitally active and, \non the other side, a substantial number of \ndigitally active firms forging ahead. Old \nsmall firms, with fewer than 50 employees \nand over 10 years old, are significantly more \nlikely to be persistently digitally non active. \nThey are also less likely to be innovative.\n\n\n\n735\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 14\n\nindustry, which is consistent with winner-takes-\nall patterns (Diez et al., 2018). These trends \ntend to be more pronounced in the sectors \nwhere digital technologies \u2013 especially digital \nservices \u2013 are developed or intensely adopted \n(Calligaris, Criscuolo and Marcolin, 2018).\n\nIn digital services, the leading companies \u2013 \nincluding \u2018big tech\u2019 firms, such as Alphabet \n(Google\u2019s parent company), Apple, Facebook, \nMicrosoft, Alibaba, and Huawei \u2013 are typically \nfrom the United States or China. European \nfirms are not present among either the big tech \nor the leading digital R&D investors that push \nthe frontier of digital technology (EIB, 2018; \nVeugelers, 2018). Evidence of the EU lagging \n\nbehind is mounting, especially in the services \nsector, which is correlated with subdued \nproductivity growth in the EU (EIB, 2018). \n\nGrowing digital polarisation in the global \ncorporate landscape between the technology \nhaves and have-nots has implications for the \nrising polarisation of productivity. This raises \nconcerns in policy debates that the EU may \nbe falling behind in the digital technology \nrace, being trapped on the wrong side of the \ndigital technology divide. Furthermore, it raises \nthe following questions: Are EU firms stuck as \ndigital-technology-have-nots while US tech \nfirms are forging ahead?

The survey is representative \nat the level of three aggregate groups of countries in the EU (and four regions in the United States) but not at individual EU country \nlevel. Similarly, it is representative for the manufacturing and services sectors (i.e. representative for two sectors separately in each \naggregate group of EU countries or US regions) but does not provide more detailed information on industry classification (e.g. NACE \nor ISIC classification at two digits that would classify the firms across different sub-industries within the manufacturing sector).\n\nthe digital divide. Using a new survey on digital \nadoption of firms in the EU and the United States, \nthis chapter tries to contribute to a more evidence-\nbased policy discussion on the digital divide. \n\n2.  Data \n\nIn 2018, the European Investment Bank (EIB) \nDigital and Skills survey interviewed 1 700 com-\npanies with at least five employees in manufac-\nturing and services in the EU and United States \non their adoption of digital technologies and \ntheir plans for future investments. The sample \nwas stratified by industry group ( manufacturing \nand services sector), size class and region. \n Figure 14-1 gives an overview of the distribution \nof respondent firms. \n\nTo make the sample representative of the \neconomy, the EIB Digital and Skills survey \ncomputed weights based on firm size. More \nspecifically, the weights compare the number \nof employees in the firms included in the survey \nwith data on employment from structural \nbusiness statistics in specific cells \u2013 where \nthe cells are defined by region (four regions in \nthe EU and four in the United States), sector \n(manufacturing and services) and firm-size \nclass (four firm-size classes)3. \n\nThis chapter identifies digital profiles based on \ntwo dimensions:\n\n1. the current adoption of the most prominent \nstate-of-the-art digital technologies in \nmanufacturing and services;\n\n2. future investment plans in digital tech-\nnologies. \n\n2.1 Adoption of digital technologies\n\nInformation on the adoption of digital \ntechnologies listed in Figure 14-2 is based on \nthe following survey question: \n\n\u00dd\u00dd \u2018Can you tell me for each of the following \ntechnologies if (i) not heard about them, \n(ii) have heard about them but not \nimplemented, (iii) implemented them in \nparts of your business, or (iv) whether your \nentire business is organised around them?\u2019. \n\nIf companies report that their entire business is \norganised around one of the four technologies, \nthis chapter labels them as \u2018fully digital\u2019. \nHowever, if at least one of the technologies is \nimplemented in parts of a firm\u2019s business, they \nare labelled as \u2018partially digital\u2019.

Big data and analytics is the only \ndigital technology firms were asked about in \nboth the manufacturing and services sectors. \nFirms in services tend to be more digitally ac-\ntive. As this could be partly due to the specif-\n\n4 Focusing on firms that have never heard about digital technologies, 22 firms in manufacturing and 19 firms in services have \nnot heard about any of the four technologies. More specifically, few companies in manufacturing have not heard about 3D \nprinting (6 % in both the EU and the United States) and advanced robotics (5 % in the EU and 7 % in the United States), while \na larger share of companies has not heard about IoT (18 % in the EU and 22 % in the United States) and big data (21 % in the \nEU and 18 % in the United States). In services, the share of companies that have not heard about a technology is highest for \nbig data (24 % in the EU and 15 % in the United States), but lower for digitalisation and automation of internal routines (7 % \nin the EU and 9 % in the United States), web-based applications for marketing and sales (7 % in the EU and 4 % in the United \nStates) and provision of digital products and services online (11 % in the EU and 8 % in the United States). There is no large \ndifference between the United States and the EU, except for the share of firms that have not heard about big data, which is \nsomewhat higher in the EU than the United States, especially in the services sector.\n\nic digital technologies listed, manufacturing \nand services firms are analysed separately \nthroughout the chapter. \n\nThe EIB Digital and Skills survey provides \nunique information compared to other data-\nbases providing evidence on the adoption of \ndigital technologies. The Eurostat data used in \nthe Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) \ndo not include US firms, which is paramount \nfor the analysis of the digital divide discussed \n\n\n\n738\n\nin this chapter5. Similarly, Organisation for Co-\noperation and Development (OECD)  statistics \non ICT access and usage by businesses provide \ndata on two indicators for the United States \nbut only in 2007 and 20126. \n\nFigure 14-3 shows that there are no large \ndifferences between the EU and the United \nStates in digital adoption in the manufacturing \nsector, while the share of EU firms that are non-\ndigital in services is larger than in the United \nStates. However, at the same time, the share of \n\n5 Eurostat provides data on the share of enterprises (with more than 10 employees) using industrial robots (16 % of the \nenterprises in manufacturing) in the EU in 2018, which is about half the share reported by EU manufacturing firms that have \nimplemented automation via advanced robotics, according to the EIB Digital and Skills survey (29 %). Similarly, the shares of \nenterprises (with more than 10 employees) using 3D printing or analysing big data are about half the share reported in the \nEIB Digital and Skills survey. The differences between Eurostat data and the EIB Digital and Skills survey may be driven by the \nrelatively small sample of the survey as well as differences in the questions that the firms were asked (e.g. whether the use \nof digital technologies is general or very specific to the daily operations of the business or whether it is regular or irregular).\n\n6 For the United States, the ICT Access and Usage by Businesses database provides data on (i) the share of business with a website or \nhome page (in 2007 and 2012) and (ii) the share of business placing orders (i.e. making purchases) over computer networks (in 2007).\n\n7 The multivariate regression analysis is based on marginal effects in a probit model and considers the likelihood of being digitally \nactive after controlling for the effects of country (United States, EU), sector (manufacturing, services), firm size (micro, small, medium, \nlarge) and firm age (young, old). An alternative specification combines the information on firm age and size to create four categories: \nyoung small, old small, young large and old large. The findings are qualitatively similar using the alternative specification.\n\nEU firms in services that have organised their \nentire business around digital technologies is \nlarger than in the United States. \n\nThe results of multivariate regression analysis \nindicate that firm size matters for digital \ntechnology adoption: smaller firms (with \nfewer than 50 employees) are less likely to \nbe digitally active7. At the same time, firm age \nseems to matter less for digitalisation; young \nfirms (less than 10 years old) are not more \nlikely to be digitally active than older firms. \n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on the EIB Digital and Skills survey 2018\nNote: All firms are weighted using employment weights to make them representative of the business population. \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter14/figure_14-3.xlsx\n\nFigure 14-3 Share of firms that are digitally active (%), by sector and country\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nEU28 United States EU28 United States\nManufacturing Services\n\nNon digital Partially digital Fully digital\n\n%\n\n\n\n739\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 14\n\n2.2 Digital investment plans\n\nThe second dimension of the digital divide \nprofiles, namely the digital investment outlook, \nis based on the following two survey questions: \n\n\u00dd\u00dd For firms that have already implemented \none of the digital technologies: \n\u00dd\u00dd \u2018Over the next three years, do you \n\nexpect your investment spend in digital \ntechnologies to (i) increase, (ii) stay around \nthe same, (iii) decrease, (iv) no investment \nplanned in digital technologies?\u2019 \n\n\u00dd\u00dd For firms that are non-digital: \n\u00dd\u00dd \u2018Looking ahead to the next three years, do \n\nyou plan to invest in digital technologies?\u2019 \n\nCompanies are considered as \u2018increasing\u2019 if they \nplan to increase their investment or, for those that \nhave yet to invest, if they plan to start investing \nin digital technologies. All other firms are labelled \n\nas \u2018stable/inactive/reduced\u2019. Figure 14-4 shows \nthat around 60 % of the firms have plans to \nraise investment in digital technologies in the \nnext three years. Although EU firms score slightly \nlower than US firms, in both the manufacturing \nand services sectors, the difference between the \nEU and the United States with respect to future \ndigital investment plans is small. \n\nMultivariate regression analysis confirms that \nthere is no significant difference between \nthe EU and the United States or between \nthe manufacturing and services sectors with \nrespect to the digital investment outlook. \nHowever, it shows a firm-size effect for digital \ninvestment plans: larger firms are not only \nmore likely to be currently digitally active, \nbut they are also more likely to expand their \ndigital investments in the future. Within the EU, \nfirms from central and eastern Europe have \na significantly lower probability of planning to \nincrease their digital investments. \n\nFigure 14-4 Share of firms that plan to increase investment in digital technologies \nin the next 3 years (%)\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on the EIB Digital and Skills survey 2018\nNote: All firms are weighted using employment weights to make them representative of the business population.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter14/figure_14-4.xlsx\n\n50\n\n52\n\n54\n\n56\n\n58\n\n60\n\n62\n\nEU28 United States EU28 United States\n\nManufacturing Services\n\n64\n\n%\n\n\n\n740\n\n3.  Is there a corporate digital divide?\n\n8 Multivariate regression analysis is based on marginal effects in a probit model and considers the likelihood of having digital-\ninvestment expansion plans depending on whether the firm is currently digitally active (yes or no), and controlling for the \neffects of the country (United States, EU), sector (manufacturing, services), firm size (micro, small, medium, large) and firm \nage (young, old). The marginal effect for digitally active firms is 0.201 (with a standard error of 0.041).\n\nA first glance at a corporate digital divide, with \nsome firms pushing ahead and others falling \nbehind, is provided by Figure 14-5, which links \nthe share of firms that are digitally active with \nthe share that have plans to further increase \ntheir digital investments. Digitally active firms \n(either partially or fully digital) are significantly \nmore likely to have plans to expand their digital \ninvestment further. This holds true in both the \nEU and the United States as well as in the \nmanufacturing and services sectors.\n\nMultivariate regression analysis confirms that \nfirms that are already digitally active have a sig-\n\nnificantly higher probability (20 % higher) of hav-\ning digital investment expansion plans, everything \nelse being equal8. This result provides evidence of \na corporate digital divide: firms that are not (yet) \ndigitally active are significantly less likely to have \ndigital investment expansion plans compared to \nthose that are already digitally active. This trend \nis likely to exacerbate the digital divide across \nfirms, in both the EU and the United States. This \ndigital polarisation is a general phenomenon: the \ndigital divide is not significantly larger in the EU \nthan in the United States or in services compared \nto the manufacturing services. \n\nFigure 14-5 Share of firms that plan to increase investment in digital technologies \nin the next 3 years (%), by digital intensity\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on the EIB Digital and Skills survey 2018\nNote: All firms are weighted using employment weights to make them representative of the business population. \nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter14/figure_14-5.xlsx\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nEU28 United States EU28 United States\nManufacturing Services\n\n70\n\n80\n\nNon digital Partially digital Fully digital\n\n%\n\n\n\n741\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 14\n\n4.  Which firms are falling behind and which \nare forging ahead? \n\nThe previous section has identified a significant \ncorporate digital divide. The next step is to \nidentify and characterise the firms on each \nside of the divide. Which companies are \nfalling behind and which are forging ahead? \nTo address this question, Figure 14-6 positions \nfirms on the digital-divide grid, based on the \ncombination of their current digital-technology \nintensity and their digital investment outlook. \n\nThe first group of firms to identify are those that \nhave not implemented any digital technology \nand do not plan to invest in digital technologies in \nthe next three years: these companies are falling \nbehind on the digital-divide grid and are labelled \nas \u2018persistently non-active\u2019. Companies that are \ncurrently non-digital but have plans to invest in \ndigital technologies are labelled \u2018beginners\u2019.\n\nWithin the group of firms that have implemented \ndigital technologies, there are those that are \nalready digital but do not intend to increase \ninvestment in digital technologies in the coming \nthree years: they are labelled as \u2018stable digital\u2019. \nDigital firms that are planning to further invest \nin digital technologies are labelled \u2018forgers \nahead\u2019 which can be further divided depending \non whether they have implemented a digital \ntechnology in parts of their business or whether \ntheir entire business is organised around digital \ntechnologies. \u2018Catching-up\u2019 firms are partially \ndigital and plan to increase their digital \ninvestments further, while \u2018frontrunners\u2019 are \nalready fully digital and continue to increase \ntheir investment spend on digital technologies.\n\nFigure 14-6 The corporate digital divide categories\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 own elaboration\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter14/figure_14-6.xlsx\n\nIn\ncr\n\nea\nsi\n\nng\n\nBEGINNER\n\nFORGER AHEAD\n\nFRONTRUNNERCATCHING\ufffdUP\n\nSt\nab\n\nle\n / \n\nIn\nac\n\nti\nve\n\n \n/ R\n\ned\nuc\n\ned\n \n\nPERSISTENTLY\nNON\ufffdACTIVE \n\nNon digital \n\nSTABLE DIGITAL\n\n  Partially digital  Fully digital  \n\n DIGITAL INTENSITY \n\nDI\nGI\n\nTA\nL \n\nIN\nVE\n\nST\nM\n\nEN\nT \n\nOU\nTL\n\nOO\nK\n\n\n\n742\n\nFigure 14-7 shows the share of companies in \nthe EU and the United States, for manufacturing \nand services, in each of the digital-divide \nprofiles, depending on their position on the \ngrid. There are more persistently non-active \nfirms in services in the EU than in the United \nStates: this category refers to firms that have \nnot implemented any digital technology and \ndo not plan to invest in them over the next \nthree years. At the same time, EU firms in \nthe manufacturing sector are not significantly \nmore likely to be persistently non-active than \nin the United States. \n\nOn the other side of the corporate digital divide, \nthere are no large differences between the EU \nand the United States in manufacturing for \nforgers ahead (catching-up and frontrunner). \nEven though the difference on forgers ahead \nis not significant in services either, the EU has \nsomewhat more frontrunners compared to the \nUnited States. Together with the higher share \nof persistently non-active firms, this suggests \nthat the EU may have a deeper and more \npolarised digital divide in services compared to \nthe United States. \n\nFigure 14-7 Digital divide, share of firms (in %), by sector and country\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on the EIB Digital and Skills survey 2018\nNote: Digital profiles defined as in Figure 14-6.

They are significantly \nless likely to \u2018begin\u2019 to be digitally active if they \nwere initially non-active (19 % lower probability \ncompared to large firms in manufacturing and \n21 % in services). Young small firms also have \na lower probability to start investing although \nthe differences are not significant. \n\nSimilarly, the probability of forging ahead, as \nopposed to remaining stable digital, is a way \nto verify among those firms that have already \nimplemented digital technologies which ones \nare likely to further increase their digital \ninvestments. Once again, old small firms \nbelong to the problematic category. Even when \nthey are already digitally active, old small firms \nare significantly less likely to increase their \ndigital investments, both in manufacturing and \nservices. In services, young small firms that are \nalready digitally active are also less likely to \nincrease their digital investments. \n\n\n\n746\n\n5.  Innovation profiles along the digital-divide grid\n\n10 The regression analysis in Figure 14.12 combines firms in the manufacturing and services sectors. The results are \nqualitatively similar when the sectors are considered separately.\n\nDoes it matter to the innovation capacity of the \nEU economy whether firms are falling behind as \npersistent non-digitally active or forging ahead \nand running in front? Digital technologies are \nlikely to be empowering innovation. Therefore, \ndigitally-active profiles are expected to be \nactive in innovation. If that is the case, any \ndigital investment polarisation would also be \nassociated with an innovation divide gap. \n\nFollowing EIB (2017), the data from the \nEIB Digital and Skills survey can be used to \nidentify innovation profiles based on current \nR&D expenditure and whether firms invest to \nintroduce new products, processes or services \n(which can be new to the company only or new \n\nto the market). The companies are identified as \nbasic firms (or \u2018non-innovation-active\u2019) if they are \nneither engaged in R&D nor innovate (developing \nthemselves or adopting innovations already \ndeveloped elsewhere). Figure 14-11 confirms \nthat non-digitally-active firms are also more \nlikely to be non-innovation-active. This holds true \nfor beginners but also for the persistently-non-\nactive firms, especially in the services sector. \n\nResults of the multivariate regression analysis \nreported in Figure 14-12 confirm these findings \nand show that, with the exception of the \nbeginners, all categories of firms are more likely \nto be innovation active than the persistently-\nnon-active firms10. In particular, the forgers \n\nFigure 14-11 Share of non-innovation-active firms (%), by digital profile\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on the EIB Digital and Skills survey 2018\nNote: Non-innovation active firms are firms that do not invest in R&D and do not introduce new products, processes or services.

Conclusions \n\nOverall, the results of the analysis using data \nfrom the EIB Digital and Skills survey con-\nfirm the trend toward digital polarisation and \na growing digital divide on the corporate land-\nscape. On the one hand, a substantial number \nof firms do not implement any state-of-the-art \ndigital technology and are also less likely to \nhave plans to start investing digitally in the next \nthree years. On the other hand, there are firms \nthat are already partially or even fully imple-\nmenting state-of-the-art digital technologies in \ntheir businesses. In addition, they are also more \nlikely to plan to further increase their digital in-\nvestments in the future and to become leading \ninnovators. The analysis further shows that per-\nsistently-non-digitally-active firms are less like-\nly to be innovative, while digital frontrunners are \nmore likely to be leading innovators. \n\nThe survey does not provide any evidence for \nsignificant differences between the EU and the \nUnited States. The prevalence of persistently-\nnon-digitally-active firms versus frontrunners \nin economies is significantly correlated to the \n\nfirm size and age composition of their business \npopulation. Small firms in manufacturing and \nold small firms in services \u2013 with fewer than \n50 employees and more than 10 years old \u2013 \nare significantly more likely to be persistently \ndigitally non active. \n\nThe findings in this chapter do not recover \ncausal relationships. Further research should \naim at investigating what policies could fast-\ntrack the adoption of digital technologies by EU \nfirms, in particular old small firms, to help them \ncatch up and grow. In this respect, the issues \nthat tend to affect the investment activities \nof small firms in the EU, such as the lack of \naccess to finance, poor management practices \nor a difficult business environment, are likely to \nplay important roles. \n\n\n\n749\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 14\n\n7.

Introduction\n\nThe European Union makes substantial \ninvestments in research, science, technology \nand innovation, aiming at lowering technical and \ncommercial risks associated with innovation \nto make its economy more competitive and \nto enable its society to achieve goals such \nas prosperity, sustainability and quality of \nlife. European strength in science, technology \nand industry is necessary to ensure that \nEurope is able to achieve its objectives. To be \ncompetitive, Europe needs to maximise the \nvalue and productivity of its investments in \nR&I, and this requires appropriate intelligence \nand coordination between relevant policies \nand strategies at EU, national and regional \nlevels. These investments may follow Europe\u2019s \nstrengths or weaknesses and concentrate \non areas where the greatest impacts can be \nexpected and where the most benefits would \nlie. A good understanding of capacities and \naspirations for future innovations is an invaluable \nbasis for reflection and debate on potential \nimpacts of different investment decisions, and \non the normative and strategic considerations \nthat should guide those investment decisions. \n\nThis paper presents a brief overview of how \nhorizon scanning took hold in EU efforts to im-\nprove priority-setting in science and technology. \nIt begins with the history of the development of \npriority setting in R&I policy and the analytical \nmethodologies used to support it, showing the \nhand-in-hand evolution of political and analytical \ndevelopments. Despite being practised for many \nyears, especially in Japan, horizon scanning in \nscience and technology (S&T) really took off with \nthe publication of the Chinese Roadmaps for \n2050. The close coupling between understand-\ning the horizon, the policy goals and the com-\nmitment to achieving them that seemed to drive \nthe modernisation of China incentivised other \ngovernments to undertake R&I horizon scanning, \nand to use it in priority setting. The paper reviews \nsome key national projects before describing the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s experience with horizon \nscanning. Its conclusions simply appraise this \nexperience and point at questions and possible \nimprovements that could determine whether \nhorizon scanning becomes a regular part of the \nEU policymaking toolbox or remains an experi-\nment from which lessons are applied elsewhere.\n\nSummary\n\nThis chapter is dedicated to efforts gathering \nwide-ranging intelligence to identify new signs \nof emerging issues, trends and challenges for \nthe future. It describes in detail the practice \nof horizon scanning, which can be seen as the \nbasic groundwork of foresight projects, or as \nan important strategic function in its own right. \n\nIt presents the European Commission\u2019s latest \nresearch and innovation (R&I) foresight \n\nexercises which are essential in the context \nof the increasing emphasis being placed by \nthe EU\u2019s R&I policy on directionality, in par-\nticular towards sustainable development. \nThe need for informed policy priorities re-\nsults in demand for more systematic, con-\ntinuous and comprehensive scans to feed \ninto decision-making processes. \n\n\n\n753\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 15\n\n2.  Horizon scanning in R&I policy \n\n1 In 2018, the JRC developed an online megatrends hub: https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/foresight/about_en and a set \nof methodologies for using it as the context for decision-making games.\n\nA great deal of modern S&T has its roots \nin the efforts to sustain the technological \nleadership of the US military and the com-\nmercial advantages these generated for US \nfirms (Bush, 1945; McDougall, 1985; Gholz, \n2011; Mazzucato, 2011). The EU\u2019s R&I efforts \noriginated in an effort to catch up with the USA \nin certain fields of S&T (EC 1970, 1985; Patel \nand Pavitt, 1987; Sharp, 1989). The EU was not \nalone in this effort. Japan, the Soviet Union and, \nincreasingly, other parts of the world began to \ninvest heavily in R&D and to seek to compete \nwith the USA in S&T. During the 1980s, it \nbecame clear that no country could afford to \nbe the world leader in all fields of S&T and \nstrategic R&I programming became prominent.\n\nJapan led the way with the launch of the Very \nlarge-scale integration (VLSI) programme in \n1976. The ALVEY Programme in the UK and the \nESPRIT programme in the European Community \nwere reactions to Japan\u2019s VLSI. More and more \ncountries set off to develop capacities in key \ntechnologies (Rothwel and Zegveld, 1985), \nwhich \u2018when effectively controlled, offer keys \nto economic success\u2019 (Revermann and Sonntag, \n1989, p. 1). The effort to devise priorities led \nto the development of disciplines such as \nscientometrics (De Sola Price, 1978), techno-\nmetrics (Sahal, 1985) and to the application \nof foresight in S&T (Martin and Irvine, 1984, \n1989; Urashima, Yokoo and Nagano, 2012). The \nfoundations of these disciplines lie in the belief \nthat priority-setting in S&T can benefit from on \nan informed understanding of capabilities and \naspirations, which can be revealed by the study \nof expert communities and their communication.\n\nThe practice of horizon scanning evolved in this \ncontext and can be seen either as the basic \ngroundwork of foresight projects, or as an import-\n\nant strategic function in its own right. It signifies \nan effort to gather wide-ranging intelligence that \ngoes beyond the normal intelligence practice, to \nidentify new signals of emerging issues, trends \nand challenges that could help preparedness for \nthe future (Cuhls, van der Giessen and Toivanen, \n2015). In S&T, horizon scanning provides intel-\nligence about capacities and aspirations which \ncould push forward the frontiers of knowledge and \ninnovation. For contemporary R&I policymaking, \nthis intelligence is an essential part of the stra-\ntegic context of policy decisions. It allows informed \nevaluations of expected costs, benefits, challenges \nand opportunities associated with particular R&I \npolicy options and directions (ibid.). Again, Japan \nled the way. Regular foresight studies in science \nand technology, with a broad horizon scan, began \nin the 1970s, and since 1996 they have been inte-\ngrated into the revision of the Basic Plan, the basis \nof Japanese S&T policy that is reviewed every five \nyears (Urashima, Yokoo and Nagano, 2012).\n\nThe need for a more strategic approach to R&I \npolicy underpins the European Commission\u2019s \nrecent efforts to develop a more systematic \nunderstanding of the innovation horizon. These \nefforts build on two foundations: the first is the \ndevelopment of strategic foresight in the EU\u2019s \nR&I policy during Horizon 2020 (EFFLA 2013; \nBurgelman et al., 2014; Kastrinos, 2018). In the \npractice of strategic foresight, some of the most \npowerful context is provided by megatrends1 \n(Gore, 2013; EEA 2010, 2015; OECD 2016; \nESPAS 2015, 2019), described as inescapably \npowerful forces). However, in their content \nmegatrends invariably resemble significant \ndebates about the future rather than determined \nhistorical destinies. The interplay between \ndeterminism and strategies to change the future \nrequires foresight to decompose megatrends, \nto juxtapose established trends with emerging \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/foresight/about_en\n\n\n754\n\ntrends, and to debate the significance of different \nphenomena. Scanning the horizon for signals of \nnew trends is a way of compensating for the \npower of megatrend discourses over both likely \nand unlikely alternative futures. \n\nTrends are sequences of events in time that \nimply an underlying cause. The horizon is \nscanned for \u2018signals\u2019. These are significant \nobservations (events) which may or may \nnot signify a trend. Horizon scanning relates \nsuch observations to one another to develop \n\u2018signposts\u201d. Signposts are conditions that could \nsignify a trend within underlying causal theories. \nBy accumulating signposts, trends become more \nvisible and different causal theories build and \nlose predictive value. And as we begin to discern \ntrends, the future becomes more predictable.\n\nThe second foundation of the European \nCommission's horizon-scanning effort lies with \nthe international experience that is demonstrating \nmore and more clearly the feasibility of scanning \nthat is useful for policy. Studies aiming to produce \nrepresentations of the scientific and technological \nfrontier began in the 1980s (Sahal, 1985; Callon \net al., 1983; Callon, Rip and Law, 1986) but really \ntook off in the 21st century with the growing \nimportance of the internet and the development \nof text-mining algorithms (Porter, Kongthon, \nLu, 2002; Kostoff, 2012; Kim and Chen, 2015). \nEarly studies built on the framework of the key \ntechnologies of the 1980s: ICT, biotechnology, \nindustrial technology and new materials and \nenergy technologies (Revermann and Sonntag, \n1989). Later, the frameworks became more \nelaborate. Two phenomena probably played \na role: the first is technological convergence and \n\ncross-fertilisation (Roco and Bainbridge, 2003). \nAn important part of convergence was tied to \nwhat they saw as the unification of S&T:\n\n\u2018The sciences have reached a watershed \nat which they must unify if they are to \ncontinue to advance rapidly. Convergence of \nthe sciences can initiate a new renaissance, \nembodying a holistic view of technology based \non transformative tools, the mathematics of \ncomplex systems, and unified cause-and-effect \nunderstanding of the physical world from the \nnanoscale to the planetary scale\u2019 (ibid. p. x).\n\nR&I policies have gradually moved from discipline-\nbased work towards a systems-oriented policy. \nIn the EU, key technologies and key application \nareas continued to be the framework (see Cahil \nand Scapolo, 1999) until the Fifth Framework \nProgramme (FP5) put its focus on key actions \nfor particular socio-economic systems, such as \nthe cities of the future, industry, etc. Whilst this \nwas very well received, evaluation of FP5 centred \naround the EU\u2019s relative inability to coordinate \nnational R&D policies:\n\n\u2018Our panel is convinced that the required \nchanges need to be conceived within an overall \nstrategy for Europe, articulated at the level \nof the EU and supported by all the Member \nStates\u2019 (Majo et al., 2000 p. i).\n\nThe ability of the Union to coordinate \nnational programmes and policies became \na key political issue of the decade, with the \nEuropean Research Area (Kastrinos, 2010), \nwhilst the thematic structure of the framework \nprogramme remained stable. \n\n3.  Horizons and roadmaps\n\nIn 2010, the Chinese Academy of Sciences \npublished a Roadmap for Science and Technology \n\nin China to 2050 (Lu, 2010). This signalled \nChina\u2019s resolution to move from imitation to \n\n\n\n755\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 15\n\ninnovation with Chinese characteristics, rooted \nin domestic efforts and integrating global \ninnovation resources. The roadmap was based \non an analysis of key systems for China\u2019s socio-\n\neconomic development and strategic capabilities, \nwhich framed its priority-setting process. Through \nthis lens, China set out what it saw as the horizon \nof R&I challenges for the coming 40 years. \n\nRoadmap for Chinese S&T 2050\nStrategic systems for China\u2019s socio-economic \ndevelopment\n\na.

Mathematics and complex systems\n\n\n\n756\n\nThe defining difference between the Chinese \nRoadmap and all other priority-setting exercises \nis its expansionary nature. It was not a plan \nfor the efficient use of resources in a steady \nstate. It was the expansion plan which, over \na decade, built the current competitive position \nof Chinese R&I and its future prospects. \n\nSoon after the Chinese Roadmap was published, \nthe Parliament of Finland launched the project \n\u2018100 opportunities for Finland and the world\u2019 \n(Linturi, Kuusi and Alqvist, 2014), and the Rus-\nsian prime minister launched the project \u2018Rus-\nsia 2030: Science and Technology Foresight\u2019 \n(Gokhberg, 2016). Both projects benchmarked \nnational capabilities in S&T in relation to key \nareas which were identified through some \nform of horizon scanning. The Russian study \nused a literature-based approach to its hori-\nzon scanning, whilst the Finnish one used an \nexpert conversation-based methodology. The \nRussian study presented its findings in seven \ncategories. The first three were the traditional \ngeneric technologies of the 1980s: ICT, bio-\ntechnology, and new materials (and nanotech-\nnology), whilst the other four were application \nareas: healthcare and medicine, environmental \nmanagement, transport and space systems, \nand energy efficiency and energy savings. In \nthose four categories, the report catalogues \nabout 200 important research areas, charac-\nterising Russian S&T as world class in a very \nsmall number of them (a handful of areas in \nmedicine and energy, one area in space and one \narea in materials). However, the report made no \ncase for the need for Russia to be world class \nin some areas. It simply developed an assess-\nment on which government agencies and public \nand private companies could base their deci-\nsions about what they wanted to achieve. \n\nThe Finnish study explicitly took the view that \nFinland would have to adapt to whatever the \nworld economy becomes. Thus, it defined future \nglobal value networks in which Finland would \nhave to play a role if it were to sustain its stan-\ndard of living. The study carried out a broad \nexpert consultation on trends in S&T that would \naffect the global value networks and evaluated \nthe importance of those trends in relation to \ntheir potential effects on such networks. The \n100 trends with the biggest potential impact \nwere labelled 100 opportunities for Finland \nand the world and were used by the study to \nbenchmark the capacity of Finland in relation \nto the world standard. The Finnish study was \nrevisited during 2017 with a similar methodol-\nogy and was published under the title Societal \nTransformation 2018-2037 (Linturi and Kuusi, \n2019). There were a few changes between the \ntwo studies. The global value networks ter-\nminology became more austere and some of \nthe areas identified changed. The earlier study \ndefined sensors, functional materials and intel-\nligent goods as emerging global value chains, \nwhile the later work emphasised more social \nareas related to work, education and mean-\ningful life. There was also some change in the \nframing of areas of innovation that constitute \nbreakthroughs, as can be seen in the box below. \n\nThe figure below traces the evolution of the \nview on future global value networks of interest \nto Finland. \n\n\n\n757\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 15\n\n100 opportunities for Finland and the world \n(published in 2014)\n\nSocietal transformation 2018-2037 \n(published in 2019) \n\nGlobal value networks\nAutomation of passenger-vehicle traffic Passenger transport\nAutomation of commodity transport Logistics\nManufacturing close to customers Manufacturing of goods\nVirtualisation of retail trade and services Exchange\nLocal or functional food Sustenance\nDistance presence and remote control of tools Remote impact\nIndividualisation of learning and guidance Acquiring information\nSelf-care based and personalised healthcare Healthcare\nNew capabilities for those who have lost their functional health Redressing disabilities\nSustainable energy technologies Energy supply\nRaw materials from untapped areas of the earth and space Materials\nParticipatory forms of entertainment, culture and influence Producing experiences\nNational defence and anti-terrorism Safety and security\nFunctionalisation of spaces and structures Built environment\nOperation models for self-organising communities Collaboration and trust\nVirtualisation of identities and social structures Existential meaning\nDemocracy, freedom and social cohesion Power structures\nEquipment that increases awareness of the environment Automation of work\nFunctional materials and new material technologies Work and income\nFunctional added value of intelligent goods Proficiency and its proof\n\nAreas of technological breakthroughs\nControl of metabolisms of human beings and other organisms Biotechnology and pharmacology\nSocial innovations Digital crowdsourcing platforms\n\nAlgorithms and systemic solutions based on IT\nArtificial intelligence and algorithmic \nreduction\n\nMeasurement and picturing Digitisation of sensory data and processing\nMoving and transportation Transport, mobility and logistics\nRobotics Production of products and services\nKey enabling materials and industrial raw materials Material technology\nEnergy technology Energy technology\nMessaging technologies and protocols Instrumentation and telecommunication\nHuman machine interface technologies Globalising technology interfaces\nImitation of nature and cyborgs\n\nFigure 15-1 Horizon scanning of the Parliament of Finland: global value networks \nand areas of technological breakthroughs2\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: Author's elaboration based on Linturi at al., 2014; Linturi and Kuusi, 2019\nNote: The placing of areas next to each other indicates the continuity from one report to the other, unless in italics, which \nindicates discontinuities.\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter15/figure_15-1.xlsx\n\n2 The placement of areas next to each other indicates the continuity from one report to the other, unless in italics, which \nindicates discontinuities.\n\n\n\n758\n\n4.  Horizon scanning in the European Commission: \nthe Radical Innovation Breakthrough Inquirer\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s Radical Innovation \nBreakthrough Inquirer (RIBRI) project was \ninspired by the Finnish study in two ways. First, \nhaving realised the importance of values in \nforesight and R&I policy (Remotti et al., 2016; \nWebber et al., 2018), the Commission came \nto appreciate the Finnish study\u2019s emphasis on \nvalues and the concomitant interest in social \ninnovation. Second, the idea of using values \nas a means of evaluating the potential impact \nof radical innovations was consistent with the \nrising emphasis on directionality in EU R&I \npolicy, in particular towards the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals in the UN Agenda 2030. \n\nThe RIBRI study used a mixed approach to \nidentify radical innovation breakthroughs. \nFor the most part, a massive bibliometric \nstudy used specially trained algorithms to \nmine scientific and technical publications for \nemerging concepts. Signals identified by the \nalgorithms went through expert refereeing, \nafter which they were written up as Radical \nInnovation Breakthroughs (RIBs). These were \ncompared to and enhanced with other RIBs \nidentified by other recent foresight studies, \n\nincluding surveys of social innovations. The \n100 most important ones were selected \nthrough expert assessment procedures for \ntheir potential for widespread use by 2038, \ntheir level of maturity, and the EU\u2019s relative \nposition in patents and publications. \n\nThe 100 RIBs were clustered ex post into \nnine areas: Artificial Intelligence and robotics \n(AI&R); electronics and computing (E&C); bio-\nmedicine (BM); human-machine interaction and \nbiomimetics (HMI&B); printing and materials \n(P&M); resource boundaries (RB); energy (E); \nbio-hybrids (BH); and social innovations (SI). \nIn all areas other than social innovations, the \ncollections include mature topics that have been \naround for a while (breakthroughs waiting to \nhappen) and emerging new areas of fundamental \nresearch (high potential \u2013 high uncertainty \nbreakthroughs). All social innovations depicted \nare areas of existing social activity and thus of \nconsiderable maturity. Having ranked the RIBs in \nterms of their potential for significant use in 20 \nyears and the current relative strength of the EU \nin the global system, the RIBs can be portrayed \nas presented in

highlights:\n\n1. The AI and robotics revolution\n\nAI&R form a cluster of innovations that will \nhave a huge impact on the future world \neconomy and society. It is the most populous \n\ncluster of RIBs identified and the one with the \nhighest average potential for significant use in \n20 years\u2019 time.\n\nEmotion recognition\nEmotion recognition has been about \napplying advanced image-processing \nalgorithms to images (or videos) of the \nhuman face. Recent developments have \nextended the field to include other means \nof gauging emotions (text analysis, \ntone of voice, heartbeat and breathing \n\npatterns, etc.) and even extending them \nto other species. Applications cover areas \nsuch as marketing (detecting minute, \nsubconscious reactions to advertising or \nproducts), smart devices that adapt to our \nmood, and law enforcement (improved lie \ndetectors).\n\nIn some areas of the AI&R cluster, such as \nchatbots, Europe is strong while in other areas, \nlike computing memory, Europe\u2019s capacities are \nrelatively weak. Consolidating the application \npathways emerging from the surge of innovations \nin algorithms and hardware in sectors such as \n\nmobility, health, education and food seems \nat least as important as fostering the further \nemergence of upcoming innovations. It is vital \nfor Europe to pursue trajectories that unlock the \npotential of these technologies to support better \nsolutions able to meet citizens\u2019 needs.\n\n2. Fast-emerging innovations\n\nThe results include 45 RIBs currently at a low \nlevel of maturity which are expected to develop \nquickly and find important use in the coming 20 \nyears. Among these, seven RIBs are expected \nto be particularly fast moving:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Neuromorphic chip\n\u00dd\u00dd Biodegradable sensors\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Hyperspectral imaging\n\u00dd\u00dd Warfare drones\n\u00dd\u00dd Harvesting methane hydrate\n\u00dd\u00dd Thermoelectric paint\n\u00dd\u00dd Neuroscience of creativity and imagination\n\u00dd\u00dd 4D printing\n\nNeuromorphic chip\nModelled on biological brains, neuromorphic \nchips are less flexible and powerful than \nthe best general-purpose chips, but highly \nefficient for specialised tasks. They can boost \nthe development of AI-based systems for \n\nspecific purposes such as object recognition, \nvoice and gesture recognition, emotion \nanalytics, health analytics or robot motion, \nand can moderate their power consumption.\n\n\n\n762\n\nAmong the 45 potentially fast-moving RIBs, \nrelative weaknesses in Europe were found in \nthe following: \n\n\u00dd\u00dd 4D printing\n\u00dd\u00dd Bioluminescence\n\u00dd\u00dd Automated indoor farming\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Water splitting\n\u00dd\u00dd Computing memory\n\u00dd\u00dd Molten salt reactors\n\u00dd\u00dd Graphene transistors\n\u00dd\u00dd Energy harvesting\n\u00dd\u00dd Hyperloop\n\n4D printing\n4D printing adds an additional element of \ntime to 3D printing/additive manufacturing. \n4D-printed objects can change shape or self-\nassemble over time if exposed to a stimulus \n\u2013 heat, light, water, magnetic field or another \nform of energy \u2013 which activates the process \n\nof change. Among the ground-breaking \napplications foreseen are drug devices \nreacting to heat changes in the body, shape-\nmemory materials enabling solar panels \nto auto-rotate towards the sun, and self-\nrepairing infrastructures.\n\nAmongst the 45 potentially fast-growing RIBs, \nrelative strengths in Europe were found in:\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Harvesting methane hydrate\n\u00dd\u00dd Underwater living\n\u00dd\u00dd Bioplastics\n\u00dd\u00dd 3D printing of food\n\u00dd\u00dd Lab-on-a-chip\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Chatbots\n\u00dd\u00dd Quantum cryptography\n\u00dd\u00dd Marine and tidal-power technologies\n\nInterestingly, in the field of quantum \ncryptography, the EU leads in terms of patents \nbut China is the leader in publications.\n\nLab-on-a-chip\nA lab-on-a-chip integrates laboratory \nfunctions into a single device of small \ndimensions. It promises better and faster \ndiagnostics, especially in areas with poor \n\nhealthcare infrastructure, a more active role \nfor patients in monitoring their own health, \nas well as enabling citizens to engage in \nenvironmental monitoring.\n\n3. Highly speculative areas\n\nThe following highly speculative topics made it \ninto the 100 RIBs: \n\n\u00dd\u00dd Neuromorphic chip\n\u00dd\u00dd Neuroscience of creativity and imagination\n\u00dd\u00dd Plant communication\n\u00dd\u00dd Spintronics\n\u00dd\u00dd Bioelectronics\n\n\u00dd\u00dd Aluminium-based energy\n\u00dd\u00dd Airborne wind turbine\n\u00dd\u00dd Artificial photosynthesis\n\u00dd\u00dd 4D printing\n\u00dd\u00dd Asteroid mining\n\u00dd\u00dd Thermoelectric paint\n\u00dd\u00dd Artificial synapse/brain\n\u00dd\u00dd Flying car\n\n\n\n763\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 15\n\nBioelectronics\nBioelectronics is the use of biological \nmaterials and architectures inspired by \nbiological systems to design and build \ninformation-processing machinery and \nrelated devices. Researchers hope to develop \nbio-inspired materials (e.g. capable of self-\n\nassembly or self-repair) and bio-inspired \nhardware architectures (e.g. massive \nparallelism) to be used in new sensors, \nactuators and information-processing \nsystems that are smaller, work faster/better \nand require less power.\n\nIn the first eight RIBs on this list, Europe \nhas noteworthy capacities. In the other five \n(indicated in italics) its position is either unclear \nor weak as regards maintaining and further \nadvancing its position as a pioneering actor in \nnewly emerging technologies. The neuromorphic \nchip also deserves special attention because, \nin spite of its low maturity, expectations on its \nwidespread use in 2038 are very high.\n\n4. Mature, yet radical \n\nSome of the RIBs identified are quite mature \u2013 \nthey have been known for a while and have been \nsubjects of R&D and patenting. At the same \ntime, they have a great deal of unexploited \ngrowth potential in the perspective of 2038. \nTheir relative technological maturity places \n\nthem at the junction between R&I policy and \nindustry policy concerns. Such RIBs are found, for \nexample, in the area of nanotechnology (nano-\nLEDs, nanowires, carbon nanotubes). Hydrogels \nand holograms also fall into this category. Their \nfurther development is not so much a matter \nof R&I policy but more a subject for industry \npolicy or other policies concerned with the \nrespective domains. Given their potential, it is \nworth asking whether appropriate regulatory \nframeworks are in place and if complementary \nsocial innovations are needed for the successful \nand beneficial exploitation of these RIBs, \nor whether an industry policy is required to \nstrengthen Europe\u2019s position in the areas of \ncarbon nanotubes, nanowires and hydrogels, \nwhere currently it is not world-leading.\n\nHydrogels\nThese natural or synthetic polymeric \nnetworks are capable of holding large \nvolumes of water that can replicate the \ndynamic signalling involved in biological \nprocesses, such as cell/tissue development. \nIn the near future, hydrogels will provide \nthe basis for first-aid kits and innovative \n\ndrug-development concepts. In the longer \nterm, we can imagine curative soft robots \nperforming surgery at microscopic and sub-\nmicroscopic levels, and hydrogels in mobile-\nphone screens sensing environmental \npollutants and informing an app.\n\n\n\n764\n\n5.  A view from Europe\u2019s Research and \nTechnology Organisations (RTOs)2\n\n2 \n3 The workshop was organised by the Directorate for Prosperity in the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for \n\nResearch and Innovation and the Research Council of Norway. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_\ninnovation/ki-03-19-551-en-n.pdf\n\n4 Organisations represented: Agency for Higher Education, Science and Innovation Funding in Romania; Austrian Institute of \nTechnology; CEA Tech; Cenate AS; CSEM; Enterprise Ireland; European Commission Directorate-General Research & Innovation and \nthe Joint Research Centre; Firda AS; European Association of Research & Technology Organisations; Flanders Make vzw; Fraunhofer \nGesellschaft; International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory; Innovate UK; J.

The workshop was part of \na wide public consultation on the draft strategic \nplan for the next EU Research and Innovation \nProgramme, Horizon Europe. \n\nRTOs play a very important role in the European \nInnovation system, intermediating between \nscience, technology, industry and government. \nBased on their special position, we asked the \ndirectors of participating RTOs and funding \nbodies to single out the technology they thought \nwas the most important for future prosperity. \n\nCurrent policy debate in the EU already focuses \na lot on information and communication tech-\nnologies, including AI, the digital transformation5 \nand Industry 4.06. Participants were asked to \nfocus on areas \u2018other than digital only\u2019. \n\nThe result was a collection of emerging \ntechnologies considered to have particularly \nstrong potential, in their opinion, to create \nprosperity, including economic growth and \nbroader benefits. An essential factor was the \n\ncontribution of the technologies to society and \nthe transition towards sustainability. \n\nThe technologies presented can be clustered into \nfive areas, technological frameworks: biological \ntransformation; smart materials; marine \ntechnologies; low-energy data transmission; \nand \u2018power to X\u2019.\n\n1. Biological transformation includes \nthe increasing exploitation of biological \nknowledge as well as the increasing \nspread of biomimetic design. Biological \ntransformation brings together the basic \ndisciplines of biotechnology, engineering \nand information technology. Methods of \nadaptive data processing (machine-learning \nalgorithms) are just as important as \nbiotechnological production processes. Their \ncombination and intelligent networking, \nincluding biological components and \nprinciples for their optimisation were \nconsidered key to a bio-intelligent economy \nthat enables prosperity and healthy \nand sustainable (qualitative rather than \nquantitative) growth. The areas discussed \nin the workshop included Human-Machine \nInteraction, smart farming, gene technology \nand neuro-technologies. \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/ki-03-19-551-en-n.pdf\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/ki-03-19-551-en-n.pdf\nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/570007/IPOL_STU(2016)570007_EN.pdf\n\n\n765\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 15\n\n2. Smart materials (e.g. renewable plastics, \nsmart nanomaterials and additive manufac-\nturing) build on technology that provides them \nwith additional functionalities, capacities, \nand features in bulk and/or at the interface, \nincluding adaptability and the capacity to \nbe both sensors and actuators, or to create \nnew structures even on a very small scale. \nFurther development of smart materials can \ncontribute to environmental sustainability \n(enabling, recycling, repair and self-healing \nor sensing) and find important uses in \nhealthcare (e.g. thanks to their properties, \nsome smart materials can be used in medical \napplications that enable better treatment of \npatients and new forms of therapy) as well as \nother areas of application. \n\n3. Low-energy data transmission will be \nimportant as data networks are expected \nto expand massively in the next few years. \nThe two technologies discussed in the \nworkshop include coherent optics, which \nallow the transmission of larger volumes \nof data over longer distances, with lower \nenergy consumption on the existing fibre-\noptic infrastructure; and smart dust, which \nis a completely different way of transmitting \nand receiving data opening up completely \ndifferent application domains. Smart dust \ncombines systems for ubiquitous Internet of \nThings (IoT) with ultra-low power consumption \nor energy autonomy. It encompasses \nintelligent sensors that are degradable and \nable to communicate among one another.\n\nFigure 15-3 Overview of technology frameworks and technologies\n\nScience, research and innovation performance of the EU 2020\nSource: M\u00fcller, J and L Potters (2019) Future technology for prosperity: Horizon scanning by Europe's technology leaders, \nEuropean Commission\nStat. link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/srip/2020/partii/chapter15/figure_15-3.xlsx\n\nSmart\nNanomaterials\n\nSmart\nFarming\n\nDigital Fish\n\nHydrogen\n\nCarbon Capture\nand Storage\n\nFreshwater \nunder sea\n\nNeuro-\ntechnologies\n\nGene\nTechnology\n\nHuman-Machine\nInteraction\n\nSmart Dust\n\nCoherent Optics\n\nSMART MATERIALS MARINE \nTECHNOLOGIES\n\nPOWER TO X\n\nBIOLOGICAL\nTRANSFORMATION\n\nLOW ENERGY DATA\nTRANSMISSION\n\nRenewable\nPlastics\n\nAdditive\nManufacturing\n\n\n\n766\n\n4. Power to X refers to the electrification of \nindustrial processes and the transition in \nthe way heavy industries, and especially \nthe chemical industry, use power. The two \ntechnologies discussed in the workshop are \nhydrogen and carbon capture and storage. \nThe long-term vision is to turn natural sources \nof energy, such as sunlight, directly into heat, \nfuels and further chemical products, which \ncould massively increase the efficiency of \nthe chemical industry through direct power \nconversion, also closely aligned with carbon \ncapture and storage technologies.\n\n5. Marine technologies emphasise the poten-\ntial of the seas. Digital fish, the monitoring of \nfish via sensors, enables a digital twin of fish \nto be created. This enables the lives of fish \nto be tracked and studied, hunger mitigated, \ndisease stress and further stress factors \nto reduce diseases, fish mortality to be im-\nproved, and the optimisation of feeding pro-\ncesses and fish well-being. The other area dis-\ncussed concerns the potential to discover and \n\nexploit large amounts of fresh water below \nthe ocean surface, often hidden in caves. This \nwater could be used to irrigate regions with \nlow precipitation, for example, for farming or \nto provide communities with fresh water. \n\nAll areas have in common the fact that they \nrelate to societal challenges and have the \npotential for systemic changes. They involve \nthe need to better understand the underlying \nsystems, a combination of disciplines and \ncollaboration and co-creation of all main actors, \nwith industry taking a leading role in this. The role \nof policymakers is seen as shaping the conditions \nfor a strong innovation ecosystem whereby all \nactors in the innovation process are connected \nand can create value, creating critical mass to \ntackle strategic economic and societal domains, \nand to deploy favourable regulation and \nfinancial instruments as an impetus for collective \ninnovation. Participants also emphasised active \nengagement with civil society and citizens from \nthe very start of technology development.\n\n\n\n767\nCH\n\nA\nPTER 15\n\n6.  In conclusion: waves of change and horizon scanning\n\nWhich areas should Europe prioritise? How \nshould strengths and weaknesses be dealt with? \nSuch strategic questions cannot be answered by \nhorizon scanning, although it can inform us about \nthe implications of one or other of the choices. \nA scan of the horizon at a specific point in time \nraises our awareness of potentially important \nareas of R&I and provides for a better-informed \nR&I strategy. In its simplest form, it enables \nus to ask ourselves whether or not we need to \ninvest in all these areas and why, and to better \nunderstand the opportunity cost of our choices. \n\nWhile this is an important strategic function, it is \nalso important to note that a complete scan of \nthe horizon is very costly, and the picture of the \nhorizon is a moving one. The Finnish experience \nwith the two successive studies provides \nsome insight into the speed of change. New \nunderstandings and experiments change people\u2019s \nviews of what is doable and worth doing, while \nsocietal values, norms and beliefs also influence \nthe pursuits of scientists and engineers. \n\nThe waves of change associated with the \nfunctioning of economic expectations have, \nsince the Second World War, combined with \nnotions of technological performance associated \nwith military concerns to drive technological \ninnovation in domains that have massively \nincreased economic productivity. Several authors \n(Mazzucato and Perez, 2014; Mazzucato, 2018; \nPerez, 2016) have argued that humanity needs \nto shift towards different sets of technological \naspirations that reflect humanistic ideals and \nthe value of our ecosystem \u2013 such as the UN \nSustainable Development Goals. The workshop in \nOslo related technologies clearly to a \u2018purpose\u2019. \nIn RIBRI, we see some signs of such waves of \nchange. The most visible innovation drive related \nto the \u2018digital revolution\u2019 is expected to be \nfollowed by a more diverse wave of innovations \n\nthat address broader concerns of life and the \necosystem. For many (Kastrinos and Vercruysse, \n2019; Messerli et al., 2019), and the EU has \nexpressed commitments in this respect, the SDGs \nwill, to a considerable degree, shape the value-\ncreating structures and processes of the future.\n\nHowever, this is neither a clear case nor \na finished battle. Although mining methane \nhydrate \u2013 to use an obvious example of an \narea where Europe appears to be strong \u2013 \ncould solve resource problems, it also poses \nsignificant environmental risks. The values of \nsustainability and environmental performance \nare not clear-cut. While science, technology, \nresearch and innovation can enable and \ncontribute to sustainability pursuits, they cannot \nalone provide a new green wave. What they can \ndo is to provide answers to those who claim that \nsuch a wave is impossible and that sustainability \ncannot be achieved. They must show that it is \ndoable and provide the tools for achieving it. It \nis society\u2019s duty to decide that it is worth doing.\n\nIn this context, it is the duty of horizon scanning \nto showcase different alternatives and to \nallow for the continuous assessment of those \nalternatives as routes towards sustainability. \nThis does not necessarily mean that only the \nmost efficient routes must be followed. Often \nshort-term efficiency is a long-term liability. \nPriorities and choices must be informed and \nto achieve that, scans of the horizon need to \nbe systematic, continuous and comprehensive, \nfeeding into decision-making processes that \nare both engaging and participative, involving \nbroad sets of stakeholders and the concerned \npublic, in a new EU R&I policy that will \nsuccessfully pave the way to sustainability. \n\n\n\n768\n\n7.
