The EIGENET \nframework of contractors was engaged in the \nsurvey implementation, involving 23 organisa-\ntions and consortia (1). The analysis of the sur-\nvey was carried out by a research group led by \nthe University of Murcia, Spain.\n\nThe survey asked 5 378 European women and \nmen about nine infrastructure services (2), and \ncovered seven activities of daily life.\n\nFigure 1.

Social relations\n\nThe survey aimed to collect direct information \non the importance of existing infrastructure \nservices for everyday activities, and the level of \nwell-being that public infrastructure provides.\n\nThe theoretical framework of this study stems \nfrom the well-being theory that developed in \nthe late 20th and early 21st century. Well-be-\n\ning theory replaced the prevailing perspective \nof the mid-20th century that saw the progress \nand development of countries indicated by their \neconomic development and measured by mac-\nroeconomic variables such as the gross domes-\ntic product (GDP) and per capita income. By \ncontrast, well-being theory argues that people \nand their capabilities should be the ultimate cri-\nteria for assessing the development of a Mem-\nber State.\n\nThis rationale underpins the European \u2018Beyond \nGDP\u2019 initiative (4), whose main objective is to \ndevelop indicators that are as clear and appeal-\ning as GDP, but are more inclusive of the envi-\nronmental and social aspects of progress. The \ninitiative also seeks to address some of the \nglobal challenges of the 21st century, such as \nclimate change, poverty, resource depletion, \nhealth and quality of life.\n\nTheir residents\u2019 well-being is becoming a goal \nfor the governments of many developed coun-\ntries in general and the EU in particular. The \nchallenge is to find a useful method of meas-\nuring well-being and generating indicators, \na methodological challenge similarly experi-\nenced by this study.\n\nAccording to the prevailing theories of the 20th \ncentury, expenditure on public infrastructure is \nrelated to investments in physical capital, and \nits convenience is assessed in terms of produc-\ntivity or rate of return. Thus, infrastructure gen-\nerating economic production and consumption \nis prioritised, while infrastructure related to care \nof people is regarded as unproductive in terms \n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/background_en.html\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nBenefits of gender equality through infrastructure provision: an EU-wide survey 7\n\nof GDP or as part of the private sphere, and is \nless frequently financed.\n\nNevertheless, all European policies \u2013 includ-\ning public infrastructure policies \u2013 must aim to \nimprove the well-being of the population rather \nthan its economic development. Consequently, \nsuch actions must be analysed and assessed \nfor their ability to provide well-being.\n\nPublic infrastructure is usually embedded in the \nconcept of urban policy or urban planning and \nhas not traditionally been studied from a well-be-\ning perspective. It is, however, crucial to meet-\ning European residents\u2019 structural needs, such \nas public centres to care for dependants so that \ntheir relatives can enter the labour market and \nenjoy their leisure time, access to public transport \nto travel to work or engage in social relationships \nand well-lit pedestrian paths generating personal \nautonomy and freedom. All of these elements are \ndeterminants of high levels of well-being.\n\nProviding for such structural needs also pro-\nmotes a new socioeconomic model, one that \naddresses gender differences (Hayden, 1981; \nBorder\u00edas and Carrasco, 1994).\n\nGender equality is a cross-cutting issue, inte-\ngral to every area of work, and is thus closely \nintertwined with substantive policy sectors, \nparticularly those relating to social policy, jus-\ntice, employment and economic policy. Gen-\nder mainstreaming has put people at the cen-\ntre of policymaking across sectors, resulting in \ngender equality policies with wider reach and \nimpact. Sectoral policies benefit from gender \nmainstreaming because it broadens knowledge \nof inequalities and different population needs, \nallowing for better-targeted policymaking.\n\nThe methodology used here combines two \nwell-being theories: the capability approach (CA), \nwhich determines the extent to which public \ninfrastructure has an impact on the capabilities \nthat are the base of human dignity; and subjec-\ntive well-being (SWB) theory, which takes a sub-\njective point of view. This methodology is appli-\ncable to every public policy because it addresses \n\nthe coverage of the policy, the extent of capabil-\nity development, and satisfaction levels.\n\nThe research began with a series of explora-\ntory hypotheses that served as the \u2018basic prop-\nositions\u2019 of the research (Halperin and Heath, \n2012).\n\n\u2022 The approach sees the development of coun-\ntries as measured by their economic devel-\nopment being replaced by theories focusing \non population well-being as the real measure \nof progress.\n\n\u2022 The CA and SWB theories advise studying \nthe effects of public policy on the well-being \nof women and men, as economic and social \ndevelopment must focus on everyone\u2019s capa-\nbility development, satisfaction and life qual-\nity.\n\n\u2022 CA and SWB are a set of conceptual tools \nwith a proven ability to achieve significant \nimprovements when turning theory into \npractice or turning institutional discourse \ninto policies, plans and programmes.\n\n\u2022 Infrastructure is key to meeting the public\u2019s \nstructural needs and well-being, providing \ncitizens and the general public with the struc-\ntural conditions that promote a new socioec-\nonomic model with no gender differences.\n\n\u2022 Removing the disadvantaged position of \nwomen means greater equality of opportu-\nnity and results in the sphere of infrastruc-\nture. Public infrastructure policies are crucial \nin changing the gender division of labour \nand fostering social rights.\n\n\u2022 Previous research establishes that differ-\nences in women\u2019s and men\u2019s positions derive \nfrom their traditional gender roles.\n\nThis study aims to close the research gap and \noffer a tool for scholars and policymakers to \nbetter understand people\u2019s needs and plan \na more efficient and balanced allocation of pub-\nlic resources.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality8\n\nThe remaining sections of this technical report \nare structured as follows:\n\n\u2022 Section 2 presents the theoretical framework \nof the study, together with its objectives and \nhypotheses.\n\n\u2022 Section 3 describes the questionnaire develop-\nment in relation to the theoretical framework.\n\n\u2022 Section 4 covers the fieldwork organisation. \nThe sampling section describes the whole \nsample selection process, sampling meth-\nods, design and data-collection process, \nhighlighting the methods for reaching the \nappropriate population and the key require-\nments for collecting quality data.\n\n\u2022 Section 5 describes the interviewing process, \nincluding how data was collected and deliv-\nered, establishes the stratification criteria fol-\nlowed by the national coordinators, interview \nduration and estimation of response rate by \nMember State.\n\n\u2022 Section 6 presents the quality-control tech-\nniques used.\n\n\u2022 Section 7 explains the weighting system.\n\n\u2022 Section 8 describes the final database, \naccompanied by a system of context indica-\ntors (SCI).\n\n\u2022 The end matter includes the bibliography, \nwhich sets out the main references used in \nthis report, and annexes.

Economic growth was the main criterion \nfor assessing social development, with public \npolicy strategies centred on the idea that qual-\nity of life improves with increased GDP or per \ncapita income.\n\nHowever, the notion that GDP growth is the \nmain goal of societies has been questioned \nsince the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\nThe first initiative to change the measure of \ndevelopment was led by the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) in 1990, with \nthe Human Development Index (HDI) (5). The \nHDI was created to emphasise that people and \ntheir capabilities should be the ultimate crite-\nria in assessing the development of a country, \nnot economic growth alone. The initiative was \nsupported by the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development (OECD) (6), with \nthe \u2018Better Life Index\u2019 (7).\n\nIn the European Union (EU) context, the Euro-\npean Commission, European Parliament, Club \nof Rome, OECD and the World Wide Fund for \nNature (WWF) hosted the high-level conference \n\u2018Beyond GDP\u2019 (8) in 2007. The objectives were to \nclarify the most appropriate indices to measure \nprogress and to establish how these can best \nbe integrated into the decision-making process \nand taken up by public debate.\n\nThe \u2018Beyond GDP\u2019 initiative (9) was about devel-\noping indicators that are as clear and appealing \nas GDP but are more inclusive of environmen-\ntal and social aspects of progress. Economic \nindicators such as GDP were never designed \n\nto be comprehensive measures of prosperity \nand well-being. Suitable (\u2018adequate\u2019) indicators \nare now needed to address some of the global \nchallenges of the 21st century, such as climate \nchange, poverty, resource depletion, health and \nquality of life.\n\nAccording to the model pursued by the EU, \nhuman development and achievements must \nbe measured by considering European popula-\ntions\u2019 living standards, well-being, equality and \ncapability development. European governments \nare now more willing to assess their popula-\ntions\u2019 well-being in order to make decisions that \nhave a positive impact on the development of \ncapabilities and satisfaction levels.\n\nPublic infrastructure expenditure receives con-\nsiderable attention in European policy perfor-\nmance and commands a large share of the EU \nbudget.\n\nInfrastructure is the material support for those \nparts of our lives in which public spaces and \nservices are used, as well as communications, \nthe environment, housing and the economic \nactivity serving a country, city, or area (10). It \nrefers to fundamental facilities and systems, \nincluding those necessary for an economy to \nfunction (Sullivan and Sheffrin, 2003). It typi-\ncally characterises technical structures, such as \nroads, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, \nelectrical grids, telecommunications, and can be \ndefined as \u2018the physical components of interre-\nlated systems providing commodities and ser-\nvices essential to enable, sustain, or enhance \nsocietal living conditions\u2019 (Fulmer, 2009).\n\nInfrastructure can be broadly defined as long-\nterm physical assets that operate in markets \n\nhttp://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi\nhttp://www.oecd.org/statistics/better-life-initiative.htm\nhttp://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/11111111111\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/download/bgdp-summary-notes.pdf\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/2007_conference_en.html\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/2007_conference_en.html\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/2007_conference_en.html\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/background_en.html\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/infrastructure\n\n\nTheoretical framework\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality10\n\nwith high barriers to entry and enable the pro-\nvision of goods and services (11).\n\nA distinction may be drawn between physical \nand social infrastructure (12).\n\nPhysical infrastructure (13) consists of a broad \narray of systems and facilities that house and \ntransport people and goods and provide ser-\nvices. It includes transportation networks (roads, \nairports, rail, mass movement, etc.), housing, \ngovernment buildings and facilities, and postal \nand telecommunications services.\n\nSocial Infrastructure (14) is a subset of the infra-\nstructure sector and typically includes assets \nthat accommodate social services. Examples \nof social infrastructure assets include schools, \nuniversities, hospitals, prisons and community \nhousing. Social infrastructure does not typically \nextend to furnishing social services, such as the \nprovision of teachers at a school or custodial \nservices at a prison.\n\nWithin the framework of last century\u2019s prevail-\ning theories, expenditure on public infrastruc-\nture is related to investments in physical capital \nand its appropriateness is assessed in terms of \nproductivity or rate of return. This means that \ninfrastructure generating economic production \nand consumption is prioritised, with care-related \ninfrastructure less frequently financed because \nit is regarded as private and unproductive.\n\nPublic infrastructure is usually embedded in \nthe concept of urban policy or urban planning \nand has not traditionally been studied from \na well-being perspective. It is, however, crucial to \nmeeting European residents\u2019 structural needs, \nsuch as public facilities to care for dependants \nto allow their relatives to enter the labour mar-\nket and enjoy their leisure time, access to public \ntransport to travel to work or engage in social \n\n(11) http://www.nzsif.co.nz/Social-Infrastructure/What-is-Social-Infrastructure\n(12) Other criteria may be used to classify infrastructure: \u2018Hard\u2019 infrastructure refers to the large physical networks necessary for the \n\nfunctioning of a modern industrial nation, whereas \u2018soft\u2019 infrastructure refers to the institutions required to maintain the economy, \nhealth, and cultural and social standards of a country (e.g. financial system, education system, healthcare system, system of gov-\nernment, and law enforcement, emergency services) (Niskanen, 1991). \n\n(13) http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Physical_infrastructure\n(14) http://www.nzsif.co.nz/Social-Infrastructure/What-is-Social-Infrastructure\n(15) Following Hayden, see Bofill et al. (1998); Ferrer (2003); S\u00e1nchez de Madariaga (2004); Lasaosa (2006), etc. \n\nrelationships and well-lit footpaths generating \npersonal autonomy and freedom.\n\nProviding for such structural needs also pro-\nmotes a new socioeconomic model, one that \naddresses gender differences (Hayden, 1981; \nBorder\u00edas and Carrasco, 1994). Similarly, Bofill \n(2012) suggests that urban planning must take \ninto account not only the needs derived from \npaid work, but also from unpaid work, education, \nleisure, physical and mental health, or personal \nautonomy. In gender mainstreaming, concepts \nof local well-being must include a thorough \nreflection on women\u2019s roles and activities when \nredefining urban space (Macchi, 2006; Johnson \nand Miles, 2014; Gunluk-Senesen at al., 2014).\n\nThis policy area thus offers the possibility to \ninclude the gender dimension through a gen-\nder-mainstreaming approach, horizontally and \nthroughout all projects, in order to achieve \nmore-inclusive results for sustainable urban \ndevelopment.\n\nGender mainstreaming in infrastructure analy-\nsis began in the United States (US), with Dolores \nHayden\u2019s works (1981, 1984). A pioneer in the \nfield, Hayden highlighted the crisis in the pre-\nvailing model of infrastructure provision and \nurban planning. Her solution was to combine \nthe concepts of work and household, and to \nstudy the city from the perspective of social, \neconomic and physical changes. She focused \nher analysis on the relationship between daily \nlife (child-rearing, access to public space, pub-\nlic transport) and existing public infrastructure \nspaces and provision. Hayden suggested the \nidea of \u2018domesticating urban space\u2019 (Hayden, \n1984) and creating innovative institutions that \nlink public and private spaces (15).\n\nUp to that point, public infrastructure was \nviewed as neutral and universal, with a largely \n\nhttp://www.nzsif.co.nz/Social-Infrastructure/What-is-Social-Infrastructure/\nhttp://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Physical_infrastructure\nhttp://www.nzsif.co.nz/Social-Infrastructure/What-is-Social-Infrastructure/\n\n\nTheoretical framework\n\nBenefits of gender equality through infrastructure provision: an EU-wide survey 11\n\ninvisible impact on well-being. However, early \nstudies revealed the need to mainstream gen-\nder in public infrastructure, particularly given \nthe following.\n\n\u2022 Women live and experience the city more \nthan men, as women use urban public space \nmore frequently to develop the daily tasks of \nhousehold management (Bofill et al., 1998).\n\n\u2022 Women\u2019s excessive workload because of their \ndifferent roles: reproduction, production and \ncommunity (European Commission\u2019s Expert \nGroup on Gender and Employment (EGGE), \n2009).\n\n\u2022 Women\u2019s lack of voice in decision-mak-\ning, given their limited control of produc-\ntive resources, as well as the small share of \nwomen in high-responsibility posts (Dahl-\nerup, 2007).\n\n\u2022 Cultural factors and male domination in \ntransportation decision-making mean that \nwomen often suffer from little or no mobility \n(Miralles-Guasch, 2010; Miralles-Guasch and \nMart\u00ednez Melo, 2012; Fitzgerald and Michie, \n2001).\n\n\u2022 Safety primarily affects women (Morrell, \n1998) and is related to maintenance and con-\ntrol measures that are overlooked in public \ninfrastructure design (Massolo, 2005).\n\nPublic infrastructure planning must consider \nthese issues. Women and men have different \nobligations, opportunities, needs and interests. \nThis insight must be put to use to ensure a pos-\nitive impact on all members of a community, as \nwell as the full effectiveness and sustainability \nof the project. Infrastructure planning from \na gender perspective implies the construction \nof a society that allows for the efficient use of \nhuman resources and the enhancement of the \nwell-being of women and men in view of their \ndifferent societal roles. To do otherwise is to \ndistribute well-being unjustly, perpetuate gen-\nder-role divisions and undermine women\u2019s tal-\nent and potential, putting European birth rates \nat risk (Alarc\u00f3n., 2015). From the perspective \nof use, well-being and provision for individual \n\nand collective needs, gender mainstreaming \nmust be integrated in any infrastructure deci-\nsion-making processes.\n\nGender mainstreaming in infrastructure plan-\nning implies leaving aside the perception that \ninfrastructure is neutral and universal and ask-\ning instead whether women and men make the \nsame use of infrastructure, and whether that \ninfrastructure is addressed to female or male \nroles. Thinking about the gender use of nurs-\neries, sports centres, street lighting or parks \nmeans questioning when, how and why they \nare used by women and men, and whether that \nuse belongs to the public/productive sphere or \nthe private/reproductive one. The answer will \ndetermine whether the infrastructure is equally \nuseful to women and men, and whether the \nimpact on well-being is the same, irrespective of \ngender (Alarc\u00f3n and Colino, 2011; Alarc\u00f3n et al., \n2012; Alarc\u00f3n and Colino, 2013; Alarc\u00f3n, 2015).\n\nGender mainstreaming is crucial in the first \nstages of infrastructure projects (identification \nand planning) because those are the stages in \nwhich the concept and the structure itself are \ndefined. Ignoring gender risks the success of \nthe project and hinders the correction of result-\ning deficiencies in later stages (Guix\u00e9, 2003).\n\nSignificant progress has been made in line with \nthe European \u2018Beyond GDP\u2019 initiative: connect-\ning public policies and well-being, and identify-\ning the human capabilities developed and satis-\nfaction levels attained by such policies.\n\nThis work aims to progress the connections \nbetween infrastructure provision from a gender \nperspective with the different well-being theo-\nries.\n\nThe methodology of this study comprises the \nassessment of public infrastructure based on \nthe CA and SWB theories. It seeks to determine \nthe extent to which public infrastructure has \nan impact on capability, which Sen (1980) and \nNussbaum (2012) suggest is the basis of human \ndignity.\n\nThis study uses an original conceptual model \n(see Figure 2), which combines both the CA and \n\n\n\nTheoretical framework\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality12\n\nSWB theories. Based on the CA theory, seven \ncapabilities (16) are identified, with a subjective \nindicator of well-being used, in line with SWB \ntheory. This allows for the use of indicators that \nprovide direct information on well-being, indi-\nviduals\u2019 satisfaction levels, and collective needs \nand freedoms they might enjoy, by asking the \npublic and citizens directly, instead of taking \na solely theoretical perspective.\n\nThe methodology combines both approaches \ninto a single model in order to facilitate an \nassessment of the impact of improving infra-\nstructure in the EU-28 on the different capabil-\nities and subjective well-being. In other words, \nthe model views CA and SBW as complemen-\ntary, rather than rival, concepts. An interesting \nantecedent of this model is the work by Muffles \nand Heady (2013), whose longitudinal data panel \nfound that increases in basic capabilities \u2013 such \n\n(16) The list developed by Nussbaum (2012) and Robeyns (2005) was shortened to seven capabilities, as a consequence of the survey \nprocess (see \u2018Principal changes to the questionnaire following the pre-test\u2019. Part C, p. 22, for more information).\n\nas human, social and cultural capital \u2013 improved \nsubjective and objective well-being among \nthose living in Great Britain (the United King-\ndom minus Northern Ireland) and Germany.\n\nNussbaum (2009) and Robeyns (2005) guid-\nance was followed to implement the CA in the \nmodel, with a list of seven capabilities created. \nRespondents to the survey were asked to assess \nthe impact of various examples of infrastruc-\nture on each of these capabilities on a scale of \n1 to 10. Statistical analysis of these variables \nthen determined which infrastructure promotes \nwhich capability. In line with Veenhoven (1991, \n1996), EU residents were asked directly about \ntheir experienced well-being, using the meth-\nodology and model questions of SWB theory \n(Rojas, 2012). These questions permitted direct \nobservations of the well-being concept and its \nmeasurement.\n\nFigure 2. Conceptual model for this study\n\n1.

Questionnaire development\nThe questionnaire is structured in five parts, \neach containing different items, from question \nzero (Q0) to Q22b (see Annex 1). In keeping with \nthe proposed theoretical framework, the most \nimportant part of the questionnaire is that which \nincludes questions related to the methodology: \nthe questions to implement CA (Part C) and SWB \n(Part D). Part E is also important, as its questions \n(Q14-20) deal with gender roles, caring activities \nand time use. Part A contains questions on the \nsociodemographic profile of respondents, while \nPart B aims to determine (objectively and sub-\njectively) the levels of importance, access and \nsatisfaction given to public infrastructure by the \nEuropean population.\n\nPART A\n\nThis part of the questionnaire covers sociode-\nmographic information, such as sex, age, place \nof residence and employment status, as well as \nsome filter questions to identify \u2013 and subse-\nquently exclude \u2013 respondents outside the tar-\nget population.\n\nGiven that the survey is done by telephone and \nthe possibility of using both fixed and mobile \nlines was considered, Q0 investigates whether \nor not there is a different telephone line to that \nused to contact the respondent. Q1 asks for the \nrespondent\u2019s sex, Q2 their age, Q3 asks either \nthe region (A) or whether the respondent is \na resident of a Member State (B). Question A or \nB is asked, depending on whether the national \ncoordinator is stratifying based on region (A) or \nnot (B). Question B ensures that the target pop-\nulation is interviewed (i.e. residents of a Mem-\nber State). Q4 determines the type of place of \nresidence, and Q5 the employment status of \nthe respondent.\n\nPART B\n\nThis part of the questionnaire collects respond-\nents\u2019 subjective assessments of the importance \n\nof public services in light of their own needs \nand access. It also includes a subjective evalua-\ntion of satisfaction with the safety, security and \nquality of the public services used, where the \nrespondent or a dependent (i.e. someone for \nwhom they provide daily care, such as a child or \nolder relative) has used some of these services \nin the last 10 years.\n\nPart B uses five questions to evaluate the impor-\ntance and quality of all 11 public services. Q6, \nQ7 and Q8 are asked of all respondents, while \nQ9a and Q9a are asked to respondents who \nanswered \u2018YES\u2019 (1) to Q8.\n\nQ6 includes the definition of \u2018public services\u2019, \nindicating that they refer to both public and \nsubsidised private services. The question is \ndesigned to shape respondents\u2019 expectations \nof the number of services under considera-\ntion. Highlighting the role of services in cre-\nating \u2018friendlier neighbourhoods\u2019 encourages \nindividuals to think about \u2018importance\u2019 in terms \nbroader than their own immediate needs. The \nquestion addresses the importance of each ser-\nvice to respondents, how essential or important \nit is in allowing respondents to live their life in \nthe way that best suits them.\n\nQ7 measures \u2018access level\u2019 to all 11 public ser-\nvices. The question defines \u2018access\u2019 as whether \nthe public service exists, whether it can be \nreached and whether respondents can afford \nit. Where respondents cannot use the service \nfor one or more of these reasons, it is deemed \ninaccessible.\n\nQ8 addresses the use of the aforementioned \npublic services in the last 10 years by the \nrespondent or their dependents.\n\nQ9a and Q9b ask about respondents\u2019 level of \nsatisfaction with these public services in terms \nof safety and security (Q9a) or quality (Q9b). \nSafety and security is defined as the capacity \nof a service to avoid damage and adverse out-\ncomes (accidents/incidents including violence \n\n\n\nQuestionnaire development\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality14\n\nand abuse of any kind). Quality of services refers \nto an overall judgement of a particular service: \nhow well it meets respondents\u2019 needs in terms \nof effectiveness, accessibility, continuity, ameni-\nties, etc. Safety and security is only one aspect \nof (service) quality.\n\nPART C\n\nQ10 integrates CA into the questionnaire. It asks \nrespondents to relate capabilities to infrastruc-\nture by rating the importance of the infrastruc-\nture in the development of each of the capabil-\nities. Nine key infrastructure elements are cov-\nered, as are cultural centres for activities, work-\nshops, gyms and other centres for workout and \nplay.\n\nThis question comprises seven sub-items, cor-\nresponding to the seven capabilities shaping \nwell-being in line with the CA. The selected \ncapabilities are education, employment, care \nand domestic activities, health, social relation-\nships, mobility and leisure.\n\nOnly respondents with direct experience of \na relevant example of infrastructure in the past \n10 years answered this question (respondents \nwho answered YES [1] to Q8). This ensures that \nresponses are the result of direct-experience \njudgements. It does, however, mean that cer-\ntain infrastructure was assessed by very few \nrespondents, resulting in a large amount of \ntruncated data.\n\nPART D\n\nThis section includes Q11, Q12 and Q13, \nstandard SWB questions that relate to the \nimplementation of SWB theory. This section \nexplores respondents\u2019 subjective assessments \nof their level of well-being in respect of health, \nthe economic situation of their household, \n\noccupation activity, free time, neighbourhood, \netc.\n\nQ11 asks for respondents\u2019 subjective assess-\nment of satisfaction with some aspects of their \nwell-being, which are closely related to the \ncapabilities analysed in the CA section. This \nallowed the research to connect both theories \nfrom a methodological perspective.\n\nQ12 and Q13 explore the level of life satisfac-\ntion. Q12 allows for modulating the degree of \nsatisfaction in certain respects, while Q13 gath-\ners respondents\u2019 subjective evaluations of their \ngeneral satisfaction with their lives.\n\nPART E\n\nThis section of the questionnaire covers \nrespondents\u2019 personal situations (dedication to \ncertain domestic tasks, existence of depend-\nent children in their charge, educational level, \nmonthly income, etc.).\n\nIt contains items Q14 to Q22b. These are items \nthat will allow sociodemographic classifications \nof the survey results.\n\nThe questionnaire was translated into every \nnational language of the EU-28. The national \ncoordinator of the EU Member States translated \nthe questionnaire and accompanying instruc-\ntions into the languages of their contract(s). \nAfter translating the questionnaire, companies \naddressed the layout of the questionnaire and \nrelated completion instructions.\n\nPrior to the survey, a pre-test of the translated \nquestionnaire took place. The aim of the pre-\ntest was to ensure that questions and answer \nscales were clear, complete and correct. Fol-\nlowing the pre-test, adjustments were made \nand a final version of the questionnaire drafted, \nmaking it more suitable for phone interviews.\n\n\n\nFieldwork organisation\n\nBenefits of gender equality through infrastructure provision: an EU-wide survey 15\n\n3.

Sampling\n\n4.1. Scope\n\nRespondents from the EU-28 took part in this \nstudy. The design was based on one sample of \n5 378 respondents (residents over 18 years old). \nThe sample was designed to be representative \nat EU level.\n\nDaily and monthly updates are published on the \nEurostat website and the study data on Euro-\npean population were taken from Eurostat on \n15 September 2014. Although these data rep-\nresent a temporal estimation at the time of \nextraction, this does not result in a methodo-\nlogical problem because differences in times of \nextraction are not significant when designing \na thorough sample.\n\nThe expected final sample was 5 378 respond-\nents but was increased to 5 385 to accommo-\ndate four additional respondents in Germany, \ntwo in Portugal and one in Poland.\n\nThe universe comprised the total population, \nrather than the 18-and-over (\u2265 18) population, \nas infrastructure and/or services are used by \nthe general population. However, ethical and \nlegal reasons required respondents to be over \n18 years of age to participate in the survey. The \nshare of people aged \u2265 18 in the total popula-\ntion was very similar across the EU-28, account-\ning for approximately 80 %.\n\n4.2. Sample design\n\nThe sample in every Member State (MS) was \nthe general population of both sexes, aged 18 \nand above (\u2265 18), and residing in the EU Mem-\nber States. In order to address the survey to the \nselected populations, a stratified probabilistic \nsample (populations/regions, sex and age) was \ncarried out, with a stratification of units from \nthe first and second stages, selecting an inde-\npendent sample within every population (MS).\n\nThe units of the first stage were populations/\nregions, while those of the second stage were \nsex and age variables.\n\nIn every region (organisational level above the \nlocal entity of every MS, nomenclature of ter-\nritorial units for statistics (Eurostat) (NUTS) 2), \nthe units of the first stage were stratified by \nage and sex. The allocation among stages and \nstrata was strictly proportional. The strategic \nvariables of stratification for the sample were \ndetermined as follows:\n\n\u2022 Stratum 1: Regions (NUTS 2) of the MS \nunder consideration.\n\nThere are more than 200 MS regions across \nthe EU. Given that the regional dimension is \nnot as important in all MS, a feasible alternative \ncould include the regional dimension in Member \nStates with a federal or highly (de jure and/or de \nfacto) decentralised state structure, e.g. Spain, \nBelgium, United Kingdom, Germany and Austria.\n\n\u2022 Stratum 2: Sex and age.\n\nThe stratification of age distribution was 18-39, \n40-64, and \u2265 65.\n\nAlthough not stratification criteria, account was \ntaken of the following.\n\n\u2022 At least 25 % must live in rural areas. This \ncan vary depending on the rural population \nweight within the total population in every \nMS, with a maximum fluctuation of 10 %.\n\n\u2022 At least 35 % must be employed workers \n(self-employed and employees).\n\n4.3. Data collection\n\nData were collected through a telephone-based \nsurvey addressed to the general popula-\ntion of the Member States. The information \n\n\n\nSampling\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality18\n\nwas obtained through a telephone conversa-\ntion between the interviewer and the eligible \nrespondent. The programme chosen, computer \nassisted telephone interviews (CATI), makes \nrandom calls and allows the interviewer to man-\nage and complete the questionnaire with com-\nputer aid. This type of telephone-based survey \nprovides an economic advantage by requiring \nfewer interviewers, appropriate monitoring, \nproviding fast and efficient access to substan-\ntial population diversity. All versions of the CATI \nsystem were valid for the data collection.\n\nMost people in the EU Member States do \nnot have access to a landline telephone, thus \nmobile phone numbers were also surveyed. \nThe sample frames used were up-to-date high \nquality Member State-specific telephone regis-\nters that included mobile telephone and land-\nline samples. Where mobile phone support was \nunder-represented in the registers, the gross \nsample of mobile numbers was generated by \nrandom digit dialling (RDD).\n\nThe following formula was used to determine \nthe proportion of mobile and fixed lines to be \nsampled.\n\nProportion fixed numbers = (F + MF) / (M+2MF+F)\n\nProportion mobile numbers = (M+MF) / (M+2MF+F)\n\nF = fixed only; M = mobile only; MF = mobile \u2013 fixed.\n\nIn Member States where this calculation resulted \nin an extremely low proportion of either fixed \nor mobile lines, oversampling was permitted \nfor that low proportion to guarantee sufficient \n\u2018completes\u2019 for that type of line.\n\nTo the extent possible, landlines were stratified \nby existing regional prefix.\n\nThe sample was presented in a uniform format \nto facilitate the verification process. Among \nother variables (e.g. language, region, urbanisa-\ntion, age, sex), the contractor verified whether \nthese gross samples contained enough fixed \nand mobile numbers.\n\n4.4. Target response rates\n\nThe Member State sample is \u2018named individuals \nwith telephone numbers\u2019. Taking into account \nthe complexity of the topic of the survey (ben-\nefits of gender equality through infrastructure \nprovision), a response rate of 20-30 % was con-\nsidered realistic. Table 3 shows the expected \nresponse rate by Member State.\n\nIn other to compute the effective response \nrates, the outcomes of all contact attempts were \ndefined and recorded according to a pre-spec-\nified categorisation: ineligible, non-contact, \nrefusal, contact but not interview, and other \ntypes of non-response (see Table 4).\n\nTable 3.

Interviewing\n\n5.1. Survey setup\n\nEvery EU Member State collected the data for the \nsurvey through a CATI system and all versions of \nCATI were effective. Table 5 shows the different \nCATI systems used by each Member State.\n\nInitial samples were obtained through two \nchannels: mobile phone numbers and landline \nphone numbers. At times, only one of these \nmeans was used to get a representative national \nsample, e.g. in Latvia, Greece, Spain and the \nUnited Kingdom.\n\nThe information was collected in May and \nJune 2015 and meets the stratification criteria \ndescribed above. The collected data allow for \nsegmentation by the suggested age groups: \n18-39 years old, 40-64 and \u2265 65. The population \ncriterion is also met (at least 25 % live in rural \nareas, with a maximum fluctuation of 10 %), and \nat least 35 % of respondents were employed \n(see Table 36 in Annex 3).\n\nIt should be noted that the affected vari-\nables were re-encoded to create Table 36 \n\n(see Annex 3) and determine compliance \nwith stratification criteria. More specifically, \nQ4: \u2018Where do you live?\u2019 had four types of \nresponse: 1. The open countryside or a vil-\nlage; 2. A small town; 3. A medium to large \ntown; and 4. A city or city suburb. Responses \nwere dichotomised to calculate the percent-\nage of respondents living in rural vs urban \nareas: category 1 (rural area) is made up by \nsubjects living in the open countryside, a vil-\nlage or small town, while category 2 (urban \narea) comprises those living in a medium \nto large town or a city or city suburb. Like-\nwise, Q5: \u2018Could you please tell me what is \nyour current employment status?\u2019 had six \ntypes of answer: 1. Student; 2. Housewife/\nStay-at-home husband/partner; 3. Retired \nor pensioner; 4. Self-employed; 5. Employee; \nand 6. Unemployed. Again, responses were \ndichotomised to calculate the percentage of \nemployed respondents in the sample: cate-\ngory 1 (employed) includes self-employed \nand employee, while category 2 (unem-\nployed) includes the remaining respondents \nand thus includes more than simply unem-\nployed people.\n\nTable 5.

Interview duration\n\nThe master questionnaire (English) was \ndesigned to last between 15 and 20 minutes, \nwhich it did, in English-speaking Member \nStates: Ireland (19 minutes) and United King-\ndom (17 minutes). As with other cross-national \nsurveys, the duration varied depending on the \nspecific nature of each language. Outliers on \nboth sides (extremely short \u2013 less than 5 min-\nutes \u2013 and extremely long \u2013 more than 60 min-\nutes) were excluded from the data (see Table 6). \nLong durations may be the result of a range of \npotential issues.\n\n\u2022 The respondent required a lot of extra expla-\nnation.\n\n\u2022 The respondent had some difficulties in \nunderstanding and the interviewer had to \n\nrepeat the question or answer options sev-\neral times.\n\n\u2022 There were several pauses during the inter-\nview because of disturbances.\n\n\u2022 The interview was stopped and resumed with \na new call at a later point in time (e.g. at the \nrespondent\u2019s request). When resuming the \ninterview, the interviewer had to introduce \nthe survey again.\n\nShort durations stemmed from filtering in the \nquestionnaire. If, for example, a respondent had \nvery limited experience with the services listed, \nthey were required to answer only a short set of \nquestions. Even though some of the interviews \nin the final database were too short or too long, \nthey were of sufficient quality, according to local \nsupervisors.\n\nTable 6.

Effective response rate\n\nResponse rate (RR) in survey research refers to \nthe number of people who answered the survey, \ndivided by the number of people in the sample.\n\nThere are different methods for calculating the \nresponse rate. The effective response rates for \nthis study were calculated using two defini-\ntions of response rate proposed by the Amer-\nican Association for Public Opinion Research \n(AAPOR) (17).\n\nTo obtain the response rate in every MS, the \nratio of completed interviews to the total num-\nber of respondents eligible to take part in the \nsurvey was estimated:\n\nComplete \u2013 subjects that completed the sur-\nvey successfully; Refusal \u2013 those who refused \nto participate, either immediately after pick-\ning up the phone or right at the beginning of \nthe questionnaire; Person Not Available \u2013 eli-\ngible respondents who were not available at \nthe moment of the survey; Partly Completed \u2013 \nincomplete questionnaires due to an interrup-\n\n(17) American Association for Public Opinion Research (2011). \n\ntion or the respondent\u2019s refusal to continue or \nrequest to be contacted later.\n\nTable 7 shows the RR in each MS, using the for-\nmula described above.\n\nThe respondents who refused to answer typi-\ncally stated that the subject matter was of no \ninterest to them, they lacked time or the ques-\ntionnaire was too long.\n\nRDD includes thousands of contacts that are \neventually discovered to be ineligible contacts: \ninvalid numbers, answering machine/busy line \nor number not used. This is why ineligible con-\ntacts were ruled out from the RR estimates. Nei-\nther were ineligible respondents (e.g. non-resi-\ndents, people who did not speak the language \nof the country, or those who had already been \nsurveyed) included in the estimates. Eligible \nsubjects with mental or psychological issues \nwere also discarded.\n\nDefining and understanding the RR calculation \ntechnique in each Member State is important. \nFigure 3 shows a flow diagram of the elements \nof the formula and those excluded, as well as an \noutline of the whole process.\n\nTable 7. Response rate, by Member State\n\nMember State RR (%) Member State RR (%)\n\nAT 8.91 IT 22.66\nBE 7.08 LV 15.60\nBG 17.63 LT 8.75\nHR 18.34 LU 6.58\nCY 12.90 MT 50\nCZ 6.39 NL 18.19\nDK 17.31 PL 7.01\nEE 36.59 PT 81.97\nFI 23.69 RO 7.23\nFR 10.67 SK 5.31\nDE 10.47 SI 15.33\nEL 14.19 ES 6.84\nHU 70.06 SE 23.64\nIE 5.11 UK 4.21\n\n\n\nInterviewing\n\nBenefits of gender equality through infrastructure provision: an EU-wide survey 23\n\nThe other way to calculate the RR focused on the \nquestions of the survey. Here, RR was calculated \nby dividing the number of completed interviews \nby the number of interviews attempted.\n\nThis formula was applied to each question of the \nsurvey in order to determine the success rate of \neach question. As Table 8 shows, the RR was very \nhigh in all questions, above 85 % in most cases. \nThis is a central indicator of survey quality \u2013 \nhigher RRs ensure more accurate survey results.\n\nHowever, in Q19 and Q22a, the RRs were 62.4 % \nand 65.7 %, respectively. Q19 asks \u2018How many \nhours a week do you dedicate to caring for \nthe children?\u2019 and Q22a asks about monthly \nincome. These questions are usually more diffi-\ncult because respondents must give a number, \nthus RRs may be lower. Q22b was formulated to \nimprove the RR in Q22a, where the respondent \n\ncould choose from a list of possible answers. \nThe RR for Q22b (89.4 %) was substantially \nhigher than the RR for Q22a.\n\nFilter questions were used to calculate the RRs \nof each item. To apply formula 2 it is necessary \nto insert the total number of interviews in the \ndenominator, i.e. 5 385 interviews or respond-\nents. Nevertheless, when there is a filter ques-\ntion these data change, so the number of \npotential respondents is smaller. In particular, to \ncalculate the RRs for Q9 and Q10, the denomi-\nnator was the number of the respondents who \nanswered \u2018yes\u2019 to filter question Q8. On the \nother hand, to calculate the RRs for Q11_3 and \nQ17, the denominators were the subjects who \nhad a job (filter question Q5); to calculate the \nRRs for Q15 and Q19, the denominators were \nthe subjects with a dependent child (filter ques-\ntion Q14); and to calculate the RR in Q20, the \ndenominator was subjects with a dependent \nperson (filter question Q16).\n\nFigure 3.

Quality assurance on com-\nparability required clear definition and state-\nment instructions to be followed.\n\n\u2022 Coverage of sample, representing the target \npopulation regionally and across types and \nsize and comparable across Member States.\n\n\u2022 Non-response computed according to one \ninternationally accepted standard across all \nparticipating Member States.\n\n\u2022 Non-response bias estimated in a stand-\nard fashion across all participating Member \nStates.\n\n\u2022 List of sampling management systems used; \nindication of risk due to possible differences \nin fieldwork across Member States due to \nuse of different sampling management sys-\ntems.\n\n\u2022 List of CATI systems used; indication of risk in \nusing different CATI systems.\n\n\u2022 List of the interview staff composition (age, \ngender, education) for each Member State; \n\nindication of risk due to different staff com-\nposition.\n\n\u2022 Documentation of translation process and \noutcomes; indication of risk involved due to \ntranslation or adaptation.\n\nData checks were carried out on the pre-test \ndata then on the soft launch. Completed inter-\nviews were checked during and after fieldwork. \nPhone files of the population under study had \nto meet established quality standards, includ-\ning checking for missing or erroneous data, fil-\ntering, interview duration, duplicates, straight \nliners, cross-consistency, outliers and non-re-\nsponses.\n\nThe data-collection system was computerised. \nFieldwork and sample quotas were closely mon-\nitored throughout, with regular data checks \nduring the fieldwork.\n\nInterviewers attended an in-depth briefing. \nSupervisors then conducted quality control dur-\ning the fieldwork by listening to interviews and \nproviding the interviewers with feedback. Thor-\nough data cleaning took place after the field-\nwork.\n\nAn important indicator of the survey quality is \nthe effective RR: higher RRs ensure more accu-\nracy in the survey. The RR was satisfactory in \nmost cases using the two estimation proce-\ndures (see Section 5 for detail).\n\nDuring the assessment stage, data were vali-\ndated through an in-depth statistical analysis, \nfocusing on the following aspects.\n\n\u2022 Error detection and debugging data file.\n\n\u2022 Analysis of missing values.\n\n\u2022 Data filtering.\n\n\u2022 Analysis of reliability, validity and robustness.\n\n\n\nQuality control\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality26\n\n6.1.  Error detection and \ndebugging data file\n\nThe first step was to examine each data file \nfor possible errors and inconsistencies in \nresponses. Two strategies were used.\n\n\u2022 Study the frequency of each variable in the \ndataset to check for values outside the range.\n\n\u2022 Create contingency tables using filter ques-\ntions to detect whether the respondent had \nanswered non-applicable questions.\n\nOnce the datasets in each Member State were \ndebugged, verified and edited, the second step \nwas to merge all of the files into a single data-\nbase. In this database, a new variable referenc-\ning the cluster was introduced, with the fol-\nlowing labels: 1 \u2018Northwestern\u2019; 2 \u2018Southern\u2019; 3 \n\u2018Eastern\u2019; and 4 \u2018Nordic\u2019.\n\n6.2. Analysis of missing values\n\nOne of the most common problems in data \nanalysis is missing data. Missing values are part \nof research work but responses are missing in \nsome of the variables, i.e. the responses of the \nsame participant are available in some varia-\nbles but missing in others. The missing values \nare usually caused by unknown processes, for \ninstance, respondents do not want to answer \ncertain questions or do not have sufficient \nknowledge to answer. These data are collected \nwithin the category do not know (DK) or not \navailable (NA).\n\nAs Table 9 shows, most of the variables do not \npresent high percentages of missing values \n(DK/NA category). Q22a shows the highest per-\ncentage (23.2 %), as this item asks for monthly \nincome. Since it may be regarded as a very \npersonal issue, respondents are more likely to \nrefuse to answer.\n\nTable 9.

Data filtering\n\nFilter questions are asked prior to some ques-\ntions so as to avoid addressing those questions \nto respondents to whom they do not apply. \nResponses allow for the selection or classifica-\ntion of respondents (Kn\u00e4uper, 1998). Informa-\ntion from filter questions cannot be regarded \nas missing values, as the non-response is not \na random phenomenon.\n\nThe design of the questionnaire included some \nfilter questions to determine the respondents \naffected by the question and their perceptions \nof their direct experiences with the services \nat issue. The data show that respondents who \nhave access to services value them differently \nfrom those without access.\n\nQ5, Q8, Q14 and Q16 are filter questions. Some \nfilters are unavoidable; for example, a sur-\nvey could not ask about the number of hours \ndevoted to paid work (Q17) to respondents who \nhad already stated they were not engaged in \nany paid work in Q5. Other filters (mainly those \nconcerned with Q8 and the most substantial \npart of the research: Q9a, Q9b and Q10) were \ndetermined by the questionnaire designers.\n\nFilter Q8 was introduced as methodological \nchoice, based on the presumption that only \npeople with direct experience of using a ser-\nvice can evaluate its importance to their lives. \nAn analysis of the questions affected by filter \nQ8 shows that questions related to services \u2013 3 \n(health services and medical centres), 11 (light-\ning), 6 (footpaths and walkways) and 7 (parks \nand gardens) show a percentage of non-re-\nsponse around 12-17 %. Service 8 (public trans-\nport) shows about 25 % non-response, while \nservices 9 (cultural centres) and 10 (sport) are \nclose to 50 %. However, services 2 (nursery \nschools for children between 3 years old and \nmandatory school age), 1 (nursery schools for \nchildren under 3 years old), 4 (centres for older \npersons) and 5 (centres for people with disabil-\nities) non-response rates are above 70 %, 80 % \nor 90 % (see Table 10), which represents very \nhigh sampling error (beyond +/- 5 %).\n\nThe analyses are conducted with the sample of \nindividuals who responded. The survey results \ngeneralise this available subpopulation ref-\nerence. Logically, the error is greater, and the \nsample size and the accuracy of the estimates \nlower (see Table 11).\n\nTable 10.

Analysis of reliability, validity \nand robustness\n\nOnce data quality has been guaranteed, other \ndata requirements must be safeguarded: relia-\nbility, validity and robustness. Reliability is the \noverall consistency of a measure. Although reli-\nability does not ensure validity, a lack of reliabil-\nity limits validity. As for validity, it would prove \nthat the measurements used are well-founded \nand correspond accurately to the real world (i.e. \nmeasuring what they claim to measure). Finally, \nrobustness ensures that a small fraction of data, \nsuch as outliers, does not affect the results.\n\nReliability is the overall consistency of a meas-\nure. A measure is said to have a high reliability \nif it produces similar results under consistent \nconditions. Due to the nature of the questions \nand the context, multi-item measures were the \nfocus. Multi-item measure reliability was meas-\nured with Cronbach\u2019s Alpha (see Tables 11.1 and \n11.2 in Annex 2) in order to check the internal \nconsistency. Following a well-known proce-\ndure, corrected item-total correlation was also \nchecked. Based on the results, it can be con-\ncluded that the multi-item scale Q12 is a reliable \nmeasure.\n\nThe concept of validity can be split into three dif-\nferent aspects: content validity, criterion validity \nand construct validity.\n\n\u2022 Content validity refers to the extent to which \na measure represents all facets of a given \nsocial construct. It requires the use of rec-\nognised subject-matter experts to evaluate \nwhether test items assess the defined con-\ntent. As the questionnaire was developed by \nsubject matter experts, the different concepts \nmeasured in the questionnaire could reasona-\nbly be expected to have content validity.\n\n\u2022 Criterion validity is a measure of how well one \nvariable or set of variables predicts an out-\ncome based on information from other vari-\nables.\n\n\u2022 Construct validity is \u2018the degree to which \na test measures what it claims, or purports, to \nbe measuring\u2019 (Brown, 1996). A single study \ndoes not prove construct validity. Rather, it is \na continuous process of evaluation, re-evalu-\nation, refinement and development. Correla-\ntions that fit the expected pattern contribute \nevidence of construct validity. Correlations \namong the constructs are provided in Annex \n2 (Tables 11.3 to 11.14). Instead of checking for \nall possible correlations (a matrix of 154 \u00d7 154), \nattention was paid to those constructs that \nwere expected to be related. As it can be \nseen in the tables, all of the correlations fit \nthe expected pattern. For example, Table 29 \nshows that all measures of satisfaction and \nhappiness are significantly correlated.\n\nTable 11. Sampling error of a proportion with a confidence level of 2\u03c3 and P=Q\n\nNumber of respondents % Sampling error (+/-)\n\nQ9a_1 890 3.35\nQ9a_2 1 370 2.70\nQ9a_3 4 719 1.46\nQ9a_4 831 3.47\nQ9a_5 445 4.74\nQ9a_6 4 683 1.46\nQ9a_7 4 501 1.49\nQ9a_8 4 005 1.58\nQ9a_9 2 963 1.84\nQ9a_10 2 858 1.87\nQ9a_11 4 641 1.47\n\n\n\nQuality control\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality30\n\nRobustness refers to the extent to which \na change in the sample entails a big change in \nthe parameters. The database can be analysed \nto check how the elimination of outliers changes \nthe parameters in order to evaluate its robust-\nness. Robust statistics can be used to ensure \ngood performance for data drawn from a wide \nrange of probability distributions.\n\nOutliers were identified in a previous stage. Anal-\nyses without the outliers are replicated. Outliers \nwere found in the following variables: Q15, Q17, \nQ18, Q19 and Q20.\n\nIn order to facilitate comparisons of changes in \nthe parameters, previous results are included in \nAnnex 2 (see Table 30). For example, when 32 \noutliers are eliminated, the mean of Q15 goes \nfrom 1.80 to 1.74 while the median does not \nchange. With data from 1 845 interviewees, this \nchange in the mean can be considered small. \nMeanwhile, 391 outliers of 2 837 cases were \neliminated for Q17. In this case, although the \n\nmedian remains equal, the mean changes from \n39.21 to 40.17. This change can nevertheless be \nconsidered as small. In summary, the data are \nconsidered robust.\n\n6.5. Links to other sources\n\nThe possibility to link the results obtained in this \nsurvey to those provided by other sources is an \nadditional tool to assess the quality of the data. \nThe fourth European quality of life survey (EQLS) \ncarried out by the European Foundation for the \nImprovement of Living and Working Conditions \n(Eurofound) could be used to benchmark how \nrespondents rate the quality of two relevant \npublic services: health and transport.\n\nTable 12 and Table 13 show that, despite EIGE\u00b4s \nsurvey providing higher rates than the Euro-\nfound survey, the ranks by gender and cluster \nare exactly the same in both sources. Therefore, \ntheir consistency is assured.\n\nTable 12.

Weighting\nIn this survey-based research, the selected sam-\nple size was proportional to the size of the adult \npopulation in every participating Member State. \nIn particular, in each Member State, the sample \nsize for the survey was 0.0001 % of the popula-\ntion size. The sample size of each Member State \nthus acts as an implicit weighting factor in the \nanalyses and it is not necessary to use addi-\ntional weights in the microdata to ensure that \nthe sample is representative of the EU.\n\nThe sample was selected proportionally to age \n(18-39, 40-64 and \u2265 65) and gender. As it was \na random selection of cases in each Member \nState, some discrepancies may have occurred \nbetween the age and gender distribution of the \nsample and that of the population. In order to \ndetermine the reach of these discrepancies by \nMember State, the percentage distribution by \ngender and age of the sample was calculated and \ncompared to their distribution in the population.\n\nTable 37 (Annex 3) shows the percentage dis-\ntributions, where the unweighted percentage \n(\u2018u (%)\u2019) refers to the proportion of the sample \nthat belonged to that category, whereas the \nweighted percentage (\u2018w (%)\u2019) is the proportion \nof the population belonging to that category. \n\nFor instance, the percentage of men aged 18-39 \nwas 20.24 % and 17.38 % in the Austrian sample \nand population, respectively.\n\nColumns \u2018u (%)\u2019 and \u2018w (%)\u2019 reveal the extent of \nthe discrepancy/similarity between sample and \npopulation percentages, by Member State.\n\nIt is worth noting the lack of 18-39 male respond-\nents in Luxembourg and Malta, even though \nthe percentage of this part of the population is \n19.60 % and 19.74 %, respectively.\n\nTable 38 (Annex 3) shows a percentage distribu-\ntion similar to that in Table 1, but with data dis-\naggregated by sex and labour status (employed \nvs unemployed). It was a prerequisite that 30 % \nof respondents should be employed. Table 38 \nreveals the extent of compliance with the crite-\nrion in every MS, by gender.\n\nFinally, Table 39 (Annex 3) includes the per-\ncentage distribution of rural, intermediate and \nurban areas in the sample and the population \nof each Member State. It was a prerequisite that \n30 % of respondents should live in rural areas. \nTable 39 reveals the extent of compliance with \nthe criterion in every MS, by gender.\n\n\n\nFinal database\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality32\n\n8. Final database\n\n(18) Requests should be sent to eige.sec@eige.europa.eu\n\n8.1. Micro and macro data\n\nThe analysis of results may be carried out \naccording to gender (female, male) and age \ngroup (18-39, 40-64, and \u2265 65) at European level \nand at cluster level, with the exception of some \ncases in Q9 and Q10.\n\nTable 1 provides information on the sample \nsizes, both planned and final. Due to the filter \nquestion (Q8), some variables (Q9, Q10, Q11) \nhave insufficient data to perform the analysis by \ncluster or Member State within an acceptable \nerror level.\n\nAnnex 4 provides the sampling errors of a pro-\nportion of each question at Member State, clus-\nter and EU-28 level, highlighting in green the \ncases with a sampling error that could be con-\nsidered acceptable (\u2264  5 %).\n\nIn some exceptional cases where the sample size \nis adequate for some items, depending on gen-\nder, sufficiently precise estimates could be cal-\nculated at Member State level. A rule of thumb \ncould be to accept a sample size where it has at \nleast 50 respondents in each category of interest.\n\nThe fact that this database only provides infor-\nmation for people with direct experience of the \nservices evaluated is not a drawback. Rather, \nthese data are highly valuable, as evaluations \nof the services are based on personal experi-\nence rather than on others\u2019 experience, word of \nmouth or intuitive inferences. Users with direct \nexperience of the services analysed are likely \nto have clear perceptions and thus provide an \naccurate evaluation of the services. Drawing \nconclusions from the overall population is not \npossible, but drawing conclusions from service \nusers certainly is.\n\nThe database at cluster and EU level is availa-\nble on request in SPSS format (.sav) (18). The file \n\nincludes all of the questions in the questionnaire, \naccompanied by additional contextual informa-\ntion (see Section 9 for description). The aggrega-\ntion of the scale and ordinal variables was done \nusing the arithmetic mean, while the nominal \nvariables (Q8, Q14 and Q16) were aggregated \nthrough the median.\n\n8.2. Contextual information\n\nPerceptions of context are useful where indi-\nviduals elaborate on the subjective perceptions \nthat an ad hoc survey aims to measure. To facil-\nitate testing the impact of the context, the data-\nbase includes a set of macro indicators that aim \nto reconstruct the economic, health and polit-\nical environments of each cluster, with special \nreference to gender inequality.\n\nThat system of context indicators (SCI) was \ncompiled through different data sources and is \nstructured according to the following indicator \nareas (see Annex 5):\n\n\u2022 income and income distribution\n\u2022 labour market\n\u2022 gender\n\u2022 transport\n\u2022 social expenditure\n\u2022 crime and corruption\n\u2022 environment\n\u2022 culture\n\u2022 violence against women.\n\nIncome and income distribution\n\nIncome and income distribution contain GDP at \nmarket prices and per capita GDP, which allows \nfor a measure of the income of each Member \nState.

The area was introduced \nto analyse how Member States/clusters charac-\nterised by different degrees of gender equality \ncan show different degrees of satisfaction in the \nuse and access to infrastructure that are con-\nsidered to be particularly important from a gen-\nder perspective.\n\nTable 15. Indicators included in gender\n\nIndicator Year Source\n\nGender Equality Index 2012 EIGE\nWork domain in the Gender Equality Index 2012 EIGE\nMoney domain in the Gender Equality Index 2012 EIGE\nKnowledge domain in the Gender Equality \nIndex\n\n2012 EIGE\n\nTime domain in the Gender Equality Index 2012 EIGE\n\nIndicator Year Source\n\nPower domain in the Gender Equality Index 2012 EIGE\nHealth domain in the Gender Equality Index 2012 EIGE\nGender wage gap 2013 Eurostat\n\nThe Gender Equality Index is produced by EIGE and \ncontains six core domains \u2013 work, money, knowl-\nedge, time, power and health \u2013 and two satellite \ndomains \u2013 violence against women and intersect-\ning inequalities \u2013 that are considered important to \nthe European policy framework (EIGE, 2015).\n\nThe dataset included the single summary meas-\nure (Gender Equality Index) and the indicators \nof the core domains, referenced to 2012. The \nvalues range from 0 to 1, where 1 can be con-\nsidered complete gender equality and 0 com-\nplete gender inequality.\n\nThe gender wage gap is the unadjusted gender pay \ngap, computed as the difference between average \ngross hourly earnings of male paid employees and \nfemale paid employees as a percentage of aver-\nage gross hourly earnings of male paid employ-\nees. The reference population consists of all paid \nemployees in enterprises with 10 employees or \nmore. Account must be taken of Member States \ncharacterised by lower and non-randomly selected \nfemale employment, as the unadjusted gender \npay gap can underestimate the gap obtained by \nproperly accounting for the non-random selection \nof women into employment. This finer indicator \nwas not available for all of the Member States in \nthe sample, thus the research unit used the gen-\nder pay gap indicator described above.\n\nTransport\n\nGeneral government expenditure in transport \nas a percentage of GDP (Eurostat, gov_10a_exp).\n\nSocial expenditure\n\nExpenditure as a percentage of GDP was \nincluded in the following.\n\n\u2022 Social protection (expenditure on social pro-\ntection includes social benefits that consist of \ntransfers, in cash or in kind, to households \nand individuals to relieve them, including: \n\n\n\nFinal database\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality34\n\nsickness/healthcare; disability; old age; sur-\nvivors; family/children; unemployment; hous-\ning; social exclusion not classified elsewhere).\n\n\u2022 Housing (including interventions by public \nauthorities to help households to meet the \ncost of housing).\n\n\u2022 Family/children (support, except healthcare, \nin connection with the costs of pregnancy, \nchildbirth, childrearing and caring for other \nfamily members).\n\n\u2022 Disability (social expenditure on disability, \nincluding pensions).\n\nEnvironment expenditure\n\nTotal general government expenditure on \nenvironment as a percentage of GDP, from \nthe Eurostat database on general govern-\nment expenditure by function (COFOG) [Code: \ngov_10a_exp].\n\nCulture expenditure\n\nAs a context variable, heterogeneity in cul-\ntural expenditure by government was taken \ninto account by including the total government \nexpenditure in recreation, culture and religion \n(GF08) as a percentage of GDP, from Eurostat \ndatabase on the general government expend-\niture by function (COFOG) [Code: gov_10a_exp].\n\nViolence against women\n\nWomen who have experienced physical and/or \nsexual violence by a current and/or previous part-\nner or by any other person since the age of 15 \nwere included, from the European Union Agency \nfor Fundamental Rights (FRA) (2014) ad hoc sur-\nvey. More information on the problems that can \narise in the violence against women indicators \ncan be found in EIGE (2015).\n\nCorruption and crime\n\nThis area includes a set of indicators on the \ndegree of corruption and civicness in the Mem-\nber State and statistics on perceptions of crime \nand violence.\n\nThe Corruption Perception Index by Transpar-\nency International expresses the perceived level \nof public-sector corruption on a scale of 0 (highly \ncorrupt) to 100 (very clean).\n\nThis section includes indicators produced by the \nWorld Bank on voice and accountability, govern-\nment effectiveness, and the control of corrup-\ntion within the Worldwide Governance Indicators \n(WGI) project.\n\nVoice and accountability is based on the percep-\ntions of the extent to which European residents \nare able to participate in selecting their govern-\nment, as well as freedom of expression, freedom \nof association, and a free media. The index ranges \nfrom \u2013 2.5 to 2.5, where the highest value shows \nbetter voice and accountability achievement.\n\nGovernment effectiveness reflects perceptions of \nthe quality of public services, the quality of the \ncivil service and the degree of its independence \nfrom political pressure, the quality of policy for-\nmulation and implementation, and the credibility \nof the government\u2019s commitment to such policies.\n\nThe control of corruption indicators reflects per-\nceptions of the extent to which public power is \nexercised for private gain, including both petty \nand grand forms of corruption, as well as \u2018cap-\nture\u2019 of the state by elites and private interests.\n\nHealth\n\nThis section includes healthy life years (HLYs) in \nabsolute value at birth indicator (Eurostat), dis-\naggregated by gender. It measures the number \nof years that a person \u2013 at birth \u2013 is expected \nto live in a healthy condition. As a context varia-\nble, heterogeneity in health expenditure was also \ntaken into account by including the related total \ngovernment expenditure as a percentage of GDP.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBenefits of gender equality through infrastructure provision: an EU-wide survey 35\n\n9.

Each one of those populations is \ndefined according to various criteria of similar-\nity such as cultural, historical, geographical or \nlinguistic nature.\n\nEffective response rate: actual proportion \nof individuals who have finally responded to \na questionnaire about the total number of indi-\nviduals in that population.\n\nExpected response rate: proportion of individ-\nuals expected to answer a questionnaire about \nthe total number of individuals in that population.\n\nNon-response bias: error committed when \nsome sample individuals do not respond to \nthe questionnaire. In order to avoid this bias, \na reserve sample is usually planned. However, \nthis does not prevent that there is finally some \nerror as a consequence of this non-response.\n\nOutliers: observation in a dataset which value \nis significantly different from the rest, distorting \nthe analysis of the dataset. In some cases, its \norigin is due to a measurement error.\n\nPearson correlation coefficient: it measures \nlinear association between two variables. Neg-\native values correspond to decreasing linear \n\nassociations and positive values increasing lin-\near associations. The value 0 means no linear \ncorrelation. The closer it gets to -1 or 1 the \nmore intense the linear correlation is.\n\nSampling error: difference between the true \nvalue of a certain parameter and the estimate \nresulting from applying sampling methods. It is \ntherefore the error of investigating a part of the \npopulation rather than the whole population.\n\nStatistical significance: it refers to a result sup-\nported by a large empirical evidence or sup-\nported by a large probability.\n\nStratification: In social studies, it is common to \nclassify individuals in a population into groups \nor strata according to some criterion. The indi-\nviduals in each stratum, according to this crite-\nrion, are homogeneous among themselves and \nheterogeneous with respect to the individuals \nof the rest of the strata. In the current study, \nindividuals from the same Member State can \nbe divided into several strata according to their \nage and age group.\n\nStratified probabilistic sample: it consists \nof applying mechanisms of random selection \nof individuals from each of the strata inde-\npendently.\n\n\n\nGETTING IN TOUCH WITH THE EU\n\nIN PERSON\nAll over the European Union there are hundreds of Europe Direct information centres.
