PES Network Mission The core purpose of the PES Network is to promote modernisation of PES, assisting them in adapting their role and function contributing to implementation of the Union\u2019s employment policies. This will also help implement the principles in the European Pillar of Social Rights, contribute to the European Green Deal objectives and pursue the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. It will achieve this through strengthening and encouraging cooperation between PES, thereby increasing their capacity to enhance labour market function, boost labour demand, increase labour supply and skills and facilitate matching between jobseekers and employers. 2. PES Network Vision The Network vision is to be the vehicle for enhanced European PES cooperation enabling them to deliver their role as labour market conductors, contributing to European employment strategies, improving labour market function and integration and creating better balanced labour markets.   In 2017, the PES Network made a formal contribution to the consultation on the European Pillar of Social Rights1. In 2018, it elaborated a working paper on the Future of Work2. These activities presented an opportunity for the Network to consider how its PES 2020 strategy might be adapted to ensure it remains fit for purpose as PES seek to meet the new challenges of a rapidly changing labour market.  This strategy3, to be updated in 2021, looks beyond 2020 and presents a common view of                                                            1 http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=16870&langId=en  2 https://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=20524&langId=en   3 http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=9690&langId=en  the evolving role of PES, while considering the differences in institutional settings, objectives, product portfolios and the structures of individual European PES. Finally, it provides a description of the operational impact for PES, underlining the need to follow pathways of change to achieve the strategic reorientation of PES. It puts an emphasis on recent developments on the labour markets including emerging platform economies and \u201cnonstandard\u201d forms of work, and on labour shortages including increased (workforce) mobility. Moreover, a focus is on a more heterogeneous PES customer base. The need for PES making use of (new) digital technologies and harvesting richer data sources as well as for co-production and strengthening the conducting function is also highlighted in the new version. 3. PES Network Mandate Articles 4 and 5 of the Decision (amended in 2020) establishing the PES Network provide it with an official mandate to foster realisation of the PES Network vision through: \u25cf Contributing to modernising and strengthening PES in key areas, in view of the Union\u2019s employment and social policies, and having in mind the European Pillar of Social Rights, the European Green Deal and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as challenges related to digitalisation, the changing world of work and work patterns as well as demographic changes \u25cf Developing and implementing Union-wide evidence based Benchlearning to compare the performance of PES  \u25cf Providing mutual assistance through cooperation between members of the Network                                                                                      http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=16870&langId=enhttps://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=20524&langId=enhttp://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=9690&langId=en 8  \u25cf Initiating co-operation with relevant labour market stakeholders, including both public and private partners  \u25cf Preparing reports at the request of the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, or on its own initiative4  \u25cf Contributing to the implementation of relevant policy initiatives  \u25cf Adopting and implementing its annual Work Programme  \u25cf Promoting and sharing best practices on the identification of NEETs5. In addition, the Youth Guarantee (YG) Council Recommendation (reinforced in 2020)6 specifically mentions the PES Network\u2019 role in awareness-raising and dissemination of results and good practice examples among Member States. Also, the Council Recommendation on the integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market7 calls on the PES Network to contribute to the monitoring of its implementation. The PES Network also provides support to the implementation of PES-related Country-specific Recommendations. 4. PES benchlearning The core of PES Network activities is the development and implementation of a European-wide PES Benchlearning system. Benchlearning is defined in the PES Network Decision as the \u2018process of creating a systematic and integrated link between benchmarking and mutual learning activities that consists of identifying good performances through indicator-based benchmarking                                                            4 http://ec.europa.eu/social/PESknowledgecentre  5 http://ec.europa.eu/social/PESpractices  6 https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1079&langId=en  7 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016H0220%2801%29&qid=1456753373365  systems [\u2026] and of using findings for tangible and evidence-informed mutual learning activities, including good or best practice models\u2019. The funding of the Benchlearning is foreseen under the European Social Fund+ (2021-2027)8. 5. Priorities of the 2021 PES Network Work Programme  Benchmarking In 2021, the quantitative assessment of the PES benchmarking will continue as in previous years. As to the qualitative assessments, the third cycle of adapted assessments started in 2020 but was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and will continue online in 2021 after two pilot online assessments were successfully held in 2020. These assessments will focus on change made since the first two cycles, and a new section on risk and crisis management. Identification of 2021 Mutual Learning activities Mutual learning activities aim to strengthen PES performance and modernisation by building upon the Benchlearning results. 2018 marked the end point of the second cycle of Benchlearning. In addition to the Benchlearning site visit reports, PES also produced Change Agenda Reports that highlighted the priority areas for change following the first and second cycle Benchlearning site visit.                                                              8 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:382:FIN  http://ec.europa.eu/social/PESknowledgecentrehttp://ec.europa.eu/social/PESpracticeshttps://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1079&langId=enhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016H0220%2801%29&qid=1456753373365https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016H0220%2801%29&qid=1456753373365https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016H0220%2801%29&qid=1456753373365https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:382:FINhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:382:FIN 9  The process for developing the 2021 PES Network Work Programme was based on three main sources: \u25cf Outcomes of the 2020 Work Programme, which included four main thematic clusters, which continue in 2021 with a strong focus on recovery. \u25cf Additional subjects brought up by the PES, including information received in the monthly update of PES responses to the COVID-19 crisis delivered. \u25cf Requests from the European Institutions to the PES Network. Feedback and suggestions were received from the Advisers for European PES Affairs (AFEPAs) and discussed in its meetings on 15 October and 12 November 2020. These were incorporated into the 2021 PES Network Work Programme below. The Heads of PES adopted the 2021 PES Network Work Programme during the Board meeting on 7-8 December 2020.  Following the adoption of this systematic approach, the 2021 PES Network Work Programme has been prepared to reflect key strategic and operational themes of especial relevance to PES, thereby assisting their modernisation programmes. The events address macro-organisational issues including PES performance management, and organisational awareness of the future world of work, digitalisation and the green economy. The Work Programme also specific practitioner issues including PES service delivery. Individual learning events will therefore enable participation from staff at different levels within PES both with senior steering, and operational delivery functions. All activities will be organised online until further notice, due to the travel restrictions and the pandemic situation. The PES Network Work Programme presented herewith will remain a living document, which can be adjusted according to changing priorities of the Board or a changing situation on the European labour market.  10   "}]}
