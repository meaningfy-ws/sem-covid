This will facilitate a set-up month in December 2020, for example: commencement of staff recruitment and 18 months project activity.\r\rThere are three measures under which an organisation can apply:\r\r* Measure 1: Access to employment, self-employment and training/education supports for family carers\r* Measure 2: Initiatives to support and develop young carers\r* Measure 3: Access to employment and self-employment for people with a disability\r\rNational organisations may apply for a grant ranging from \u20ac75,000 to \u20ac200,000.\rLocal organisations may apply for a grant that ranges from \u20ac20,000 up to \u20ac50,000.\rFor national organisations applying for both Measure 1 (family carers) and Measure 2 (young carers) the maximum grant paid is \u20ac200,000.\r\rThe revised measure expands the remit for whom funding can be given to. Prior to COVID-19 the dormant accounts fund was used for people with visual impairment and/or hearing loss.

The \u201cAccess to Employment and Self-Employment for People with a Disability\u201d measure will focus on providing practical support to these people so they can avail of opportunities to start employment, create their own employment and stay supported while they are in work.

The Dormant Accounts Acts 2001-2012, together with the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003, provide a framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts in credit institutions (that is, banks, building societies and An Post) and unclaimed life assurance policies in insurance undertakings.                The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account or policy holders with their funds in credit institutions or insurance undertakings and in this regard, these bodies are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies.                In order to utilise the unused funds in dormant accounts and unclaimed policies to best use, the legislation also introduced a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed from dormant accounts and unclaimed policies for the purposes of measures to assist:                \tthe personal and social development of people who are economically or socially disadvantaged\tthe educational development of people who are educationally disadvantaged\tpeople with a disability                The main income supports provided by the Department of Social Protection for carers or people with disabilities are Carer\u2019s Allowance, Carer\u2019s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, the Carer\u2019s Support Grant and Disability Allowance. The total estimated expenditure on these schemes for 2020 is in excess of \u20ac3 billion.
