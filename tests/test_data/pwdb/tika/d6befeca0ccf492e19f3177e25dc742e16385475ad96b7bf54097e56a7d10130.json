In this context, GEO no. 131/2020 solves a series of existing salary inequities between the specialised medical-sanitary staff and the public servants employed in these institutions, although they are all directly involved in actions to stop the spread of the pandemic. Also, the regulations of GEO 131/2020 take into consideration the large volume of work that the staff of the public health departments and of the prefect's institutions must perform in the context of the current pandemic (being necessary to work overtime), and the insufficient number of employees in these institutions.", "content_of_measure_description": "Civil servants employed in the public health directorates and prefect's institutions, involved in missions to prevent and combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, benefit - starting with August 2020 - from a 30% increase in the basic salary, during the state of alert. The exceptions are the Executive Director and the Deputy Executive Directors of the Public Health Directorates, who will receive a 40% salary increase. The staff of the prefect's institutions that will benefit from the increase is established by prefect's order at the motivated proposal of the direct chief, from which should result the activity and the way of involvement in preventing and combating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and which posed an additional risk or a larger workload. The provisions of this emergency ordinance apply during the alert state.", "use_of_measure_description": "Not known.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "The representatives of the Economic and Social Council, a body with a consultative role regarding the activity of the Government and the Parliament, had different opinions in connection with this legislative act.
