These include the closure of its manufacturing plant in Tunisia which will remain shut until the curfew in that country is lifted. Furthermore, all Bortex and Gagliardi retail stores both in Malta as well as overseas will remain closed until health authorities in each market give the green light to re-open.\u00a0Group CEO Peter Borg said that the Maltese production facility will focus exclusively on the production of face masks and medical scrubs to support the Maltese healthcare authorities as well as to supply private organisations with their needs to the full extent that this will be possible. Borg said that the local production capacity is expected to reach anywhere between 20,000 and 30,000 pieces per month.\u00a0Bortex is Malta\u2019s longest established and most respected name in formal men\u2019s tailoring. Maltese entrepreneur Sunny Borg established the company in 1964.
