currently halved - rise to 60% of pre-coronavirus rates in OctoberBy Ingrid MileyIndustry and Employment CorrespondentAer Lingus pilots, whose pay has been halved due to the Covid-19 emergency, will see earnings gradually recover to 80% of normal by April if they accept proposals in a ballot by their union F\u00f3rsa/IALPA.However, SIPTU said it was \"unacceptable\" that the pilots had been given time to hold a ballot on their crisis proposals, while non-pilot unions had been denied that right.Under the pilots' deal, in return for certain changes they will see their pay - currently halved like the rest of the workforce - rise to 60% of pre-coronavirus rates in October.In January it will increase to 70%, and in April it will hit 80%.As\u00a0with other Aer Lingus grades, where staff work for less than half their hours due to a lack of business, any \"overpayments\" will be recouped when the airline recovers.It is understood that one pilot briefing document stated: \"Once pay increases, it cannot decrease even if work drops off.\"The Covid Crisis Recovery Plan for ground operations, maintenance and cabin crew finalised on Friday would have preserved pay at 50% (even where activity fell below that level) and averted around 200 planned lay-offs in return for implementation of certain work practice reforms.Any \"overpayments\" would have been recouped when the business recovered, and reward or \"recognition\" payments would also be negotiated at that stage.The company also reserved the right to \"re-visit\" these measures should the situation \"materially deteriorate\".Aer Lingus set a deadline of Monday evening for acceptance, which left no time to ballot members.When F\u00f3rsa insisted on balloting cabin crew on the proposals, the deadline was not met and management withdrew the Recovery Plan proposals.The company is now preparing to implement not just the additional pay cuts (to 30% of normal) and layoffs, but also the contested work practice changes.However, sources suggested the reason the pilots had more time to ballot their members was because they operate to a different monthly payroll system.In a statement, Aer Lingus said that from early on in the management-union discussions, all parties had accepted that public health restrictions would cause the ICTU Group of Unions to have difficulties consulting with and balloting their members in the normal way.\"It was therefore accepted by all parties that the discussion be structured in the form of a document that could be accepted by the Unions rather than requiring a balloting process in the traditional way,\" the company said.\"IALPA informed Aer Lingus at the outset of discussions that it had the capacity to undertake remote consultation and balloting processes. Given this and that discussions with IALPA also clearly impacted on express terms of some existing collective agreements, discussions were structured to produce an agreement\u00a0 to be put to ballot,\" it concluded.SIPTU had been prepared to accept the deal without a ballot due to pressure of time, public health concerns, and to avoid further pay cuts and job losses.However, Transport Divisional Organiser Karan O'Loughlin said it was unacceptable and unfair that the company would give one group more time to go through the democratic process, while putting other workers under the pressure of what now turned out to be an \"arbitrary\" deadline.She urged Aer Lingus to halt the lay-offs planned for next week and re-engage immediately to ensure that workers have the required protections.F\u00f3rsa's ballot of cabin crew members on the Covid Crisis Recovery Plan is proceeding despite the fact that management has withdrawn it - and will conclude this Monday.More stories on\tNews\tIreland\tBusiness\tCoronavirusMore by Ingrid MileyIndustry and Employment CorrespondentWait for non-Covid illness benefit falls to three daysBusinessMore female workers take leave due to caring dutiesIrelandYouth unemployment worsening, according to CSO figuresBusinessLabour Court hearing halted in ex-RT\u00c9 employee caseIrelandF\u00f3rsa warns risk of action over water services deadlineIreland\tWeatherDiscover\tRT\u00c9 Archives\tRT\u00c9 Brainstorm\tHistory\tGaeilge\tRT\u00c9 LearnWatch\tRT\u00c9 Player\tTV\tRT\u00c9 One\tRT\u00c92\tRT\u00c9 News\tRT\u00c9jrListen\tRadio\tPodcasts\tRT\u00c9 Radio 1\tRT\u00c9 2FM\tRT\u00c9 lyric fm\tRT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na GaeltachtaServices\tOrchestras\tRT\u00c9 Weather\tLotto\tCentury Ireland\tRT\u00c9 ShopKids & Teens\tTRT\u00c9\tRT\u00c9jrHelp\tContact\tFeedback\tPolicies and Reports\tComplaints\tTerms & Conditions\tIndividual Rights Guide\tPrivacy Policy\tCookie Policy\t Freedom of Information Information\tAbout RT\u00c9\tTV Licence\tVacancies\tLatest Annual Report\tAdvertise with RT\u00c9\t2rn\tSaorview\tNewsletters\tRT\u00c9 Supporting the ArtsFollow RT\u00c9 \u00a9 RT\u00c9 2021.

The withdrawal of that agreement last Monday was followed by the announcement on Friday that 500 ground staff are to be made redundant, on top of 296 seasonal and catering staff who are also to leave the airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Aer Lingus management has agreed with pilot union IALPA that \"no pilot member will suffer involuntary unpaid leave, lay-off, furlough and/or redundancy\" for the period of the agreement, which runs to the end of September 2021.                                                                                                                                The agreement guarantees all pilots in the company no less than 50pc of their wages. Pilots' pay will then increase to no less than 60pc on or before October 1, 2020, to no less than 70pc on or before January 1, 2021, and will increase to no less than 80pc on or before April 1, 2021.                                                                                                                Pilot pay will return to what it was before the Covid-19 crisis when the period of the proposed agreement ends in September next year.                                                                                                                                A key principle of the agreement is that \"the pay 'savings' from pilots are invested in retaining pilots in employment\".                                                                                                                By contrast, ground staff and cabin crew could see wages fall to just 30pc from today. Siptu was locked in talks with management yesterday in an attempt to resurrect a deal which would have seen wages stay at 50pc but only increase as business at the airline increased.                                                                                                                                The pilots' agreement is subject to ratification by secret ballot of pilots' union IALPA members. By contrast, the cabin crew and ground handling proposals were pulled by the company after Forsa insisted on holding a ballot of cabin crew. Siptu had refused requests from its shop stewards to hold such a ballot, telling them it was too difficult due to Covid-19 and because the company had only given them three days to agree the deal.                                                                                                                Asked why the airline did not agree to allowing for similar ballots by Siptu and Forsa of ground and cabin crew, an Aer Lingus spokeswoman said: \"From early in our discussions, all parties accepted that public health restrictions would cause the ICTU group of unions to have difficulties consulting with and balloting their members in the normal way. It was therefore accepted by all parties that the discussion be structured in the form of a document that could be accepted by the unions rather than requiring a balloting process in the traditional way.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Daily Digest Newsletter            Today's news headlines, directly to your inbox every morning and evening.
