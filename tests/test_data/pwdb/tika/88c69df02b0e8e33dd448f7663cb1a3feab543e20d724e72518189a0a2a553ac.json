However, under the new ruling,\u00a0SSP will be\u00a0paid from day 1, rather than day 4 of an individual's\u00a0absence from work if that person is\u00a0absent from work due to sickness or the\u00a0need to self-isolate caused by COVID-19.

If you are in this group, you will previously have received a letter from the NHS or from your GP telling you this. You may have been advised to shield in the past.This shielding guidance applies to clinically extremely vulnerable individuals only. Others living in a household with someone who is clinically extremely vulnerable are not advised to follow this guidance. They should instead follow the general advice and regulations set out in the national lockdown guidance that came into effect on 5 January 2021.The clinically extremely vulnerable will get priority access to vaccination against COVID-19 before the general population and in line with the priority ordering set by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). You will be contacted again by the NHS with more information on when and how you will be invited to get the vaccine.The vaccine is likely to make an important contribution towards protecting you from COVID-19. Clinically extremely vulnerable people are expected to receive a vaccination against COVID-19 before the general population. Your local NHS will ensure that you can receive the vaccine as safely as possible, as well as any care and support needed. Even if you have had both doses of the vaccine, you should continue to follow this shielding advice, until further notice as we continue to assess the impact of vaccination among all groups. The people you live with should continue to follow the public health rules and guidance as long as they are in place, including if you have received the vaccine and also if they have received the vaccine.What has changedWhilst the national lockdown has been effective and cases of COVID-19 are now falling, the levels of infection in the community remain high and the virus continues to pose a high risk to people across the country.Everyone in England, including those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, is required to follow the new national lockdown guidance, which has been set out by the Government and applies to the whole population. These restrictions:\tRequire people to stay at home, except for specific purposes.\tPrevent people gathering with those they do not live with, except for specific purposes.\tClose certain businesses and venues.\tSupport children and young people to learn remotely until 8 March, except for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers who may still attend school.The new information below includes additional guidance for clinically extremely vulnerable people, to help protect you from COVID-19. We will also write to you with a version of this guidance.These new formal shielding measures will apply across the whole of England until at least 31 March.SocialisingThe new national lockdown guidance, which applies to everyone, means that you must not leave or be outside of your home and garden, except for limited purposes which are set out in that guidance.We are advising clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home as much as possible.You can still go outside for exercise or to attend health appointments, but try to keep all contact with others outside of your household to a minimum, and avoid busy areas.You can still meet with your support bubble \u2013 but you cannot meet others you do not live with unless they are part of your support bubble. Outdoors, you can meet one person from another household for exercise. This is part of the wider national regulations that apply to everyone.Try to stay 2 metres away from other people within your household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate.WorkYou are strongly advised to work from home because the risk of exposure to the virus in your area may currently be higher. If you cannot work from home, then you should not attend work.You may want to speak to your employer about taking on an alternative role or change your working patterns temporarily to enable you to work from home where possible.If you need support to work at home you can apply for Access to Work \u2013 this offers support for the disability-related extra costs of working that are beyond standard reasonable adjustments an employer must provide.If you cannot make alternative arrangements, your employer may be able to furlough you under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which has been extended until the end of April 2021. You should have a conversation with your employer about whether this is possible.As you are being advised not to attend work, you may be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The formal shielding letter you receive can act as evidence for your employer and the Department for Work and Pensions that you are advised to shield and may be eligible for SSP or ESA.Members of the household who are not clinically extremely vulnerable should continue to attend work if they are unable to work from home, in line with the wider rules set out in the national lockdown guidance.Education settingsAs our knowledge of COVID-19 has grown, we now know that very few children and young people are at highest risk of severe illness due to the virus. Doctors have therefore been reviewing all children and young people who were initially identified as clinically extremely vulnerable to confirm whether they are still thought to be at highest risk.If you have already discussed this with your child\u2019s doctors and they have confirmed your child is still considered clinically extremely vulnerable, your child should follow this shielding advice.Under the current national lockdown, children will learn remotely until 8 March, except for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers who may still attend school.Clinically extremely vulnerable children and young people should not attend school or other educational settings, because the risk of exposure to the virus in the community is now very high. Your school or college will make appropriate arrangements for you to be able to continue your education at home.TravelYou are advised to stay at home as much as possible and not to travel unless essential (for example, to attend health appointments).ShoppingYou are advised not to go to the shops. Use online shopping if you can, or ask others to collect and deliver shopping for you (friends and family, local volunteers or NHS Volunteer Responders).You can register to request priority access to supermarket delivery slots, if you do not have someone you can rely on to go shopping for you. If you already have priority access to a supermarket delivery slot, that will continue \u2013 you do not need to do anything further. When registering you will be asked for your NHS number. You can find it on any letter the NHS has sent you, or on a prescription.Registering on the site just gives you priority. It does not mean you\u2019ll definitely get a delivery slot. Once you have registered, in order to receive supermarket deliveries, you will still need to book the delivery slots yourself.If you need other forms of help, including support to register for priority access to supermarket delivery slots, you should contact your local council directly. Find out how your local council can help.Guidance on accessing food and essential supplies during the coronavirus pandemic is available.MedicinesYou are strongly advised not to go to a pharmacy.In the first instance, you should ask if any friends, family or volunteers can collect medicines for you.If friends and family are not able to collect your medicines for you, and you and/or the pharmacy are unable to arrange for a volunteer, then you will be eligible for free medicines delivery. Please contact your pharmacy to inform them that you are clinically extremely vulnerable and need your medicines delivered, and they will arrange this free of charge.Accessing care and supportYou can still receive informal care at home from people within your support bubble if eligible.You can still receive care at home from professional social care and medical professionals.We urge you to continue using the NHS and other health providers for your existing health conditions and any new health concerns.You can access a range of NHS services from home, including ordering repeat prescriptions or contacting your health professional through an online consultation. To find out more visit Health at home or download the NHS App. If you have an urgent medical need, call NHS 111 or, for a medical emergency, dial 999.If you do need to receive care in person, you can. Your local NHS services are well prepared and will put in measures to keep you safe.It is also really important to look after your mental health. Go to the Every Mind Matters website for advice and practical steps that you can take to support your wellbeing and manage your mental health during this pandemic. If you or someone you care for are experiencing a mental health crisis, we urge you to make contact with a local health professional immediately.Any carers or visitors who support you with your everyday needs can continue to visit. This also applies for those of a child or young person in your care. They should follow social distancing guidance where close or personal contact is not required.You should continue to access support from local charities and organisations, as well as NHS Volunteer Responders. As well as helping with shopping and medicines delivery, NHS Volunteer Responders can help with a regular, friendly phone call, and transport to and from health appointments.Call 0808 196 3646 between 8am and 8pm to arrange support or visit NHS Volunteer Responders website.You can also access additional support from your energy supplier. Energy suppliers are required by the regulator, Ofgem, to hold a register of customers in a vulnerable circumstance, called a Priority Service Register. If you are clinically extremely vulnerable you can be added to this register. For information about how to be added to the register and the additional services your supplier can provide you, please visit Ofgem\u2019s website.Registering for additional supportIf you need additional help to follow this guidance, your local council may be able to help. If you are advised to shield you will be able to register yourself or someone else to:\trequest priority access to a supermarket delivery slot (if you have already got priority access that will continue \u2013 you do not need to do anything further)\ttell your council if you need support to follow shielding guidance, especially if you are unable to arrange this yourself or with the help of friends, family or other support networks\tmake sure your details, such as your address, are up to dateWhen registering you will be asked for your NHS number. You can find it on any letter the NHS has sent you, or on a prescription. It is helpful if you register even if you do not have any support needs at this time. You can log in and update your needs if circumstances change at any time.Definition of clinically extremely vulnerable groupsPeople who are defined as clinically extremely vulnerable are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus. There are 3 ways you may be identified as clinically extremely vulnerable:\t    You have one or more of the conditions listed below.  \t    Your clinician or GP has added you to the Shielded Patient List because, based on their clinical judgement, they deem you to be at high risk of serious illness if you catch the virus.  \t    You have been identified through the COVID-19 Population Risk Assessment as potentially being at high risk of serious illness if you catch the virus.  If you do not fall into any of these categories, and have not been contacted to inform you that you are on the Shielded Patient List, follow the national lockdown guidance for the rest of the population.If you think there are good clinical reasons why you should be added to the Shielded Patient List, discuss your concerns with your GP or hospital clinician.People with the following conditions are automatically deemed clinically extremely vulnerable:\tsolid organ transplant recipients\tpeople with specific cancers:    \tpeople with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy\tpeople with lung cancer who are undergoing radical radiotherapy\tpeople with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment\tpeople having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer\tpeople having other targeted cancer treatments that can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors\tpeople who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6 months or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs  \tpeople with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\tpeople with rare diseases that significantly increase the risk of infections (such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), homozygous sickle cell disease)\tpeople on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of infection\tproblems with your spleen, for example splenectomy (having your spleen removed)\tadults with Down\u2019s syndrome\tadults on dialysis or with chronic kidney disease (stage 5)\twomen who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired\tother people who have also been classed as clinically extremely vulnerable, based on clinical judgement and an assessment of their needs. GPs and hospital clinicians have been provided with guidance to support these decisions                          Contents              Print this page                      Is this page useful?

This explains how restrictions will be eased over time.From 8 March some of the rules on what you can and cannot do will be changing.England is still in a national lockdown. You must stay at home, leaving only where permitted by law, and follow the rules in this guidance.NHS Test and Trace:\tensures that anyone who develops symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) can quickly be tested to find out if they have the virus, and also includes targeted asymptomatic testing of NHS and social care staff and care home residents\thelps trace close recent contacts of anyone who tests positive for coronavirus and, if necessary, notifies them that they must self-isolate at home to help stop the spread of the virusWe have introduced this service to help return life more to normal, in a way that is safe and protects our NHS and social care. The service allows us to trace the spread of the virus and isolate new infections and play a vital role in giving us early warning if the virus is increasing again, locally or nationally.How NHS Test and Trace helps fight the virusNHS Test and Trace will help to control the rate of reproduction (R), reduce the spread of the infection and save lives. By playing your part through the actions set out below, you will directly help to contain the virus by reducing its spread. This means that, thanks to your efforts, we will be able to go as far as it is safe to go in easing lockdown measures.Playing your part:\tif you develop symptoms, you must continue to follow the rules to self-isolate with other members of your household and get a test to find out if you have coronavirus\tif you test positive for coronavirus, you must share information promptly and accurately about your recent contacts through NHS Test and Trace to help us alert other people who may need to self-isolate\tif you have had close recent contact with someone who has coronavirus, you must self-isolate if NHS Test and Trace advises you to do so\tif you are returning from travel abroad it is important to check whether you need to self-isolateThis specific guidance applies in England only. All 4 administrations are working closely together to have a consistent and joined-up approach to testing and tracing.Definitions\u2018Self-isolation if you have symptoms\u2019 means you and all household members must remain at home. Do not go outside your home for any reason, that is to work, school or public areas, and do not use public transport or taxis. The guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection page has more information on self-isolation.\u2018Contact\u2019 means a person who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus and who may or may not live with them.It is a legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive for COVID-19 or if you are identified as a contact and told to self-isolate by Test and Trace. Failure to self-isolate for the full time-period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000.How NHS Test and Trace worksPart 1: for someone with symptoms of coronavirus\t    isolate: as soon as you experience coronavirus symptoms, medical advice is clear: you must self-isolate for at least 10 days. Anyone else in your household must self-isolate for 10 days from when you started having symptoms  \t    test: get a free NHS test immediately to check if you have coronavirus or call 119 if you have no internet access  \t    results: if your test is positive, you must complete the remainder of your 10-day self-isolation. Anyone in your household must also complete self-isolation for 10 days from when you started having symptoms. Failure to self-isolate for the full time-period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000. If your test is negative you will no longer be required to self-isolate, though you may wish to do so if you still feel unwell and have symptoms similar to coronavirus. If your test is negative, other household members no longer need to self-isolate.  \t    share contacts: if you test positive for coronavirus, NHS Test and Trace will send you a text or email alert or call you with instructions of how to share details of people with whom you have had close, recent contact and places you have visited. It is important that you respond quickly and accurately so that we can give appropriate advice to those who need it. You will be told to do this online via a secure website or you will be called by one of our contract tracers. If NHS Test and Trace contact tracers are unable to contact you for 24 hours, they may pass your case to your local authority to follow up by phone or in person.  Part 2: if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace  because you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus\t    alert: you will be alerted by NHS Test and Trace if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. The alert will usually come by text, email or phone call. You should then log on to the NHS Test and Trace website, which is normally the easiest way for you and the service to communicate with each other \u2013 but, if not, a trained call handler will talk you through what you must do. Under-18s will get a phone call and a parent or guardian will be asked to give permission for the call to continue  \t    isolate: you will be told to begin self-isolation for 10 days from your last contact with the person who has tested positive. It\u2019s really important to do this even if you don\u2019t feel unwell because you could still be infectious to others. Failure to self-isolate for the full time period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000. Your household doesn\u2019t need to self-isolate with you, if you do not have symptoms, but they must take extra care to follow the guidance on social distancing and handwashing and avoid contact with you at home  \t    test if needed: if you develop symptoms  of coronavirus, other members of your household must self-isolate immediately at home for 10 days and you must get a test to check if you have coronavirus or call 119 if you have no internet access. If your test is positive, you must continue to stay at home for at least 10 days and we will get in touch to ask about your contacts since they must self-isolate. If your test is negative, you must still complete your 10-day self-isolation period because the virus may not be detectable yet \u2013 this is crucial to avoid unknowingly spreading the virus.  The NHS COVID-19 appThe new NHS COVID-19 app, now available to download for free in England and Wales, is the fastest way to see if you\u2019re at risk from coronavirus. The faster you know, the quicker you can alert and protect your loved ones and community.The app has a number of tools to protect you, including contact tracing, local area alerts and venue check-in. It uses proven technology from Apple and Google, designed to protect every user\u2019s privacy.Part 1: people who develop symptoms of coronavirusThis section applies if you have symptoms of coronavirus or you have received a positive test result.When to self-isolateThe medical advice is clear: you must self-isolate if you have coronavirus symptoms or live in the same household as somebody who does. The main symptoms of coronavirus are:\thigh temperature \u2013 this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)\tnew, continuous cough \u2013 this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)\tloss or change to your sense of smell or taste \u2013 this means you\u2019ve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normalFor more information, read the further guidance on symptoms.If you have one or more of these symptoms, you must self-isolate straight away for 10 days \u2013 or longer if you still have symptoms other than cough or loss of sense of smell/taste.If you live in the same household as someone with coronavirus symptoms, you must self-isolate straight away for 10 days.Failure to self-isolate for the full time-period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000.How to get a testAnyone with symptoms can get a coronavirus test, whatever their age.Get a coronavirus testIf you don\u2019t have access to the internet, you can get a test by phoning 119.Our guidance on testing has more information on our testing programme.If you test negativeIf you get a negative test result, this means you are at low risk of having coronavirus.Other members of your household can stop self-isolating. If you feel well and no longer have symptoms similar to coronavirus, you can stop self-isolating. You could still have another virus, such as a cold or flu \u2013 in which case it is still best to avoid contact with other people until you are better.If you test positiveIf you get a positive test result, this means that when you took the test, you had coronavirus. You \u2013 and other members of your household \u2013 must continue to self-isolate.Health and care workersIf you work in a health or care setting, you should follow the separate guidance for health and care workers on testing and when to return to work.Telling people about your test resultIf you develop symptoms, you may wish to alert the people with whom you have had close contact over the last 48 hours. You should tell them that you might have coronavirus but are waiting for a test result.At this stage (until the test result is known), those people do not need to self-isolate, but they should take extra care in practising social distancing and good hygiene, like washing their hands regularly. They should also watch out for their own symptoms.You may want to write down your recent close contacts now so that you have them to hand if you test positive.Sharing information about your recent contactsIf you get a positive test, we will contact you and ask you to share information about any close contacts you had just before or after you developed symptoms. This is vital if we are to stop the spread of the virus.We will contact you by text message, email or phone. If you are under 18 years old, we will contact you by phone wherever possible and ask for your parent or guardian\u2019s permission to continue the call.You will be sent a link to the NHS Test and Trace website and asked to create a confidential account where you can record details about your recent close contacts. If you do not have internet access or if you don\u2019t complete the online process, one of our contact tracers will phone you to gather this information from you.The information you give will be handled in strict confidence and will only be kept and used in line with data protection laws. It will help us to contact people who are at risk of having been exposed to coronavirus and explain what they must do to help prevent the further spread of the virus.Some local authorities have their own contact tracing teams who are employed by the local council. NHS Test and Trace may pass your details to these local teams if you have tested positive for coronavirus and they have not been able to contact you for 24 hours. These teams work with local public health experts and will usually contact you by phone and text. In certain circumstances they may visit you at your home to ask you to make further contact with them or to ask about your contacts.When we contact people to advise them to self-isolate, we do not tell them your identity. But if you have alerted them when you first develop symptoms or when you get your test result, they will be better prepared for the advice we give them.When we contact youIf NHS Test and Trace contacts you, the service will use text messages, email or phone.All texts or emails will ask you to sign into the NHS Test and Trace contact-tracing website.If NHS Test and Trace calls you by phone, the service will be using the phone number 0300 013 5000.All information you provide to NHS Test and Trace is held in strict confidence and will only be kept and used in line with the Data Protection Act 2018.Contact tracers will:\tcall you from 0300 013 5000. Local contact tracers will contact you from a local council number. If you\u2019re unsure if this is genuine, please contact your local council for advice\tsend you text messages from \u2018NHStracing\u2019\task you to sign into the NHS Test and Trace contact-tracing website\task for your full name to confirm your identity, and postcode to offer support while self-isolating\task about the coronavirus symptoms you have been experiencing\task you to provide the name, telephone number and/or email address of anyone you have had close contact with in the 2 days prior to your symptoms starting\task if anyone you have been in contact with is under 18 or lives outside of EnglandContact tracers will never:\task you to dial a premium rate number to speak to us (for example, those starting 09 or 087)\task you to make any form of payment or purchase a product or any kind\task for any details about your bank account\task for your social media identities or login details, or those of your contacts\task you for any passwords or PINs, or ask you to set up any passwords or PINs over the phone\tdisclose any of your personal or medical information to your contacts\tprovide medical advice on the treatment of any potential coronavirus symptoms\task you to download any software to your PC or ask you to hand over control of your PC, smartphone or tablet to anyone else\task you to access any website that does not belong to the government or NHSWhat we will ask youWe will ask you:\tif you have family members or other household members living with you. In line with the medical advice they must remain in self-isolation for the rest of the 10-day period from when your symptoms began\tif you have had any close contact with anyone other than members of your household. We are interested in in the 48 hours before you developed symptoms and the time since you developed symptoms. Close contact means:    \thaving face-to-face contact with someone less than 1 metre away (this will include times where you have worn a face covering or a face mask)\thaving been within 2 metres of someone for more than 15 minutes (either as a one-off contact, or added up together over one day)\ttravelling in a car or other small vehicle with someone (even on a short journey) or close to them on a plane  \tif you work in \u2013 or have recently visited \u2013 a setting with other people (for example, a GP surgery, a school or a workplace). The use of face masks and other forms PPE does not exclude somebody from being considered a close contact, unless they are providing direct care with patients or residents in a health and care settingWe will ask you to provide, where possible, the names and contact details (for example, email address, telephone number) for the people you have had close contact with. As with your own details these will be held in strict confidence and will be kept and used only in line with data protection laws.If NHS Test and Trace identify you as a contact and you work in a critical service where the recommendation for you to self-isolate would have impact on providing that critical service, your employer will need to escalate this to the local health protection team (HPT) for a risk-assessment.How this information is usedBased on the information you provide, we will assess whether we need to alert your contacts and ask them to self-isolate.We may refer the case to local public health experts if your case is complex, for example, if you work in or have recently visited:\ta health or care setting, such as a hospital or care home\ta prison or other secure setting\ta school for people with special needs\tcritical national infrastructure or areas vital for national security\twhen NHS Test and Trace has been unable to contact you after an agreed amount of time and your local authority has set up a system to take over your caseLocal public health experts are Public Health England staff and teams employed by your local authority who work together with all parts of the local community to prevent or respond to local outbreaks.Part 2: people who have had close contact with someone who has coronavirusThis section applies to those who have been identified by NHS Test and Trace as a close contact.If you are told to self-isolateIf we identify you as someone who has had close recent contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, we will notify you that you must self-isolate in line with medical advice and the law.It is a legal requirement to self-isolate if you are identified as a contact and told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. Failure to self-isolate for the full time-period can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000.You may be feeling well and not have any symptoms, but it is still essential for you to follow the advice that you are given.This is because, if you have been infected, you could be infectious to others. Some people infected with the virus don\u2019t show any symptoms at all and it is therefore crucial to self-isolate to avoid unknowingly spreading the virus.If you do not have symptoms, you must not seek a test, as the scientific evidence shows that the test may not be able to detect whether you have the virus.How you will be told to self-isolateIf you are aged 18 or over, we will contact you by text message or email but will follow up by phone if we don\u2019t get a response. If we only have a landline number for you, we will contact you on that number.If you are under 18 years old, we will contact you by phone wherever possible and ask for consent from your parent or guardian to continue the call.If you have internet access, we will ask you to log onto the NHS Test and Trace website. This is the simplest way of giving you the information you need and the opportunity to ask any questions. The online service will also ask you to confirm that you are following the advice on self-isolation.If you do not have internet access, we will arrange for a trained call handler to speak to you by phone to give you the information and advice you need.What happens nextYou must self-isolate for 10 days after you were in contact with the person who has tested positive for coronavirus. This is crucial to avoid unknowingly spreading the virus and failure to do so can result in a fine, starting from \u00a31,000.Self-isolation means staying at home and not going outside your home at any time. If you live with other people, they do not need to self-isolate, but they should avoid contact with you as far as possible and follow advice on hygiene. If you do not live with other people, you should seek help from others, or delivery services, for essential activities such as food shopping. Self-isolation can be particularly challenging if you are looking after children, or if you care for vulnerable people who cannot stay with friends or family.If you go on to develop symptoms, anyone you live with must then self-isolate and you must report your symptoms and get tested.It is crucial that you complete your 10-day self-isolation period if you\u2019ve been identified as a contact, even if you get a negative test result. This is because you may have the virus, but it cannot yet be detected by a test, so you could unknowingly spread the virus if you leave the house. Other members of your household, however, do not need to remain in self-isolation.When we contact youIf NHS Test and Trace contacts you, the service will use text messages, email or phone.All texts or emails will ask you to sign into the NHS Test and Trace contact-tracing website.If NHS Test and Trace calls you by phone, the service will be using the phone number 0300 013 5000.All information you provide to NHS Test and Trace is held in strict confidence and will only be kept and used in line with the Data Protection Act 2018.Contact tracers will:\tcall you from 0300 013 5000\tsend you text messages from \u2018NHS\u2019\task for your full name and date of birth to confirm your identity, and postcode to offer support while self-isolating\task if you are experiencing any coronavirus symptoms\tprovide advice on what you must do as you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirusContact tracers will never:\task you to dial a premium rate number to speak to us (for example, those starting 09 or 087)\task you to make any form of payment or purchase a product of any kind\task for any details about your bank account\task for your social media identities or login details, or those of your contacts\task you for any passwords or PINs, or ask you to set up any passwords or PINs over the phone\tdisclose any of your personal or medical information to your contacts\tprovide medical advice on the treatment of any potential coronavirus symptoms\task you to download any software to your PC or ask you to hand over control of your PC, smartphone or tablet to anyone else\task you to access any website that does not belong to the government or NHSSupport for people who are self-isolatingWe will direct you to your local authority helpline if you need the following during the period of self-isolation:\tpractical or social support for yourself\tsupport for someone you care for\tfinancial supportThis is so you can access the local support available to you, like help delivering food or medicine. You may also be able to get help from the NHS volunteer responders.Employers should support workers who are told to self-isolate and must not ask them to attend work. See the guidance on the NHS Test and Trace service for employers, businesses and workers. If you are in employment, speak to your employer to discuss if you can work from home or other options are available during your period of isolation.Workers in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for every day they are in isolation, as long as they meet the eligibility conditions. Guidance has been produced for employees that are unable to work because they are self-isolating.NHS Test and Trace will provide evidence that someone has been told to self-isolate. This evidence can be shared with an employer or education provider. Get an isolation note if you need evidence that you\u2019ve been told to self-isolate.You may be entitled to a one-off payment of \u00a3500 through the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme if you are required to stay at home and self-isolate. You should go to your local authority\u2019s website for more information. You will be eligible if you live in England and meet all the following criteria:\tyou have been asked to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace\tyou are employed or self-employed\tyou cannot work from home and will lose income as a result\tyou are receiving at least one of the following benefits:    \tUniversal Credit\tWorking Tax Credits\tincome-related Employment and Support Allowance\tincome-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\tIncome Support\tPension Credit\tHousing Benefit  Customer logs and NHS QR codesContinued opening up of the economy and public services is reliant on NHS Test and Trace being used to minimise transmission of the virus. In order to ensure that businesses and local services are able to remain open, we will be mandating that organisations in designated sectors must:\task at least one member of every party of customers or visitors (up to 6 people) to provide their name and contact details\tkeep a record of all staff working on their premises and shift times on a given day and their contact details\tkeep these records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days and provide data to NHS Test and Trace if requested\tdisplay an official NHS QR code poster from 24 September 2020, so that customers and visitors can \u2018check in\u2019 using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details\tadhere to General Data Protection RegulationsIn addition, the hospitality sector will be required to ensure that anyone visiting pubs, restaurants and other venues provides their contact information or checks in using the official NHS QR code before being allowed entry to the venue.Any designated venue that is found not to be compliant with these regulations will be subject to financial penalties. It is vital that relevant venues comply with these regulations to help keep people safe, and to keep businesses open.Designated venues will need to keep records of customers, visitors and staff for a period of 21 days and make them available when requested by NHS Test and Trace or local public health officials to help contain clusters or outbreaks.Find out more about the requirements around maintaining these records.
