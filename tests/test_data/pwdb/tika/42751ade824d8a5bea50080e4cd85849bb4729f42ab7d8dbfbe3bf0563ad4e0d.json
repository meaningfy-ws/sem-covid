Even before the latest economic and social restrictions, official forecasts were projecting a possibility of joblessness shooting up to four million by early next year.\u00a0 As such, pressure was mounting for the government to act. Thus, in a speech to the House of Commons on 24 September, the Chancellor outlined his Winter Economy Plan; central to this was the new Jobs Support Scheme, which is essentially a short-hours working subsidy, similar to the German Kurzarbeit scheme.", "content_of_measure_description": "The new scheme\u00a0will run for six months from the 1 November. Essentially, the government will contribute towards the wages of employees who are working fewer than normal hours. In order to qualify (at least for the first three month of the scheme,\u00a0the employee must work at least 33% of their usual hours - the\u00a0government will review whether to increase the threshold after three months of the scheme's operation).\u00a0 Employees will be able to \u201ccycle on and off\u201d the scheme and do not have to work the same pattern each month. However, each short-time working arrangement must cover a minimum period of seven days.\r\rFor the hours actually worked, employers will continue to pay the employee's usual wages. However, for\u00a0every hour\u00a0not worked, the government and the employer will each pay one third of the equivalent salary.\u00a0The government\u2019s contribution will be capped at GBP 697.92 a month;\u00a0much lower than the cap on the original furlough scheme of GBP 2,500. Because of the requirement to work at least a third of usual hours, the scheme will cover the wages for a maximum of 66.6% of hours not worked. This means that the government contribution is worth 22% of full pay, whilst the employer contribution\u00a0will be 55%. \u00a0As a result \u2013 taking together pay for full hours worked, and state and company subsidised wages for down time \u2013 employees using the scheme will receive at least 77% of their usual pay (unless it is cut down by the government cap of GBP 697.92).\r\rRegarding eligibility, employees under the scheme\u00a0must not be on a redundancy notice, in a step designed to encourage companies to retain staff.\u00a0Indeed, the scheme is\u00a0designed to complement\u00a0the government\u2019s jobs retention bonus, announced by the Chancellor\u00a0in his summer economic update. Under this scheme, businesses receive a one-off payment of GBP 1,000 for every previously furloughed employee they still employ at the end of January 2021.\rThe new scheme will be open to all employers with a UK bank account and part of PAYE. All small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be eligible. However, large businesses must show their business has been adversely affected by COVID-19, with such\u00a0companies needing to demonstrate that\u00a0turnover has fallen by a third.\u00a0The government also stated that it\u00a0expected that large employers would not pay dividends to shareholders while using the scheme.\r\rThe scheme is in part designed to save Government money. The Chancellor outlined in his speech that\u00a0a worker on the furlough scheme gets GBP 1,400 a month on average. In comparison however,\u00a0if that same person was on the job support scheme, the maximum amount of government support they would get would be GBP 300 per month. If a million workers are covered by the new scheme, the Chancellor stated, it would cost the exchequer GBP 300 million per month, whereas the\u00a0furlough scheme has cost almost GBP 40 billion since its launch in March. \r\rHowever, concerns have been voiced as to the scheme's exclusion of workers at companies forced to close because of coronavirus restrictions,\u00a0where no working hours may be possible.\u00a0Moreover, the opposition Labour Party has said that the new scheme incentivises employers in financial trouble to dismiss\u00a0staff by making it more expensive to keep two people on reduced hours than to dismiss one\u00a0and keep the other.\r\r", "use_of_measure_description": "As the scheme is yet to be implemented, the numbers of companies which will take up the subsidy, as well as the numbers of employees who will be covered, is unknown.\r\rIndependent economists put the cost of the chancellor\u2019s Winter Plan in total at around GBP 5 billion, on top of the GBP 160 million already spent by the government. The Chancellor declined to\u00a0put an exact price tag on the package, beyond saying that VAT measures will cost around GBP 800 million and job support about GBP 300 million a month for every 1 million workers enrolled.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "The Chancellor has informally consulted with both the CBI and TUC on employment measures introduced in response to the pandemic. This consultation has been acknowledged by him and the bodies themselves. However, this is not done through formal institutionalised social dialogue fora/mechanisms, because these do not exist in the UK. It is assumed that both bodies have made recommendations as to the design\u00a0of the new scheme and will have lobbied for it initially; however, the nature of their input and the extent to which it has effected the scheme's design, is not known.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "No", "private_or_public_sector": "Not specified", "is_occupation_specific": "No", "actors": ["National government"], "target_groups": ["Employees in standard employment"], "funding": ["Companies", "National funds"], "sectors": [], "occupations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-outlines-winter-economy-plan", "title": "UK Government (2020) Chancellor outlines Winter Economy Plan ", "content_path": "res/82394d81b71aeb3fb6f9e2146305e57d66c5bd67df89e362df5199b3da70e734", "content": "Chancellor outlines Winter Economy Plan - GOV.UK                                          Cookies on GOV.UK                      We use some essential cookies to make this website work.We\u2019d like to set additional cookies to understand how you use GOV.UK, remember your settings and improve government services.We also use cookies set by other sites to help us deliver content from their services.

The primary goal of our economic policy remains unchanged - to support people\u2019s jobs - but the way we achieve that must evolve.Since the beginning of the pandemic, the government has taken swift action to save lives, limit the spread of the disease and minimise damage to the economy.Ministers have introduced one of the most generous and comprehensive economic plans anywhere in the world with over \u00a3190 billion of support for people, businesses and public services - including paying the wages of nearly 12 million people, supporting over a million businesses through grants, loans and rates cuts and announcing the Plan for Jobs in July.The government has been consistently clear that it would keep its support under review to protect jobs and the economy, with today\u2019s action reflecting the evolving circumstances and uncertainty of the months ahead.The package of measures, which applies to all regions and nations of the UK, includes:Support for workersA new Job Support Scheme will be introduced from 1 November to protect viable jobs in businesses who are facing lower demand over the winter months due to coronavirus.Under the scheme, which will run for six months and help keep employees attached to the workforce, the government will contribute towards the wages of employees who are working fewer than normal hours due to decreased demand.Employers will continue to pay the wages of staff for the hours they work - but for the hours not worked, the government and the employer will each pay one third of their equivalent salary.This means employees who can only go back to work on shorter time will still be paid two thirds of the hours for those hours they can\u2019t work.In order to support only viable jobs, employees must be working at least 33% of their usual hours. The level of grant will be calculated based on employee\u2019s usual salary, capped at \u00a3697.92 per month.The Job Support Scheme will be open to businesses across the UK even if they have not previously used the furlough scheme, with further guidance being published in due course.It is designed to sit alongside the Jobs Retention Bonus and could be worth over 60% of average wages of workers who have been furloughed \u2013 and are kept on until the start of February 2021. Businesses can benefit from both schemes in order to help protect jobs.In addition, the Government is continuing its support for millions of self-employed individuals by extending the Self Employment Income Support Scheme Grant (SEISS). An initial taxable grant will be provided to those who are currently eligible for SEISS and are continuing to actively trade but face reduced demand due to coronavirus. The initial lump sum will cover three months\u2019 worth of profits for the period from November to the end of January next year. This is worth 20% of average monthly profits, up to a total of \u00a31,875.An additional second grant, which may be adjusted to respond to changing circumstances, will be available for self-employed individuals to cover the period from February 2021 to the end of April - ensuring our support continues right through to next year.This is in addition to the more than \u00a313 billion of support already provided for over 2.6 million self-employed individuals through the first two stages of the Self Employment Income Support Scheme \u2013 one of the most generous in the world.Tax cuts and deferralsAs part of the package, the government also announced it will extend the temporary 15% VAT cut for the tourism and hospitality sectors to the end of March next year. This will give businesses in the sector - which has been severely impacted by the pandemic - the confidence to maintain staff as they adapt to a new trading environment.In addition, up to half a million business who deferred their VAT bills will be given more breathing space through the New Payment Scheme, which gives them the option to pay back in smaller instalments. Rather than paying a lump sum in full at the end March next year, they will be able to make 11 smaller interest-free payments during the 2021-22 financial year.On top of this, around11 million self-assessment taxpayers will be able to benefit from a separate additional 12-month extension from HMRC on the \u201cTime to Pay\u201d self-service facility, meaning payments deferred from July 2020, and those due in January 2021, will now not need to be paid until January 2022.Giving businesses flexibility to pay back loansThe burden will be lifted on more than a million businesses who took out a Bounce Back Loan through a new Pay as You Grow flexible repayment system. This will provide flexibility for firms repaying a Bounce Back Loan.This includes extending the length of the loan from six years to ten, which will cut monthly repayments by nearly half. Interest-only periods of up to six months and payment holidays will also be available to businesses. These measures will further protect jobs by helping businesses recover from the pandemic.We also intend to give Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme lenders the ability to extend the length of loans from a maximum of six years to ten years if it will help businesses to repay the loan.In addition, the Chancellor also announced he would be extending applications for the government\u2019s coronavirus loan schemes that are helping over a million businesses until the end of November. As a result, more businesses will now be able to benefit from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, the Bounce Back Loan Scheme and the Future Fund. This change aligns all the end dates of these schemes, ensuring that there is further support in place for those firms who need it.Investment in public servicesAt the start of the pandemic, the Chancellor pledged to give the NHS and public services the support needed to respond to coronavirus \u2013 and as of today, \u00a368.7 billion of additional funding has been approved by the Treasury, including \u00a324.3 billion since the Summer Economic Update in July.This funding has helped ensure the procurement of PPE for frontline staff, provided free school meals for children while at home and protected the country\u2019s most vulnerable. In addition, the \u00a312 billion funding to roll-out the Test and Trace programme has played a key role helping to unlock the economy, enabling businesses like restaurants and bars to serve customers again.As announced earlier this year, the Treasury has also guaranteed the devolved administrations will receive at least \u00a312.7 billion in additional funding. This gives Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the budget certainty to for coronavirus response in the months ahead.Responses from business groupsDame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said:  These bold steps from the Treasury will save hundreds of thousands of viable jobs this winter. It is right to target help on jobs with a future, but can only be part-time while demand remains flat. This is how skills and jobs can be preserved to enable a fast recovery.  Wage support, tax deferrals and help for the self-employed will reduce the scarring effect of unnecessary job losses as the UK tackles the virus. Employers will apply the same spirit of creativity, seizing every opportunity to retrain and upskill their workers.  The Chancellor has listened to evidence from business and acted decisively. It is this spirit of agility and collaboration that will help make 2021 a year of growth and renewal.Mike Cherry OBE, Federation of Small Businesses National Chair, said:  The UK\u2019s small businesses are facing an incredibly difficult winter.  Today\u2019s support package is the flipside of the coin to Tuesday\u2019s COVID-19 business restrictions.  It is a swift and significant intervention, extending emergency SME loans, creating new wage support for small employers and the self-employed, and providing cashflow help on VAT deferrals and new Time To Pay for any tax bills to HMRC.  We welcome that the Chancellor is ensuring that decisions to protect public health are informed by the need to protect the economy, people\u2019s jobs and prospects for young people in our schools and workplaces.BCC Director General Adam Marshall said:  The measures announced by the Chancellor will give business and the economy an important shot in the arm. Chambers of Commerce have consistently called for a new generation of support to help preserve livelihoods and ease the cash pressures faced by firms as they head into a challenging and uncertain winter.  The Chancellor has responded to our concerns with substantial steps that will help companies preserve jobs and navigate through the coming months. The new wage support scheme will help many companies hold on to valued employees after furlough ends, and the extension of business lending schemes and tax forbearance will lessen the immediate pressure on cash flow for many affected firms.  As we look past the immediate challenge, more will need to be done to rebuild and renew our economy. Chambers of Commerce across the UK will continue to work with government to ensure the benefits of these schemes are delivered to firms on the ground.

The short-time working scheme announced by Rishi Sunak \u2013 a model common in the rest of Europe but the first ever in the UK \u2013 is an important step.But let\u2019s be clear: it\u2019s just one piece in the jigsaw of support we need.\u00a0While the new scheme will give many firms much-needed breathing space to get back on their feet, ministers will need to do far more to protect livelihoods in the months ahead.Wider support package\u00a0The government must urgently work with unions and business on a wider support package for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy. Which is why cancelling the Budget was a mistake.The new scheme unveiled by the Chancellor is likely to benefit manufacturing companies most, where unions can negotiate work shares and pay top-ups. But industries like aviation, retail, arts and hospitality needed targeted support now.And we need action on job creation, too. The TUC has set out detailed plans for\u00a0investment in green infrastructure\u00a0and\u00a0public service resilience\u00a0that together could create nearly two million jobs.Training\u00a0Labour was right to highlight that yesterday\u2019s announcement was a missed opportunity for skills and training. It\u2019s crucial that hours not worked under the new short-time working scheme are not wasted.Workers must be given the chance during their down time to build their skills and expertise, as an investment for the future. We will continue to push the government on\u00a0our proposals for upskilling\u00a0during this pandemic and beyond.Keeping things under review\u00a0It\u2019s no secret that the TUC pushed for the scheme to be more generous to avoid triggering more lay-offs and to provide more support for the self-employed. Mass unemployment is a real and growing threat. It scars lives and whole communities. Much better for our economic recovery to have workers paying their taxes and spending wages than adding to the benefit bill.That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential that ministers are flexible and keep the level of support provided by the scheme under review. And they must set out what protections will be in place if we see more local lockdowns, and for people who can\u2019t go to work because they\u2019re caring or shielding.Fixing the safety net\u00a0This new scheme is not going to halt all job losses and \u2013 despite a recent (temporary) increase in Universal Credit \u2013 is simply not enough for people to live on. We need a social security net that catches those who lose their jobs and allows them to bounce back quickly.This pandemic has exposed the need for our benefits system to be urgently overhauled. This should include a rise in the standard UC payment to \u00a3260 per week, scrapping the five-week wait for the first payment, and the end of the two-child benefit cap.And if we want people to able to self-isolate we need to give them a proper rate of sick pay. Rather than one-off payments for some of those are self-isolating, we need to increase statutory sick pay to the equivalent of a week\u2019s living wage (\u00a3326) and make it available to all.Investing in the future\u00a0It\u2019s even more vital that government takes proactive steps now to shore up our economy. The TUC set out a plan in June for how we could create 1.24 million jobs in the next two years in the green industries of the future \u2013 if ministers fast-track investment now.We have also called for a public sector jobs drive that will create decent, higher-skilled and better paid work. With the right investment, this could create 600,000 new jobs in public services.The TUC and our unions know that the road ahead is going to be tough. But with the right support in place, government can stave off mass unemployment and protect people\u2019s livelihoods.We\u2019ll continue to push for a wider economic plan that prioritises protecting and investing in good jobs, fixes the social safety net and finally sorts out sick pay. A responsible government would call unions and business to work with ministers in a National Recovery Council to do just that.First published at LabourList.Stay UpdatedWant to hear about our latest news and blogs?

This will deliver the next phase of the plan to tackle the virus and protect jobs, so the extensions to the business loan and furlough schemes enable businesses to plan with certainty and access support in the first few months of the New Year ahead of the further update on wider Covid-19 economic support.So far, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) scheme has protected 9.6 million jobs across the UK with more than one million businesses accessing loans to help them through the crisis.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said:\u201cOur package of support for businesses and workers continues to be one of the most generous and effective in the world \u2013 helping our economy to recover and protecting livelihoods across the country.\u201cWe know the premium businesses place on certainty, so it is right that we enable businesses to plan ahead regardless of the path the virus takes, which is why we\u2019re providing certainty and clarity by extending this support, as well as implementing our Plan for Jobs.\u201dBusiness Secretary, Alok Sharma, said:\u201cWhile our loan schemes have provided a vital lifeline to millions of firms across the country, we know that business owners need additional certainty as we head into the New Year.\u201cExtending government-backed loan schemes will give companies right across the UK the finance they need to support, protect and create jobs as we build back better from the pandemic.\u201dThe Chancellor said he would review the employer contribution element of the CJRS in January, but decided to bring this forward to allow businesses to plan ahead for the remainder of the winter and the New Year.The government will continue to pay 80% of the salary of employees for hours not worked until the end of April. Employers will only be required to pay wages, National Insurance Contributions (NICS) and pensions for hours worked; and NICS and pensions for hours not worked.The eligibility criteria for the UK-wide scheme will remain unchanged and these changes will continue to apply to all Devolved Administrations.Extending the scheme until the end of April means businesses across the country will have certainty about what support will be available to them.Businesses will also be given until the end of March to access the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. These had been due to close at the end of January.The schemes have already provided over \u00a368 billion in guaranteed loans, and helped to keep afloat business in all sectors of the UK economy who have been impacted by coronavirus.We are extending the schemes now, ahead of Christmas and further into the new year, to ensure that businesses can continue to access the support they need to grow and recover.The government has already announced that more support will be available beyond March, through a successor loan scheme. More details of the scheme will be announced in due course, with the government providing a further update on wider Covid-19 economic support at the Budget on 3 March.The furlough and loan schemes are part of the government\u2019s wider plan to support, create and protect jobs through its Plan for Jobs. This includes the Kickstart Scheme, more investment in training and skills as well as the Self Employment Income Support Scheme grant, with a fourth grant being made available from February to April 2021.Further information:\textending the CJRS until the end of April gives businesses certainty well ahead of the 45 day redundancy notice period, with Budget setting out the next phase of support more than 45 days before the new end date of the scheme                      Share this page    \t                                                                                                                              Share on                    Facebook        \t                                                                                                                              Share on                    Twitter                    Published 17 December 2020                          Related content              \tCheck which employees you can put on furlough to use the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme\tHoliday entitlement and pay during coronavirus (COVID-19)\tCalculate how much you can claim using the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme\tCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme\tSteps to take before calculating your claim using the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme                                  Topical events  \tPlan for Jobs                          Is this page useful?
