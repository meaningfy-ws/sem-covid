For instance, Carol says, \u201cbranches can\u2019t operate normally. A cheque might need two signatories and the lockdown makes that really difficult for one person to do.\u201cLogistics at the moment are really quite difficult.\u201dSo a specific fund, administered centrally, can play an important role.Carol Sewell\u00a0Carol herself appreciates the problems for members. She suspects she\u2019s had COVID-19 herself \u2013 certainly, she can tick off a clutch of the symptoms.\u201cHeadache, aching body, very lethargic and not eating \u2013 because I\u2019ve had symptoms, I haven\u2019t been able to work.\u201dShe\u2019s back in harness now though \u2013 working from home for her local authority.\u201cI live with my mum \u2026 she\u2019ll come and have a little chat with me, bless her,\u201d she says.As a trustee, her background working for the local benefits office helps. \u201cWhen someone asks you for help, they\u2019re desperate,\u201d says Carol, so she\u2019s behind this new fund 100%.\u201cWe need to give the praise to Julie and the members of the team for all the work they\u2019re doing,\u201d she observes. \u201cThey\u2019re so dedicated.\u201d\u201cIt makes me so happy that we can support people.\u201dSo what sort of reason might a member need help?All of the following members were able to access grants of \u00a3250 from There for You, using the charity\u2019s quick and easy COVID-19 grant application process.Sheila is a care worker in a nursing home and had to take sick leave for three weeks as she had COVID-19 symptoms. She was paid statutory sick pay only for the time that she was ill, which left her struggling to pay her bills.Her work is always challenging and the current health crisis has made additional demands on Sheila and her colleagues. The last thing she needed was financial worries on top of everything else.\u00a0David works as a refuse collector for the local authority. His partner works in a local cafe and has been furloughed as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions. She is only receiving 80% of her salary, as her employer cannot afford to make up the balance.Both David and his partner are on low incomes and have nothing left at the end of the month once they have met their commitments \u2013 they were both really worried about how they will manage.\u00a0Lesley is a nurse working at a hospital some distance away from her home. She has been doing extra shifts to help during the current crisis, but her usual transport links have been reduced. In order to travel to and from the hospital, she is having to regularly pay for cab fares, which she is finding expensive.Find out more here \u2013 and get access the application formThere for YouCoronavirus \u2013 all you need to know\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 5 May 20206 May 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t Taggedcoronavirus  Covid-19  there for you  unison welfare\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFacebook\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwitter\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore options\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrint / Translate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrint page\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTranslate page\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPost navigation\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeedless care home deaths can be prevented if staff get safety kit, says UNISONA diary from the COVID frontline\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore on this\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoronavirus guidance for health and safety reps\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese are difficult and challenging times \u2013 and a challenging time for UNISON\u2019s safety reps who play such a vital role in keeping workers safe.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere for You (UNISON Welfare)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers experiencing financial and emotional difficulties can contact our welfare charity, There for You, which provides a confidential advice and support service for members and their dependants.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Latest news\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe unsung key workers\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on March 8, 2021March 8, 2021 by Demetrios Matheou\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe second wave\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on March 3, 2021March 3, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tForced jabs are counterproductive, says UNISON\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 3 March 20213 March 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLong COVID: \u2018It\u2019s frightening not knowing where this will end up\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on March 2, 2021March 8, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u2018Peace of mind and protection\u2019 \u2013 why members are getting the jab\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 26 February 202126 February 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuick Links\tJoin UNISON today\tMy UNISON\tContact UNISON\tJobs\tMedia centre\tSlavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2019\tUNISON where you work\tLocal government\tHealth care\tEducation\tPolice and justice\tCommunity\tWater, environment and transport\tEnergy\tPrivate contractors\tRegions\tCymru/Wales\tEast Midlands\tEastern\tGreater London\tNorthern\tNorth West\tNorthern Ireland\tScotland\tSouth East\tSouth West\tWest Midlands\tYorkshire & Humberside\tEquality in UNISON\tBlack members equality\tDisabled members equality\tLGBT+ members equality\tRetired members equality\tWomen members equality\tYoung members equality\tOnline tools\tOnline catalogue\tOrganising Space\tOther sites and sections\tLearning and organising\tHealth and Safety\tBritish Sign Language (BSL)\tSkills for Schools\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFollow us\tTwitter\tFacebook\tYoutube\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUNISON, UNISON Centre, 130 Euston Road, London NW1 2AY. 0800 0 857 857\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 Copyright 2021 Privacy policyTerms and conditions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00d7 Hide message\t\t\t\tWe use cookies on our website to ensure you find the information you need in the simplest way.
