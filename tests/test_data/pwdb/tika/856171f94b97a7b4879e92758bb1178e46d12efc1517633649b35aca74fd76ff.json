The scheme introduced a legal mechanism that allows businesses to retain employees without the need to work but to still receive a minimum level of salary. The purpose is to reduce redundancies and to avoid people being laid off without pay. Lay off (without pay) is the usual vehicle open to employers when they wish to retain employees but have no work for them to do. Under the job retention scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support from the government to continue paying part of the salary of those employees.  ", "content_of_measure_description": "The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a temporary scheme open to all UK employers/employees for at least three months starting from 1 March 2020. It is designed to support employers/employees whose operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Employers can use a portal to claim for 80% of furloughed employees\u2019 (employees on a leave of absence) usual monthly wage costs to enable them to continue paying these wages, up to 2,820 Euros (GBP 2,500) a month. The government will also cover the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and minimum automatic enrollment employer pension contributions on that wage. Employers/employees can use this scheme anytime during this period.\r\rEmployers who have just made workers redundant (because of the emerging impact of coronavirus) can hire them back and place them on furlough and claim the benefit.\r", "use_of_measure_description": "The scheme has been criticised for excluding workers starting in a new job after the 28 February 2020 cut off point (and before the government announced the lock down measures). The scheme is set to be up and running by the end of April 2020 with the possibility of claiming payments in arrears.\r\rBy the 19 July (the latest available data), the total number of jobs furloughed was\u00a09.5 million, with 1.2 million employers utilising the scheme, at a total cost to the government of\u00a0GBP 29.8 billion (HM Government, 2020).\r\rOn the 18 September, the Government published data on the scheme's operation up until the 31 July (although\u00a0figures for 31 July are provisional and subject to revision as additional claims for the period are received). The main findings are that:\u00a0\r\r* following on from the last release which covered the period to 30 June, preliminary estimates show that furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to the 31 July;\r* since the peak of 8.9 million employments furloughed on the 8 May, followed by reductions in June, preliminary figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to fall throughout July to 4.8 million on\u00a0the\u00a031\u00a0July - it is estimated that this figure could be in the region of 10% higher, or around 5.3 million once all returns are received and revisions made;\r* furloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on the 24\u00a0April at 1.85 million employments - by the 31\u00a0July, initial figures show 789,000 jobs furloughed in this sector \u2013 a decrease of more than a half since the peak for the sector;\r* across all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between the 30\u00a0June and the 31\u00a0July:\r* as at the 31\u00a0July, the sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furloughed that were actually furloughed was arts, entertainment and recreation at 45% followed by accommodation and food services sector at 43% - in all, 58% of employers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of July and 57% of employers in accommodation and food services;\r* overall, where it was possible to link the CJRS data on individual furloughed employments to other data, for the UK as a whole, 2.26 million women were furloughed at the end of July compared with 2.15 million men;\r* preliminary estimates show there was broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of July;\u00a0London had the highest take-up rate of 17% against the UK average of 16%;\r* in most countries and regions, more women than men were furloughed at the 31\u00a0July, the greatest exception to this being the West Midlands where 187,000 women were furloughed as opposed to\u00a0197,000 men;\r* almost 200,000 employers were using flexible furlough at the end of July for at least one job;\u00a0 in total, over 950,000 employments were on flexible furlough at the end of July,\u00a0around 20% of all furloughed employments;\r* at 29%, the accommodation and food services sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed flexibly;\r* based on the preliminary data for the 31 of\u00a0July, the South West has the highest proportion of employments on flexible furlough at 25% and London has the highest proportion of employments furloughed on a full-time basis at 82%.\u00a0\r\r\rAs of the 13 December, the total value of claims made by that date was \u00a346.6 billion. The  Government released the most recent data on the scheme in December 2020. The main points from the analysis, covering the period to 31 October are that: \r\r* furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to 31 October \rsince the peak of 8.9 million employments furloughed on 8 May, followed by reductions in June, \r* figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to fall throughout July, August and September to 5.4 million at 31 July and 3.8 million at 31 August and 2.8 million at 30 September.\r* Latest figures show that the number of employments has continued to fall throughout October to 2.4 million at 31 October. This is a reduction of 73% from the peak\rfurloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.9 million employments. \r* At 31 October, there were 356,400 employments furloughed in this sector \u2013 a decrease of more than 80% since the peak for the sector\r* As at 31 October, the sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furlough that were actually furloughed was the accommodation and food services sector at 27% followed by arts, entertainment and recreation at 24%. In all, 45% of employers in both the accommodation and food services sector and the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of October\r* Across all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between 30 September and 31 October\r* Overall, where it was possible to link the data, across the UK, 1.19 million women were furloughed at 31 October compared with 1.14 million men. This is a decrease of 229,700 women and 210,400 men when compared to 30 September\r* There was a broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of October. London had the highest take-up rate of 10% against the UK average of 8%\rin most countries and regions more women than men were furloughed at 31 October, the exceptions to this being London where 210,300 women were furloughed and 220,900 men, and West Midlands where 93,500 women were furloughed and 96,800 men\r* 196,400 employers had at least one employment on flexible furlough at the end of October. In total 977,200 employments were on flexible furlough at the end of October, 41% of all furloughed employments\r* At 50%, the other service activities sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed partially. This was followed by the accommodation and food services sector at 48%\r", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "Please note that the UK does not have formal institutional settings for involvement in the design, implementation and monitoring of policies although often, there will be information exchange and consultation, conducted on informal bases (this exists in addition to formal responses from the social partners to official consultations).\r\rIt is reported that the Chancellor held discussions with both the CBI and the TUC before launching the raft of emergency measures at the start of the epidemic.

If you are flexibly furloughed, then any hours taken as holiday during the claim period should be counted as furloughed hours rather than working hours.You can only be put on furlough if coronavirus is affecting your employer\u2019s operations.You cannot be put on furlough just because you are going to be on paid leave.You can agree with your employer to vary holiday pay entitlement as part of the furlough agreement, however almost all workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of statutory paid annual leave each year which they cannot go below.Employees can take holiday whilst on furlough. If you are flexibly furloughed then any hours taken as holiday during the claim period should be counted as furloughed hours rather than working hours. You should not be put on furlough for a period just because you are on holiday for that period. You should only be placed on furlough because your employer\u2019s operations have been affected by coronavirus and not just because you are on paid leave. This applies equally during any peak periods in late December and early January.Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be paid at your normal rate of pay or, where your rate of pay varies, calculated on the basis of the average pay you received in the previous 52 working weeks (12 weeks in Northern Ireland). Therefore, if you take holiday while on furlough, your employer should pay you your usual holiday pay in accordance with the WTR. Your employer will be obliged to pay the additional amounts over the grant, though will have the flexibility to restrict when leave can be taken if there is a business need. This applies for both the furlough period and the recovery period.If you usually work bank holidays then your employer can agree that this is included in the grant payment. If you usually take the bank holiday as leave then your employer would either have to top up your pay to your usual holiday pay, or give you a day of holiday in lieu.Read further guidance on holiday pay during furlough.Pay for time spent trainingWhile you\u2019re on furlough, you\u2019re encouraged to do training as long as your training does not provide services to, or generate revenue for your employer or an associated organisation.Find out more information on training that is available.When you do training at the request of your employer during hours which your employer records you as being on furlough, you are entitled to be paid at least your appropriate national minimum wage for this time. Usually, the furlough payment of 80% of your regular wage, will cover these training hours. However, when the minimum wage entitlement is more than the furlough payment, your employer will need to pay you the additional wages.Employees returning to work after being on sick payIf you\u2019re on fixed pay and are returning to work after time off sick, your employer will calculate how much you\u2019ll receive against your salary, before tax, not the pay you received whilst off sick.If you\u2019re on variable pay and returning to work after time off sick, your employer will calculate how much you\u2019ll get using the normal rules for employees whose pay varies.While you\u2019re on furloughDuring hours you are on furlough you will not be able to work for your employer. Your employer cannot ask you to do any work for them that:\tmakes money for your employer or a company linked or associated to your employer\tprovides services to your employer or a company linked or associated to your employerDuring hours you are on furlough you can:\ttake part in training\tvolunteer for another employer or organisation\twork for another employer, if contractually allowedFor the hours you are furloughed your employer cannot ask you to do work for another linked or associated company.If your contract allows, you may undertake other employment for the time your current employer has placed you on furlough, and this will not affect the grant that they can claim under the scheme. You will need to be able to work for the employer that has placed you on furlough if they decide to stop furloughing you or start flexibly furloughing you, and you must be able to undertake any training they require while on furlough. If you take on new employment, you should make sure you complete the starter checklist form with your new employer correctly. If you are furloughed from another employment, you should complete Statement C. Any activities undertaken while on furlough must be in line with the latest Public Health guidance during the coronavirus outbreak.If you do not want to go on furloughIf your employer asks you to go on furlough and you refuse you may be at risk of redundancy or termination of employment, depending on the circumstances of your employer. However, this must be in line with normal redundancy rules and protections.Details of your employer\u2019s claim that will be publicly availableIf your employer claims for periods starting on or after 1 December 2020, HMRC will publish details of their claim on GOV.UK.

Find out more about how the scheme is changing.Claims for furlough days in February 2021 must be made by 15 March 2021.You can no longer submit claims for claim periods ending on or before 31 October 2020.To use the scheme, the steps you\u2019ll need to take are:\tCheck if you can claim\tCheck which employees you can put on furlough\tSteps to take before calculating your claim\tCalculate how much you should claim\tClaim for your employees\u2019 wages online\tReport a payment in PAYE Real Time Information (RTI)If you cannot maintain your workforce because your operations have been affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), you can furlough employees and apply for a grant to cover a portion of their usual monthly wage costs where you record them as being on furlough.For periods ending on or before 30 April  2021 , you can claim for employees who were employed on 30 October 2020, as long as you have made a PAYE RTI submission to HMRC between the 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee. This may differ where you have made employees redundant, or they stopped working for you on or after 23 September 2020 and you have subsequently re-employed them. You do not need to have previously claimed for an employee before the 30 October 2020 to claim.For periods starting on or after 1 May 2021, you can claim for employees who were employed on 2 March 2021, as long as you have made a PAYE Real Time Information (RTI) submission to HMRC between 20 March 2020 and 2 March 2021, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee. You do not need to have previously claimed for an employee before the 2 March 2021 to claim for periods starting on or after 1 May 2021.For periods ending on or before 30 June 2021 you can claim 80% of an employee\u2019s usual salary for hours not worked, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month. From 1 July 2021, the level of grant will be reduced each month and you will be asked to contribute towards the cost of your furloughed employees\u2019 wages.You do not need to have previously claimed for an employee before the 30 October 2020 to claim.Employers can furlough employees for any amount of time and any work pattern, while still being able to claim the grant for the hours not worked.You will need to pay for employer National Insurance contributions and pension costs. Find out more information on employer contributions to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.If you\u2019ve already worked out how much you can claim, you can claim for wages online through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.HMRC will check claims. Payments may be withheld or need to be paid back if a claim is found to be fraudulent or based on incorrect information. You can report suspected fraud in the Coronavirus Job Retention scheme.Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme grants are not classed as state aid.Who can claimYou must have:\tcreated and started a PAYE payroll scheme on or before 30 October 2020\tcreated and started a PAYE payroll scheme on or before 2 March for periods starting on or after 1 May  2021\tenrolled for PAYE online\ta UK, Isle of Man or Channel Island bank accountAny entity with a UK payroll can apply, including businesses, charities, recruitment agencies and public authorities.If you receive public fundingIf you have staff costs that are publicly funded (even if you\u2019re not in the public sector), you should use that money to continue paying your staff, and not furlough your staff.Organisations can use the scheme if they are not fully funded by public grants and they should contact their sponsor department or respective administration for further guidance.If you\u2019re an administratorWhere a company is being taken under the management of an administrator, the administrator can furlough and claim for employees.Administrators should only use the scheme if there is a reasonable likelihood of retaining the employees. For example, this could be as a result of an administration and pursuit of a sale of the business.Employees you can claim forFind out which employees you can put on furlough and claim for.Agreeing to furlough employeesEmployers should discuss with their staff and make any changes to the employment contract by agreement. When employers are making decisions in relation to the process, including deciding who to offer furlough to, equality and discrimination laws will apply in the usual way.To be eligible for the grant, employers must have confirmed to their employee (or reached collective agreement with a trade union) in writing that they have been furloughed. You must:\tmake sure that the agreement is consistent with employment, equality and discrimination laws\tkeep a written record of the agreement for five years\tkeep records of how many hours your employees work and the number of hours they are furloughed (such as, not working)The employee does not have to provide a written response and you do not need to place all your employees on furlough.You can:\tfully furlough employees \u2013 they cannot undertake any work for you  while furloughed full time\tflexibly furlough employees \u2013 they can work for any amount of time, and any work pattern but they cannot do any work for you during hours that you record them as being on furloughIf you flexibly furlough employees, you will also need to agree this with the employee (or reach collective agreement with a trade union) and keep a new written agreement that confirms the new furlough arrangement.You do not need to place all your employees on furlough and you can continue to fully furlough employees if you wish. Employees cannot undertake any work for you during time that you record them as being on furlough.Where consistent with employment law, any flexible furlough or furlough agreement made retrospectively that has effect from 1 November 2020 will be valid for the purposes of a Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme claim as long as it is made according to the conditions above. Only retrospective agreements put in place up to and including the 13 November 2020 may be relied on for the purposes of a claim.Flexible furlough agreementsThere is no minimum furlough period, agreed flexible furlough agreements can last any amount of time. Employees can enter into a flexible furlough agreement more than once.Although flexible furlough agreements can last any amount of time, unless otherwise specified the period that you claim for must be for a minimum claim period of 7 calendar days.When your employees are on furloughDuring hours which you record your employee as being on furlough, you cannot ask them to do any work for you that:\tmakes money for your organisation or any organisation linked or associated with your organisation\tprovides services for your organisation or any organisation linked or associated with your organisationYour employee can:\ttake part in training\tvolunteer for another employer or organisation\twork for another employer (if contractually allowed)Paying employee taxes and pension contributionsYour employees will still pay the taxes they normally pay out of their wages.You must deduct and pay to HMRC income tax and employee National Insurance contributions on the full amount that you pay the employee, including any scheme grant.You must also pay to HMRC the employer National Insurance contributions on the full amount that you pay the employee, including any scheme grant.You must report these payments through a Full Payment Submission (FPS) to HMRC on or before the pay date.Your employee will also still pay pension contributions (both employer and automatic contributions from the employee), unless the employee has opted out or stopped saving into their pension. You are not able to claim for employer National Insurance contributions and pension contributions.Keeping employee rightsEmployees still have the same rights at work, including:\tStatutory Sick Pay (SSP)\tannual leave\tmaternity and other parental rights\trights against unfair dismissal\tredundancy paymentsGrants cannot be used to substitute redundancy payments. HMRC will continue to monitor businesses after the scheme has closed.Holiday payFurloughed employees continue to accrue leave as per their employment contract.You can only place employees on furlough if coronavirus is affecting your operations.You should not place employees on furlough just because they are going to be on paid leave.The employer and employee can agree to vary holiday entitlement as part of the furlough agreement, however almost all workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of statutory paid annual leave each year which they cannot go below.Employees can take holiday whilst on furlough. If they are flexibly furloughed then any hours taken as holiday during the claim period should be counted as furloughed hours rather than working hours. You should not put your employees on furlough for a period just because they are on holiday for that period. This means that employees should only be placed on furlough because your operations have been affected by coronavirus and not just because they are on paid leave. This applies equally during any peak periods in late December and early January.Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be paid at the employee\u2019s normal rate of pay or, where the rate of pay varies, calculated on the basis of the average pay received by the employee in the last 52 working weeks (12 weeks in Northern Ireland). Therefore, if a furloughed employee takes holiday, the employer should pay their usual holiday pay in accordance with the Working Time Regulations.Employers will be obliged to pay employees who are on holiday additional amounts over the grant, though will have the flexibility to restrict when leave can be taken if there is a business need and the correct notice is given. This applies for both the furlough period and the recovery period.If an employee usually works bank holidays then the employer can agree that this is included in the grant payment. If the employee usually takes the bank holiday as leave then the employer would either have to top up their usual holiday pay, or give the employee a day of holiday in lieu.Find out more information on holiday pay during furlough.Employees working for a different employerIf contractually allowed, your employees are permitted to work for another employer whilst you have placed them on furlough.For any employer that takes on a new employee, the new employer should ensure they complete the starter checklist form correctly. If the employee is furloughed from another employment, they should complete \u2018statement C\u2019 on the list.If your employee does volunteer workA furloughed employee can take part in volunteer work during hours which you record your employee as being on furlough as long as it is for another employer or organisation.If your employee does trainingFurloughed employees can engage in training during hours which you record your employee as being on furlough, as long as in undertaking the training the employee does not provide services to, or generate revenue for, or on behalf of their organisation or a linked or associated organisation. Furloughed employees should be encouraged to undertake training.Find out more information on training that is available.Where training is undertaken by furloughed employees during hours which you record your employee as being on furlough, at the request of their employer, they are entitled to be paid at least their appropriate national minimum wage for this time. In most cases, the furlough payment of 80% of an employee\u2019s regular wage, up to the value of \u00a32,500, will provide sufficient monies to cover these training hours. However, where the time spent training attracts a minimum wage entitlement in excess of the furlough payment, employers will need to pay the additional wages (see National Minimum Wage Section for more details).Furloughed employees working as union or non-union representatives or as pension trusteesDuring hours which you record your employee as being on furlough, employees who are union or non-union representatives may undertake duties and activities for the purpose of individual or collective representation of employees or other workers. However in doing this, they must not provide services to or generate revenue for, or on behalf of your organisation or a linked or associated organisation.During hours which you record your employee as being on furlough, employees who are pension scheme trustees or trustee directors of a corporate trustee may undertake trustee duties in relation to the pension scheme. However, a professional, independent pension scheme trustee who has been furloughed by the independent trustee company cannot undertake trustee work that would provide services to or generate revenue for, or on behalf of, the independent trustee company or any organisation linked or associated with that independent trustee company during hours which you record them as being on furlough.Before you claimYou will need to work out how much you can claim through the scheme. HMRC will retain the right to retrospectively audit all aspects of your claim.Employers should discuss with their staff and make any changes to the employment contract by agreement.Employers may need to seek legal advice on the process. If sufficient numbers of staff are involved, it may be necessary to engage collective consultation processes to procure agreement to changes to terms of employment.HMRC cannot provide your employees with details of claims you make on their behalf. Please help us by keeping your employees informed, answering any questions that they might have. Please ask them not to contact HMRC.Details of your claim that will be publicly availableIf you claim for periods starting on or after 1 December 2020, HMRC will publish details of your claim on GOV.UK. We are doing this to:\tmeet our transparency commitments\tdeter fraudulent claimsWe will publish this information monthly, updating the previous month\u2019s information with any amendments. You can:\tview the latest data for claims made through the scheme\tfind out what to do if publishing your claim could leave individuals at risk of violence or intimidationIn February, furloughed employees can see if they were included in a December 2020 claim in their personal tax account.This information will be updated monthly and January claims will be available to view from the end of March.Report fraud to HMRCHMRC will check claims, and payments may be withheld or need to be paid back if a claim is found to be fraudulent or based on incorrect information.The public can report fraud to HMRC if they have evidence to suggest an employer on the list is abusing the scheme.Contacting HMRCUse HMRC\u2019s digital assistant to find more information about the coronavirus support schemes.You can also contact HMRC if you cannot get the help you need online.

The Chancellor has shown real leadership. We\u2019re glad he has listened to unions and taken vital steps to support working families.\u201cLarge-scale wage subsidies are the best way to boost household finances and keep businesses running. And they\u2019ll help our economy bounce back after this crisis.\u201cEmployers across the economy can now be confident that they will be able to pay their wage bills. They must urgently reassure their staff that their jobs and livelihoods are safe. \u201cUnions will continue to work with business and government to protect jobs and livelihoods.\u201dENDSNotes to editors:\u00a0- TUC experts are available for briefing on the details of the package. - Earlier this week, a TUC report set out five actions urgently needed to minimise the impact of the coronavirus on workers, the economy and public health: \tProvide wage subsidies for short-time working - all industries will be hit hard by coronavirus so the government must step up and help fund wages now. Just like in Germany, Denmark and Sweden the government should subsidise wages for reduced hours and help working families. \tSick pay for all \u2013 ministers must ensure that sick pay is available for everyone, including the 2 million low-paid workers who currently don\u2019t earn enough to qualify for it. In addition, sick pay must be increased to at least the real living wage. \u00a394 a week is not enough for people to survive on \u2013 especially over a prolonged period. \tParental leave support - ministers have to sort out parental leave and financial support for working families. They must not lose out if their kids cannot go to school or nursery. \u00a0\tProvide further significant economic stimulus \u2013 the government must help people meet their rent, mortgage and debt payments, give people living on benefits and pensions a significant bump in income. \tAssemble a national taskforce \u2013 ministers need to pull together employers, unions and government agencies to make sure coronavirus doesn\u2019t lead to a recession and mass unemployment \u00a0- The Trades Union Congress (TUC) exists to make the working world a better place for everyone. We bring together more than 5.5 million working people who make up our 48 member unions. We support unions to grow and thrive, and we stand up for everyone who works for a living.Stay UpdatedWant to hear about our latest news and blogs?

It doesn't go far enough.Today's statement from Rishi Sunak contained some welcome steps. But feel good gimmicks like \u00a310 off your meals are not the way to meet the looming threat of mass unemployment.Yesterday the UK was warned of unemployment rising to 11.7% - meaning 4 million people - by the end of the year.\u00a0 Every day we hear new announcements of job losses, from British Airways to Pr\u00eat a Manger. \u00a0The government has won plaudits including from the trade union movement for its bold and rapid action in setting up the Job Retention and self-employment income support schemes that, while far from perfect, have supported the incomes of near 12 million workers.But, as the chancellor has admitted, the hardest part of the task begins with the return to work. Making a big deal of a phased approach, today he announced his \u2018Plan for Jobs\u2019. We have to wait until later in the year to hear the plan to rebuild.But the only possible plan for jobs is to rebuild today. In failing to do this, the chancellor has left the threat of mass unemployment hanging over the heads of many working people.Some positive stepsUnions have campaigned for a job guarantee scheme, and \u2018Kickstart\u2019 is a good first step. Young workers, overrepresented in the most vulnerable sectors (like retail and hospitality), face a particularly high risk of unemployment. To make it work properly, the scheme will need to offer good quality jobs with training opportunities, with regional panels in place to ensure these jobs benefit the community and employers topping up wages to the real living wage.But the jobs crisis will go far beyond young people, and the government\u2019s scheme does not.A \u2018job retention bonus\u2019 in effect extends the furlough scheme, but in less generous terms.\u00a0 Firms will receive \u00a31,000 for every employee that they retain for three months after the furlough scheme ends in October, as long as they pay them a minimum amount \u2013 designed to stop employers bringing back workers on very low hours. This is better than a cliff edge end to the scheme, but it won\u2019t be enough for the hardest hit businesses. And it won\u2019t help those workers who have shielding or whose caring responsibilities mean they can\u2019t return to their workplace. They needed more from today\u2019s plan. \u00a0While we heard about some new money for Jobcentres, following years of cuts, the overall package for jobs and skills support falls short. Today there was little reference to the training needs of adults, with the exception of a \u00a31,500 employer bonus for apprentices aged 25+. \u00a0The TUC has called for a new right to retrain\u00a0for everybody, backed up by funding and personal lifelong learning accounts. This should involve bringing forward the \u00a3600m promised investment in a National Skills Fund, and accelerating the work of the national retraining partnership, to ensure there is a gateway to new skills for everyone. The chancellor missed an opportunity here.Too many gaping holesThe social and economic imperatives as we come out of the pandemic are the same.Putting money in workers\u2019 pockets will support spending, improve business sales and encourage them to retain workers. Businesses in the hardest hit sectors will need bespoke and substantial interventions. There was no mention anywhere in this statement of the crisis in retail, an industry on its knees with hundreds of thousands of jobs already gone and many more losses to come in the period ahead. \u00a0Where business models face major changes after the pandemic, government investment in public services and infrastructure can provide new work for those who lose their jobs. Above all, government investment in the green economy could be the foundation for a new deal worthy of the name.Here all the government has to offer are small measures and gimmicks: a welcome but small- scale home insulation programme, some targeted changes to VAT (\u00a34bn) and a so called \u201ceat out to help out\u201d discount. This is not the time for feel good initiatives but for real action.The TUC set out a plan for how investment in infrastructure and public services could deliver millions of new jobs. Research for the TUC\u00a0shows that an \u00a385bn investment in green infrastructure could help create 1.24 million jobs in the next two years. There are\u00a0 over 100,000 vacancies in social care, and 100,000 more in the NHS. There have been 100,000 redundancies in the past decade in local government. But public services got nothing from today\u2019s statement.The TUC have calculated that to match Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal would mean a total of \u00a3450 billion spending over the next five years. In spite of all the fanfare, the chancellor announced just \u00a33billion for greening homes and public buildings on top of the prime minister\u2019s so called \u2018new deal\u2019 package of only \u00a35bn.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0And the gaping holes in too many families\u2019 budgets will remain unfilled. There was no action on the UK\u2019s incredibly low level of sick pay, which leaves those who have to self-isolate facing huge falls in income. Nothing about the inadequate amounts of universal credit \u2013 or the five week wait to receive it. No pay rise for key workers. \u201dUp to \u00a310 off\u201d in restaurants won\u2019t mean much to those who have been driven to food banks or only have a few pounds to feed their family a day. \u00a0Building back betterThe chancellor is facing a huge challenge. But he needs to do more to meet the challenges ahead for families across the country.The government needs to recognise that every hour put in by every worker each day \u2013 that's what our economy is made of. So everything done to protect and create jobs will pay for itself with a faster, stronger recovery. \u00a0Stay UpdatedWant to hear about our latest news and blogs?

Update: the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been extended until the end of April 2021.On 17 December, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the extension of the Job Retention Scheme (JRS) for a

He also confirmed that the government will continue to contribute 80% towards wages until the end of April, and the eligibility criteria for the UK-wide scheme will remain unchanged. Employers continue to be required to pay staff\u2019s wages, National Insurance Contributions and pensions for hours worked, as well as NICS and pensions for hours not worked.

This includes\u00a0compulsory commission, as well as fees and past overtime.\u00a0However, discretionary\u00a0commission\u00a0should be excluded, as well as discretionary bonuses\u00a0(including tips)\u00a0and non-cash payments.\u00a0\u00a0Do\u00a0employers\u00a0have to\u00a0top up\u00a0the\u00a020% of\u00a0an\u00a0employee\u2019s\u00a0wage\u00a0and go\u00a0beyond the guaranteed\u00a080%\u00a0of employee\u2019s salary?\u00a0\u00a0No. An employer can choose to top up an employee\u2019s salary beyond the guaranteed 80% but is not obliged to.Is there a minimum furlough period?\u00a0\u00a0No. During the extension of the JRS from 1\u00a0November, part-time furloughing of employees continues to be\u00a0possible\u00a0and employers are able to agree any working arrangements with their employees. This means that there is no minimum furlough period; that is, no minimum amount of time that an employee must be on temporary leave.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a minimum claim period?\u00a0Yes,\u00a0the period that\u00a0an employer can\u00a0claim for must be for a\u202fminimum claim period of\u00a0seven\u00a0calendar days\u00a0(one week).\u00a0Can a claim\u00a0period\u00a0span\u00a0two months?\u00a0Yes.\u00a0From 1 November it will be possible for a claim period to span two calendar months.Can an employee work while on furlough?\u00a0\u00a0No.\u00a0During hours\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0an employee is\u00a0recorded\u00a0as being on furlough,\u00a0an employer\u00a0cannot ask\u00a0them\u00a0to do any work\u00a0that:\u00a0makes money for their organisation or any organisation linked or associated with\u00a0their\u00a0organisation, or\u00a0provides services for\u00a0their\u00a0organisation or any organisation linked or associated with\u00a0their\u00a0organisation.\u00a0But employees can take\u00a0part in training,\u00a0volunteer for another employer or organisation,\u00a0work for another employer (if contractually allowed).\u00a0\u00a0Can an employee\u00a0undertake training while on furlough?\u00a0Yes.\u00a0Furloughed employees can engage in training during hours\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0an employer\u00a0records\u00a0them\u00a0as being on furlough, as long as in undertaking the training the employee does not provide services to, or generate revenue for, or on behalf of their organisation or a linked or associated organisation.\u00a0Where training is undertaken by furloughed employees, at the request of their employer, they are entitled to be paid at least their appropriate national minimum wage for this time.\u00a0Are employers breaching the\u00a0law\u00a0if the 80%\u00a0of an\u00a0employee\u2019s wage\u00a0paid by the government\u00a0(and the employer)\u00a0falls\u00a0below National Living Wage (NLW) or National Minimum Wage (NMW) rates?\u00a0\u00a0No.\u00a0Individuals are only entitled to\u202fthe NLW/NMW for the hours they work.\u00a0Furloughed workers are not\u00a0allowed to\u00a0work\u00a0for you\u00a0during this period, so there is no minimum wage to comply with.\u00a0You\u00a0have to\u00a0pay\u00a0the lower of 80% of their salary or \u00a32,500. This is the case\u00a0even if, based on their usual working hours, this\u00a0falls\u00a0below NLW/NMW.\u00a0Are National Insurance Contributions and auto enrolment still\u00a0due on the \u00a32,500 grant?\u00a0Can the grant be used to pay non-wage costs such as employer NIC or pensions contributions?\u00a0Employers\u00a0remains liable for associated Employer NIC and minimum automatic enrolment.\u00a0If the employer decides to pay a top up, the employer will be responsible for paying the additional NIC and automatic enrolment.\u00a0Employers are\u00a0also responsible for any voluntary automatic enrolment contributions above the minimum mandatory employer contribution of 3% of income above the lower limit of qualifying earnings.\u00a0\u00a0From 1\u00a0November until 30 April,\u00a0employers are required to pay\u00a0NIC and minimum automatic enrolment for the hours that their employees are furloughed.\u00a0\u00a0Can\u00a0employees that were\u00a0due a pay rise during the furlough period\u00a0still receive it?\u00a0If so,\u00a0can\u00a0employers claim\u00a0for\u00a080% of the\u00a0employees\u2019\u00a0new salary via\u00a0the\u00a0grant?\u00a0\u00a0The guidance does not clarify this question.\u00a0\u00a0How does the\u00a0Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme interact with Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)?\u00a0Employees that have been furloughed have the same rights as they did previously\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0includes\u00a0employees\u2019 entitlement to SSP\u00a0where they are eligible.\u00a0\u00a0If\u00a0employers want to furlough employees for business reasons and they are currently off sick, they are eligible to do so, as with other employees. In these cases, the employee should no longer receive sick pay and would be\u00a0classified as a furloughed employee.\u00a0However, if\u00a0an employee becomes sick while\u00a0furloughed, it is up to employers to decide whether to move these employees onto SSP\u00a0or to keep them on furlough at their furloughed rate.\u00a0If a furloughed employee who becomes\u00a0sick is moved onto SSP, employers can no longer claim for the furloughed salary.\u00a0How does the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme interact with the Apprenticeship Levy?\u00a0\u00a0Apprentices\u00a0can be furloughed\u00a0and\u00a0continue to train during this period.\u00a0This includes\u00a0the 20% of-the-job\u00a0requirement for the Apprenticeship Levy. All apprentices must be paid\u00a0the appropriate minimum wage\u00a0for the time they spend training \u2013 i.e. the\u00a0Apprenticeship Minimum,\u00a0National Living or National Minimum Wage. Employers\u00a0need to\u00a0pay this in full,\u00a0covering\u00a0any shortfall between\u00a0an employee\u2019s\u00a0appropriate minimum wage and\u00a0amount they can recover via\u00a0grant.\u00a0The grant does not cover employers\u2019\u00a0Apprenticeship\u00a0Levy obligations.Does an employer need to demonstrate that it is otherwise planning redundancies\u00a0in order to\u00a0furlough individuals?\u00a0\u00a0No. All employers with a UK bank account and UK Pay As You Earn (PAYE) scheme can claim the grant. Employers do not need to have previously used the JRS for an employee before the 30 October 2020 to claim for periods from 1 November 2020.Can employers roll\u00a0employees on and off\u00a0furlough?\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0During the extended JRS employers\u00a0will still be able to\u00a0bring employees off furlough and re-furlough them\u00a0at a later date.\u00a0\u00a0Will employees accrue holiday whilst being on furlough?\u00a0Yes.\u00a0Can employees take holiday\u00a0(including bank holidays) whilst being on furlough?\u00a0If so,\u00a0do employers have to top up the\u00a0government\u2019s grant money\u00a0to pay holidays\u00a0at full pay?\u00a0\u00a0Yes,\u00a0furloughed workers can take annual leave and the JRS grant continues during this time.\u00a0Holiday pay\u00a0must\u00a0be paid at the employee\u2019s normal rate of pay or, where the rate of pay varies, calculated\u00a0on the basis of\u00a0the average pay received by the employee in the previous 52 working weeks.\u00a0Employers will have the flexibility to restrict when leave can be taken if there is a business need and the correct notice is given.\u00a0In cases where an employee usually works on bank holidays the employer can agree that this is included in the grant payment. If an employee usually takes the bank holiday as\u00a0leave, then the employer would\u00a0either have to top up the employee\u2019s pay to their usual holiday\u00a0pay or\u00a0give them a day of holiday in lieu.\u00a0Can an\u00a0employee\u00a0on furlough\u00a0with one employer\u00a0start a new paid job with a\u00a0second\u00a0employer?\u00a0Yes, so long at is it contractually allowed by the\u00a0original\u00a0employer.\u00a0The second employer will need to\u00a0complete a starter checklist, which can be found\u00a0here.\u00a0\u00a0Can\u00a0company\u00a0directors,\u00a0owner-mangers\u00a0or\u00a0pension trustees\u00a0be furloughed?\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0Complying with\u00a0statutory duties\u00a0does not constitute \u2018work\u2019 during the period of furlough.\u00a0\u00a0Can\u00a0employees\u00a0working on\u00a0a Tier 2 visa be furloughed via the Job Retention Scheme? Do employers have to top up grant money to meet\u00a0the\u00a0minimum salary threshold of\u00a0a\u00a0Tier 2 migrant?\u00a0\u00a0Employees that are Tier 2 migrants can\u00a0be furloughed.\u00a0The Home Office has confirmed that employers do not need\u00a0to top up\u00a0an employee\u2019s salary beyond the 80%\u00a0or \u00a32,500 cap\u00a0paid by the government\u00a0to meet\u00a0minimum Tier 2 salary thresholds.\u00a0\u00a0Can the employer choose to furlough some but not other employees within a business or department?Yes. Employers will need to ensure that their consultation and notification processes for furloughing employees is in line with relevant equalities and employment law.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do employers have to go through a selection process, like for redundancy, when furloughing\u00a0individuals?\u00a0\u00a0Yes. When furloughing employees, employers are still subject to relevant employment and equalities laws. This includes proper consultation with employees and notification that they will be put on furlough.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Will\u00a0furloughed\u00a0employees have to sign a new employment contract?\u00a0\u00a0The guidance does not\u00a0specify that employees need to\u00a0physically\u00a0sign a new employment contract.\u00a0To be eligible for the grant, employers must confirm in writing to their employee that they\u00a0have been furloughed. If this is done in a way that is consistent with employment law, that consent is valid for the purposes of claiming through the scheme. Collective agreement reached between an employer and a trade union is also acceptable for the purpose of such a claim.\u00a0\u00a0Employees can enter into a flexible furlough agreement more than once.\u00a0There needs to be a written record\u00a0of the agreement, but the employee does not have to provide a written response. A record of this communication must be kept for five years.\u00a0If employees are furloughed\u00a0part-time the employer should keep\u00a0records of how many hours\u00a0their\u00a0employees work and the number of hours they are furloughed.\u00a0If an employee asks to be furloughed because they\u00a0cannot work due to\u00a0childcare responsibilities (because of nursey/school\u00a0closures) can an employer agree to this?\u00a0\u00a0Yes.\u00a0Employees who are unable to work because they have caring responsibilities resulting from coronavirus (COVID-19) can be furloughed. This applies to employees that\u00a0cannot work\u00a0because they are caring for\u00a0children or\u00a0a vulnerable individual in their household.\u00a0\u00a0Can employers furlough employees who are clinically extremely vulnerable and are following public health guidance?Yes.\u00a0Employees who are unable to work because they are clinically extremely vulnerable in line with public health guidance can be furloughed.\u00a0Employers must ensure they follow all existing\u00a0employment and\u00a0equalities law\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the\u00a0decision to furlough an employee in a vulnerable group\u00a0should be\u00a0an agreement between\u00a0both parties.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does\u00a0an\u00a0employer need to reach agreement with\u00a0an\u00a0employee\u00a0before\u00a0being\u00a0\u2018on\u00a0furlough\u2019, as is the usual process\u00a0for any reduction in pay?\u00a0Yes.\u00a0Both employees and their employer must agree\u00a0before\u00a0an individual can be\u00a0put on furlough \u2013\u00a0usual\u00a0consultation and notification processes apply.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a minimum period within which the employer cannot make a\u00a0furloughed employee redundant?\u00a0\u00a0No. Employers can make employees redundant while they are on furlough or immediately after. If an employee is made redundant while on furlough, their redundancy rights are not affected.\u00a0\u00a0When the government ends the Scheme, employers will need to decide whether employees can return to work and, if not, consider whether it is necessary to make them redundant. Employees that have been\u00a0furloughed have the same rights as they were entitled to previously \u2013 this\u00a0includes rights against unfair dismissal and redundancy.\u00a0\u00a0On 31\u00a0July the government has introduced new\u00a0legislation\u00a0that\u00a0ensures\u00a0that furloughed employees receive statutory redundancy pay based on their normal wages, rather than a reduced furlough rate.\u00a0The changes will also apply to statutory notice pay\u00a0and\u00a0awards for\u00a0unfair dismissal\u00a0cases\u00a0that need to be based on full pay rather than\u00a0wages under JRS.\u00a0But this legislation does not\u00a0impact any enhanced redundancy pay that may be stipulated in the terms and conditions of an employee\u2019s individual employment contract.\u00a0Note that the government is reviewing whether employers should be eligible to claim for employees serving contractual or statutory notice periods, and will change the approach for claim periods starting on or after 1 December 2020, with further guidance published in late November.What happens in cases where employees have been made redundant?If an employer has made employees redundant, or they stopped working for the employer on or after 23 September 2020 they can be re-employed and put on furlough. This applies as long as the employee was employed by the employer on September 23 and the employer made a PAYE RTI submission to HMRC between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee.How to calculate salary for hours\u00a0worked\u00a0on flexible\u00a0furlough\u00a0from 1\u00a0November?\u00a0To calculate the pro-rated subsidy for flexible furlough, the employer will have to calculate the\u00a0employee\u2019s usual working hours\u00a0in the relevant claim period\u00a0and\u00a0subtract the hours\u00a0actually worked\u00a0during the period. This will give the number of furlough hours in the claim period.\u00a0Employers should then pro-rate the grant claim, using the proportion of furlough hours against usual hours.\u00a0\u00a0For an employee who has fixed contractual hours, the employee\u2019s usual hours will be their normal contractual hours at the end of the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020 if:\tThey were on your payroll on 19 March 2020, that is the employer made a payment of earnings to them in the tax year 2019 to 2020 which was reported to HMRC on a Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) on or before 19 March 2020\tThe employer made a valid CJRS claim for in a claim period ending any time on or before 31 October 2020\tFor all other employees, the reference period is the last pay period ending on or before 30 October 2020; this will only apply for periods starting after 1 November 2020.If an employee has variable pay, how an employer works out their usual wages depends on when they were on your payroll.For employees who were on payroll on 19 March 2020, that is, the employer made a payment of earnings to them in the tax year 2019 to 2020 which was reported to HMRC on a Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) on or before 19 March 2020, the employer should calculate 80% of the higher of:\tThe wages earned in the corresponding calendar period in the tax year 2019 to 2020\tThe average wages payable in the tax year 2019 to 2020.This also applies to employees for whom you made a valid Job Retention Scheme claim in a claim period ending any time on or before 31 October 2020.For all other employees the employer should calculate 80% of the average wages payable between 6 April 2020 (or, if later, the date the employment started) and the day before they are furloughed on or after 1 November 2020.Employers will need to make\u00a0this\u00a0proportionate to the claim period by\u00a0dividing\u00a0employee\u2019s usual hours\u00a0by\u00a0the number of calendar days in the work-pattern\u00a0to get\u00a0usual daily hours, multiplied by the number of days in the claim period\u00a0(rounded up if not a whole number).\u00a0For\u00a0detailed guidance\u00a0and example calculations please see\u00a0here.\u00a0What\u00a0is\u00a0the process employers need to go through to apply for, and receive, the government\u2019s grant?To calculate\u00a0a\u00a0grant claim, employers\u00a0will\u00a0need to calculate employee\u2019s usual working hours\u00a0subtract their actual hours worked during claim period.\u00a0Workers who are on full-time\u00a0furlough\u00a0will\u00a0receive 80% of their regular wages up to the cap of \u00a32,500 per month.\u00a0Employees\u00a0on flexible\u00a0furlough\u00a0will\u00a0receive the grant\u00a0proportionate to their furloughed hours\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which means any hours\u00a0worked will also reduce the\u00a0maximum\u00a0government subsidy available on a pro-rata basis.\u00a0Information\u00a0about how to access and apply for grants can be found\u00a0here.\u00a0\u00a0Can a new\u00a0employer\u00a0furlough\u00a0the employees of a previous business\u00a0in cases when a change in ownership\u00a0happened?\u00a0Yes, for claim periods after 1 November 2020, a new employer is eligible to claim in respect of the employees of a previous business transferred if the TUPE or PAYE business succession rules apply to the change in ownership.The employees being claimed for should have been:\tTransferred from their old employer to their new employer on or after 1 September 2020\tEmployed by either their old employer or new employer on 30 October 2020\tOn a PAYE Real Time Information (RTI) submission to HMRC, by their old or new employer between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee.Can an employer that has consolidated PAYE\u00a0schemes\u00a0make claims under the JRS?Yes.\u00a0Where a group of companies have multiple PAYE schemes and there is a transfer of all employees from these schemes into a new consolidated PAYE scheme, the new scheme will be eligible to continue to furlough and claim for employees.Can furloughed employees continue working as union or non-union representatives?Yes. During hours which employers record their employee as being on furlough, employees who are union or non-union representatives may undertake duties and activities for the purpose of individual or collective representation of employees or other workers. However, in doing this, they must not provide services to or generate revenue for, or on behalf of their employer\u2019s organisation or a linked or associated organisation.Will HMRC make employer claim information public?Yes, from December 2020, HMRC will publish employer names and for companies and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs), the company registration number of those who have made claims under the scheme for the month of December onwards.

HM Revenue and Customs told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee it estimates that 5-10% of furlough cash has been wrongly awarded.Latest data shows the programme has cost the government \u00a335.4bn so far.The scheme has paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave since March, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month.Speaking to MPs on Monday, HMRC's permanent secretary, Jim Harra, said: \"We have made an assumption for the purposes of our planning that the error and fraud rate in this scheme could be between 5% and 10%.\"That will range from deliberate fraud through to error.\"The Public Accounts Committee estimates that a total of \u00a330bn in tax was lost in 2019 due to taxpayer error and fraud. Both HM Treasury and HMRC were ordered to appear in front of MPs to explain how they were intending to reduce the problem.\tWhat's the latest with the furlough scheme?\tCoronavirus: Taxpayers to lose billions to virus fraud - report\tFurlough wind down: 'We prepared for the worst'\"What we have said in our risk assessment is we are not going to set out to try to find employers who have made legitimate mistakes in compiling their claims, because this is obviously something new that everybody had to get to grips with in a very difficult time,\" said Mr Harra.\"Although we will expect employers to check their claims and repay any excess amount, what we will be focusing on is tackling abuse and fraud.\"So far, 8,000 calls have been received to HMRC's fraud telephone hotline. HMRC is now looking into 27,000 \"high risk\" cases where they believe a serious error has been made in the amount an employer has claimed, he added. Mr Harra advised that any employee who feels that their employer may have been fraudulently claiming furlough money can report it to HMRC by filling in a form on its website. \"While we can't get involved in any relationship between the employee and employer, we can certainly reclaim any grant that the employer is not entitled to, which includes grants they have not passed on in wages to their employees.\"This is the first time that HMRC has spoken publicly about potential fraud affecting the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.Swetha Ramachandran, investment manager at GAM Investments, told the BBC: \"The speed with which they wanted to expedite this programme in order to ensure that this was available to employers, to minimise the damage that could have been caused, means there was always a likelihood that this was going to happen.\"So I don't think it's that surprising.\" She said other government programmes, such as the Bounce Back Loans scheme or the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans scheme, might suffer from similar problems.\"That won't probably emerge for a few months,\" she added.image copyrightParliament TVimage captionHMRC's Jim Harra: \"We will be focusing on is tackling abuse and fraud.\"In July, centre-right think tank Policy Exchange warned that fraud and error could cost the government between \u00a31.3bn and \u00a37.9bn.The think tank said the government's financial rescue scheme were vulnerable to scams because of the size of the packages and the speed at which measures were rushed through to save people and businesses from economic ruin.The calculation is based on expected fraud rates for government expenditure from the Cabinet Office and the Department for Work and Pensions.The report said the true value lost to fraud may be closer to the higher end of the estimate \"due to the higher than usual levels of fraud that accompany disaster management\".It said: \"This is a serious squandering of public finances and properly resourced post event assurance will be required to reassure the public that every possible step has been taken to reduce this level of fraud.\"At the time, a government spokesman said it was committed to \"extensive post payment reviews of stimulus and support payments, to find fraud and recover money for the taxpayer\".Related Topics\tRishi Sunak\tUK economy\tUnemployment\tPay\tCoronavirus lockdown measures\tCoronavirus pandemic\tHM Revenue & Customs\tCompanies\tEmploymentMore on this story\tTaxpayers to lose billions to virus fraud - report\tPublished\t11 July 2020\tFurlough wind down: 'We prepared for the worst'\tPublished\t1 September 2020Top Stories\tMeghan: Royal had concerns about son's skin colourThe duchess tells Oprah Winfrey that a family member talked about how \"dark\" her baby's skin might be.\tPublished\t16 hours ago\tSkin colour remark 'not Queen nor Duke' - Oprah\tPublished\t6 minutes ago\tMeghan 'didn't want to be alive any more'\tPublished\t36 minutes agoFeatures\t'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism'\tThe woman with HIV helping others have a 'good death'\tCovid map: Where are cases the highest?\t12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview\tCovid: 'My family told me to marry at 14'\tThe ballerina dancing on ice for a real \u2018swan lake\u2019 VideoThe ballerina dancing on ice for a real \u2018swan lake\u2019\t'The first black fairytale' gets modern reworking\tWhat's causing vaccine delays in some Asian countries?\t'Deepfake is the future of content creation'Elsewhere on the BBC\tLyrics quizHave you been getting these songs wrong?\tFeeling hotWhat happens to your body in extreme heat?Most Read\tSkin colour remark 'not Queen nor Duke' - Oprah1\t12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview2\tBillionaire Mackenzie Scott marries science teacher3\tMeghan 'didn't want to be alive any more'4\t'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism'5\tPastor on leave after Melania 'trophy wife' sermon6\tEU bank authority hit by Microsoft email hack7\tHuge explosion hurts hundreds in Equatorial Guinea8\tCovid: 'My family told me to marry at 14'9\tBanksy to auction hospital art for NHS10BBC News Services\tOn your mobile\tOn smart speakers\tGet news alerts\tContact BBC News\tHome\tNews\tSport\tReel\tWorklife\tTravel\tFuture\tCulture\tMusic\tTV\tWeather\tSounds\tTerms of Use\tAbout the BBC\tPrivacy Policy\tCookies\tAccessibility Help\tParental Guidance\tContact the BBC\tGet Personalised Newsletters\tWhy you can trust the BBC\tAdvertise with us\tAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info\u00a9 2021 BBC.

It provides analysis of claims for periods up to 31 July. The data used includes claims submitted to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) by 31 August 2020. The data for July is incomplete as claims relating to July may still be filed; thus, the figures for July should therefore be considered preliminary results and will be revised in future releases.We will continue to publish more CJRS statistics in future months. These statistics are Experimental Statistics and are subject to revisions. Further information is provided later in this publication.The government announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) on 20 March 2020. CJRS supports employers through the COVID-19 period. Employers are able to claim CJRS support for employees furloughed from 1 March 2020. Up to 30 June 2020, CJRS provided employers with financial support of up to 80% of their employees\u2019 salaries. This support is capped at \u00a32,500 per month per employee. Employers may also claim Employer National Insurance and minimum automatic enrolment pension contributions. Starting from 1 July 2020, except in certain exceptional circumstances, staff who have not already been furloughed under the scheme may not be included in claims for support. Further changes from 1 August and 1 September \u2013 as described later in this bulletin \u2013 reduced the total level of support available for each furloughed employee.This release extends the daily time series presented in the last release up to the end of July and includes a snapshot of furloughing by region and for flexible furloughing at 31 July.Claims data for August 2020 is currently too incomplete to produce reliable figures. Statistics on the use of the CJRS in August and onwards will be included in future publications.The previous CJRS statistics release published in August 2020 reported that in total, 9.6 million employments had been furloughed through CJRS (32% of eligible employments) for at least part of the period between March to June 2020. These claims were made by 1.16 million employers, with 61% of eligible employers claiming.Contact detailsFor queries or feedback on this publication, please contact:\tPeter LumbFor press queries, please contact:\tDan Allen, tel: 03000 585 024\tLisa Billard, tel: 07773 091 264Next releaseThe next release will be published on 22 October 2020. This date has been amended from 16 October as announced on GOV.UK.Main pointsThe key points from this release covering the period to 31 July 2020 are below. Figures for 31 July are provisional and subject to revision as additional claims for the period are received.\tthe CJRS claims data for July is not yet complete as claims for periods from 1 July onwards may still be made - this means that the figures for July are preliminary and are likely to be revised upwards somewhat in future releases\tfollowing on from the last release which covered the period to 30 June, preliminary estimates show that furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to 31 July\tsince the peak of 8.9 million employments furloughed on 8 May, followed by reductions in June, preliminary figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to fall throughout July to 4.8 million on 31 July - it is estimated that this figure could be in the region of 10% higher, or around 5.3 million once all returns are received and revisions made\tfurloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.85 million employments - by 31 July, initial figures show 789,000 jobs furloughed in this sector \u2013 a decrease of more than a half since the peak for the sector\tacross all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between 30 June and 31 July\tas at 31 July, the sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furloughed that were actually furloughed was arts, entertainment and recreation at 45% followed by accommodation and food services sector at 43% - in all, 58% of employers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of July and 57% of employers in accommodation and food services\toverall, where it was possible to link the CJRS data on individual furloughed employments to other data, for the UK as a whole, 2.26 million women were furloughed at the end of July compared with 2.15 million men\tpreliminary estimates show there was broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of July - London had the highest take-up rate of 17% against the UK average of 16%\tin most countries and regions more women than men were furloughed at 31 July, the greatest exception to this being the West Midlands where 187,000 women were furloughed and 197,000 men\talmost 200,000 employers were using flexible furlough at the end of July for at least one job - in total over 950,000 employments were on flexible furlough at the end of July \u2013 about 20% of all furloughed employments\tat 29%, the accommodation and food services sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed flexibly\tbased on the preliminary data for 31 July, the South West has the highest proportion of employments on flexible furlough at 25% and London has the highest proportion of employments furloughed on a full-time basis at 82%About the data in this releaseThe data used in this release comprises the CJRS claims made up to 31 August 2020. Where possible, this data has been matched with other HMRC data to enable additional analysis to be presented. This bulletin includes breakdowns of CJRS claims as follows:\tthe number of employments furloughed by day, also broken down by sector and employer sizeThe use of CJRS as at 31 July by:\temployer size\tsector of the economyNew additions / expanded tables\tthe use of flexible (partial) furlough by sector and region as at 31 July\tfurloughed employments by region and gender as at 31 JulyThese statistics have been produced using data from both the CJRS and HMRC\u2019s Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI) system. Following user feedback, we continued to include details of the number of employments furloughed each day. We would welcome any further feedback from users. This should be sent to CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk. User responses will then be taken into consideration when developing future releases.For these statistics, an \u2018employer\u2019 is defined as a PAYE scheme, and \u2018employments\u2019 are defined according to the CJRS criteria; further details are within the background section.As with previous releases, where we have been unable to match the CJRS claims with other HMRC data, we have denoted this as \u2018unknown\u2019 in the tables within this release.The release reports a CJRS take-up rate for both employers and employments, where appropriate. The take-up rate has been calculated using PAYE RTI data, to estimate the eligible population of both employers and employments. An individual with employments with more than one employer is counted once for each employment furloughed.Rounding has been applied to the figures in the tables accompanying this release this release, with counts rounded to the nearest 100 and amounts to the nearest million.Employments furloughed over timeThis section of the release presents the number of employments furloughed each day from the scheme\u2019s start up to 31 July 2020. The figures for July 2020 are based on incomplete data and should be considered to be provisional and subject to change. This is because claims for staff furloughed from July onwards can still be submitted. It is estimated that the overall total number of people furloughed at the end of July will be in the region of 10% higher once all claims are submitted and revisions applied. A further consequence of it being still possible to submit claims is that the available data is not complete enough to reasonably reliably extend the daily series after the end of July.While the job retention scheme was announced on 20 March 2020, claims for furloughed staff could be made extending back to 1 March 2020 for jobs had already been furloughed in the period 1 March to 19 March 2020; therefore the daily series included in this release start before the scheme was announced.The data presented in this section comes from the total number of furloughed staff included in each claim. Some additional detail about furlough periods is available from the job level data supplied with larger claims (covering 100 or more furloughed jobs) and it is planned to revise the series adding this extra information in the next release of these statistics. This change to the methodology may slightly reduce the size of the step changes in the series seen between months and apparent in the charts. The noticeable changes at the start of months, for example between May and June, may be the result of the combination of the easing of coronavirus restrictions and administrative decision-making cycles for some employers that pay their staff monthly.More details on the methodology can be found later in the bulletin.The figures show the total number of employments furloughed by day. Some employees have moved on and off furlough over time. Because not all furloughed employments have been furloughed at the same time, the peak figures in the time series are lower than the total number of jobs furloughed at any time up to the end of June and published in the August release. That figure is 9.6 million. Additional jobs could normally not be newly furloughed after the end of June. The August release of these statistics also provides more detail on the overall total jobs that have been furloughed at any time since the start of the scheme.Where figure 1 shows a reduction in the number of employments furloughed, it should not necessarily be inferred that employees have returned to work or alternatively that employments has ended. The data presented here should be interpreted in this context.The key points to note from this figure are:\tinitially the number of employments furloughed increased quickly following the announcement of the scheme on 20 March, reaching 4.8 million on 23 March and 6.8 million by the end of March\tfollowing further strong growth at the start of April the number of employments furloughed increased gradually and peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May 2020\tafter the early May peak, the number of employments furloughed decreased slowly before a fall of around 670,000 employments between the end of May and the start of June\tthe number of employments that were furloughed then continued reduce throughout June to 6.8 million on 30 June\tpreliminary figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease throughout July to 4.8 million on 31 July. As discussed above this figure will be revised in future releases. It is estimated that the figure could be in the region of 10% higher, or around 5.3 million once all returns are received and revisions madeFigure 1: Total employments furloughed, 1 March 2020 to 31 July 2020Source: HMRC CJRS dataEmployments furloughed over time by industryThis section breaks down of the overall time series included above by the employer\u2019s industrial sector.The key points to note from this are:\tfollowing on from the last release which covered the period to 30 June, preliminary estimates show that furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to 31 July\tfurloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.85 million employments. By 1 June 2020 there had been a net decrease of 361,000 in this sector dropping further to 1.32 million employments furloughed by 30 June. By 31 July, initial figures show 789,000 jobs furloughed in this sector \u2013 a decrease of more than a half since the peak for the sector\taccommodation and food services peaked at 1.62 million employments furloughed on 10 April, with a net decline of 319,000 employments to 1.31 million furloughed by 30 June, by 31 July provisional figures show 942,000 people furloughed in the sector\tthe manufacturing sector had a peak of 908,200 employments furloughed on 17 April, this reduced to 582,600 by 30 June, and a provisional total of 422,000 at the end of July\tin construction, furloughing peaked on 14 April with 721,000 employments furloughed, with this falling to 403,000 employments on 30 June. Furloughing of jobs in this sector decreased further to 277,000 (provisional figure) at the end of July. This was the largest proportionate decrease from the peak across all sectors (62%) except for energy production and supply but that sector had far fewer employments furloughed\tfurloughing in arts and entertainment sector peaked later than other sectors on 15 May 2020 with 461,000 employments furloughed on that date. To 30 June there was been a net decrease of 62,000 employments furloughed in this sector and by the end of July provisional figures show 303,000 jobs furloughed \u2013 a decrease of about a third from the peakFigure 2: Total employments furloughed by industry (millions) (largest 15 sectors), 23 March to 31 July 2020Source: HMRC CJRS dataEmployments furloughed over time by employer sizeIn addition to the sectoral breakdown we also provide a breakdown of the number of employments furloughed per day by employer size. The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed. As with the cumulative employer size breakdown, we assume a PAYE scheme to be equivalent of an employer.Presented in figure 3 below is a set of small charts, one for each employer size band. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the accompanying spreadsheet. The key points to note here are:\tacross all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between 30 June and 31 July\tover 3.4 million employments were furloughed by large employers with 250 or more employments on 5 May (the peak for this category), this reduced to 2.8 million employments furloughed by 30 June. By 31 July, provisional figures indicate that furloughed employments among the largest employers had fallen to 1.7 million \u2013 the largest proportionate decrease across all employer size bands since the peak (51%)\temployers with 20 to 49 employments had a peak of 1.15 million employments furloughed on 17 April, compared with a peak of 796,200 for employers with 100 to 249 employments on 1 May\temployers with one employment had a peak of 295,700 employments furloughed on 20 April, compared to 219,400 employments furloughed on 30 June. A net decline of 76,300. This decreased further to 176,000 (provisional) by the end of JulyFigure 3: Total employments furloughed (millions) by employer size (number of employees), 23 March to 31 July 2020Source: HMRC CJRS dataFurloughing by Employer Size at 31 JulyWhere it has been possible to match CJRS data to Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI), we have estimated the size of each employer in terms of number of employees potentially eligible for CJRS support.For this data, we have assumed that PAYE scheme is the equivalent to an employer. For some employers, this is not an exact one-to-one equivalent. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls for different groups of employees and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one PAYE scheme. However, in our view PAYE schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release. The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed.The key points to note from tables 1a and 1b are, as at 31 July:\tprovisional figures for 31 July show 39% of employers had staff furloughed at that date under CJRS and 16% of employments were furloughed\temployers with 20 to 49 employees were most likely to have claimed under CJRS to support the furloughing of staff, with 67% employers of this size having at least 1 employee furloughed\temployers with 250 or more employees had a provisional total of 1.67 million employments furloughed at 31 July.

The take-up rate is also reported in this table for both employments and employers. This is presented in tables 2a and 2b, below. Key points from these tables are, as at 31 July:\tthe sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furloughed that were actually furloughed was arts, entertainment and recreation at 45% followed by accommodation and food services sector at 43%. In all, 58% of employers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of July and 57% of employers in accommodation and food services\tthe wholesale and retail sector was responsible for the greatest total value of claims up to the end of July at \u00a36.6 billion. Accommodation and food services and manufacturing were the two sectors with the next highest values of claims to date by the end of August, with \u00a35.2 billion and \u00a34.2 billion claimed respectively)More details on this are available in the methodology section.Table 2a: CJRS claims by sector as at 31 July 2020 \u2013 employer level\tSector\tEmployers furloughing staff\tTake-up rate\tValue of claims made for periods to 31 July (\u00a3 million)\tAgriculture, forestry and fishing\t5,000\t15%\t109\tMining and quarrying\t400\t34%\t69\tManufacturing\t49,100\t50%\t4,247\tEnergy production and supply\t400\t32%\t92\tWater supply, sewerage and waste\t2,500\t45%\t187\tConstruction\t89,500\t39%\t3,203\tWholesale and retail; repair of motor vehicles\t113,100\t47%\t6,570\tTransportation and storage\t28,000\t39%\t1,853\tAccommodation and food services\t72,200\t57%\t5,229\tInformation and communication\t43,600\t28%\t987\tFinance and insurance\t10,600\t31%\t322\tReal estate\t19,900\t43%\t592\tProfessional, scientific and technical\t108,500\t35%\t2,551\tAdministrative and support services\t69,300\t42%\t3,140\tPublic administration and defence; social security\t300\t4%\t70\tEducation\t18,900\t49%\t1,008\tHealth and social work\t39,100\t39%\t1,242\tArts, entertainment and recreation\t22,900\t58%\t1,497\tOther service activities\t43,600\t47%\t1,030\tHouseholds\t3,300\t4%\t34\tUnknown and other\t12,100\t-\t199\tTotal\t752,300\t39%\t34,231Source: HMRC CJRS and PAYE Real Time Information data and Inter-Departmental Business RegisterTable 2b: CJRS claims by sector as at 31 July \u2013 employment level\tSector\tEmployments furloughed\tTake-up rate\tAgriculture, forestry and fishing\t15,000\t8%\tMining and quarrying\t6,000\t11%\tManufacturing\t421,600\t17%\tEnergy production and supply\t5,000\t4%\tWater supply, sewerage and waste\t18,100\t10%\tConstruction\t277,000\t22%\tWholesale and retail; repair of motor vehicles\t788,800\t17%\tTransportation and storage\t208,000\t16%\tAccommodation and food services\t942,300\t43%\tInformation and communication\t143,500\t12%\tFinance and insurance\t45,300\t4%\tReal estate\t76,800\t18%\tProfessional, scientific and technical\t380,200\t17%\tAdministrative and support services\t515,000\t19%\tPublic administration and defence; social security\t8,100\t1%\tEducation\t204,400\t6%\tHealth and social work\t236,300\t6%\tArts, entertainment and recreation\t303,000\t45%\tOther service activities\t180,800\t32%\tHouseholds\t4,100\t3%\tUnknown and other\t34,900\t-\tTotal\t4,814,500\t16%Source: HMRC CJRS and PAYE Real Time Information data and Inter-Departmental Business RegisterGeography \u2013 Countries and Regions at 31 July including gender breakdownWe also provide geographic breakdown of CJRS claims based on the residential address information that HMRC holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee\u2019s usual place of work, or employer\u2019s centre of operations which may be in a different region. For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England.Figure 4 shows the number of furloughed employments by each of the English regions, and the totals for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For some employments it has not been possible so far to link the employment to the employees\u2019 area of residence and these are included in the unknown category.The key points from this figure are as at 31 July (provisional figures):\tLondon and the South East accounted for over 1.32 million of the furloughed employments\tthe East Midlands and West Midlands had a total of 675,200 employments furloughed under CJRS\tWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined had 664,900 employments claimed for under CJRS\toverall, where it was possible to link the data, across the UK as a whole, 2.26 million women were furloughed at the end of July compared with 2.15 million men. However, for 482,000 employments it had not been possible to link the furloughed employments to other HMRC data to determine the region of residence and gender of the furloughed employees\tin most countries and regions more women than men were furloughed at 31 July, the greatest exception to this begin the West Midlands where 197,000 women were furloughed and 187,000 menFigure 4: CJRS Furloughed employments as at 31 July by region and country\tRegion\tFemale\tMale\tTotal\tLondon\t364,200\t355,600\t719,800\tSouth East\t325,300\t281,500\t606,800\tNorth West\t227,600\t226,100\t453,700\tEast\t212,000\t183,200\t395,200\tWest Midlands\t186,700\t197,000\t383,700\tSouth West\t190,400\t167,100\t357,500\tYorkshire And The Humber\t158,200\t157,700\t315,900\tEast Midlands\t150,400\t141,100\t291,500\tNorth East\t71,500\t71,300\t142,800\tWales\t100,000\t95,600\t195,600\tScotland\t182,900\t183,800\t366,700\tNorthern Ireland\t50,700\t51,900\t102,600Source: HMRC CJRS and PAYE Real Time InformationFigures 5 and 6 show the take-up rate of employments furloughed within each country and region using CJRS, with figure 6 providing a gender breakdown.The key points to note from figures 5 and 6 are as at 31 July (provisional figures):\tin figure 5, preliminary estimates show there was broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of July (provisional data).

It was not possible under the scheme for an employee to, for example, work half their normal hours and for the employer to claim furlough support under CJRS for the remaining hours. From 1 July additional flexibility was introduced into the scheme whereby employees could be partially furloughed. Under this type of arrangement, the employee would work part of their normal hours for their employer and be furloughed for the rest of the time. Both part-time and full-time employees can be furloughed for part of their contracted hours under flexible furlough arrangements.The key points to note, as per the provisional figures for 31 July:\t199,300 employers had at least one employment on flexible furlough\tat 29%, the Accommodation and food services sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed flexibly\t955,200 employments were on flexible furlough: 20% of the total employments on furlough\t3.5 million employments were furloughed on a full-time basis, 73% of the total employments on furlough. Due to missing information on some furloughed employments \u2013 for example incomplete or not fully processed spreadsheet-type returns for employers furloughing 100 or more staff \u2013 mean that whether an employee has been flexibly furloughed is not known in 7% of cases. This figure should reduce over timeFigure 7: Employees furloughed at 31 July by SectorSource: HMRC CJRS and PAYE Real Time InformationUse of flexible furlough at 31 July by country and regionThe spreadsheet file accompanying this release additionally provides figures for the proportion of the workforce furloughed in each area and sector. The analysis is based on where employees live rather than where they work.The key points to note, as at 31 July (provisional data):\tthe South East had the highest number of staff flexibly furloughed at 31 July (131,000) and the South West had the highest proportion of employments on flexible furlough at 25%.

It works by providing grants to employers of up to a maximum 80% of salary to a maximum value of \u00a32,500 per employee (until the end of August). Up to the end of July, the scheme also met some of the cost of employer pension contributions and the employer National Insurance Contributions.The scheme is based around HMRC\u2019s Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system. For an employer to qualify for the scheme they need to have created a PAYE scheme by 19 March 2020. In these statistics, an employer is defined as a PAYE scheme.The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the scheme are set out in guidance, and two of the key rules are that the furloughed employee must have been employed on 19 March 2020 and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (RTI) submission to HMRC for the employee by this date. Further information on the qualifying criteria are available on the GOV.UK website.Changes to the scheme from 1 JulyFrom 1 July 2020, employers have the flexibility to bring furloughed employees back to work part time. Additionally, employers have the flexibility to decide the hours and shift patterns of their employees \u2013 with the government continuing to pay 80% of salaries for the hours they do not work. From 1 September 2020, the scheme has supported 70% of salaries for the hours for hours not worked. When claiming the CJRS grant for furloughed hours, employers will need to report and claim for a minimum period of a week.The scheme closed to new entrants from 30 June 2020. After this date, employers have only been able to furlough employees they furloughed for a full three-week period prior to 30 June 2020.As a consequence of the closure of the scheme to additional employees and the minimum three-week furlough period that applied until the end of June, the final date that an employer could have furloughed an employee for the first time was 10 June 2020. Employers had until 31 July 2020 to make any claims in respect of the period to 30 June 2020. A small number of claims have been made since this date. These claims relate to exceptions as set out in the CJRS guidance (for example, for employees being furloughed who have been absent from work and who had been paid Statutory Maternity Pay).GlossaryAn employer is defined within this release as a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Scheme. In some circumstances this does not map directly to what is commonly understood to be an employer. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls, and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one PAYE scheme. However, in our view PAYE schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.An employment is defined within this release as anyone who meets the scheme criteria set out within the published guidance. We have applied this definition in order to keep the presentation simple and the difficulty in separating out Office Holders (such as directors) from what are generally considered employees. Further information on the eligibility criteria is set out in the background section above.Measuring the dataData source and collectionThe data for this release comes from HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 CJRS claims. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies, and it will allow for more detailed estimates of the population.The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. As a result, the series are subject to revisions.Additional data from HMRC\u2019s Real Time Information system has been matched with CJRS data in order to produce the statistics released here.CoverageThis publication covers all CJRS claims made by employers from the start of the scheme up to 31 August 2020 for support for the wages of furloughed staff up to 31 July 2020.Upcoming changesFuture bulletins are planned to include additional statistics. The further analysis will be informed by user feedback. Please email CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk if you would like to offer feedback on how the contents can be improved in the future.MethodologyThis section provides notes on the methodology and implications for interpreting the figures.The statistics in this release count employments. Therefore, an employee with jobs at two employers will be counted twice if both jobs are furloughed.The take-up figures and the breakdown by employer size are based on a list of employees employed on 19 March 2020 and included in PAYE Real Time Information submissions for the 2019 to 2020 tax year. Only employments in RTI submissions received by HMRC by 19 March 2020 are counted. Following the criteria for qualifying for the scheme, this is supplemented by a list of people who were employed on 28 February 2020 but who left their job before 19 March and who were later re-employed by the same employer.In some circumstances HMRC holds incomplete information about employments, for example where a leaving date had not been submitted by employer. In this situation, an estimate of the probability that an individual was employed on the qualifying dates has been used. The assessment of whether a person was employed on the qualifying dates is based on the methodology used for the joint HMRC/ONS statistics release, Earnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information.Employers making claims for 100 or more employees are required to submit the details of the employees furloughed in a spreadsheet-type file. While these claims have been processed from a customer service perspective, the processing of this information for these statistics has been complex and the processing of data on some employments has not been completed. This is a factor behind the unknown category in the tables. The completeness of this data has gradually improved since the first release, and we expect some further (smaller) improvements.The geographic and flexible furlough breakdowns of employments include all employees that employers have furloughed where it has been possible to link claim data on furloughed employments to classifying information (such as the employee\u2019s gender and address). The linking has been performed using employees\u2019 National Insurance numbers to data held within HMRC\u2019s Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI) system. When the employer-submitted National Insurance numbers are not of sufficient quality to be matched with other HMRC data, the employments have been categorised as \u2018unknown\u2019.The geographic breakdowns in the tables and maps use a postcode lookup file from Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to link UK postcodes to geographic areas.Industrial sector information is based on the Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR) produced by the ONS. Where PAYE schemes are absent from the IDBR, we have used sector information from Companies House, linking on employer name where possible. This provides Standard Industrial Classification codes (UK SIC 2007) for employers that have made a claim. Where we have unable to determine SIC codes, we have reported the sector as \u2018unknown\u2019. The descriptions of the SIC 2007 sections used have been amended since the last release to better align with the standard SIC 2007 section descriptions as published by the Office for National Statistics (the categorisation used itself remains the standard groupings and is unchanged).The time series in this bulletin show figures for the number of employments furloughed each day, using all claims submitted to HMRC by 31 August 2020. The closing date for claims for periods to the end of June was 31 July but claims for July onwards may be submitted until after the scheme closes at the end of October. Whilst we have been able to produce time series up to the end of July, at the time of the preparation of this bulletin the data available for August was not complete enough to produce reliable statistics. We will reassess the position for the next release.In producing the time series statistics some challenges had to be tackled. These included dealing with data on amendments to claims and claims for overlapping periods. In addition, claims for 100 or more furloughed staff may include staff furloughed for varying periods. These factors combined with some incomplete data (as mentioned above) make counting the number of employees furloughed over time complex. The method employed is designed to generally prevent overcounting employments and may in certain circumstances very slightly undercount. Consequently, for the period to the end of June, the time series presented in this bulletin may typically slightly undercount the number of furloughed employments. Some additional detail about furlough periods is available from the job level data supplied with larger claims (covering 100 or more furloughed jobs) and it is planned to revise the series adding this extra information in the next release of these statistics. This change to the methodology may slightly reduce the size of the step changes in the series seen between months and apparent in the charts. We are working on possible refinements to address the points above and expect to complete this in time for the October publication. We will revise the figures if appropriate.For July 2020, the claims data is incomplete, and the series should be considered to be preliminary. It is estimated that the overall total number of people furloughed at the end of July will be in the region of 10% higher once all claims are submitted and revisions applied.Questions and feedback on these statistics will be welcomed and can be sent to CJRS.statistics.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk.Strengths and limitationsHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) grants pre-release access to Official Statistics publications, and in accordance with the HMRC policy, pre-release access has been granted to a number of people to enable the preparation of a ministerial briefing. Further details, including a list of those granted access, can be found on HMRC\u2019s website.Experimental Statistics statusThe release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.Rather than waiting until the development work has been completed, the statistics are being published now to involve potential users in developing the statistics. We hope that this encourages users to provide us with their thoughts and suggestions of how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. Comments can be sent by email to CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk.More information about what it means for Official Statistics to be classified as Experimental Statistics is available from the Office for Statistics Regulation.Office for Statistics regulation reviewThese statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events. The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics and regards them as consistent with the Code\u2019s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.Strengths of the dataThe data used in this release includes all claims made by employers up until 31 August 2020 and thus covers the complete employer population having made at least one CJRS claim. We have linked CJRS data to Pay As You Earn Real Time Information data (PAYE RTI) to provide the additional information presented in this release.RevisionsThe figures in this release incorporate data on claims received by HMRC up to 31 August and cover employments furloughed up to 30 July 2020. The figures presented for July will be revised to reflect additional claims for July made during September. In future iterations of this statistics release there will be some further revisions reflecting improvements to the data processing and methodology.Related linksEarnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information, UK: September 2020 - Employee and earnings statistics from PAYE Real Time Information.Labour market in the regions of the UK: September 2020 - Regional breakdowns of changes in UK employment, unemployment and economic activityEmployment in the UK: September 2020 - Estimates of employment, unemployment and economic inactivity for the UK.Average weekly earnings in Great Britain: September 2020 - Estimates of growth in earnings for employees before tax and other deductions from pay.HMRC coronavirus (COVID-19) statistics - Collection of HMRC data regarding COVID-19 response initiatives and policy.

This release provides analysis of claims for periods up to 31 October 2020. The data used includes claims submitted to HMRC by 30 November 2020.In this release the daily time series of employments supported by the CJRS are extended to the end of October. These statistics also include analysis of the use of CJRS as at 31 October and revised figures for the period from July to September incorporating additional claims submitted up to the 30 November deadline.We will continue to publish statistics on the Job Retention Scheme and the CJRS extension in future months. These statistics are Experimental Statistics and are subject to revisions. Further information is provided later in this publication.The government announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) on 20 March 2020. CJRS supports employers in paying their employees. Employers have been able to claim CJRS support for employees furloughed from 1 March 2020. Up to 30 June 2020, CJRS provided employers with financial support of up to 80% of their employees\u2019 salaries. This support is capped at \u00a32,500 per month per employee. Employers were also able to claim Employer National Insurance and minimum automatic enrolment pension contributions.For the period 1 July 2020 to 31 October, except in certain exceptional circumstances, staff who had not already been furloughed under the scheme could not be included in claims for support. Changes to the scheme from the start of August, September and October \u2013 as described later in this bulletin \u2013 gradually reduced the total level of support available for each furloughed employee up to the end of October.The government has announced an extension to CJRS to support individuals and businesses who are impacted by disruption caused by coronavirus (COVID-19). The CJRS will remain open until 30 April 2021. For claim periods from 1 November 2020 to 30 April 2021, employers with a PAYE scheme can claim 80% of an employee\u2019s usual salary for hours not worked, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month.See guidance on applying for support from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and further details.Contact detailsFor queries or feedback on this publication, please contact:\tClaire BreezeFor press queries, please contact:\tDan Allen, tel: 03000 585 024\tLisa Billard, tel: 07773 091 264Next releaseThe next release will be published in January 2021.Main pointsThe key points from this release covering the period to 31 October 2020 are below. Figures for July 2020 to September 2020 have been revised to take into account additional claims received after the cut-off for the previous November release of these statistics.\tfollowing on from the last release which covered the period to 30 September, figures show that furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to 31 October\tsince the peak of 8.9 million employments furloughed on 8 May, followed by reductions in June, figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to fall throughout July, August and September to 5.4 million at 31 July and 3.8 million at 31 August and 2.8 million at 30 September. Latest figures show that the number of employments has continued to fall throughout October to 2.4 million at 31 October. This is a reduction of 73% from the peak\tfurloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.9 million employments. At 31 October, there were 356,400 employments furloughed in this sector \u2013 a decrease of more than 80% since the peak for the sector\tas at 31 October, the sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furlough that were actually furloughed was the accommodation and food services sector at 27% followed by arts, entertainment and recreation at 24%. In all, 45% of employers in both the accommodation and food services sector and the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of October\tacross all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between 30 September and 31 October\toverall, where it was possible to link the data, across the UK, 1.19 million women were furloughed at 31 October compared with 1.14 million men. This is a decrease of 229,700 women and 210,400 men when compared to 30 September\tthere was a broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of October. London had the highest take-up rate of 10% against the UK average of 8%\tin most countries and regions more women than men were furloughed at 31 October, the exceptions to this being London where 210,300 women were furloughed and 220,900 men, and West Midlands where 93,500 women were furloughed and 96,800 men\t196,400 employers had at least one employment on flexible furlough at the end of October. In total 977,200 employments were on flexible furlough at the end of October, 41% of all furloughed employments\tat 50%, the other service activities sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed partially. This was followed by the accommodation and food services sector at 48%\tat 48%, South West had the highest proportion of employments partially furloughedAbout the data in this releaseThe data used in this release comprises the CJRS claims made up to 30 November 2020. Where possible, this data has been matched with other HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) data to enable additional analysis to be presented. As previously, this bulletin includes figures for the use of the CJRS as follows:\t    the number of employments furloughed by day, also broken down by sector and employer size  \t    the number of employments furloughed by day, for July onwards broken down by:    \tcountry and region\tgender\tage\ttype of furlough (fully furloughed or flexible (partial) furlough)  Updated and revised tables:\tfigures for the use of CJRS as at 31 October by the following categories (together with revised figures for the use of CJRS as at 31 July, 31 August and 30 September):    \temployer size\tsector\tcountry and region, including a gender breakdown\tlocal authority, including a gender breakdown\tparliamentary constituency, including a gender breakdown\tage, including a gender breakdown\tregion and sector  These statistics have been produced using data from both the CJRS and HMRC\u2019s Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI) system. They have been developed taking into account user feedback and requests. We would welcome any further feedback from users. This should be sent to CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk. Responses will then be taken into consideration when developing future releases.For these statistics, an \u2018employer\u2019 is defined as a PAYE scheme, and \u2018employments\u2019 are defined according to the CJRS criteria. Further details are within the background section.As with previous releases, where we have been unable to match the CJRS claims with other HMRC data, we have denoted this as \u2018unknown\u2019 in the tables within this release.The release reports a CJRS take-up rate for both employers and employments, where appropriate. The take-up rate has been calculated using PAYE RTI data, to estimate the eligible population of both employers and employments. An individual with employments with more than one employer is counted once for each employment furloughed.Rounding has been applied to the figures in the tables accompanying this release, with counts rounded to the nearest 100 and amounts to the nearest million.\u2003Employments furloughed over timeThis section of the release presents the number of employments furloughed each day from the scheme\u2019s start up to 31 October 2020. In previous releases, the figures for 1 July 2020 onwards were based on incomplete data as claims for support from the CJRS could be submitted until 30 November. The figures presented previously for July to September were therefore subject to revision as more data was submitted. The deadline for claims for the periods covered by this bulletin has now passed and thus the figures are not expected to be revised due to receipt of additional claims.While the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced on 20 March 2020, claims for furloughed staff could be made extending back to 1 March 2020 for jobs which had already been furloughed in the period 1 March to 19 March 2020. Therefore, the daily series included in this release starts before the scheme was announced.The data presented in this section comes from combining detail about furlough periods from the job level data supplied with larger claims (claims with 100 or more furloughed jobs) and the total number of furloughed staff included in each claim.More details on the methodology can be found later in this bulletin.The figures show the total number of employments furloughed by day. Some employees have moved on and off furlough over time. Because not all furloughed employments have been furloughed at the same time, the peak figures in the time series are lower than the cumulative total number of jobs furloughed at any time up to the end of June. This is published in the management information on the scheme and included in the August release. That figure is 9.6 million. Additional jobs could normally not be newly furloughed after the end of June.Where figure 1 shows a reduction in the number of employments furloughed, it should not necessarily be inferred that employees have returned to work or alternatively that employments has ended. The data presented here should be interpreted in this context.The key points to note from figure 1 are:\tinitially the number of employments furloughed increased quickly following the announcement of the scheme on 20 March, reaching 4.8 million on 23 March and 6.8 million by the end of March\tfollowing further strong growth at the start of April the number of employments furloughed increased gradually and peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May 2020\tafter the early May peak, the number of employments furloughed decreased slowly before a fall of around 670,000 employments between the end of May and the start of June\tthe number of employments that were furloughed then continued to reduce throughout June to 6.8 million at 30 June\tthe number of employments furloughed continued to fall throughout July, August and September to 5.4 million at 31 July, 3.8 million at 31 August and 2.8 million at 30 September\tlatest figures show that the number of employments furloughed has continued to fall through October to 2.4 million at 31 October. This is a reduction of 73% from the peakFigure 1: Total employments furloughed, 1 March 2020 to 31 October 2020Employments furloughed over time by industryThis section breaks down the overall time series included above by the employer\u2019s industrial sector. Figure 2 is a set of charts, one for each industrial sector. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the accompanying spreadsheet.The key points to note from figure 2 are:\tfollowing on from the last release which covered the period to 30 September, the data shows that furloughing of staff across all sectors continued to decrease up to 31 October\tfurloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.85 million employments furloughed. This dropped to 1.33 million employments furloughed at 30 June, 598,900 at 31 August and 356,400 employments furloughed at 31 October\taccommodation and food services peaked at 1.65 million employments furloughed on 10 April. There was a net decline of 325,700 employments to 1.32 million employments furloughed at 30 June. The number of employments continued to fall to 745,800 employments furloughed at 31 August and 601,400 at 31 October\tthe manufacturing sector had a peak of 911,000 employments furloughed on 17 April. This reduced to 583,600 at 30 June, 329,400 at 31 August and 188,200 at 31 October\tin construction, furloughing peaked on 14 April with 723,600 employments furloughed, with this falling to 404,200 employments furloughed at 30 June, 204,400 at 31 August and 130,700 at 31 October\tfurloughing in arts and entertainment sector peaked later than other sectors on 15 May 2020 with 455,100 employments furloughed on that date. To 30 June there had been a net decrease of 61,700 to 393,400 employments furloughed in this sector. Figures for this sector show 262,800 employments furloughed at 31 August and 159,600 employments furloughed at 31 OctoberFigure 2: Total employments furloughed by industry (millions) (largest 15 sectors), 23 March to 31 October 2020Employments furloughed over time by employer sizeIn addition to the sectoral breakdown we also provide a breakdown of the number of employments furloughed per day by employer size. The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed. We assume a PAYE scheme to be equivalent of an employer.Presented in figure 3 is a set of charts, one for each employer size band. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the accompanying spreadsheet.The key points to note from figure 3 are:\tacross all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed continued to decrease between 30 September and 31 October\t3.45 million employments were furloughed by large employers with 250 or more employments on 5 May (the peak for this category). This reduced to 2.82 million employments furloughed by 30 June, 1.34 million by 31 August and 737,000 employments furloughed by 31 October. This is the largest proportionate decrease across all employer size bands between the peak and 31 October (79%)\tlarge employers with 250 or more employments accounted for 31% of the employments furloughed at 31 October\temployers with 20 to 49 employments had a peak of 1.15 million employments furloughed on 16 April, compared with a peak of 795,400 for employers with 100 to 249 employments on 1 May\temployers with one employment had a peak of 295,700 employments furloughed on 20 April, compared to 219,400 employments furloughed at 30 June. A net decline of 76,300. Figures for this employer size show this decreased further to 159,800 employments furloughed at 31 August and 127,900 employments furloughed at 31 OctoberFigure 3: Total employments furloughed (millions) by employer size (number of employees), 23 March to 31 October 2020Employments furloughed over time by Country and RegionThis section provides a geographic breakdown of the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July up to 31 October. This is based on the residential address information that HMRC holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee\u2019s usual place of work, or employer\u2019s centre of operations which may be in a different region.For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see methodology section for more information).Presented in figure 4 is a set of charts, one for each region. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the accompanying spreadsheet.The key points to note from figure 4 are:\tacross Scotland and all English regions, the number of employments furloughed decreased from 30 September to 31 October. In Wales and Northern Ireland there were slight increases in the number of furloughed jobs across this period\ton 1 July there were 4.69 million employments furloughed in England. At 31 July this had fallen to 4.23 million employments furloughed and 3.09 million at 31 August. Figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to drop throughout September and October to 2.33 million at 30 September and 1.90 million at 31 October\tin London \u2013 the English region with the most furloughed staff from July to October, there were 905,100 employments furloughed on 1 July. This decreased by 63,200 to 841,900 employments furloughed at 31 July and 657,200 employments furloughed at 31 August. This figure continued to drop throughout September and October to 523,100 employments furloughed at 30 September and 431,200 at 31 October\tthe number of employments furloughed in Scotland on 1 July was 489,900. At 31 July this figure had fallen to 421,200 and at 31 August was 286,900. Through September and October this figure continued to fall to 216,500 at 30 September and 195,200 at 31 October\tthe number of employments furloughed in Wales was 247,300 on 1 July, this fell to 224,700 at 31 July and 109,600 at 30 September. At 31 October, the number of employments furloughed in Wales has risen again to 123,000\ton 1 July, the number of furloughed employments in Northern Ireland was 139,100. This fell to 119,400 employments furloughed at 31 July and 82,500 employments furloughed at 31 August. At 30 September 65,100 employments were furloughed and at 31 October the number of employments furloughed was 68,000Figure 4: Total employments furloughed (millions) by country and region, 1 July to 31 October 2020Employments furloughed over time by genderThis section provides new analysis showing the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July up to 31 October, broken down by the claimants\u2019 gender. The underlying data for figure 5 can be found in the accompanying spreadsheet. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see the methodology section for more information).The key points to note from figure 5 are:\tsince 1 July, more employments have been furloughed with female job holders than where the employee was male\tfor employments where the employee was female, there were 2.91 million employments furloughed on 1 July. This decreased to 2.60 million at 31 July and 1.92 million at 31 August. At 30 September this figure was 1.42 million and fell further to 1.19 million employments furloughed at 31 October\tfor employments where the employee was male, there were 2.72 million employments furloughed on 1 July. This reduced to 2.46 million at 31 July and 1.74 million at 31 August. This figure continued to decrease throughout September and October to 1.35 million at 30 September and 1.14 million at 31 October\tthe August CJRS statistics release reported cumulative figures for the March to June period. Over that period more jobs with male employees than female employees were furloughed. That finding refers to jobs that were furloughed at any time until the end of June when CJRS closed to additional employees being furloughed (rather than any specific point in time)Figure 5: Total employments furloughed by gender, 1 July to 31 October 2020Employments furloughed over time by ageThis section provides analysis for the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July up to 31 October, broken down by age band. The claimant\u2019s age is calculated at 1 March 2020. Figure 6 is a set of charts, one for each age band.The underlying data for figure 6 can be found in the accompanying spreadsheet. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see methodology section for more information).The key points to note from figure 6 are:\tfigures show that across all age bands the number of employments furloughed decreased between 1 July to 31 October\tfor employments where the employee was aged 25 to 34, the number of employments was 1.30 million on 1 July, the highest across all age bands. This decreased by 134,500 to 1.17 million employments furloughed at 31 July and fell further to 833,600 at 31 August. This continued to fall throughout September and October to 627,900 employments furloughed at 30 September and 526,000 at 31 October\tthe number of employments furloughed with employees in the 18 to 24 age band was 977,000 on 1 July, falling to 844,500 employments furloughed at 31 July. 558,600 employments were furloughed at 31 August, declining to 398,400 at 30 September and 325,300 at 31 October\twhere the employee was 65 or over, the number of employments furloughed was 243,400 on 1 July. Figures for this age band show the number of employments furloughed decreased to 225,800 at 31 July, 168,300 at 31 August and 132,500 at 30 September. The number of employments furloughed continued to fall through October to 111,900 at 31 OctoberFigure 6: Total employments furloughed (millions) by age of employee, 1 July to 31 October 2020Employments furloughed over time by furlough typeThis section provides a breakdown of the overall time series by employments furloughed fully and partially furloughed. On 1 July, the option was introduced for employers to furlough their employees for part of their usual hours, with the employee free to work the remainder. Therefore, the time series shown in figure 7 starts at 1 July.The underlying data for figure 7 can be found in the accompanying spreadsheet.The key points to note in figure 7 are:\tthe number of employments furloughed on a full-time basis has decreased month on month from July to October. The number of employments fully furloughed was 4.51 million at 1 July, falling to 3.97 million at 31 July and 2.51 million at 31 August. These figures continued to fall through September and October to 1.68 million at 30 September and 1.36 employments fully furloughed at 31 October\tthe number of employments claimed for while the employee was working some of their usual hours has remained steady since this was made possible on 1 July. At 1 July there were 1.15 million such employments with a small reduction to 977,200 at 31 October\talthough the number of partially furloughed employments has remained relatively constant between July and October, the jobs partially furloughed during this period may have changed over time. Some employments may have moved between full and partial furlough, others may have returned to work and some employments may have been terminatedFigure 7: Total employments furloughed by furlough type, 1 July to 31 October 2020Furloughing by employer size at 31 OctoberWhere it has been possible to match CJRS data to Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI), we have estimated the size of each employer in terms of number of employees potentially eligible for CJRS support.For this data, we have assumed that PAYE scheme is the equivalent to an employer. For some employers, this is not an exact one-to-one equivalent. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls for different groups of employees and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one PAYE scheme. However, in our view PAYE schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed.The key points to note from tables 1a and 1b are, as at 31 October:\t28% of employers had staff furloughed at 31 October under CJRS and 8% of employments were furloughed\tas at 31 October, employers with 250+ employees were most likely to have claimed under CJRS to support the furloughing of staff, with 49% of employers of this size having at least 1 employee furloughed\temployers with 250 or more employees had a total of 737,000 employments furloughed at 31 October, the highest of all employer sizes. However, this represents just 4% of employments eligible across employers of this size\tthe figures for the value of claims do not take account of voluntary repaymentsTable 1a: CJRS claims by employer size as at 31 October \u2013 employer level\tEmployer size\tEmployers furloughing staff\tTake-up rate\tValue of claims made for periods to 31 October (\u00a3 million)\t1\t127,900\t18%\t1,219\t2 to 4\t206,900\t31%\t3,841\t5 to 9\t88,000\t36%\t3,855\t10 to 19\t52,300\t38%\t4,094\t20 to 49\t40,500\t46%\t6,092\t50 to 99\t13,000\t45%\t3,780\t100 to 249\t7,800\t45%\t4,277\t250+\t5,700\t49%\t16,097\tUnknown\t700\t-\t60\tTotal\t542,900\t28%\t43,314Source: HMRC CJRS and PAYE Real Time Information dataTable 1b: CJRS claims by employer size as at 31 October \u2013 employment level\tEmployer size\tEmployments furloughed\tEligible employments\tTake-up rate\t1\t127,900\t727,600\t18%\t2 to 4\t363,300\t1,682,900\t22%\t5 to 9\t271,300\t1,547,800\t18%\t10 to 19\t246,000\t1,792,700\t14%\t20 to 49\t303,500\t2,615,200\t12%\t50 to 99\t164,100\t1,977,600\t8%\t100 to 249\t175,200\t2,606,900\t7%\t250+\t737,000\t17,402,300\t4%\tUnknown\t11,300\t-\t-\tTotal\t2,399,600\t30,353,200\t8%Source: HMRC CJRS and PAYE Real Time Information dataNote: the number of employments furloughed in the unknown size category is not directly comparable with the number of employers in the equivalent category in table 1a.Furloughing by sector at 31 OctoberThis section presents analysis of CJRS claims according to the primary economic sector of employers\u2019 activity. The take-up rate is also reported in this table for both employments and employers. This is presented in tables 2a and 2b, below.Key points from these tables are, as at 31 October:\tthe sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furlough that were actually furloughed was the accommodation and food services sector at 27% followed by arts, entertainment and recreation at 24%. In all, 45% of employers in both the accommodation and food services sector and the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of October\tthe wholesale and retail sector were responsible for the greatest total value of claims up to the end of October at \u00a38.0 billion. Accommodation and food services, and manufacturing were the two sectors with the next highest values of claims to date by the end of October, with \u00a36.9 billion and \u00a35.2 billion claimed respectivelyMore details on this are available in the methodology section.Table 2a: CJRS claims by sector as at 31 October 2020 \u2013 employer level\tSector\tEmployers furloughing staff\tTake-up rate\tValue of claims made for periods to 31 October (\u00a3 million)\tAgriculture, forestry and fishing\t3,100\t9%\t130\tMining and quarrying\t200\t23%\t99\tManufacturing\t35,300\t35%\t5,223\tEnergy production and supply\t300\t25%\t97\tWater supply, sewerage and waste\t1,700\t31%\t229\tConstruction\t59,300\t26%\t3,810\tWholesale and retail; repair of motor vehicles\t81,900\t34%\t7,962\tTransportation and storage\t21,100\t29%\t2,539\tAccommodation and food services\t58,700\t45%\t6,890\tInformation and communication\t32,300\t21%\t1,316\tFinance and insurance\t7,300\t21%\t399\tReal estate\t14,400\t31%\t753\tProfessional, scientific and technical\t81,800\t26%\t3,355\tAdministrative and support services\t51,000\t31%\t4,122\tPublic administration and defence; social security\t200\t3%\t54\tEducation\t12,400\t32%\t1,325\tHealth and social work\t24,800\t25%\t1,587\tArts, entertainment and recreation\t18,200\t45%\t1,974\tOther service activities\t33,700\t36%\t1,275\tHouseholds\t1,300\t2%\t44\tUnknown and other\t3,800\t-\t130\tTotal\t542,900\t28%\t43,314Source: HMRC CJRS and PAYE Real Time Information data and Inter-Departmental Business RegisterTable 2b: CJRS claims by sector as at 31 October \u2013 employment level\tSector\tEmployments furloughed\tTake-up rate\tAgriculture, forestry and fishing\t6,900\t4%\tMining and quarrying\t1,600\t3%\tManufacturing\t188,200\t8%\tEnergy production and supply\t900\t1%\tWater supply, sewerage and waste\t6,800\t4%\tConstruction\t130,700\t10%\tWholesale and retail; repair of motor vehicles\t356,400\t8%\tTransportation and storage\t121,600\t9%\tAccommodation and food services\t601,400\t27%\tInformation and communication\t76,900\t6%\tFinance and insurance\t19,100\t2%\tReal estate\t38,000\t9%\tProfessional, scientific and technical\t193,300\t9%\tAdministrative and support services\t213,400\t8%\tPublic administration and defence; social security\t5,000\t0%\tEducation\t62,500\t2%\tHealth and social work\t96,900\t2%\tArts, entertainment and recreation\t159,600\t24%\tOther service activities\t102,100\t18%\tHouseholds\t1,700\t1%\tUnknown and other\t16,700\t-\tTotal\t2,399,600\t8%Source: HMRC CJRS and PAYE Real Time Information data and Inter-Departmental Business RegisterFurloughing by countries and regions at 31 October including gender breakdownWe also provide a geographic breakdown of CJRS claims based on the residential address information that HMRC holds for employees.

Missing information on some furloughed employments \u2013 for example incomplete or not fully processed spreadsheet-type returns for employers furloughing 100 or more staff \u2013 means that whether an employee has been partially furloughed is not known in 3% of casesFigure 14: Employments fully and partially furloughed at 31 October, by sector\tSector\tEmployments fully furloughed\tEmployments partially furloughed\tTotal\tAgriculture, forestry and fishing\t4,400\t2,500\t6,900\tMining and quarrying\t1,100\t500\t1,600\tManufacturing\t100,300\t86,400\t188,200\tEnergy production and supply\t700\t200\t900\tWater supply, sewerage and waste\t4,600\t2,200\t6,800\tConstruction\t92,200\t37,900\t130,700\tWholesale and retail; repair of motor vehicles\t209,400\t143,700\t356,400\tTransportation and storage\t78,900\t41,000\t121,600\tAccommodation and food services\t264,000\t289,100\t601,400\tInformation and communication\t50,500\t25,800\t76,900\tFinance and insurance\t13,800\t5,200\t19,100\tReal estate\t27,900\t10,100\t38,000\tProfessional, scientific and technical\t127,800\t63,100\t193,300\tAdministrative and support services\t143,100\t67,700\t213,400\tPublic administration and defence; social security\t3,500\t1,300\t5,000\tEducation\t35,900\t26,200\t62,500\tHealth and social work\t52,700\t43,400\t96,900\tArts, entertainment and recreation\t84,800\t71,500\t159,600\tOther service activities\t50,300\t51,400\t102,100\tHouseholds\t1,000\t700\t1,700\tUnknown and other\t8,100\t7,300\t16,700Source: HMRC CJRS data and PAYE Real Time InformationFull and partial furlough use by Country and Region at 31 OctoberFigure 15 shows the number of employments fully and partially furloughed at 31 October by Country and Region.

It works by providing grants to employers of up to a maximum 80% of salary to a maximum value of \u00a32,500 per employee (until the end of August). Up to the end of July, the scheme also met some of the cost of employer pension contributions and the employer National Insurance Contributions.The scheme is based around HMRC\u2019s Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system. For an employer to qualify for the scheme they need to have created a PAYE scheme by 19 March 2020. In these statistics, an employer is defined as a PAYE scheme.The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the scheme are set out in guidance, and two of the key rules are that the furloughed employee must have been employed on 19 March 2020 and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (RTI) submission to HMRC for the employee by this date. Further information on the qualifying criteria is available online.The scheme closed to new entrants from 30 June 2020. After this date, employers have only been able to furlough employees they furloughed for a full three-week period prior to 30 June 2020.As a consequence of the closure of the scheme to additional employees and the minimum three-week furlough period that applied until the end of June, the final date that an employer could have furloughed an employee for the first time was 10 June 2020.Employers had until 31 July 2020 to make any claims in respect of the period to 30 June 2020. A small number of claims have been made since this date. These claims relate to exceptions as set out in the CJRS guidance (for example, for employees being furloughed who have been absent from work and who had been paid Statutory Maternity Pay).Changes to the scheme from 1 JulyFrom 1 July 2020, employers have the flexibility to bring furloughed employees back to work part time. Additionally, employers have the flexibility to decide the hours and shift patterns of their employees \u2013 with the government continuing to pay 80% of salaries for the hours they do not work.From 1 September 2020, the scheme supported 70% of salaries for hours not worked, reducing to 60% from 1 October 2020.When claiming the CJRS grant for furloughed hours, employers will need to report and claim for a minimum period of a week. Employers had until 30 November 2020 to submit claims for support from the CJRS.Changes to the scheme from 1 NovemberThe government has announced an extension to CJRS to support individuals and businesses who are impacted by disruption caused by coronavirus (COVID-19). The CJRS will remain open until 30 April 2021. For claim periods from 1 November 2020 to 30 April 2021, employers with a PAYE scheme can claim 80% of an employee\u2019s usual salary for hours not worked, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month.See guidance on applying for support from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and further details.GlossaryAn employer is defined within this release as a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Scheme. In some circumstances this does not map directly to what is commonly understood to be an employer. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls, and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one PAYE scheme. However, in our view PAYE schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.An employment is defined within this release as anyone who meets the scheme criteria set out within the published guidance. We have applied this definition in order to keep the presentation simple and the difficulty in separating out Office Holders (such as directors) from what are generally considered employees. Further information on the eligibility criteria is set out in the background section above.Measuring the dataData source and collectionThe data for this release comes from HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 CJRS claims. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies, and it will allow for more detailed estimates of the population.The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. As a result, the series are subject to revisions. Information about what the term Experimental Statistics means is published by the Office for National Statistics.Additional data from HMRC\u2019s Real Time Information system has been matched with CJRS data in order to produce the statistics released here.CoverageThis publication covers all CJRS claims made by employers from the start of the scheme up to 30 November 2020 for support for the wages of furloughed staff up to 31 October 2020.Upcoming changesThe next release of statistics on the Job Retention Scheme will include figures on the CJRS extension.MethodologyThis section provides notes on the methodology and implications for interpreting the figures.The statistics in this release count employments. Therefore (for example), an employee with jobs at two employers will be counted twice if both jobs are furloughed.The eligible population, used to calculate take-up figures and the breakdown by employer size, is based on a list of employees employed on 19 March 2020 and included in PAYE Real Time Information submissions for the 2019 to 2020 tax year.Only employments in RTI submissions received by HMRC by 19 March 2020 are counted. Following the criteria for qualifying for the scheme, this is supplemented by a list of people who were employed on 28 February 2020 but who left their job before 19 March and who were later re-employed by the same employer.In some circumstances HMRC holds incomplete information about employments, for example where a leaving date had not been submitted by employer. In this situation, an estimate of the probability that an individual was employed on the qualifying dates has been used. The assessment of whether a person was employed on the qualifying dates is based on the methodology used for the joint HMRC/ONS statistics release, Earnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information, last released in December 2020.Employers making claims for 100 or more employees at a time are required to submit the details of the employees furloughed in a spreadsheet-type file. While these claims have been processed from a customer service perspective, the processing of this information for these statistics has been complex and the processing of data on some employments has not been completed.This is a factor behind the unknown category in the tables. The completeness of this data has gradually improved since the first release, and we expect some further (smaller) improvements.The geographic and flexible furlough breakdowns of employments include all employees that employers have furloughed where it has been possible to link claim data on furloughed employments to classifying information (such as the employee\u2019s gender and address).The linking has been performed using employees\u2019 National Insurance numbers to data held within HMRC\u2019s Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI) system. When the employer-submitted National Insurance numbers are not of sufficient quality to be matched with other HMRC data, the employments have been categorised as \u2018unknown\u2019.The geographic breakdowns in the tables and maps use a postcode lookup file from Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to link UK postcodes to geographic areas.Industrial sector information is based on the Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR) produced by the ONS. Where PAYE schemes are absent from the IDBR, we have used sector information from Companies House, linking on employer name where possible.This provides Standard Industrial Classification codes (UK SIC 2007) for employers that have made a claim. Where we have unable to determine SIC codes, we have reported the sector as \u2018unknown\u2019.The time series in this bulletin show figures for the number of employments furloughed each day, using all claims submitted to HMRC by 30 November 2020. The closing date for claims for periods to the end of June was 31 July but schemes may submit claims for July onwards until 30 November.In producing the time series statistics some challenges had to be tackled. These included dealing with data on amendments to claims and claims for overlapping periods. In addition, claims for 100 or more furloughed staff may include staff furloughed for varying periods.These factors combined with some incomplete data (as mentioned above) make counting the number of employees furloughed over time complex. The method employed is designed to generally prevent overcounting employments and may in certain circumstances very slightly undercount.Consequently, for the period to the end of June, the time series presented in this bulletin may typically slightly undercount the number of furloughed employments.We welcome questions and feedback. Our email address is: cjrs.statistics.enquiries@hmrc.gov.ukStrengths and limitationsHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) grants pre-release access to Official Statistics publications, and in accordance with the HMRC policy, pre-release access has been granted to a number of people to enable the preparation of a ministerial briefing.Experimental Statistics statusThe release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.Rather than waiting until the development work has been completed, the statistics are being published now to involve potential users in developing the statistics. We hope that this encourages users to provide us with their thoughts and suggestions of how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. Comments can be sent by email to CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk.More information about what it means for Official Statistics to be classified as Experimental Statistics is available from the Office for Statistics Regulation.Office for Statistics regulation reviewThese statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events. The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics and regards them as consistent with the Code\u2019s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.Strengths of the dataThe data used in this release includes all claims made by employers up until 30 November 2020 for support for the wages of furloughed staff up to 31 October 2020 and thus covers the complete employer population having made at least one CJRS claim. We have linked CJRS data to Pay As You Earn Real Time Information data (PAYE RTI) to provide the additional information presented in this release.RevisionsThe figures in this release incorporate data on claims received by HMRC up to 30 November and cover employments furloughed up to 31 October 2020.In future iterations of this statistics release there may be some further revisions reflecting improvements to the data processing and methodology.Related linksEarnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information, UK: December 2020 - Employee and earnings statistics from PAYE Real Time Information.Labour market in the regions of the UK: December 2020 - Regional breakdowns of changes in UK employment, unemployment and economic activityEmployment in the UK: December 2020 - Estimates of employment, unemployment and economic inactivity for the UK.Average weekly earnings in Great Britain: December 2020 - Estimates of growth in earnings for employees before tax and other deductions from pay.HMRC coronavirus (COVID-19) statistics - Collection of HMRC data regarding COVID-19 response initiatives and policy.
