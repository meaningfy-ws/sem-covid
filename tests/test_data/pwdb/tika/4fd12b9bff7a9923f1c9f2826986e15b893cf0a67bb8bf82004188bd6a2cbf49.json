We\u2019ve already pumped billions of euro into the economy through wage subsidies, the PUP, cash for businesses, low cost loans and commercial rates waivers. We know these actions have made a difference. We\u2019ve made enormous progress on suppressing the virus, and significant progress too on restarting our economy. More than 280,000 people have already got back to work. Repairing the damage wrought on the economy \u2013 and keeping the virus contained \u2013 is vital for the wellbeing of our people. Today\u2019s stimulus package is the next step in our national recovery story. It is designed to help businesses which haven\u2019t reopened yet and those struggling to do so. We have listened to businesses and responded with a package of scale and speed to meet their most immediate needs. Our main objective is to save jobs and create new ones.\u201dCovid-19 has had an enormous impact on communities, businesses, families and individuals across the country.\u00a0 The priority of the Government remains the wellbeing of our people and communities.\u00a0We are now increasing our focus on business and on getting as many people as possible back to work.\u00a0Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and Transport, Eamon Ryan TD said:\"This July Jobs initiative is a substantial first step on our road to a sustainable recovery. It invests in our people and our infrastructure in a way that will provide jobs and support our climate and environment goals.

           July 23, 2020                        Ibec, the group that represents Irish business, has strongly welcomed the July Stimulus package announced from Government today, the largest single economic stimulus in the history of the State.\u00a0\u00a0Ibec CEO Danny McCoy said: \u201cOn behalf of the Irish business community, today\u2019s stimulus package of increased public spending, investment and tax supports is a welcome and important step in rebooting the economy. Government has taken on board Ibec\u2019s extensive inputs over recent months and unveiled a comprehensive package of economic and business supports. It is imperative that the package is now delivered alongside measures that ensure as safe a return to as much economic activity as possible in the coming months.\u00a0\u201cThe suite of financial supports announced today, including the amendments to the Restart Grant and Covid-19 Credit Guarantee scheme, will bring huge relief to businesses who are continuing to overcome the challenges posed by Covid disruption. It is crucial that the various supports available are now delivered more efficiently than has been the case to date.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt is positive to note the extension and expansion in scope of the Wage Subsidy Scheme until April 2021. This scheme will play a vital role in enabling the economy to bounce back at the other end of this crisis, helping vulnerable firms to stay afloat and keeping their employees engaged whilst protecting the incomes of individuals.\u00a0\u201cA welcome feature of today\u2019s package is the \u20ac200m dedicated to retraining those who have been made unemployed over the course of the pandemic, alongside a commitment to better support apprenticeships and related training courses nationwide. Getting those workers who have lost their jobs because of Covid back into the labour market will be a key determinant of the rate of our economic recovery. Such supports must be targeted at those sectors and regions most adversely impacted by Covid.\u201d\u00a0Mr. McCoy said the commitment of \u20ac500m to accelerate capital works projects will enable the advancement of regional development, housing and sustainable transport objectives.\u00a0However, he added caution that this stimulus package alone will not reboot the economy and should be part of a wider suite of measures aimed at delivering economic recovery \u2013 more must now be done to ensure the safe return of footfall to towns and cities. Greater clarity is still needed on returning to office work and education and more fully functioning childcare and transport.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                      See all News                                                                                                                           Personal injury awards reforms do not go far enough but are a step in right direction                                            March 07, 2021                                                                                                                                                                               National Accounts demonstrate the K-shaped nature of the Irish economy                                            March 05, 2021                                                                                                                                                                               Irish manufacturing generates 30,000 jobs and stands out in Europe with 5.4% export growth                                             March 04, 2021                                                        See all News                            Featured Events / upcoming events                                            See all Events                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Webinar:  Addressing the practical implications of remote and hybrid working                                                                    March 09, 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Ibec Networks HR Forum                                                                    March 10, 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Ibec Engineering Network CEO Quarterly Forum                                                                    March 11, 2021                                                                                                                                                        See all Events                                                                                        Our networks / Ibec Trade Associations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Careers                Careers and Life at Ibec        Working in Ibec                                    Relevant Links                Join Ibec        About Ibec        Ibec Campaigns        Ibec Trade Associations & Networks        HR Management Guide        Ibec Management Training        Online SEPA DD Mandate form        Events        The KeepWell Mark                                    Other links                Ibec membership contract        Privacy Statement        Cookie Policy        Cookie Settings        GDPR        Ibec rules                  Contact usDublin Office84/86 Lower Baggot StreetDublin 2, Ireland\u00a0D02 H720+353 (01) 605 1500info@ibec.ieOther OfficesSign up to Newsletter        \u00a9Ibec, 2021    Ibec clg is registered in Ireland.

We must end the scourge of low pay and precarious work and no longer tolerate bogus self-employment that pervades the sectors hardest hit.\u00a0 The race to the bottom must end.\u00a0Business supports paid out of public money must be linked to full and active participation in national industrial relations machinery: vetoes and opt-outs for statutory bodies such as JLCs are not tenable . We must vindicate the rights of workers by ensuring their voice is heard through access to collective bargaining.It is essential that adequate measures are put in place to monitor the expenditure of public funds through the establishment of Stakeholder\u00a0 Oversight Groups accountable to the Government.\u201cThe introduction of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), as proposed by ICTU in early March, now to be known as\u00a0 the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, has served to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on employment. This should be extended and transformed into a genuine short-time work scheme modelled on the most effective schemes in place in other European countries.\u00a0 ICTU has advocated this approach since early 2019 in our Brexit response discussions with government officials and Ministers .\u00a0 Such a scheme can serve to protect workers\u2019 income, greatly enhance their access to upskilling and maintain a continuous connection to their employer.\u201cThe \u00a0decision to pay a flat \u20ac350 to every worker laid off by the COVID-19 lockdown by the Government correctly prioritised speed and adequacy for half a million workers .\u00a0 Given \u00a0the proposed roadmap for the withdrawal of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), there is now more than ever an urgent need to transition all \u00a0laid off workers from the PUP onto the TWSS to protect their income . If employers are unwilling to maintain the link with their workers they equally cannot be allowed to continue to have the protection of the freeze on redundancy rights\u201d. \u00a0Incentives for Apprenticeship training is a positive development which has been consistently advocated by Congress over many years.\u00a0ENDS\u00a0Conor Kavanagh Congress Communications Office 086 811 6607 /

The tax cut will be in place from September this year to February 2021.                                                        The help-to-buy scheme has also been expanded with homebuyers using the programme now entitled to a tax relief of \u20ac30,000, an increase of \u20ac10,000.                                                        The \u201cStaycation Subsidy\u201d, which will allow people who spend \u20ac625 to claim back in an income tax credit worth \u20ac125, with consumers able to upload their receipts to an app on their phone in order to claim the credit.                                                        As reported this morning by The Irish Times, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will be extended until next April, but the rates will be cut from September, and it will also be closed to new applicants from then.                                                        The temporary wage subsidy scheme (TWSS) is also being extended to the end of March next year, but will be recast a a new scheme from September.                                                        The bike to work scheme is being extended, while there will significant investment in cycling and walking facilities, \u20ac10 million for the arts and \u20ac10 million for tourism. A range of new training and employment grants are included for individuals and businesses, as well as incentives to take on apprentices.                                                        'Unprecedented times\u2019Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said the package is an \u201cunprecedented set of measures required by unprecedented times\u201d.                                                        Speaking on Thursday, he said over the past five months 2,310 people on the island have lost their lives, and that \u201cfor their loved ones, the impact of this terrible virus will always be with them\u201d.                                                        He said the health of Irish people would be the first priority of the Government, but also that the impact of the virus had unleashed a recession more \u201crapid and dramatic\u201d than ever before recorded.                                                                                                                                                \u201cWe now need to move to a new agenda,\u201d he said, which would \u201climit the damage of the pandemic but also moves on to build a sustainable and inclusive recovery\u201d.                                                        He said the package was bolstered by a wider European backdrop where Brussels had agreed a rescue package for the EU economy, and beneficial market conditions that made the borrowing necessary to fund the package accessible.

Mr Martin said the package included placing direct subsidies to business on a new and permanent footing, the introduction of longer term income supports, an expanded and extended waiver of commercial rates, and a retraining programme.                                                        A wide range of measures, he said, would be implemented to fast track environmental, economic, social and cultural initiatives. Capital funding would be provided to all schools, and there will be increased funding for town and city centres, as well as a widespread programme retrofitting.                                                                                                                                                            \t                                                                                    Stimulus package is largest cash injection into Irish economy in history                                                                            \t                                                                                    July stimulus: What does the plan mean for you?                                                                            \t                                                                                    Staycation vouchers 'should be introduced before October'                                                                                                                                                                                                          \t       Inside Politics \u00b7    Green list confusion, EU recovery deal and the impending stimulus package   He said work on the wider economic plan \u201cwill proceed at place, ready for implementation later this year\u201d.                                                        \u201cAn ambitious and comprehensive response to an unprecedented crisis felt by every family, business and individual in the country,\u201d he said.                                                        \u201cThe greatest strength of our country has always been the skills of our people \u2026 our determination is to work in partnership with the Irish people\u201d in an effort to protect and create jobs.                                                        Unemployment paymentAs part of the package after September there will be three rates, based on pre-unemployment earnings, instead of the current two.                                                        There will be a new top rate of \u20ac300 a week, a middle rate of \u20ac250, and the basic \u20ac203 per week rate, equivalent to the regular rate of unemployment benefit.                                                                                                                                                The long-awaited plan was published by the Government in Dublin Castle after a Cabinet meeting on Thursday with a package that included capital spending, welfare and employment supports, grants and tax cuts.                                                        T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar said about 800,000 people had benefited from the pandemic unemployment payment at some point. At its peak, 600,000 people were on the payment.                                                        He confirmed the temporary wage subsidy scheme was being extended to March, and will be open to firms not currently participating as well as workers not currently covered, such as seasonal workers.                                                               Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin, T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar and Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan at Dublin Castle today for the post cabinet press briefing. Photograph: Julien Behal Photography   Mr Varadkar confirmed a six month two per cent cut in the rate of VAT, from 23 per cent to 21 per cent, and a six month commercial rates holiday.                                                        A further \u20ac300 million in grants for small and medium enterprises, with the maximum lifted to \u20ac25,000. He said this would be especially useful to rural businesses, and the businesses, which had already received a grant could apply for a top up. B&Bs, charities and ratable sports businesses, previously kept out of the scheme, will now be eligible.                                                        He said he wanted to pay tribute to the business people of Ireland who had displayed \u201cremarkable grit, determination and adaptability in the face of unprecedented challenges.\u201d                                                        To the unemployed, he said, the package \u201ccreates a path back to your old job or to a new one\u201d.                                                        \u201cBacking business and backing workers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this pandemic together, and through this economic crisis together.\u201d                                                        Cheaper loans would be made available through the credit guarantee scheme, with a particular emphasis on sectors such as life sciences, and industries focused on decarbonisation and digitalisation.                                                                                                                                                \u2018Connect to nature\u2019Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the government is investing in funds for more walking, cycling facilities and rural greenways to allow people to \u201cconnect to nature in a better way\u201d.

Discussions between the coalition parties continued until late last night, but the objections of the Green Party to the proposed cut could not be overcome.                                                        The CGT cut was proposed by the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe as part of the plan, and was supported by Fianna F\u00e1il who had first proposed the idea during the general election campaign. However, the Green Party objected to the proposal, according to political sources.                                                                                                                                                Sources added, however, that the idea may be reconsidered in the autumn as part of the budget process.                                                        It is understood that the proposal was for a cut in capital gains tax \u2013 currently set at 33 per cent \u2013 to perhaps 25 per cent for a limited period to stimulate business activity.                                                        Sources cited a previous cut from 40 per cent to 20 per cent by then finance minister Charlie McCreevy in the late 1990s which saw a surge in commercial activity and the yield from the tax doubling.
