Mainly due to an undersupply of dwellings, house prices and rents are comparatively among the highest in Europe. Rents or mortgage payments are the largest proportion of income people in Ireland spend. The job or income losses due to the pandemic situation has aggravated this crisis, increasing the difficulty many people face with keeping up with mortgage and rent payments. At the same time, the possibility to find new accommodation is reduced in times of the public health policy with social distancing. As part of its package of 'Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020' the Irish government therefore introduced restrictions on evictions and rent freezes for landlords.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The Government  Act includes new measures to protect renters, during the emergency period of 3 months.\r\r1. Renters may not be evicted from their home, or \r2. Be served a notice of termination by their landlord. Notices of termination which the renter had received prior to the emergency period are frozen for the duration of the emergency (3 months).\r3. It is also prohibited for landlords to increase rents.\r\rAll types of rentals are included, such as shared accommodation with the landlord, student accommodation and \u2018digs\u2019 type accommodation where meals are provided.\r\rRenters shall continue to pay rent and continue to follow any rules as part of their tenancy.\r\rRenters having difficulties to pay their rents should contact their landlords and possibly agree on a reduced amount for the duration of the emergency measures. For those having lost their jobs or part of their employment income, a means tested social welfare, rental support benefit is available. \r\r\r", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "Not known yet.

to make provision in relation to the operation of certain provisions of the \nResidential Tenancies Act 2004\n during the period of 3 months following the enactment of this Act and such further period (if any) as may be specified by order of the Government; to amend the \nPlanning and Development Act 2000\n to provide, in certain circumstances, for the disregard of a certain period in the calculation of time limits referred to in that Act and in certain other enactments; to provide for the registration of certain health and social care professionals to fulfil the need for medical resources to alleviate the risk from Covid-19 to human life and public health and for those and related purposes to amend the \nDentists Act 1985\n, the \nHealth and Social Care Professionals Act 2005\n, the \nPharmacy Act 2007\n, the \nMedical Practitioners Act 2007\n, and the \nNurses and Midwives Act 2011\n;

information and contacts\n\n\n    \n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nCOVID-19 has had a huge\nimpact on jobs and incomes across Ireland. \n\n\nSince March 2020, there have been a number of different protections put in\nplace to support tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which have\nexpired and others which overlap, see below.\n\n\nIn October 2020, an eviction ban was introduced for any period when\npeople\u2019s movement is restricted to 5 kilometres from their home as part of\nCOVID-19 restrictions. This means that tenants cannot be evicted when\nthe country is at Level 5 of COVID-19 restrictions from 31 December 2020 to 5\nApril 2021 and for a ten-day grace period after this. \n\n\nThere are also rental\nlaws to protect tenants economically affected by COVID-19, who have fallen\ninto rent arrears and are at risk of losing their tenancy. These protections\ninclude a rent freeze and a 90-day notice period when ending a tenancy. The\nprotections ran from 2 August 2020 to 10 January 2021 under the Residential\nTenancies and Valuation Act 2020, and were then replaced with the Planning\nand Development, and Residential Tenancies Act 2020 from 11 January 2021 to\n12 April 2021. The steps landlords and tenants must follow to access these\nprotections changed under the most recent legislation see Rent\narrears due to the financial impact of COVID-19 below. \n\n\nIn March 2020, a range of protections were put in place for people affected\nby the pandemic under the Emergency\nMeasures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020. These protections,\nwhich included a ban on eviction notices and rent increases, have now expired.\nHowever, they still have an effect on notice periods and the calculation of\nPart 4 tenancies, see below.\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination of tenancy\n\n\nNormally, if your landlord wants you to leave your accommodation, they must\nserve you with a notice of termination. This\ncan be for a number of reasons.\n\n\nHowever, since October 2020, if COVID-19 restrictions lead to an eviction\nban, your landlord can issue you with a notice of termination while the ban\nis in place, but you cannot be evicted except in certain\ncircumstances. \n\n\nPart 4 tenancies\n\n\nWhen a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months, the tenancy becomes a Part\n4 tenancy. This means the tenancy can only be ended for specific reasons\nuntil the end of a 4 or 6 year period (depending on when the tenancy started).\n\n\n\nDuring COVID-19 emergency periods, Part 4 tenancies and further part 4\ntenancies cannot start. And these emergency periods do not count towards\nthe time spent as a tenant for Part 4 or further part 4 tenancies, if the\nperson is subject to a notice of termination or awaiting eviction. \n\n\nThe emergency periods cover:\n\n\t27 March 2020 to 1 August 2020\n\t22 October 2020 to 1 December 2020\n\t31 December 2020 to 5 April 2021\n\n\n\nYou can read more about part 4\ntenancies.\n\n\nIf you want to leave\n\n\nThe emergency legislation does not affect your right to end your tenancy.\nYou should read your lease agreement or tenancy agreement for information on\nhow to end your tenancy. If you are in a fixed term lease, you may lose your\ndeposit if you leave your accommodation before the end of the fixed period.\n\n\n\nEvictions when COVID-19 restrictions limit\nmovement to 5km\n\n\nAn eviction ban will automatically kick-in any time people\u2019s movement is\nrestricted to 5 kilometres from their home, as part of COVID-19 restrictions.\nThis happened when Ireland moved to Level 5 COVID 19 restrictions, which means\nthere is a ban on evictions from 31 December 2020 to 5 April 2021, and for a\nten-day grace period after this.\n\n\nIf your landlord has given you a valid notice to quit (also called an\neviction notice), the notice is paused while these restrictions are in place,\nand also for a further 10 days after the restrictions are lifted, unless the\nnotice to quit is for the following reasons:\n\n\tAnti-social behaviour\n\tActing in a way that would invalidate a house insurance policy\n\tActing in a way that would cause substantial damage to the\n  accommodation\n\tUsing the accommodation for commercial or other non-residential\n  purposes\n\n\n\nThis means that the time you have left before you are due to be evicted is\nextended by 10 days plus the amount of time Ireland is at Level 5.\n\n\nIf the notice of termination is for one of the four reasons above, the\neviction can proceed once the appropriate notice period expires.\n\n\nThese rules are set out in the Residential\nTenancies Act 2020. The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) has a guidance\ndocument and FAQ\u2019s\nabout this legislation, where you can get general information about the\neviction ban, as well as examples of how it applies.\n\n\nIf you are threatened with eviction, you should call Threshold for advice. See 'Further\ninformation and contacts' below for other organisations that might be able to\nhelp you.\n\n\n\n\n\nRent freezes\n\n\nFrom 2 August 2020, rent increases can take effect for tenants who have not\nbeen financially impacted by COVID-19. They must follow the usual rent setting and review rules inside and\noutside a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ). If your rent is increased, no backdating is\nallowed.\n\n\nIf you have been financially impacted by COVID-19 and meet the requirements\nof the Planning\nand Development, and Residential Tenancies Act 2020, your rent cannot be\nincreased before 13 April 2021. \n\n\nRent decreases continue to be allowed.\n\n\nThis applies to all types of tenancies.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficulty paying rent\n\n\nIf you cannot afford to pay rent, you should discuss this with your\nlandlord. Your landlord may agree to allow you to pay a reduced amount until\nyour situation improves. You should not stop paying rent completely, and if you\ncannot pay the full amount of rent due, you should talk to your landlord or\nagent before you start paying a reduced amount.\n\n\nYou can read our document on social welfare\nand COVID-19 for information on the social welfare payments available. You\ncan also find out more about the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)\nand Rent\nSupplement. \n\n\nTo qualify for Rent Supplement you must:\n\n\tBe working (or self-employed) less than 30 hours per week.\n\tBe habitually resident in Ireland.\n\tBe renting for 6 out of the past 12 months (or in receipt of Rent\n    Supplement in the past 12 months).\n\tHave been able to afford the rent when you took up the tenancy.\n\tPass a means test.\n\tBe in a bona fide tenancy.\n\n\n\nA bona fide tenancy is where a genuine tenancy is in place and was in place\nbefore your claim for Rent Supplement. For example, if the house you live in is\nowned by a close relative and you have been living there without paying rent,\nyou will not qualify for Rent Supplement for that accommodation.\n\n\nIf your spouse or partner is working or self-employed for over 30 hours per\nweek, you will not be eligible for Rent Supplement.\n\n\nYou can read more about the\nhabitual residence condition and how\nRent Supplement is calculated.\n\n\nIf you are a HAP tenant and you have lost some or all of your\nself-employment, you should contact your local authority. Make sure that you\nhave applied for any social welfare payment you might be entitled to before\ncontacting your local authority. If your income has decreased, the local\nauthority will re-assess your contribution to your rent.\n\n\n\n\n\nRent arrears due to the financial\nimpact of COVID-19\n\n\nDuring periods when COVID-19 restrictions limit people\u2019s movement\nto 5 kilometres from their home, you cannot be evicted for falling into rent\narrears. \n\n\nIn addition the Planning\nand Development, and Residential Tenancies Act 2020 (which replaced the\nResidential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020) sets out current protections for\ntenants who have fallen into rent arrears due to COVID-19, and are at risk of\nlosing their tenancy. They include a rent freeze and an increased 90-day notice\nperiod when ending a tenancy.\n\n\nThe rental protections may apply to you if you are at risk of losing\nyour tenancy and are also getting one of the following::\n\n\tGetting Illness Benefit for a COVID-19 absence, or\n\tGetting the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme or any social welfare payment\n    or State support to help with loss of earnings caused by COVID-19\n    (including Rent Supplement or Supplementary Welfare Allowance)\n\n\n\nRules and requirements for landlords and tenants facing rent arrears due to\nCOVID-19\n\n\nThere are rules and requirements for both landlords and tenants facing rent\narrears due to COVID-19. The process is broken down into steps starting from\nthe point where a tenant has fallen into rent arrears. If the tenant completes\nthe required steps, the landlord cannot increase the rent or terminate the\ntenancy before 13 April 2021. Failure to complete each step may mean that the\nprotections will not apply to the tenant, or could lead to the notice of\ntermination being deemed invalid. Go to the RTB website for full\ndetails of each step.\n\n\nIf these rental protections applied to you under the previous\nlegislation for the emergency period that ran from 1 August 2020 to 10\nJanuary 2021, you may have to meet additional requirements to benefit from the\ncurrent legislation that extends these protections until 13 April 2021, see\n'Requirements for tenants transitioning from the old rules' below.\n\n\nThere are also some protections for landlords under the new legislation, as\nwell as a number of circumstances where the rental protections don\u2019t apply,\nsee below for more information.\n\n\nProcess for landlords and tenants\n\n\nTo access these rental protections, you must follow the steps below, if any\nstep is not completed in the required format the protections will not apply.\n\n\n\n\n\tLandlord issues a written rent arrears warning notice to the tenant to\n    pay the rent arrears. Tenants must be given at least 28 days to pay the\n    arrears. The RTB has a sample\n    warning notice for rent arrears (pdf) on its website. \n    \n\n  \n\tLandlord provides a copy of the written rent arrears warning notice to\n    the RTB. The 28-day period will begin from the date when\n    both the tenant and RTB have received the written warning\n    notice. \n    \n\n  \n\tRTB writes to the landlord confirming it has received a copy of the rent\n    arrears warning notice, and gives the landlord information about their\n    protections under the rules, see below. The RTB also writes to the tenant\n    confirming it has received a copy of the rent arrears warning notice, and\n    gives the tenant information on income supports, how to get advice from the\n    Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), a link to the Self-Declaration\n    form (pdf) and the requirements they must meet to benefit from these\n    protections. \n    \n\n  \n\tTenant signs and submits a Self-Declaration\n    form (pdf) to the RTB and their landlord. This form includes a request\n    to the RTB asking for their help to get advice from the Money Advice and\n    Budgeting Service (MABS), which must be completed. Tenant also writes to\n    their landlord asking them for a consultation, so they can make an\n    arrangement to pay their rent. This must be done within 5 days of making\n    the Self-Declaration. \n    \n\n  \n\tRTB helps the tenant to get advice from MABS. \n    \n\n  \n\tIf the landlord does not get a Self-Declaration form from the tenant, the\n    landlord can serve a notice of termination for rent arrears giving 28\n    days\u2019 notice. This can only be done once the 28-day warning notice for\n    rent arrears has expired. If a landlord does receive a copy of the\n    Self-Declaration form from the tenant confirming that they cannot pay their\n    rent due to the financial impact of COVID-19, the landlord can still serve\n    a valid notice of termination (after the 28-day warning notice for rent\n    arrears has expired). However, the tenant does not have to vacate their\n    accommodation before 13 April 2021 and the tenant must be\n    given at least 90 days\u2019 notice. Also, the landlord cannot increase the\n    rent until 13 April 2021. \n    \n\n  \n\tLandlord sends the RTB a copy of the Notice of Termination that they have\n    sent to the tenant for rent arrears on the same day. \n    \n\n  \n\tRTB contacts the tenant with information on the dispute resolution options\n    available to them. The RTB will notify the tenant of their right to refer a\n    tenancy termination dispute to the RTB within 28 days of receiving the\n    notice of termination.\n\n\n\nTenants and landlords should keep copies of all correspondence they\nsend and receive, as well as all documentation proving when documents were\nissued and sent. They can do this for example, by keeping postal record slips\nor emails.\n\n\nRequirements for tenants transitioning from the old rules\n\n\nTenants who qualified for these protections under the previous\nlegislation, which expired on 10 January 2021, may have to meet additional\nrequirements under the new legislation. This is because some of the previously\noptional rules are mandatory under the new legislation. These\nadditional requirements must be completed by midnight on 15 January 2021 and\ninclude:\n\n\tAsking the RTB to help them get advice from the Money Advice and\n    Budgeting Service (MABS)\n\tAsking their landlord for a consultation, so they can make an arrangement\n    to pay their rent, and notifying the RTB of this\n\n\n\nIf you have already met these requirements under the previous legislation\nthe new protections automatically apply, and the rent cannot be increased or\nthe tenancy terminated before 13 April 2021.\n\n\nExceptions\n\n\nYou will not be able to benefit from these rental protections if:\n\n\tYou have outstanding rental payments of 5 months or more\n\tYou do not contact the RTB asking them to help you get MABS advice\n\tYour landlord invokes their rights under the legislation, see\n    landlords\u2019 protections below.\n\n\n\nLandlords\u2019 protections under the new rules\n\n\nA landlord can submit a Self-Declaration\nform to the RTB to stop the tenant\u2019s protections under this legislation.\n\n\n\nThis is only possible if at least one of the following apply:\n\n\tThe tenant has outstanding rental payments of 5 months or more.\n\tThe tenant did not give the RTB or MABS the information it needed to\n    provide timely MABS advice.\n\tThe tenant did not met the terms of the rent payment arrangement they\n    made with the landlord.\n\tThe protections under the Act would cause undue financial hardship to the\n    landlord. A landlord can only claim undue financial hardship if one of the\n    following applies: \n    \tThey are getting a qualifying COVID-19 payment.\n\tThe rent is their only income.\n\tThey will be unable to pay their mortgage on the rented property if\n        they don\u2019t get the rent from the tenants.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe landlord must include supporting documentation with the Self-Declaration\nform and send a copy of it and the form to the tenant as well as the RTB.\n\n\nFor more detail, information and support regarding these steps, see the\nRTB\u2019s guidance\ndocument and FAQs\nor contact the RTB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisputes\n\n\nThere are 2 stages to the RTB\u2019s dispute resolution process:\n\n\tStage 1 is confidential mediation or adjudication. If\n    the landlord or tenant do not want to accept the mediator\u2019s or\n    adjudicator\u2019s decision, the dispute can be appealed to Stage 2.\n\tStage 2 is a hearing by a 3-person Tenancy Tribunal.\n\n\n\nDuring COVID-19, dispute resolution applications are handled in a number of\nways to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. Telephone\nmediation is still available and has not been affected by the restrictions.\nThe majority of adjudication cases dealt with since March have been resolved\nusing a paper-based process. However, the RTB can now hear adjudication\nhearings virtually, and intends that most hearings will be held in this way in\nthe future. Face-to-face adjudication hearings have recommenced but only in\nlimited and urgent circumstances. Tribunal hearings are now also available\nvirtually. The RTB has published information about virtual\nhearings and how the dispute resolution process works during COVID-19.\n\n\nIf you are having difficulties with your tenancy, contact the RTB for\ndetails of the dispute\nresolution process.\n\n\nThreshold\u2019s\nTenancy Protection Service provides advice and support to tenants where\nthere is a tenancy problem or where a tenancy is at risk. Threshold advisors\ncan mediate with landlords and also help with applications for rent supplement.\nCall 1800 454 454, 9am-9pm, Monday to Friday for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information and contacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Residential Tenancies Board\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    PO Box 47 \nClonakilty  \nCo.
