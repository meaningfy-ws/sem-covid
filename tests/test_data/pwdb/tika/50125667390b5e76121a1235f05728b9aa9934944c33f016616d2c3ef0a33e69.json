With the onset of COVID-19, and the subsequent reduction in international travel, English language schools experienced mass cancellations. For example, one school, AM Language School, reported 8,000 cancellations in the space of 3 weeks in April 2020 alone. \r\rMass closures of English Language Schools were prevented by the [COVID-19 Wage Supplement](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/MT-2020-13_264.html), whilst other Government measures such as the [Electricity Bill Refund](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/MT-2020-24_939.html) and [Rent Refund](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/MT-2020-24_991.html) may also have aided.   \r\rFurthermore, English Language Schools did what they could to remain afloat. This included offering online English courses and implementing health and safety procedures within their premises. ", "content_of_measure_description": "A few English Language Schools, such as BELS, were proactive and brought forwards plans to offer online English courses during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to this, all teaching was classroom-based. This resulted in an array of English language courses being offered for learners of different levels and interests (e.g., English for business). Such online courses remain ongoing. \r\rOnce Schools re-opened physically on 1 July 2020, a Federation of English Language Teaching Organisation Malta (FELTOM) survey highlighted that arrivals in the first week, were just 9% of the numbers seen in 2019. Numbers were expected to peak at 12.8% in August. \r\rSchools introduced a range health and safety initiatives to protect staff and clients. EF, an English language school, ensures that staff and students wear face masks at all times, practice frequent good health hygiene, and observe social distancing. Incoming students are asked to present a certificate not older than 72 hours old warranting that they are COVID-19 negative, and if this is not brought, are asked to enter preventative quarantine and carry out the test privately. Staff and students who have tested positive for COVID-19 have been quarantined. Other measures include the availability of sanitisers, temperature and name checks, informational leaflets and posters, and frequent cleaning. ", "use_of_measure_description": "in 2019, 83,610 foreign students attended English Language courses at local licensed schools. In 2019, July was the busiest month, with 18,457 arrivals.

However, sources close to the school have told the newsroom that teachers who were in contact with others that have tested positive were expected to call in for work.On Wednesday, Malta registered 49 new cases of coronavirus in 24 hours bringing the total number of active cases to 486.Newsbook.com.mt has reached out to EF Language School asking it to clarify the situation after three members of staff and seven students in Malta have tested positive.The school\u2019s executive director told this newsroom that the team and the immediate close contacts of students have been all tested. \u201cNo further students or staff members are affected at this point. We are following the health authorities instructions.\u201d He further explained that all direct cases and their contacts have been informed and requested to respect a fourteen-day quarantine. The school also checks the names of students as they come into school to ensure that quarantine is observed.The school is relying on the advice being given by the health authorities and applying all the necessary protocols at the airport, at the accommodation, at the school and at the school events.Asked about school events, the executive director said that all events being organised this year are being limited to small groups and are held outdoors.The executive director told this newsroom that according to the school\u2019s regulations the wearing of face masks at all times has been mandatory since 1 July. Students and teachers are being asked to frequently practise good health hygiene as well as observe social distancing rules.Asked whether there have been any students who tested positive upon their return, EF\u2019s executive director replied that in such cases the same procedure applied and they would inform the health authorities to carry out contact tracing.The school is also requesting incoming students to present a certificate showing that they are negative for coronavirus as from this week. Students who do not present a negative coronavirus certificate will be given the option to have it done privately upon arrival. \u201cOnce the negative result is out, they can resume their experience normally,\u201d he said.\u201cFrustration\u201dSources speaking to Newsbook.com.mt spoke of frustration, underlining that teachers have been kept in the dark. The sources explained that teachers are using the same classrooms and materials as teachers who have tested positive. They added that at the time teachers and students were not required to masks or face shields at the time, noting that it was only from this week that the regulation came into force.\u2018Ensuring students, staff and community are safe\u2019The school has underlined that no teachers were asked to come in from quarantine to teach. It stressed that the use of personal protective equipment was enforced since 1 July. Everyone was provided with masks on a daily basis and sanitizers were placed everywhere. The school also provided printed leaflets and posters while a taskforce teams checks all students daily at all times. Temperature and name checks are also being carried out.Cleaning is happening on a regularly basis ensuring that the rooms and work spaces are sanitized frequently.The executive director highlighted that a communications group was set up to update staff on a regular basis through short messages and online meetings.EF has been accepting adult students who present a negative coronavirus swab test conduct up to a maximum 72 hours before they land in Malta for over a week now. Students who fail to present such certificate are placed in preventive quarantine until the swab test is carried out. The school has partnered with a local private hospital and students are tested in their room, this so as to ensure that students, staff and the community are safe, the school said.If you want to be the first to receive the latest news, download the Newsbook APP\u00a0here.\u00a0 \tTAGS\tEducation\tEF language school\tTEFLShare this story\tTotal18\t Facebook\u00a0\t Twitter0\t WhatsApp\t Copy LinkPrevious articleYouth dies while in police custody in BelarusNext articleMore BOV branches to re-open for customersMonique AgiusLeave your commentRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR  CoronavirusGozitan educators asked to come to Malta for Covid vaccine  LocalUM among top 10 universities in which senior EU officials studied before joining EU institutions  CoronavirusUnion meets with PM, Education Minister; inconclusive  CoronavirusEducation authorities assessing situation; Union says strike was massive success  Local\u201cSannat Primary School leads way for inclusion\u201d \u2013 Education Minister  CoronavirusCommissioner for Children calls for investment in remote learning  MORE ARTICLESLivid Rosianne wanted to bash Jason with her handbag \u2013 Yorgen FenechJosita Dalli\u00a0\u00a0  February 28, 2021Livid Rosienne wanted to bash Jason with her handbag \u2013 Yorgen FenechCOVID-19 update: 175 new cases; One new fatalityCedric Farrugia\u00a0\u00a0  March 1, 2021The Health Authorities announced that Malta registered 175 new cases of Covid-19, following 3,871 swab tests in the last 24 hours.Public consultation launched to establish an authority for integrity in Maltese sportStaff Reporter\u00a0\u00a0  March 1, 2021This authority will be concerned with local sport governance and integrity.

Be they subsidized weeks of tuition when purchasing more than two weeks or even subsidized flight with the local carrier,\u201d Deloitte said.The ELT industry has always been a strong contributor to the Maltese economy. Deloitte estimates that total annual expenditure by ELT students stood at approximately \u20ac145 million in 2019. That year, the ELT sector accounted for 8.6% of total tourist guest nights, with 3% of all tourists being ELT students.The ELT sector plays a key role in diversifying the tourism sector, indirectly employing hundreds of host families and providing business to accommodation and transport providers, supermarkets and restaurants.FELTOM\u2019s CEO James Perry said that, as opposed to other tourism markets, this industry attracts people who would usually not travel to Malta. Over half of ELT students (56%) were from non-EU/EEA countries in 2019. Although the highest number of students came from Italy (12% or 28,367 student weeks), this is followed by Colombia (9.1% or 21,688 student weeks) and Brazil (21,230 student weeks or 9%).\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented shock on the local economy in general, but especially on the ELT industry where between the 5th and the 16th of last March, the number of cancellations by English language students increased from 4,000 to 20,000 \u2013 all in a span of two weeks. Cancellations kept increasing throughout the subsequent weeks,\u201d Perry said.Whereas July of 2019 saw a total of 18,457 student weeks, this year\u2019s estimate stood at 9.4% of that amount which translates to 1,740 student weeks.The study also looks at the financial impact of COVID-19 on the ELT sector. Business in 2020 plummeted by 80%. A decrease in industry revenue will also significantly impact accommodation, transport, and activities providers which account for 43% of the total industry variable costs.\u201cGovernment aid is crucial for the sector. Based on the scenarios provided by Deloitte, 1,378 jobs are on the line if the industry is not sustained. The best-case scenario provided by Deloitte would still result in 643 people losing their jobs, unless government steps in,\u201d Perry said.Deloitte estimated net loss in economic activity could reach \u20ac88 million. Government revenue from the industry\u2019s economic activity could also potentially decrease by 66%, based on the VAT, income tax and NI generated by the industry. An analysis of the best-case scenario, a drop of 30% of students in arrivals,\u00a0would mean that government generated revenue would drop to \u20ac15.2 million.\u201cThe ELT sector is crucial to the tourism sector and to the country\u2019s coffers. Sustained government aid is therefore of utmost importance for the sector. The industry will only start to recover once there are reduced health concerns and a substantial decrease in travel apprehension. This could still be a long way away,\u201d Perry said.
