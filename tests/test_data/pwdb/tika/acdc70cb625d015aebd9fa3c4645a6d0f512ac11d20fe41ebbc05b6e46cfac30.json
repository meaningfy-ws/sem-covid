The Tax Credits for Micro Enterprises and Self-Employed Regulations as subsidiary legislation 463.09 to the Malta Enterprise Act, mentioned in the previous paragraph, forms the national legal basis of this aid scheme.  1.5 Designated Authority  This incentive is administered by Malta Enterprise Corporation (hereinafter referred to at the Corporation).       Micro Invest            Version 7.1                      4 1.6 Transitional provision These Incentive Guidelines shall come into for on 1st January 2018.  Any application received for support under this measure prior to this date shall be processed under the version of the Incentive Guidelines applicable during that period.   2. Definitions  2.1 Single Undertakings  For the purpose of these Incentive Guidelines, the terminology single undertaking shall be defined as follows:    As per Commission Regulation EU No 1407/2013 of 18 December 2013 on the application of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to de minimis aid,  \u2018Single Undertaking\u2019 includes, for the purposes of this Regulation, all undertakings having at least one (1) of the following relationships with each other:  a) one undertakings has a majority of the shareholders\u2019 or members\u2019 voting rights in another undertaking;  b) one undertaking has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of another undertaking;  c) one undertaking has the right to exercise a dominant influence over another undertaking pursuant to a contract entered into with that undertaking or to a provision in its memorandum or articles of association;  d) one undertaking, which is a shareholder in or member of another undertaking, controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders in or members of that undertaking, a majority of shareholders\u2019 or members\u2019 voting rights in that undertaking.  Undertakings having any of the relationships referred to in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph through one or more other undertakings shall also be considered to be a single undertaking.1  The same regulation states that a group of linked undertakings is considered as one single undertaking for the application of the de minimis rule, but those undertakings which have no relationship with each other except for the fact that each of them has a direct link to the same public body or bodies are not treated as being linked to each other. The specific situation of undertakings controlled by the same public body or bodies, which may have an independent power of decision, is therefore taken into account. 1  2.2 Start-Up  For the purpose of these Incentive Guidelines, a start-up undertaking shall be defined as an undertaking that has been established for less than four (4) years as determined from date of registration with the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) or the date the person registered with Jobsplus as self-employed.      Undertakings controlled by owners of previously closed down businesses cannot be considered as a start-up under this incentive if the new undertaking is operative in the same or related sectors as that of the closed down firm.  This restriction applies for a period of twelve (12) months following such closure.                                                    1 Commission Regulation (EU) No 1407/2013 of 18th December 2013  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:352:0001:0008:EN:PDF     Micro Invest            Version 7.1                      5 2.3 Female-owned undertaking   For the purpose of these Incentive Guidelines, a female-owned undertaking is an undertaking in which more than 50% of the stock is owned by one (1) or more women or a female self-employed person.   2.4 Family Business  A Family business is an undertaking as defined in Article 3 of the Family Business Act (Chapter 565 of the Laws of Malta) that is duly registered as a family business and holds a valid certificate issued by the Regulator for Family Businesses.    2.5 Commercial Vehicle   For the purpose of these Incentive Guidelines a commercial vehicle will be defined as follows:   a. involved in the carrying of goods (category N1, N2 or N3 motor vehicle);  or b. Special Purpose Motor Vehicles as defined in Section 2.6 of the Incentive Guidelines;  or c. any vehicle that is designed specifically for the carriage of ten (10) or more persons.  2.6 Special Purpose Motor Vehicles  For the purpose of these Incentive Guidelines, special purpose motor vehicles shall be defined as any vehicle that is designed specifically to support or enable an economic activity.   2.7 Incentive Entitlement Certificate (IEC)   An Incentive Entitlement Certificate (IEC) means a certificate issued in terms of Part VI of the Malta Enterprise Act, outlining the support granted and any applicable terms and conditions.                          Micro Invest            Version 7.1                      6      3.

Incentive Description  4.1 Applicable aid intensity Malta Enterprise will approve a tax credit equivalent to 45% of eligible expenditure.  An additional bonus of 20% (that is a total of 65% tax credit) applies to undertakings operating from Gozo. 4.2 Maximum aid per undertaking   As from 1st January 2018, (for costs incurred in 2017), the maximum eligible tax credits per single undertaking shall be capped at \u20ac50,000 over any period of three (3) consecutive fiscal years, starting from eligible expenses incurred and paid for during the period from 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2017.    This capping specified above shall be increased by \u20ac20,000 (to a total of \u20ac70,000) for undertakings:  a) operating from Gozo; b) registered as a Family Business; and c) having more than 50% of the ownership attributed to female persons.   In case of partnerships the eligible amount will be split according to ownership.  Hence, as an example, in case of a partnership where ownership is split equally between two persons, two Incentive Entitlement Certificates, each equivalent to 50% of the approved tax credits will be issued to the persons forming the partnership. Legal persons forming part of multiple partnerships and that may also be carrying out other activities through self-employment may receive support through the different undertakings in which they are active but may not benefit from a tax credit which exceeds the relevant maximum capping as established above.   4.3  Qualifying Costs Costs claimed must have been invoiced between 1st January and 31st December (both days included) of the year preceding the year in which the claim is submitted.   Costs claimed must not be assisted (even partly) through other incentive measures.  Costs claimed must be covered by the appropriate fiscal documentation. The applicant is expected to be in a position to provide evidence that the costs claimed have been settled or are tied to a binding commitment to be settled in a specific timeframe.  For example for costs incurred in Malta the applicant should be in possession of:   a) a Tax Invoice (as specified in the 12th Schedule of the VAT Act Chapter 406 of the Laws of Malta);  or b) a Fiscal Receipt (as specified in the 13th Schedule of Chapter 406 of the VAT Act).        Micro Invest            Version 7.1                      8    4.4  Eligible Costs 4.4.1 Increase in Wage Costs Eligible undertakings may apply for a tax credit on an increase in wage cost that exceed 3%, calculated by deducting from wage costs incurred in the relevant fiscal year, the highest annual wage cost incurred in the preceding two (2) fiscal years.   Example 1 Claim for increased wage costs incurred in 2016.  Year Wage Costs  (\u20ac) 2016 20,000 2015 15,000 2014 10,000  Eligible increase is the difference between 2015 and 2016 = \u20ac5,000 (which constitutes 33.3% increase). Tax Credit for an undertaking based in Malta = \u20ac5,000 x 45%  Tax Credit for an undertaking based in Gozo = \u20ac5,000 x 65%  Example 2 Claim for increased wage costs incurred in 2016. Year Wage Costs  (\u20ac) 2016 21,000 2015 18,000 2014 20,500  The eligible increase is the difference between 2014 and 2016 = \u20ac500 (which constitutes 2.4% increase).  Increase is less than 3%. Hence, increased wage costs are not eligible.    4.4.2 Furbishing and refurbishing of Business Premises  Costs incurred for services rendered for the furbishing, refurbishing and upgrading4 of business premises by third parties, including costs of materials and other items required for furbishing, refurbishing and upgrading of the business premises that are endorsed as to have been utilised by the third party providing the services in the works carried out.                                                      4 including extensions or modifications to premises.
