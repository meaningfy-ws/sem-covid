Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund (EIF).    \t    \t    \tThe Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS) benefits from a guarantee from the European Union under the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI). The Future Growth Loan scheme was delivered to the market by the SBCI in June 2019. The capacity of the Future Growth Loan Scheme has now been increased by up to \u20ac500m which will be made available through a number of financial providers in the coming months. The Scheme is supported by the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. To date, there has been very strong demand from SMEs and farmers for the longer-term, lower-cost finance.

SMEs may avail of de minimis aid provided it does not exceed \u20ac200,000 in any three-year fiscal period. In the case of certain loans, State aid may arise by virtue of the discounted interest rate received by the SME on SBCI loans, and if so, the SME will be advised. It is important to note that the aid is not the amount of the loan.See Regulations for further details.                                                                                                                        \t\t                        \t\t                        \t\t                                                                \t                                                                        Nace Codes                                                                                                                        See more                                                                                                                                                                                            See less                                                                                                                                                                                                                See link belowFGLS NACE Codes                                                                                                                        \t\t                                                                \t                                                                        Business Plan                                                                                                                        See more                                                                                                                                                                                            See less                                                                                                                                                                                                                SBCI Future Growth Loan Scheme Business Plan GuidanceFor loans of \u20ac250,000 or moreYou must provide a separate business plan when applying for a loan under the Future Growth Loan Scheme for loans of \u20ac250,000 or more.

The Minister for Finance has provided a guarantee in respect of borrowings of the SBCI therefore funds it lends or obligations it guarantees can give rise to State aid and must comply with EU law governing State aid.State aid can occur whenever State resources are provided selectively to undertakings engaged in economic activity, which confer an advantage over other undertakings. Generally, State aid is incompatible with the EC Treaty. However, the EC Treaty leaves room for a number of policy objectives for which State aid can be considered compatible.The FGLS is offered under:\tThe De Minimis Aid Regulations\tArticle 14 Agriculture Block Exemption Regulation\tArticle 17 Agriculture Block Exemption Regulation \tArticle 17 General Block Exemption Regulation\tArticle 29 General Block Exemption RegulationDe Minimis Aid exemption under Commission Regulation (EU) No 1407/2013 of 18 December 2013 (\u201cDe Minimis Regulations\u201d)The European Commission has determined that State aid given to undertakings which comply with the De Minimis Regulations has a negligible impact on trade and competition. State aid which remains below a certain ceiling, depending on sector, and otherwise complies with the De Minimis Regulations (de minimis aid) is not subject to pre-clearance with the European Commission. The maximum amount of de minimis aid any single recipient can receive is \u20ac200,000 (gross grant equivalent) over a three year fiscal period. The total amount of de minimis aid given to a single recipient performing road freight transport for hire or reward cannot exceed \u20ac100,000 over a three year fiscal period. For loans, the amount of de minimis aid which is provided to a borrower (by means of a discounted interest rate) is calculated into its \u201cgross grant equivalent\u201d (based on the discount prevailing at the time the aid is granted)1. The de minimis aid is not equal to the total amount of the loan. Applicants for SBCI de minimis loans must be aware that such loans are provided to applicants subject to compliance with the De Minimis Regulations.De minimis aid is cumulative. To ensure the relevant ceilings are not exceeded and the rules on cumulation are complied with, an applicant must declare any other de minimis aid covered by the Regulation or by other de minimis regulations it has received during the fiscal/calendar year concerned and the previous two years. It should be noted that a false declaration, resulting in State aid being granted in excess of the de minimis threshold, will require that excess aid needing to be recovered with interest. De minimis aid can be in the form of a grant, equity investment, guarantee or interest rate discount on a loan. De minimis aid could have been received from any State Agency, Government Department or Local Authority.1The rate used is as specified in the Communication from the Commission on the revision of the method for setting the reference and discount rates (O) C 14, 19.1.2008, p. 6)Examples of sources of de minimis State aid include:\tEnterprise Ireland funding (e.g. Job Expansion Fund; Market Research Grant)\tDepartment of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation \u2013 Credit Guarantee Scheme\tAn Bord Bia funding\tLocal Enterprise Offices (LEO)\tEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)ExclusionsPlease note the following activities are excluded from SBCI loans offered under the de minimis exemption:\tFinance of specific export operations, or finance contingent upon the use of domestic over imported products. In particular, it should not apply to financing the establishment and operation of a distribution network in other States, or current expenditure linked to the export activity.\tFinance of pure real estate development activity;\tFinance of activities constituting pure financial transactions (e.g. purchase of shares);\tLoans to undertakings in difficulty;\tFinance of activities forbidden by national or EU law;\tPrimary agriculture (see specific SBCI FGLS Agriculture Loan product below).\tAid for the acquisition of road freight transport vehicles by undertakings performing road freight transport for hire or reward.This is a summary of the State aid rules and applicants are advised to seek their own State aid advice and read the applicable provisions of the relevant Regulation.
