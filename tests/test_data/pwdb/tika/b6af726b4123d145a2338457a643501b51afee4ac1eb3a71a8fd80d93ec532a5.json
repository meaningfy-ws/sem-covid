All aspects of our economy have been impacted but SMEs have been particularly hard hit. As SMEs account for 99% of active enterprises and 70% of employment, assessing the impact and addressing their recovery needs must be prioritised in the coming month.Ibec is today launching our Sustaining SMEs campaign to support SMEs at this critical time. To reboot SMEs it is crucial that the proposed \u2018July Stimulus Plan\u2019 delivers the following three outcomes:1. Significantly improve the Restart Grant: increase the fund to over \u20ac1 billion, including a flat rate payment of \u20ac15,000 per company to match the German and UK schemes and remove the link to the rates system which disqualifies so many smaller operators2. Introduce a new and radically improved \u2018bounce-back\u2019 credit guarantee scheme for firms with below 50 employees: with 100% guarantees on loans, no portfolio limit and an interest rate holiday of 12 months followed by interest rates well below the eurozone average3. Introduce measures to address fixed costs and debts: Introduce a fund to write down debts under the Revenue tax warehousing scheme where they threaten business viability, extend the commercial rates waiver to six months with a further six-month deferral, and introduce a binding mandatory arbitration model for disputes over commercial leases. This arbitration model should include some State burden sharing based on the recent Swedish state-aid approved model.Further information about the scale of the challenges facing SMEs and the measures Ibec is pushing for are available in this Sustaining SMEs messaging document (attached below). I would urge you to share these messages within your own organisations and amongst your wider stakeholder groups.As part of the campaign we will host a number of events, the first on Monday 29th June, 08:30-09:30 at which a stellar line up of SME CEOs from across industry will join myself and Ibec Chief Economist Gerard Brady for a discussion on supports and liquidity needed for the sector.

It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers.The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of \u20ac2,000 and a maximum payment of \u20ac10,000.Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, said:I am acutely aware of the difficulties facing small businesses during these challenging times.The Restart Grant is designed to help small businesses get back on their feet. The grant can be used to defray ongoing fixed costs, for replenishing stock and for measures needed to ensure employee and customer safety.Small businesses, whether it the local hairdresser, caf\u00e9 or clothes shop, are absolutely vital to the social fabric of our towns and villages throughout the country. These businesses have made huge sacrifices to protect their employees and customers during COVID-19 and we want to help them get back up and running so that they can return to viability and contribute to the national economic recovery.These are small grants but they can make a big difference in terms of giving businesses an extra helping hand to open their doors again.\u00a0Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Paschal Donohoe TD, said:I welcome the announcement today in relation to the establishment of the Restart Grant. In response to the very significant economic challenges posed by Covid-19, the Government has moved swiftly to introduce a range of measures to support enterprises of all sizes. These measures have included supports for wage costs, liquidity supports and the deferral or waiver of payments.The Restart Grant, in addition to the other supports which enterprises can access, will support micro and small enterprises, helping them to reconnect with the market and assist them in getting their businesses back up and trading. The Grant will act as further assistance in defraying ongoing fixed costs and meeting costs associated with businesses reopening. In doing so it will support activity and employment across the country.\u00a0Minister for Housing, Planning & Local Government, Eoghan Murphy TD, saidI very much welcome the Restart Fund and in particular, the important role that local authorities, who have direct links to small and micro enterprises through their Local Enterprise Offices, will play in the administration of the Fund. This support, when linked with other supports put in place, including the 3 month waiver of commercial rates for businesses forced to close, will help small and micro enterprises re-starting their operations and contribute to maintaining employment and economic activity.\u00a0Applications for the Restart Grant can be made online to local authorities from Friday 22nd May.Processing of applications and payment of the Restart Grant will depend on the initial surge of applications but, as far as is feasible, will be prioritised according to scheduled re-opening dates in the national Roadmap.This direct grant support is part of the wider \u20ac12bn package of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst our SMEs.\u00a0Notes to the EditorAbout the Restart GrantMicro and small businesses are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of Covid-19. Many businesses, even while closed, continue to incur costs including fixed costs without being able to generate revenues. It is recognised that businesses will also incur costs in preparing their businesses to reopen and meeting the needs of employees and customers. The Restart Grant is designed to alleviate the pressure on businesses in this context.To avail of the Restart Grant, a business must be in the Local Authorities Commercial Rates Payment System and:\u00a0\u00a0\thave an annual turnover of less than \u20ac5m and employ between 1 to 50 people;\thave closed and/or suffered a projected 25%+ loss in turnover to end June 2020;\u00a0\u00a0\tcommit to remain open or to reopen if it was closed;\tdeclare the intention to retaining employees that are on The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and to reemploy staff on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment where applicable.The grant can be used to defray ongoing fixed costs, for replenishing stock and for measures needed to ensure employee and customer safety.                            \u00a0                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Category Finder        en                                                                                                            Latest News                    March\u00a0    8th,\u00a0    2021Minister McEntee welcomes passage through the Seanad of the proposal t...

T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar TD said:                            \"As the Minister responsible for enterprise and employment, I know how devastating today\u2019s news is for the business owners of Dublin and their staff. Trust that we did not take this decision lightly. I know this is a second closure for some and continued closure for others. The public health advice is overwhelming. We must stop the virus in its tracks now in order to protect our most vulnerable and make sure our health service doesn\u2019t get overwhelmed.\"                        Actions today include:                                                        Topped up Restart Grant Plus                        Dublin businesses impacted by 25% or more fall in turnover will now be entitled to a 30% top-up, bringing the new minimum for affected counties to \u20ac5,200 and the new maximum to \u20ac32,500. Those that applied and received a grant previously, can receive the top up of 30%.                                                        Increased Agency Support                        Applications from Dublin will be prioritised for the wide range of existing loan and voucher schemes available to assist businesses affected by COVID-19 through the July Jobs Stimulus and other government initiatives. This includes the LEO Trading Online Vouchers, MicroFinance Ireland COVID-19 Loan Fund and access to liquidity and investment finance schemes.                                                        Promotional Campaign                        The Dublin Local Enterprise Offices, in conjunction with local Chambers of Commerce and other business representative groups, will undertake an awareness, media and promotional campaign to let businesses know what grants, mentorship and low-cost loans are available to them. A dedicated helpline will be established to help companies access relevant enterprise supports.                T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar TD said:                            \"This package is about providing more help to the businesses affected to manage what is an extremely difficult situation. Over the next three weeks, the topped-up Restart Grant will help sustain business to reopen in three weeks. Applications from Dublin will be prioritised under all existing schemes. These interventions which come in addition to what is already available will make a difference over the next difficult weeks. The Budget will be our next opportunity to see what we can do for business and we will look at what further actions are required to help those worst affected.\"                        The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath TD:                            \"The measures we\u2019re announcing now are additional supports to add to the pillars already in place, such as the wage and income supports, grants, liquidity, tax measures and rates waivers. At different times, additional supports have been introduced for particular regions or sectors in response to the economic hardship brought on by additional COVID-19 restrictions. I acknowledge that this is an extremely difficult time for those business owners, employees and households that will be directly affected by today\u2019s decision.\"                        ENDS                                                        Notes                        More information on the business supports is available here.

This action is based on a review of the current public health advice and is in response to the deteriorating situation with the virus across the country.                All counties will be at Level 3 for a period of 3 weeks until midnight on 27 October 2020, at which point the situation will be reviewed by the government, based on the status of the virus and public health advice.                In addition, in recognising that Level 3 is being extended in Dublin and Donegal beyond the three-week period, businesses in these counties will be eligible for a further 20% and 10% top-up respectively.                Placing all counties at Level 3 has the following implications:                                 \tvisitors to private homes and gardens should be limited to a maximum number of 6 from one other household\tno social/family gatherings should take place, with exemptions to this for weddings and funerals (see below)\tno organised indoor gatherings should take place. Organised outdoor gatherings are permitted, up to a maximum of 15 people\tpeople should remain in their county (they must not leave to travel either domestically or internationally), with the exception of those who must travel for work, education and other essential purposes\tpeople are asked to work from home unless absolutely necessary\tschools, early learning and childcare services should remain open.

In recognition of the impact of these restrictions on businesses a 30% top-up to the Restart Plus grant will be provided to help support those affected through the three-week period.                Businesses who have previously benefited from the Restart Grant will be eligible to re-apply for this top-up.                This is in addition to the wide range of existing loan and voucher schemes available to assist businesses affected by COVID-19 provided through the July Jobs Stimulus and other government initiatives.                                 Other employment and income supports, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, as well as the full range of employment, training and support services for affected workers, will also continue to be made available. The final cost will depend on numbers of additional claimants.
