Thus, we have set up an expert group, which has developed ten measures which being applied by the Czech government can contribute to the rapid renewal of the economy's potential for long-term growth.Based on recent development we react the same way as partner industrial associations throughout Europe. Because only subsidies, social programs or soft loans will not return the economy to pre-crisis growth and long-term prosperity. In the below presented document we focus primarily on supporting investment, innovation, digital transformation, but also on education reform and better functioning of the labour market or simplification and transparency of regulation.You can read all the recommendations here.\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsection Aktu\u00e1ln\u011b\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t                back                    Share article:            \t                    Twitter                \t                    LinkedIn                \tE-mail\tPrint            Return to Top                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \t\tContacts                                                                                                                      \u00a9 Copyright                    2021                                            Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic                                                      \t\t\t\t\t                                                    | spcr@spcr.cz                                | created by Artio\u00a0s.r.o.                            \tFollow us on social networks:\tTwitter\tYoutube\tLinked in\tInstagram                                                                                                                                                                                         "}]}
