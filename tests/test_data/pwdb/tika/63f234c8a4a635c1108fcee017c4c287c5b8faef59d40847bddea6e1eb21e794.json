For instance, when Finland enters phase _strong distancing_, Elisa\u2019s strategy is as follows: \r\r* shops are open and safety arrangements are applied, \r* remote work is strongly recommended, \r* distancing and hygiene measures in offices are in place; and \r* business travel is extremely limited\r\rIn addition, the strategy provides general guidelines for distancing measures and employees in risk groups.

Fast infection spread anywhere unlikely, but still important to restrict amount of contacts. No 2m security distance needed - risk of infection is small due to small amount of infected persons. Health based risk groups still need attention. Healthcare is able to take care of all patients.Vaccination or medication available, so risk of infection and severe consequences is small.

Risk groups advised to distancing. Infection chains still known.N/ARisk groups at work7Based on current data, persons over 70 years of age are more susceptible to severe coronavirus infections. In addition, the risk of developing a severe coronavirus infection, especially in older people, may be increased by pre-existing conditions that significantly impair the functioning of the lungs, heart or immune system. These include (THL 12.5.2020):\u2022 Severe heart disease\u2022 Lung disease that is not clinically stabilised\u2022 Diabetes that involves organ damage\u2022 Chronic liver or kidney failure\u2022 Diseases that weaken the immune system, such as leukaemia or lymphoma that is currently undergoing cytostatic treatment (not maintenance therapy)\u2022 Medication which significantly weakens the immune system (e.g. high-dosage cortisone therapy)https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/coronavirus-covid-19/risk-groups-for-coronavirus-diseaseElisians with one of these conditions should request a doctor\u2019s certificate for their condition and discuss with their supervisor of work arrangements.The supervisor with support from HR takes care of adequate measures.These can include\u2022 Prolonged remote work\u2022 Transfer from directly customer facing tasks to the back office\u2022 Solitary working space at the office\u2022 Protective equipment if recommended by the doctorhttps://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/coronavirus-covid-19/risk-groups-for-coronavirus-diseaseGeneral guidance to distancing measures8Minimize TIME spent in proximity of others\u2022 Prevent formation of queues with people waiting together\u2022 Have short meetings if physical presence\u2022 Prepare for the physical meeting to keep it short: make appointments online, collect materials before the meeting etc.\u2022 Adjust work schedules to avoid high traffic in lobbiesIncrease physical DISTANCE between people \u2022 Seating arrangements to guide seating in office spaces, cafeterias etc.\u2022 Queueing signage in shops\u2022 Distancing signage in narrow places at the officeBuild BARRIERS to prevent infection spreading \u2022 Use small meeting rooms for individual work, especially for risk groups\u2022 Use glass walls to separate eg. salespersons from customers\u2022 Especially in jobs that require lots of speaking, separate desks with cubicle walls \u2022 Use face masks where feasibleLimit NUMBER of different people meeting each other\u2022 Support remote work as much as possible\u2022 Distributed location of critical teams\u2022 Restrict mobility at the office to own home bases\u2022 Create work schedules to support A/B groups or teams at the office."}]}
