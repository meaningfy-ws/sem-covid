At the same time in the assessment of the EU sectoral social partners: the European Transport Workers' Federation ETF and the European Community Shipowners' Associations ECSA, seafarers are the frontline workers of the maritime industry, which carries 90% of world trade, as they play a key role in supplying nations with essential goods. In 2021, this will increasingly include vaccine doses and personal protective equipment. The ETF and ECSA therefore call on EU authorities and governments to ensure that seafarers are recognized as key workers in all EU Member States.\r\rThe European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation is a pan-European trade union organisation which embraces transport trade unions from the European Union, the European Economic Area and Central and Eastern European countries. The ETF represents more than 5 million transport workers from more than 200 transport unions and 41 European countries.\r\rThe European Community Shipowners\u2019 Associations is the umbrella organisation of the national shipowners\u2019 associations of the EU, the UK and Norway. European shipowners control around 40% of the world\u2019s shipping fleet. ECSA\u2019s prime task is to represent the overall interests of the European shipping industry with the institutions of the European Union. ", "content_of_measure_description": "ETF and ECSA strongly call on EU Member States and EU Institutions to ensure that seafarers and maritime personnel should, in line with the key worker status, continue to be exempted from restrictions being put in place, like quarantine and pre-arrival testing requirements. This to ensure they can travel to and from EU Member States for the purpose of crew changes, shore leave or repatriation.\r\rSocial partners stress that even with priority access to vaccinations, it will take some time before all seafarers will be vaccinated. During this period seafarers and maritime personnel should not be subjected to any requirement to have been vaccinated for entry to or travel within the EU.\rSocial partners stressed also that European flag states have a particularly important role to play in leading by example in facilitating crew changes in their ports and supporting their flagged vessels in efforts to undertake crew changes and repatriations globally.", "use_of_measure_description": "n.a.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "This is a bilateral initiative of EU-level sectoral social partners.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "Yes", "private_or_public_sector": "Not specified", "is_occupation_specific": "Yes", "actors": ["EU level social partners"], "target_groups": ["Cross-border commuters", "Sector specific set of companies", "Companies providing essential services", "Other businesses", "Workers in essential services"], "funding": ["No special funding required"], "sectors": ["Water transport"], "occupations": [{"recordId": "37", "occupations::name": "Labourers in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport", "modId": "0"}], "sources": [{"url": "https://www.etf-europe.org/resource/etf-ecsa-letter-on-crew-changes-and-vaccinations-210121/", "title": "EU Member States must enable crew changes to take place without further delays and prioritise seafarers for vaccination", "content_path": "res/8cd92f4536183229dfbe6b94a390f584d333170f79e3386a1f3f480dd8e24faf", "content": "ETF: European Transport Workers' Federation | ETF-ECSA letter on crew changes and vaccinations 210121 -
