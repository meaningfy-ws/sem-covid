An allocation of \u20ac5 million is being made available under the \u201cLive Performance Support Scheme\u201d which aims to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  The scheme will help to de-risk the costs of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by the Department.                A further support package, the Music Stimulus Package, involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and western and traditional and folk.  Under this package, a fund of \u20ac1,000,000 is being put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources including live event fees.                The music support schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases.  The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work in the context of COVID restrictions. The Music Stimulus Package schemes will be managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.                Announcing the new measure of support Minister Catherine Martin said:                \u201cI am conscious of the unprecedented nature of the challenge facing live performance promoters and producers, not least from a financial point of view and accordingly am pleased to announce this funding response that will assist established commercial venues and promoters to employ performers, artists, technicians, creative and performance support staff up to the end of 2020 in anticipation of the return of audiences to live performance.  Further, to help ensure the survival and revival of the music industry in Ireland, I am announcing the introduction of a number of schemes which have been designed to provide incentives for creating new work, the recording of new music from all music genres and the promotion and release of work, which might not otherwise happen in 2020.  These schemes will also support the music professionals who work with artists and facilitate music performance, recording and album release.\u201d                Key features of the these Support Schemes include-                \tSupport the creation of employment opportunities in the culture, creative and music industries.\tAddress the large gap left by the absence of income from live performances\tSupport performances/work that will commence on or before 31 December 2020.\tSupport commercial venues, producers and promoters in the culture sector (e.g. music, entertainment and theatre).\tSupport the music professionals and aim to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work in the context of COVID restrictions.

The main objective of this pilot scheme is to provide employment opportunities to artists in this uncertain time and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead with either a live audience or to share content through streaming.                Recipients of this funding allocation range from small to large venues, producers and promoters and grants range from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac400,000.                The funds will support a variety of live events planned including concerts, pantomimes, theatre productions, festivals, outdoor performances and comedy events.                The exceptional demand for this pilot scheme contributed to Minister Martin\u2019s decision to ensure a much larger package would be available to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters next year as part of Budget 2021 funding.                Speaking today Minister Martin said:                            \"I am very conscious of the unprecedented nature of the challenge facing the live performance sector, not least from a financial point of view and accordingly I\u2019m very pleased to announce this funding allocation which I\u2019m sure will greatly assist in the employment of performers, artists, technicians, creative and performance support staff across the sector.                                    \"I was also delighted to recently announce \u20ac50 million in support for the sector in Budget 2021 \u2013 which will encompass a range of supports for live entertainment events to take place in venues next year across the country, and other measures to support music, and a new grant scheme for equipment.                                    \"This scheme, designed after consultation with the sector, helps to de-risk the costs of running productions that may be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The live events sector was one of the first to close and I want to ensure that it will be supported and there once again for musicians, artists and performers.\"                        ENDS                                                        Notes                        The list of successful applicants under this pilot Live Performance Support Scheme is available here:                            \tApplicant\tLocation of performances\tType of event\tSpecifics\tRecommended Grant\tDeeramber Ltd\tArts Centres/ Theatres nationwide\tTheatrical Production -

The supports are targeted at independent radio, in particular local and regional radio, and the production of programmes that support the live music sector.                 Minister Martin will be providing additional funding of \u20ac2.5m for the independent radio sector.                The Minister today wrote to the BAI requesting that they develop a funding round for the independent radio sector early next year. Minister Martin asked that local and regional radio stations in particular would be prioritised.                 Speaking today the Minister said:                            \"Radio has played a vital role in providing reliable news and information to citizens throughout the COVID-19 crisis, and in bringing together local communities. I am delighted to be able to provide additional support of \u20ac2.5m which builds on earlier supports to the sector to ensure they can continue to deliver their services at this difficult time when advertising revenues have been reduced.                                    \u201cI hope these extra funds will help local radio stations across the country who have had a difficult year. I have met with the sector and heard their concerns and want to ensure that local radio stations have more support as we hopefully look towards a better period for the country next year.\"                        Recognising the severe challenges faced by the live music sector as a result of COVID-19, the Minister also asked the BAI to include a call for specific projects to support this sector in the next general round of Sound and Vision and has provided \u20ac1.4m for this purpose.                 The Minister noted:                            \"We all love our live music and miss going to gigs and concerts. I have asked the BAI, therefore, in calling for applications for the next general round of Sound and Vision to seek projects which will provide a mechanism to support the sector.\"                        This will complement the other initiatives to support the live music sector that the Minister has already put in place.                 Finally, the Minister asked the BAI to allocate \u20ac1m of the additional funding to the current Sound and Vision round which was hugely oversubscribed, providing much needed support for the independent production sector.                ENDS                                                        Notes                        The \u20ac4.9m announced today by Minister Martin is on top of supports already put in place this year.                 Radio benefitted from a waiver of the broadcasting levy for the first half of 2020, worth \u20ac1m to the sector. A special \u20ac2.5m round of the Sound and Vision Fund for commercial radio, including local and regional stations, has also been distributed in 2020.                For audiovisual, the Minister secured additional funding of \u20ac2m in the July stimulus package bringing the amount available in the latest Sound and Vision round to \u20ac4.5m. This was on top of the \u20ac7m made available earlier this year to the audiovisual sector under Sound and Vision.                 Further details of the Broadcasting Fund including how to apply for these rounds will be published by the BAI in due course.

Acutely recognising that areas such as Tourism and Culture are a \u201cfundamental expression of who we are as a nation\u201d, the Minister \u2013 who took office in June \u2013 has put key supports in place for these essential industries during her first six months in office. Measures include:                July Jobs Stimulus The wide-ranging suite of measures, agreed at Cabinet level, unveiled grants and supports for the sectors. Notable announcements included: the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme; an additional \u20ac300m for the ReStart Grant Scheme for tourism businesses; the announcement of a Stay and Spend programme to encourage tourist spending; and funding for the audiovisual sector and the Culture Fund.                 October Budget                 Minister Martin and the Minister of State for Sport and An Ghaeltacht, Jack Chambers TD, announced a strong package of supports as part of an unprecedented total 1.08bn Budget for 2021. For the first time, the government provided support for live entertainment in the amount of \u20ac50m.The enlarged Department\u2019s two new areas \u2013 sport and tourism \u2013 received strong boosts, notably a new \u20ac55m support fund for strategic tourism businesses and a reduction in VAT in the sector to 9%. A new COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) offered rebates of up to \u20ac5,000 a week to hospitality, accommodation and arts businesses impacted by the pandemic.                 Other measures:                 \u2022\t\u20ac130m for the Arts Council \u2013 a record level                \u2022\tOver \u20ac78m funding allocation for Gaeltacht and Irish language sector \u2013 up \u20ac14.8m on initial 2020 allocation                \u2022\tFunding for TG4 up to \u20ac40.733m                \u2022\tSport Ireland allocated \u20ac104.5m \u2013 up \u20ac36m                Arts and Culture have been hard hit by COVID-19, a fact recognised by the Minister with a series of funding supports throughout the year. Arts and Culture. Combined with funding from the July Jobs Stimulus package, this additional funding announcement brought to \u20ac56m the overall support for arts and culture in the early autumn.                Night-Time Economy TaskforceAnnounced in July, the Taskforce sees a range of Departments, Agencies and groups working together to promote and develop a vibrant and sustainable night-time culture and economy.                \u20ac6m Live Performance Support Scheme Allocation of \u20ac5m under the \u201cLive Performance Support Scheme\u201d to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries, plus a \u20ac1m Music Stimulus Package. Some 184 musicians/bands were initially awarded a total of \u20ac896,000 to assist them to record singles, EPs and albums. The overall Music Industry Stimulus Package  was then increased to \u20ac1.7m due to an exceptional number of applications from musicians and the funds also covered 79song writing camps and 56 new album releases                Separately, 59 organisations benefited from the Live Performance Support scheme. Recipients included small to large venues, producers and promoters, with grants ranging from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac400,000.                 The Department has also played its part in backing creativity to light up the darkness. It has supported the Hot Press Y&E Series, which saw 40 Young and Emerging Series artists perform online to fans in Ireland and around the world in a series of concerts.                Support for the Other Voices programme of concerts and events emphasises the Department\u2019s commitment to helping wellbeing through a range of initiatives including cultural content.                Culture Ireland\u2019s Ireland Performs, in association with Facebook Ireland, showcased the best of Irish artistry through virtual events and music sessions, again supporting wellbeing, while Creative Ireland\u2019s Cruinni\u00fa na n\u00d3g saw one of our most cherished resources \u2013 our young \u2013 showcase their creativity in a summer\u2019s day of imagination and talent.                The Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce has kept the Minister briefed on the situation in the sector, after the announcement of the formation of the cross-industry body, chaired by Clare Duignan.                 Despite the importance of tackling the conditions created by COVID-19, the Minister has continued to emphasise that better days lie ahead. The appointment of Cultural Officers in London and New York, under the  Government's Global Ireland 2025 strategy, was a key statement of intent. The officers will play a vital role in widening and deepening Ireland\u2019s global cultural presence and engagement in the months and years ahead.                 Also looking to the future, Minister Martin has held high-level talks with EU Ministers for Culture and proposed Europe-wide concerts to mark the reopening of live performances.                 Participation is a key pillar of the vision for areas such as culture and sport. The Minister announced a \u20ac500,000 investment in the Creative Ireland Programme\u2019s new Creativity in Older Age Programme to emphasise that the arts is for all of us.                 Despite COVID-19, all areas have been working resolutely to ensure that the show goes on \u2013 virtually. Funding for Galway 2020's revised online programme saw 28 projects and over 350 artists supported.                 In Tourism, the Tourism Recovery Taskforce submitted a Recovery Planto the Minister detailing a number of recommendations to help the sector survive and recover from the pandemic. These recommendations were an important input into the Minister\u2019s deliberations for the Budget. Minister Martin subsequently appointed a Recovery Oversight Group to oversee the implementation of agreed recommendations of the Taskforce and monitor the sector\u2019s recovery from COVID-19.                 One of the key Budgetary measures to support tourism was the Stay and Spend Scheme, launched by An Taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin TD, the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe TD, and Minister Martin.                 Minister Martin addressed European Tourism Ministers in September, where she discussed developing more sustainable tourism policies, the safe return of international travel and allowing the maximum flexibility possible in State Aids rules, to enable Member States provide timely and appropriate supports for tourism.                 A cut in the VAT rate for the sector to 9% was also secured by Minister Martin in the Budget after a recommendation for such from the Taskforce.                 Sport is crucial to our wellbeing, both physically and mentally. As with other areas under the Department, participation and equality are key. This year\u2019s All Ireland games have brought joy to many. The success of Sam Bennett in the Tour de France, and the dedication of teams such as the Irish Women\u2019s soccer squad, have proved inspirational in a time of uncertainty.                 The Government, and the Department, have supported our sporting bodies. In November, the Ministers announced an unprecedented funding package of \u20ac85 million to support the sport sector (IRFU, GAA, FAI, National Governing Bodies of Sport, clubs and communities) . The Return to Sport Expert Group has been liaising with health authorities throughout, to ensure that this key component of Ireland\u2019s social fabric returns and reopens on a safe and sustainable footing.                The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme has helped clubs and associations, big and small, over the years. The 2020 programme has funding of \u20ac40m to help clubs in their vital work.                 Participation received a boost, too, in September, with the announcement of an investment package of \u20ac7.3m in Dormant Accounts Funding for a wide range of sport and physical activity measures countrywide. The investment focuses on people with disabilities, people who are educationally disadvantaged and from disadvantaged communities.                 In a further support for the sector, both Ministers announced a \u20ac2.5 million funding package for swimming pool operators across the country.                 As with arts and culture, both Ministers are looking to the future of sport while dealing with the pressures of the present. Minister Chambers addressed European Sports Ministers in December, where he discussed the safe return of spectators to sport as well as the prevailing Covid challenges to the sector.                 A key mission of the Department is to support the Irish language and to strengthen its use as the principal community language of the Gaeltacht. The Budget agreed a  \u20ac78m-plus funding allocation for the Gaeltacht and Irish language sector \u2013 an increase of \u20ac14.8m on the initial 2020 allocation.                It also announced total funding of \u20ac31.8m for \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta to help protect client companies from full impacts of Brexit and COVID-19.                There was also a first programme funding increase since 2016 for An Foras Teanga.                 Recognising the importance of storytellers, musicians and other artists, \u20ac280,000 was awarded to 57 Gaeltacht artists.                In December, Minister Chambers also announced the approval of a language plan for an tEachr\u00e9idh, Co. Galway, under the language planning process. An annual allowance of up to \u20ac100,000 will be allocated, allowing the Eachr\u00e9idh Language Plan Committee to employ a Language Planning Officer to help implement the language plan in the area.                Day-to-day commerce is crucial for the language, with Minister Martin and Minister of State Chambers collaborating with Minister of State Malcolm Noonan to announce additional supports for Irish language restoration works on traditional shopfronts.                 In their commitment to community, Ministers Martin and Chambers also announced total funding of \u20ac660,000 for capital projects in Gaeltacht areas, funding which will be used by clubs and associations to support their endeavours.                  The development of the language in the digital age was recognised in a Government report revealing progress of 2018-2022 Action Plan to promote the Irish language. Both Ministers noted the \u201csignificant progress\u201d in supporting the language which was reflected in the report.                 The Ireland of a century ago saw some of its darkest days. The Ireland of today is working to combat some of its most difficult times since then. Despite these considerable challenges, there is time \u2013 and motivation \u2013 to reflect. Minister Martin announced funding of \u20ac1.75 million for local authorities in 2021 to support their leading role in developing community-led commemorative activities for the final phase of the Decade of Centenaries Programme.                 The move followed increased funding in the Budget to allow for the appropriate commemoration of the centenary of events leading to the foundation of the State.                Under its new Media functions, the Department now holds responsibility for the development of the legislative and regulatory framework for broadcasting and for certain media in Ireland. It is also responsible for policy in relation to the funding of the public service broadcasters, RT\u00c9 and TG4, and the development of the broadcasting sector in general.                \u2022\tSupplementary funding of \u20ac1.9m was provided to TG4 in 2020 related to the additional COVID-19 programming costs, not least C\u00fala4 ar Scoil.                \u2022\tAdditional funding of \u20ac3.5m was secured in the budget for TG4 to bring its total exchequer funding to \u20ac40.733m in 2021 which will ensure that it continues to provide high quality and innovative Irish language and programming and better implement the strategy to attract and retain younger audiences across all platforms.                   \u2022\t\u20ac2m was provided under the July Stimulus for the BAI Sound and Vision Scheme to support broadcasters and independent producers.                \u2022\tA further \u20ac4.9m was provided to BAI in December to support local radio and audiovisual production that supports the live music sector.                 Recognising that \"it is important that national events which are of great importance to Ireland be shown free to air for us all to enjoy\u201d, Minister Martin has opened a public consultation on the designation of sporting and other events as being of major importance to society.                 The Minister also presented additions to the new law proposed for online safety and media regulation.                 These will further help avoid the spread of harmful content by allowing for substantial fines against companies or platforms and by ensuring senior management are held responsible.                Furthermore, the legislation will implement an EU directive to ensure standards for video on-demand content is brought into line with TV broadcasting regulations.                 The sector\u2019s future is also the subject of The Future of Media Commission, which will chart a pathway for public service broadcasting and independent media.                 Reflecting on her first six months as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin said: \u201cThe past six months have been difficult for the nation, with much of that pressure felt in areas overseen by my Department. It\u2019s been a challenging time, but a challenge I\u2019ve willingly accepted.                 \u201cSupports in place have enabled those in the artistic and Gaeltacht communities and tourism sector to survive. Our sports, though devoid of spectators, have managed to bring much-needed joy to the nation through our media. \u201cThere is a sense of hope. And the recent call to action from Tourism Ireland signals the message that our country will go back to hosting the world and also entertaining it through our rich heritage, artists and ambassadors.                \u201cThe Decade of Centenaries reminds us of the key and historic events of 100 years ago \u2013 events that would later gave birth to a strong, proud nation. Just like we overcame that chequered past, I have no doubt that history will repeat itself and we will have greater days ahead.                \u201cI am committed to doing my best to ensure sectors overseen by my Department are centre stage in the recovery. And I know the agencies under my remit - in this time of crisis - will rise to the challenge of reaffirming what is best about us as people in the year ahead.\u201d                 The Minister of State for Sport and An Ghaeltacht, Jack Chambers, said: \u201cThe Gaeltacht and sports worlds have faced huge tests this year, and I commend them for their resilience in the face of such adversity. Such resilience has required support in tandem, and I am happy to have been part of that mission to put their issues front and centre.                 \u201cEarlier this year, my Department implemented a COVID-19 support package worth \u20ac4.7m aimed at ensuring the maintenance of the Irish summer colleges sector. In  July we announced an additional \u20ac8m for \u00dadar\u00e1s Na Gaeltachta, bringing the total capital allocation to \u20ac18m. This extra funding is supporting a range of capital investments which will enhance an t\u00dadar\u00e1s\u2019 capacity to support local enterprises and is creating 40-50 new construction jobs. It is expected that the investment will support the creation of 320 new longer-term jobs.                \u201cThis year has seen also increased funding for the language planning process and the Gaeltacht Community and Language Supports Programme. In addition to this, further funding of \u20ac250,000 has been be provided to Eala\u00edn na Gaeltachta to provide a significant number of bursaries for Gaeltacht-based artists.                \u201cLikewise, sport is part of what we are as a nation. I am delighted that the All Ireland Championships \u2013 for men and women \u2013 have continued to delight us as we wear our respective colours and cheer on our heroes from afar. But supporting sport wasn\u2019t just about investment in the main bodies of the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU, it was also ensuring that everyone has a chance to shine at whatever level they choose.                 \u201cThe Sports Capital and Equipment Programme is open to all clubs, big and small, while the dormant accounts funding is particularly focusing on areas of disadvantage. I\u2019d like to thank our partners in Sport Ireland for their work in promoting health, whether it be walking or everyday activities for everyday people. I wish every sports body a brighter new year and commend you on your efforts.\u201d                                                                                                                                        Share            \t                                                                \u00a0                    Email                \t                                                                \u00a0                    Facebook                \t                                                                \u00a0                    Twitter                                                                            BETA                    This is a prototype - your feedback will help us to improve it.

The intention is to support those museums in regional and rural areas or with a specific focus of both local and national interest that were particularly impacted by the Covid-19 Emergency.                An allocation of \u20ac58,000 to Business to Arts as a continuing support for their fellowships designed to support and enhance investment by cultural organisations in the development of fundraising, human resources and capacity building.

With the Arts, Culture and Entertainment expected to be hit harder by job losses than any other sector of the economy, funding must targeted towards those artists and creatives who are most exposed.\u00a0\u201cIrish Equity seeks to ensure that the funding announced in the budget promptly and directly benefits our members including actors, directors and theatre makers, dancers, designers, stage managers and other creatives. These people are the backbone of the creative industry. We also want to see funding channelled into building sustainability in the Arts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFor Irish Equity representatives, negotiations on better pay and conditions are just one feature of our work and we also campaign for a sustainable environment for workers. Being a member of the union is even more important for those employed in the Arts and Entertainment as this public health crisis continues.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Karan O\u2019Loughlin was speaking at the release of a promotional video created by Irish Equity and highlighting the importance of the work done by the union on behalf of its members.\u00a0The video features some of Ireland\u2019s finest acting talent, discussing why membership of Irish Equity is important and the protections it offers them in the frequently precarious freelance world.\u00a0 It also demonstrates the rich and rapidly growing diversity among the membership of Irish Equity.Watch the video nowAbout Irish Equity\t\t\tIrish Equity represents Professionals in the live performance and theatre sector in the Republic of Ireland.
