These include the following reports: \r\r* TUC (2020) A new jobs protection and upskilling plan\r* TUC (2020) Key Workers: Decent pay and secure work for key workers\r* TUC (2020) A Better Recovery: Learning the lessons of the corona crisis to create a stronger, fairer economy\r\rThe rationale for the reports is that emerging\u00a0from the crisis successfully will require more than stemming the rates of Covid-19 infection, and ensuring that people can return to work safely, important though this is, the TUC acknowledges that the\u00a0UK is entering the deepest recession for decades and that\u00a0without government action, unemployment will rise to levels not seen for 30 years. It counters emergent calls for a return to austerity, pointing out that the previous decade of\u00a0austerity was a failure, repeatedly failing to\u00a0deliver economic growth or reduce national debt, while creating a weakened economic and social fabric, clearly exposed by the coronavirus crisis.\r\rThe TUC calls for\u00a0a fairer society and therefore, a stronger economy, in which decent wages create both security for workers and their families, and demand for the products and services of the nation's businesses. It states that this will be achieved through\u00a0everyone having a decent job, on better pay and working conditions, alongside revitalised public services and a stronger safety net. \r\rIn line with this, its report on key workers specifically calls for pay increases for key workers to be an integral part of the recovery from the coronavirus lockdown. It points out that the crisis highlighted how much society owes to healthcare staff, care workers, retail and delivery workers, public transport workers, teachers and support staff, energy workers amongst others. As a result, there is strong public support for ensuring key workers are treated fairly.\r\rThe New Jobs Protection and Upskilling plan is a partial response to the ending of the Government's furlough scheme, due to end in October. The TUC argues that government needs to do more to get people back to work, support jobs and prevent the threat of mass unemployment and that it should learn from experience across Europe. Such support should come with conditions attached and that there is now an opportunity to use this moment to upskill the workforce, prepare for the jobs of the future and build a fairer labour market that offers decent work to everyone.\r\rIts key message is that the recovery should encompass the complementary policy goals of creating a fairer labour market and the creation and promotion of decent work.", "content_of_measure_description": "The reports are essentially policy recommendations to get Britain growing out of the crisis and in so doing, prevent mass\u00a0unemployment and ensure the creation of decent work. The TUC argues that the\u00a0pandemic alone did not cause this economic crisis. It was made worse by a decade of austerity and the government\u2019s failure to strengthen the UK\u2019s economy. It avers that choosing the wrong approach to recovery now risks embedding low growth, long-term unemployment and all the social ills that go alongside.\r\rIts\u00a0first report, published in May called for an 'investment for growth approach' and called for action on a number of key areas, including:\r\r* Decent work and fairer employment relationships\r* Sustainable industry with an economic stimulus for a just transition to net zero carbon\r* Reforms to social security to provide help faster and prevent poverty \r* The rebuilding of public services, with decent pay\r\rOn this last point, its later report on decent pay and work for key workers, it called on government to improve the pay of 6 million key workers by increasing the minimum wage and public sector pay, as well as enacting a ban on zero-hours contracts. \r\rIn September, the TUC published its job protection and upskilling plan, in response to the planned end of the government's furlough/job retention scheme  in October. The TUC argues that the Job Retention Scheme (JRS) has done vital work protecting jobs, supporting 9.6 million people in total,\r\rIt states that there are some tentative signs of economic recovery but that the threat of mass unemployment is still present, with the Bank of England estimating that unemployment could rise to 7.5% by the end of the year, leaving 2.5 million people out of work. Further, the National Institute of Social and Economic Research estimates that unemployment could reach ten per cent. \r\rThe TUC thus argues that there is now an opportunity to use this moment to upskill the workforce, prepare for the jobs of the future and build a fairer labour market that offers decent work to everyone. The TUC thus proposes a Jobs Retention Deal and upskilling plan, recommending that: \r\r* Government should require businesses to demonstrate they have been hit by coronavirus restrictions in order to qualify for the Jobs Retention Deal\r* Businesses hit by local lockdowns would automatically qualify for the scheme\r* The scheme should require workers to be working for a minimum proportion of their normal hours\r* The scheme should support workers who cannot work because they are in the group previously told to shield or who have caring responsibilities that mean they cannot work\r* Similar support should be put in place for the self-employed, including those who have lost out on previous support\r* Workers should continue to receive at least 80 per cent of their pay for time they are not working\r* Workers earning the national minimum wage should receive 100 per cent of their normal pay\r* Any worker working less than 50 per cent of their normal working time must be offered funded training\r* Businesses accessing the scheme must set out Fair Pay Plans\r* Businesses that access support should set out a plan for decent jobs\r* Businesses that access support should pay their Corporation Tax in the UK\r* Businesses accessing the scheme should commit to keep people in work and not pay dividends while using the scheme.\r\r\r\r", "use_of_measure_description": "The report itself is publicly available on the TUC's website; no evaluation data is available with regard to how many times it has been downloaded etc. These are policy recommendations, not actual measures that have been implemented.

It was made worse by a decade of austerity and the government\u2019s failure to strengthen the UK\u2019s economy. Choosing the wrong approach to recovery now risks embedding low growth, long-term unemployment and all the social ills that go alongside.An investment for growth approach means taking action on six key areas:\tDecent work and a new way of doing business: New business models based on fairer employment relationships. A fairer share for workers of the wealth they create, with a higher minimum wage and new collective bargaining rights.\tSustainable industry: Economic stimulus for a just transition to net zero carbon. Rebuilding the UK\u2019s industrial capacity with modern tech and training in new skills.\tA real safety net: Reforms to social security to provide help faster and prevent poverty. A job guarantee scheme so everyone can work and long-term unemployment does not take hold.\tRebuilding public services: Bringing our public services back to full strength, with decent pay for those who looked after us in the crisis, and a new focus on good jobs and direct employment in social care.\tEquality at work: Specific actions to make sure women, disabled people and BME groups do not suffer disproportionately from the impact of the coronavirus recession.\tRebuilding internationalism: New international rules must prioritise decent jobs and public services for all.The evidence from the post-war recovery is that this investment for\u00a0growth recovery plan can pay for itself. Millions of working families with higher disposable income create the economic demand needed for strong growth and healthy public finances. Stronger public services and an effective safety net will support people to start and grow businesses, and will better protect against a future pandemic.Download full report (pdf) | single page online viewIntroductionCoronavirus has transformed the lives of people across the UK and much of the world. Responding to the health crisis has required significant restrictions on everyday life, and dramatic economic measures from the government. The impact of the virus has been compounded by the fragility of our health and social care services and by pre-existing inequalities in living and working conditions.Significant flaws in how our economy is organised have been exposed by the crisis and addressing these will be key to rebuilding a stronger and fairer post-virus economy with greater resilience for the future.\u00a0The response to the crisis has been educative. The government\u2019s interventions show the speed and scale of what can be done when necessary; the same commitment and urgency must now be applied to addressing the threat of climate change. The \u2018Everyone In\u2019 programme that brought homeless people off the streets in a matter of days shows that homelessness is not inevitable \u2013 and that political will can solve seemingly intractable social problems. The changes that people have made in their lives during lockdown have demonstrated the UK\u2019s adaptability and resilience - vital components in the creation of a fairer and more sustainable economy. The mutual aid groups that sprang up spontaneously across the country remind us of our interdependence, and that people want to help and support one another. These are the values that should govern our economic relationships.\u00a0The crisis has put the world of work centre stage and shown who really keeps the country going. It is the labour of working people that creates the goods and services that people need. The commitment of health, social care, transport, food and other essential workers to keep working while others stay at home has been inspirational. And it has exposed the poor pay and insecurity of many workers in essential services \u2013 despite the vital economic and social value they create. It is time to reassess the value placed on different jobs and recognise the inter-dependency that characterises every workplace and our society more broadly. Building back better means delivering a pay rise for all low paid workers and addressing the discrimination and insecurity that many face.\u00a0The scale and depth of existing inequalities have been starkly exposed. The fact that Black and minority ethnic (BME) people are more likely to live in overcrowded housing, have poorer health outcomes and be concentrated in insecure work where they have access to far fewer employment rights is well documented. However, the Covid-19 crisis has shown us that this inequality not only limits Black people\u2019s life opportunities but also contributes to prematurely ending their lives. Most carers are women, whether paid or unpaid, making up around four out of five of those working in health and social care and doing three times more unpaid care than men. Imbalances in caring have been increased by the closure of schools and childcare settings, with women balancing paid work, childcare and caring for extended family. In recovery, we need renewed commitment and action to address systemic discrimination and inequality or we risk not only further reinforcing entrenched inequality but also reversing the gains of previous decades.\u00a0Addressing the indignity of low pay and the scourge of insecurity and inequality requires more than legal reform; it requires a new approach to how our economy is organised. We need new business models based on employment relationships that promote dignity, fair pay and voice at work, and an end to business models based on fragmented employment relationships, low pay and insecurity. This will require corporate governance reform to promote workforce voice in company decision-making and changes to the rules governing company purpose to create companies focussed on long-term, sustainable success, shared by all their stakeholders.\u00a0The importance of unions in expressing the collective voice and interests of working people has never been clearer. As the crisis has demonstrated the centrality of everyday work and everyday workers to our economy, so it has shown why workers must be properly represented in decisions about how work and our economic system is organised. Unions worked with government to deliver the job retention scheme that saved millions of jobs \u2013 and negotiated with employers to use it rather than making redundancies. We fought for strong rules on safe workplaces, and co-operated with employers on new ways of working to allow businesses to adapt and survive. Working people have voted with their feet, joining unions in large numbers throughout the crisis. The government must continue to work constructively with working people through their unions, and with employers, for a sustainable recovery in which all working people can prosper.\u00a0Our economy is truly global in nature: investment, goods, services and people cross national borders every day in increasingly complex and varied pathways. The rules that govern our international systems for trade and finance often act to damage the interests of poorer countries and make it harder for working people across the world to be paid fairly for their labour, driving down regulatory standards and working conditions, increasing precarious work and undermining public services. Working people must be engaged in the process of developing international global rules and institutions that support universal human and labour rights and ensure a Just Transition. In building back a better country, we must also play our part in building back a better world.\u00a0We entered this crisis with a fragile safety net and public services damaged by years of austerity \u2013 and this undermined our preparedness for the challenge of coronavirus. There is now an unanswerable case for a new settlement for public services, with adequate funding, public provision and a public service ethos at its heart. Even in the most optimistic scenario, there is a bumpy ride ahead and it is essential that our safety net is strengthened so it can offer security and safety to all who need it in the times ahead. As a society, we are only as strong as our weakest member.\u00a0Coming out of the crisis successfully will require more than stemming the rates of Covid-19 infection, and ensuring that people can return to work\u00a0safely, important though this is. The UK is entering the deepest recession for decades. Without government action, unemployment will rise to levels not seen for 30 years. Already there are siren voices calling for a return to austerity, but the last decade shows the failure of austerity in its own terms. It repeatedly did not deliver economic growth or reduce national debt, while creating a weakened economic and social fabric exploited in deadly fashion by the virus.\u00a0Instead, by creating a fairer society, we will build a stronger economy, in which decent wages create both security for workers and their families, and demand for the products and services of our businesses. The way to do this is through everyone having a decent job, on better pay and working conditions, alongside revitalised public services and a stronger safety net. We must invest in this fairer future; we cannot afford not to.\u00a0People are the heart of our economy. Let\u2019s choose a recovery built around their work, their needs, their health, and their dreams.\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t7\t8\t9\tLast\tNextContents01Introduction02Executive summary03Chapter 1: Decent jobs and a new way of doing business04Chapter 2: Equality at work05Chapter 3: A real safety net06Chapter 4: Rebuilding public services07Chapter 5: Building a sustainable industrial base and a green recovery08Chapter 6: Rebuilding internationalism09Chapter 7: Paying for itselfSingle page view Download this reportPDF | 697.73 KBStay UpdatedWant to hear about our latest news and blogs?

The scheme has supported 9.6 million people in total, with over 6.8 million people still supported by the scheme at the end of June.1.There are some tentative signs of economic recovery: retail sales are up \u2013 although many of these remain online2 .\u00a0But the threat of mass unemployment is still with us. The Bank of England estimates that unemployment could rise to 7.5 per cent by the end of the year, leaving 2.5 million people out of work. They show that in previous recessions, employment has taken seven years to recover to its previous rate 3.\u00a0The National Institute of Social and Economic Research estimates that unemployment could reach ten per cent 4.\u00a0It\u2019s clear that the Job Retention Bonus proposed in the Chancellor\u2019s summer statement isn\u2019t enough to stop millions of people losing their livelihoods. And we know that in previous downturns young people and those already disadvantaged in the labour market\u2013 including Black and disabled workers- tend to lose work first 5 .Government needs to do more to get people back to work, support jobs and prevent the threat of mass unemployment \u2013 learning from experience across Europe. But this support should come with strings attached. We have an opportunity to use this moment to upskill our workforce, prepare for the jobs of the future and build a fairer labour market that offers decent work to everyone.Our proposal for a Jobs Retention Deal would:\tSupport businesses to bring people back to work and save jobs. To qualify for support, employers must ensure that workers meet a threshold of minimum hours (pro rata) at work. This will encourage employers to protect jobs and promote work sharing as the firm gradually builds back to full operations. We would suggest a minimum threshold of ten per cent.\tDevelop the skills of the future, by funding any worker undertaking less than 50 per cent of their normal working time to part in training; and\tRequire businesses receiving support to set out fair pay plans, allow trade unions access to workplaces and work to eliminate zero hours contracts, to pay their tax in the UK, and not to pay dividends while claiming government support.Governments across Europe are taking the necessary steps to support jobs:\tIn Austria, unions and employers have extended their coronavirus short time work scheme for another six months from October 6.\tIn Germany, the coronavirus specific short time work scheme is expected to be extended until December 2021 7.\tIn France, a new form of the short time work scheme has been introduced that will apply until June 2022 8.It\u2019s time for the UK government to act to protect jobs. Below we set out the TUC\u2019s plan for a Jobs Protection and Upskilling Plan, including:\tWhich businesses would be eligible for support\tWhat workers would receive \u2013 including training\tThe conditions that should apply to businesses accessing the support.Targeting support on the businesses that need it most and encouraging a return to workThe Job Retention Scheme was rightly open to all businesses, recognising the widespread impact of the corona virus pandemic and the restrictions it imposed on the economy. But with more businesses now able to open up, we should target support on those businesses that need it most.As we set out further below, our scheme would focus on those businesses that can support some work \u2013 by requiring workers in receipt of support to be working at least a proportion of their normal working time. This would mean the scheme was supporting viable businesses that can retain the skills of their workforce \u2013 but need more time to get back on their feet.\t1.

It could:\tRequire businesses to agree a business plan with a recognised union that shows how it has been affected by the scheme and its plan for recovery\tRequire businesses to follow the same steps that self-employed workers have been required to take to access the second stage of the SEISS\tSet a minimum amount by which turnover has been reduced in order for businesses to access the scheme.The scheme should be available to all companies meeting these conditions, not only those that have previously accessed the Job Retention Scheme.Recommendation 2: Businesses hit by local lockdowns would automatically qualify for the schemeWhile many businesses have been able to start re-trading to some extent, the continuation of local lockdowns means that new restrictions are stopping businesses from operating.Any business in an area hit by local lockdown should be able to apply to access the scheme. This should apply whether or not they have previously applied for the JRS, or whether they can meet the \u2018return to work\u2019 conditions set out below.Recommendation 3: The scheme should require workers to be working for a minimum proportion of their normal hoursMost businesses are now able to operate to some extent, and we want to encourage a return to work. To qualify for support, employers must ensure that workers meet a threshold of minimum hours, pro rata, at work. This will encourage employers to protect jobs and promote work sharing as the firm gradually builds back to full operation. We would suggest a minimum threshold of ten per cent.This would mirror best practice in short-time work schemes across Europe. Setting a minimum threshold of working hours will ensure that the scheme focuses on viable businesses.Recommendation 4: The scheme should support workers who cannot work because they are in the group previously told to shield or who have caring responsibilities that mean they cannot workEven in businesses that are up and running, there are likely to be some workers who cannot safely work outside the home, including those who were previously classified as shielding, caring for someone shielding, some who are in clinically vulnerable groups and those whose caring responsibilities mean they cannot work outside the home. These workers are likely to face a significant threat of redundancy, and a particularly hard time finding new work in a difficult labour market.The requirement for workers to be working at least a minimum threshold of their normal working hours should not apply to this group.Recommendation 5: Similar support should be put in place for the self-employed, including those who have lost out on previous supportMany self-employed workers will also continue to face challenges trading, including many of those who have lost out on previous packages of government support. The scheme should be designed to be accessible to these workers.Supporting jobs and skillsThe JRS has helped protect jobs and incomes, and it is vital that the new Jobs Protection and Upskilling Scheme continues this vital work. Even with the scheme in place, around a fifth of people report their finances being affected by the crisis. ONS data show that 16 per cent of people said they have found it difficult or very difficult to pay bills since the crisis began, an increase just over 1 in 10 at the end of June 10.But the new scheme can also do more to help us prepare for the jobs of the future, using the time that people are outside the workplace to invest in the training we know we need to fill skills shortages, raise productivity and help tackle regional inequalities across the UK.Recommendation 6: Workers should continue to receive at least 80 per cent of their pay for time they are not workingWorkers must continue to receive at least 80 per cent of their pay for the time they are not at work up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month, whilst receiving 100 per cent of hourly pay for the time in which they are in work.Businesses would receive a subsidy of 70 per cent of each workers\u2019 wages (up to a cap) for their non-working time\u2013 mirroring the support received through the Job Retention Scheme at the end of September. However, because of the requirement for most workers to be working at least a proportion of their normal working hours, the total potential subsidy received by each business would be less than under the JRS. Businesses would not be able to claim for individuals both under this scheme and under the government\u2019s proposed Job Retention Bonus.Recommendation 7: Workers earning the national minimum wage should receive 100 per cent of their normal payThe crisis has hit those in low paid jobs particularly hard, particularly those for whom 80 per cent of wages means falling below the level of the national minimum wage. Bank of England research shows that while those earning \u00a335,000 and above have been able to build up savings, those earning less than \u00a320,000 have had to dig into their savings to get by\u00a011.The new scheme should require employers to ensure that no worker receives below the national minimum wage for their normal weekly working hours.Recommendation 8: Any worker working less than 50 per cent of their normal working time must be offered funded trainingThe government should use its proposed national skills fund to offer any worker working less than 50 per cent of their normal working hours the right to take part in funded training.Employers would be required to put workers in this situation in touch with the National Retraining Scheme, who would broker an individualised offer of quality training, funded by government. Government should bring forward its planned investment in a \u00a3600m national skills fund to help enable this.The National Retraining Scheme would be responsible for ensuring that training courses were good quality, and offering job relevant skills, particularly in expanding industries. They must also ensure that training is accessible to everyone, including those with caring responsibilities, and that workers have the right to complete their training once they increase their working hours.Strings attached: government support must encourage decent jobsGovernment has done the right thing by providing support to business to protect jobs. But this support should be used to encourage the kind of decent work we want to see in the future. The pandemic has exposed the insecurity of work for too many people 12.12 And there are worrying signs that this is increasing, with an increase in the number of people on zero hours contracts to over a million, with sharp rises in retail and social care 13.The areas of conditionality set out below should be used as forward-looking conditionality in order to influence corporate behaviour in the future, rather than as exclusions on the basis of past behaviour. The aim is for government support to save jobs and businesses and drive responsible performance behaviour at the same time.Recommendation 9: Businesses accessing the scheme must set out Fair Pay PlansThe pay gaps within the private sector remain very high, despite some reduction over recent years. Average total CEO remuneration for 2018 in the FTSE 100 was \u00a33.46m and in the FTSE 250 it was \u00a31.58m 14. These vast sums are 117 and 53 times median full-time earnings. When compared with the legal minimum, the National Living Wage (for those aged 25 or more - lower rates apply for workers under the age of 25), the gap widens to around 218:1 and 100:1 respectively 15.\u00a0Before the corona crisis, average earnings in the UK had still not reached their pre-financial crisis level in real terms. It is a matter of justice and of economic necessity that companies should develop fair remuneration plans that include both company directors and outsourced workers and tackle pay inequalities based on race and gender to ensure that company resources are deployed in a way that is both fairer and more effective than is currently the case.Businesses that access government support should commit to putting in place fair pay plans. These should be discussed and agreed with trade unions where they are present in the company and where they are not businesses should engage with staff collectively in a way that enables staff to discuss the issues fully without management present and feedbackthrough staff representatives. Companies should commit to initiating these discussions within three months, and putting Fair Pay Plans in place in time for 2021.All fair pay plans should include:\tThe period during which the scheme is in place should not count towards the accrual of cash bonuses, long-term incentive plans or any other incentive-related remuneration included in executive pay packages.\tNo staff whose work contributes to the company, including those who are employed through agencies and/or support the company through outsourced roles, should be paid less than the Real Living Wage.\tThe maximum pay ratio between top and bottom of the organisation should be no more than 20:1.Recommendation 10: Businesses that access support should set out a plan for decent jobsFor the vast majority of businesses, their most significant social and economic impact is their role as an employer. Promoting \u201csustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\u201d is one of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by all United Nations Member States, including the UK, in 2015. The TUC has developed six principles for decent work, which encompass voice at work, fair and decent pay, regular hours, learning and progression, fair treatment and respect and healthy workplaces 16.Businesses that accept government support must commit to promoting decent work throughout their direct and indirect operations. Making this commitment must be a condition of receiving government support and businesses should produce a timed plan for putting in place the steps that they need to take. As a first step businesses should commit to:\tEliminate the use of zero hours contracts within their business; and\tAllow trade unions access to their workplace where there is not already a collective agreement in place.Recommendation 11: Businesses that access support should pay their Corporation tax in the UKIf businesses are accepting support from the UK government, it is not acceptable for them to be registered in tax havens and thus avoiding paying corporation tax in the UK. This principle has been widely accepted in the debate around conditionality that has already taken place 17.\u00a0Businesses that accept government support should commit to acquiring Fair Tax Mark accreditation within the next three years. Those that are currently not registered in the UK for tax purposes should commit to changing their tax registration status as soon as is practically possible and to setting out a timeline for this in their 2020 annual report.Recommendation 12: Businesses accessing the scheme should commit to keep people in work and not pay dividends while using the schemeBusinesses must commit to use the additional support provided by government as it is intended; to protect jobs. No business accessing the scheme should make redundancies while the scheme is in place (and money must be returned if any workers are made redundant). And it is not right for businesses to pay out dividends to shareholders while relying on government funds for support.What else needs to happen?The new Job Protection and Upskilling Plan is vital to prevent mass unemployment and save viable businesses and valuable skills. But government must take wider steps to support new jobs and a better recovery. The TUC has set out a comprehensive list of actions in our Better Recovery report and subsequent analysis 18.\u00a0These include:\tA plan to create over a million new jobs in the green industries of the future\tEnsuring a real safety net for those who lose their job, by increasing the rate of Universal Credit and legacy benefits to \u00a3260 a week\tEnsuring that the new Kickstarter youth employment scheme offers quality jobs with real training, and expanding it to cover older workers\tA \u2018right to complete\u2019 for all existing apprentices to empower them to complete their training go well beyond the existing commitment by government to try to find another employer for apprentices who are made redundant\tBuilding promoting equality into all government recovery plans.\t9.

They must act by giving workers a pay rise and tackling the insecure work many face.Despite doing essential work like caring for us and keeping food on shop shelves through this crisis, millions remain underpaid and in insecure work. Many made huge sacrifices putting themselves and their families at risk through the lockdown as they faced no choice but to go to work. Workers who carried the country through the crisis deserve to be rewarded fairly.The government must:\traise the minimum wage to improve the pay of 2 million key workers\tgive meaningful pay rises to over 4 million public sector key workers\tban zero-hours contracts which particularly affect key workers in health and social care, and wholesale and retailIt is time to end the low pay and insecure work that leave carers, supermarket workers, delivery drivers and many more of our most essential workers struggling.SummaryThe coronavirus crisis has demonstrated how much we all owe to healthcare staff, care workers, retail and delivery workers, public transport workers, teachers and support staff, energy workers and so many others. Despite this, millions of key workers remain underpaid and in insecure work. The nation applauded the efforts of key workers through the peak of the crisis and there is strong public support for ensuring key workers are treated fairly.The government can directly increase the pay of 6 million key workers by increasing the minimum wage and public sector pay. The government can also put an end to some of the worst excesses of insecure work by banning zero-hours contracts. They must not let key workers down.The crisis also starkly exposed the huge inequalities faced by workers, especially related to pay, security, safety and voice at work. Unequal impacts have fallen along existing lines of inequality; including class, gender, ethnicity and other inequalities. Key workers who have kept the country running are more likely to be women and more likely to be Black or Minority Ethnic (BME). All workers who have been on the frontline of the crisis need to be rewarded fairly and treated with dignity.A pay rise for key workersThe TUC estimates that 6 million key workers would stand to benefit from public sector pay increases and planned minimum wage increases. Both these levers are directly within the government\u2019s control. But there are signs that pay increases may not materialise.We believe the minimum wage should be set at least \u00a310 an hour for all workers. Our analysis shows that 3.6 million key workers would benefit from this increase. The Low Pay Commission recently consulted on an increase to \u00a39.21 an hour. This would increase the pay of at least 2 million key workers, with 1.5 million of them in the private sector. However, there have been calls from business groups to keep the minimum wage even lower than this level.[1] Ministers and officials are understood to be discussing applying an \u201cemergency brake\u201d which would slow down increases in the minimum wage.[2] The TUC believes that rowing back on a planned pay rise for 2 million key workers would be the wrong decision.The government recently announced a pay rise for public sector workers but left out some of the most essential workers including social care, local government, nurses and other NHS staff, and low paid civil servants. Just hours after the pay announcement, it emerged that the Chancellor had urged government departments to \u2018exercise restraint in future public sector pay awards\u2019.[3] Following a decade of real pay cuts, key workers in the public sector deserve better. There are over 4 million key workers in the public sector who would benefit from the government giving them a pay rise.The government needs to ensure all key workers are paid the true value of their work and earn enough to get by. It can begin by giving a pay increase to the 6 million key workers whose pay it sets directly.Treating Key Workers Fairly The government needs to:\traise the minimum wage to improve the pay of 2 million key workers\tgive meaningful pay rises to over 4 million public sector key workers\tban zero-hours contracts which particularly affect key workers in health and social care, and wholesale and retailIt is time to end the low pay and insecure work that leave carers, supermarket workers and delivery drivers struggling.Download full report (pdf)    Insecure workThe government also needs to take action to stamp out insecure work. Our analysis finds that 1 in 9 UK workers are in insecure work such as zero-hours contracts, agency, casual, seasonal work or low paid self-employment. Many of these workers are key workers who have been on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis.For the first time on record, the number of people on zero-hours contracts has risen to over a million. This is driven by their proliferation in essential industries like health and social care, and wholesale and retail. One in four workers in adult social care \u2013 one of the sectors hit hardest by the virus \u2013 are on zero-hours contracts, which\u00a0mean\u00a0their hours of\u00a0work\u00a0and pay packets can vary significantly.\u202fThe government needs to ban zero-hours contracts to protect key workers from some of the worst excesses of insecure work.Who are key workers?Key workers do jobs that are essential to society. These workers kept the country running through lockdown and have been critical in our response to the pandemic. This includes healthcare staff, care workers, essential retail and delivery workers, public transport workers, teachers and support staff, energy workers and thousands of others.We estimate that 9.9 million employees are key workers. 5.3 million key workers are in the private sector. 4.6 million are in the public sector.During lockdown, the government published guidance to help schools determine which children\u2019s parents are key workers. This guidance identified workers working in the following industries:\thealth and social care\teducation and childcare\tkey public services\tlocal and national government\tfood and other necessary goods\tpublic safety and national security\ttransport\tutilities, communication and financial servicesThe pandemic has highlighted the true value of this work and the extent to which much of it has been undervalued. The pandemic also highlighted the stark inequality faced by many key workers, related to pay but also to job security, safety, and voice in the workplace. Unequal experiences have often fallen along the lines of structural inequalities, including class, gender, ethnicity and other inequalities. Key workers are more likely to be women and more likely to be Black or Minority Ethnic (BME).GenderWomen are almost twice as likely as men to be employed in a key worker occupation (45 per cent, compared to 26 per cent). Many of the largest key worker occupations have a large majority of female employees. Care workers and home carers, nurses, primary and nursery education teaching professionals and teaching assistants, for example, are some of the largest key worker occupations. In each, over 80 per cent of employees are women.EthnicityBME employees are more likely than white employees to be key workers, with 40 per cent of BME employees being a key worker, compared to 35 per cent of white employees working as key workers.AgeKey workers are drawn fairly evenly from people of working age across all ages.RegionsKey workers make up 35 per cent of all employees, but this varies by region. London has the lowest proportion (30 per cent), whereas Northern Ireland has the highest (42 per cent).    How we defined key workers in our analysisTo reach an estimate, we matched occupation groups, broken down to four-digit occupation codes, to the government\u2019s guidance on key workers. We then used the Labour Force Survey to find the number of employees in these key worker occupation groups, broken down by hourly wage, sector, and demographics including gender, age, and ethnicity. Even at the detailed level of four-digit occupation codes however, we cannot guarantee that everyone within every occupation is a key worker.A pay rise for key workersThe TUC believes the minimum wage should be set at least \u00a310 an hour for all workers. This would improve the pay of 3.6 million key workers. But there are signs that the government may shy away from even its own planned minimum wage increases to \u00a39.21 an hour.[1]The government has the tools it needs to increase the pay of 6 million key workers by increasing the minimum wage as planned to at least \u00a39.21 per hour and implementing a public sector pay increase. Over 2 million key workers stand to benefit from the government\u2019s planned minimum wage increase. A further 3.8 million public sector key workers would benefit from the government giving them a direct pay rise.Both these levers are directly within the government\u2019s control but there are signs that pay increases may not materialise. Some business groups have called for a delay in minimum wage increases and the Treasury has indicated that public sector workers will be subject to pay restraint in the coming years. This cannot be allowed to happen \u2013 the key workers who got us through the crisis deserve to be rewarded fairly for their essential work.Minimum WageThe minimum wage plays a significant role in determining the wages of many key workers. There are currently 2.1 million key workers earning at or below the minimum wage.The TUC believes the minimum wage should be at least \u00a310 an hour for all workers. This would raise the wages of 3.6 million key workers and help them earn enough to get by.The government has a target that takes the minimum wage to 66 per cent of median wages by 2024. When the Low Pay Commission set out this year\u2019s consultation on the minimum wage it estimated that the main rate would need to increase to \u00a39.21 in April to stay on target for 2024[1]. The TUC does not believe it would be appropriate to divert from the path. Increasing the main minimum wage rate to around \u00a39.21 in April 2021 would improve the pay of 2.1 million key workers aged over 25. However, there are calls from some business groups to delay this increase in the light of the crisis.[2] The TUC believe this would be the wrong decision.    Recent increases in the minimum wage have demonstrated there is room for a more ambitious wage floor. Since 2016 the minimum wage has been receiving larger material increases. This saw the minimum wage climb to 60 per cent of median wages by April 2020. This has been achieved without adverse impact on employment levels. Up until the coronavirus crisis, employment increased alongside increases to the wage floor. This lines up with international evidence[1] which shows \u201ca very muted effect of minimum wages on employment, while significantly increasing the earnings of low paid workers.\u201dThe OBR predicts wage growth to pick up to 3.6 per cent in 2021 and level off around 3 per cent after that.[2] This would take 66 per cent of the median wage to well over \u00a310 in 2024 for those aged 25+. It is important that minimum wage growth remains on course for this target.An increase in the main minimum wage rate to \u00a39.21 would raise the pay of 2.1 million key workers. These economic circumstances are challenging for many businesses and many firms will face difficult choices. But without wage protections we know it is often low paid workers who suffer \u2013 while shareholder dividends[3] and executive pay continue to rise[4]. We are not in a crisis caused by wages that are too high, nor in one that can be resolved with lower wages.Public Sector PayPublic sector workers make up 52 per cent of key workers. They have led the fight against Covid-19 and kept the country going during lockdown as carers, NHS workers, bus drivers, civil servants, postal delivery workers and more. Following a decade of real terms pay losses due to cuts and pay restraint, public sector workers deserve serious pay increases which reward them for their sacrifices during coronavirus and set them on track to recover the pay they have lost over the past ten years. Increasing pay for all public sector key workers would give a pay rise to 4.4 million people.Since 2010, public sector pay has fallen behind the cost of living as the intentional result of government policy. As a result, average public sector pay is still \u00a3900 lower today in real terms than it was in 2010. In other words, once the cost of living is taken into account, public sector workers are earning less today than they were ten years ago. For many, the loss in pay is more than \u00a3900 per year. For example, in real terms:\tNurses and community nurses (NHS band 5) are more than \u00a33,000 worse off today in real terms than they were in 2010.\tResidential care workers employed by local government are nearly \u00a31,900 worse off in real terms.\tAmbulance services drivers are \u00a31,605 worse off in real terms.It is not just on take home pay that public sector workers are losing out. The government recently announced its intention to press ahead with its plans to\u00a0cap exit payments[5]\u00a0(the amount received as part of a redundancy settlement) for public sector workers, a measure that will particularly hit workers with long years of public service. Public sector workers are also set to see their pension benefits decline due to the government unfairly shifting[6] the costs of addressing the discrimination\u00a0identified in the McCloud case[7] onto public servants.The government recently announced that it would be implementing the recommendations of Pay Review Bodies in full this year. While this was touted by government as a generous, above inflation offer that would reward public sector workers for their sacrifices during Covid-19, in practice it fell far short what is needed. First, it left out large numbers of public sector workers whose pay is not determined by Pay Review Bodies, including social care worker, local government employees and junior civil servants. It also left out NHS workers because they are in the final year of a three year pay deal, despite NHS unions calling for pay negotiations to be brought forward in response to Covid.Second, the announcement on pay was not accompanied by additional funding, leaving public sector employers to find the money from already stretched departmental budgets. Finally, the size of the pay rise did not go nearly far enough to reward public sector workers for their contributions during the Covid crisis or make up for a decade of lost pay. On the contrary, the pandemic was not factored into Pay Review Body recommendations at all (which were rather based only on assessments of what is needed to attract and retain staff) and just hours after the pay announcement, it emerged that the Treasury had urged government departments to \u2018exercise restraint in future public sector pay awards\u2019.[1]Following a decade of real pay cuts, all key workers in the public sector deserve better. The government must reward workers for the huge sacrifices they have made by awarding them fair pay rises that restore what they have lost through ten years of cuts and slow growth. Further, it must do so in a way that is responsive to particular concerns in different sectors. For example:\tNHS workers are calling for pay discussions to be brought forward to allow all NHS staff to be awarded early and substantial pay increases in recognition of their contribution to the fight against Covid.\tThe pandemic has revealed the desperate situation in our social care system and the people who work in it are in. Seven in ten care workers and home carers \u2013 that is, over half a million people - earn less than \u00a310 an hour and a quarter of the social care workforce are on zero-hours contracts. The urgently-needed long-term settlement for social care must include funding improved pay and opportunities for progression for social care workers.\tThe asymmetrical treatment of lower paid civil servants must stop. Union demands for simplified pay bargaining structures should be adopted by Cabinet Office in order to avoid complex negotiations during the crisis and the cap of 1.5-2.5% on civil service pay that falls outside of the Pay Review Body process should be lifted.\tLocal government faces \u00a311 billion of additional financial pressures as a result of Covid. Urgently-needed support from central government should include funding for a much-needed pay increase for local government workers.Insecure workOne in nine UK workers is in insecure work \u2013 including many key workers. Our analysis[1] indicates that 3.6 million people are in precarious employment. These include:\u00a0\u00a0\tpeople\u202fon zero-hours contracts\u00a0\u00a0\tagency, casual and seasonal workers\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\tthe low-paid\u202fself-employed\u202f\u00a0\u00a0Insecure work isn\u2019t just found among the food delivery riders and taxi drivers of the new app-based platform economy, who are prominent in discussion of the topic. Though it is rife in these roles, many of those in insecure work are the sorts of key workers \u2013 carers, delivery drives, shopworkers \u2013 whose importance was brought sharply to attention during the pandemic. For example, nearly one in six (15.6 per cent) of those in caring, leisure and other service roles were in insecure work, according to our analysis of official figures. This compares to 6 per cent of those in professional roles and 6.4 per cent of those in administrative or secretarial jobs.For the first time on record, the number of people on zero-hours contracts has risen to over a million. This is driven by their proliferation in essential industries like health and social care, and wholesale and retail. One in four workers in adult social care \u2013 one of the sectors hit hardest by the virus \u2013 are on zero-hours contracts, which\u00a0mean\u00a0their hours of\u00a0work\u00a0and pay packets can vary significantly.\u202fThe government needs to ban zero-hours contracts to protect key workers from some of the worst excesses of insecure work. We recommend this is done by giving workers the right to a contract that reflects their regular hours, at least four weeks notice of shifts and compensation for cancelled shiftsRecommendationsThe government must not let down key workers. Despite doing the essential work of caring for us and keeping food on shop shelves through this crisis, millions remain underpaid and in insecure work. Many made huge sacrifices putting themselves and their families at risk through the lockdown as they faced no choice but to go to work.
