This has been deemed necessary due to hub schools being kept open for the children of key workers during lockdown and subsequently, in the face of government insistence that schools re-opened at the beginning of September. The unions have been greatly concerned about staff safety and have campaigned vociferously to government about such issues. The NEU compiled a National Education Recovery Plan and wrote again to the PM on the 11 September, in order to voice concerns as to rising cases and how staff and pupils should be protected.\r\rMoreover, both\u00a0have established coronavirus hubs, in order to provide a mass of information and advice to teachers on a wide range of salient issues. NASUWT has also established a Coronavirus Help Desk.", "content_of_measure_description": "Both unions have provided Coronavirus Hubs, which provides a mass of information and guidance to members and union reps on a wide range of issues. From NASUWT, their comprehensive guide\u00a0include \r\r* arrangements for remote teaching, learning and support; \r* mental health advice for teachers working from home; \r* advice on social security benefits available during the pandemic; \r* guidance on how to access the union's benevolent fund; income and social security coverage for supply teachers. \r\rThe NEU, in its dedicated portal, has provided\u00a0specific guidance to different occupations (from principals to special needs teachers). The NEU, together with other unions, has issued guidance to its workplace representatives, as well as a manual to members, and is negotiating in every school to ensure safety, student numbers, distancing, hygiene and cleaning. \r\rIn both cases, the materials are publicly available on the respective unions' websites; thus, the advice is open to all. There is no evaluation data on how many members/teachers have accessed the materials and no data on cost.", "use_of_measure_description": "No evaluation data available. It would be difficult to measure as activities listed refer to campaigning, lobbying of government and the provision of advice and guidance to members.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "The initiatives described are those of two teaching unions; thus, they are solely responsible for the design and implementation of the advice and guidance issued to their members and their workplace representatives. Both unions have also campaigned around staff and pupil safety. They have devised recovery plans and checklists, written to government and highlighted issues in the media. They have influenced government strategy to some extent; however, this has not been done through institutionalised settings with consultation requested by government.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "Yes", "private_or_public_sector": "Not specified", "is_occupation_specific": "Yes", "actors": ["Trade unions"], "target_groups": ["Particular professions", "Children (minors)", "Parents", "Workers in essential services"], "funding": ["Trade union"], "sectors": ["Education"], "occupations": [{"recordId": "35", "occupations::name": "Cleaners and helpers", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "7", "occupations::name": "Teaching professionals", "modId": "0"}], "sources": [{"url": "https://www.nasuwt.org.uk/advice/health-safety/coronavirus-guidance.html", "title": "NASUWT Coronavirus Hub", "content_path": "res/89ccc15accc65336ebf5bfa157ae08cb67ed6e01d84dbc7dbe48ae219bdd7e99", "content": "NASUWT |  Coronavirus Hub\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe detected you haven\u2019t selected to personalise the site.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPreference\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease select...EnglandN.

The NEU believes that this \u2018big bang\u2019 approach, in contrast to the more phased approaches in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, is reckless and that, whilst we are committed to bringing back all children and young people to the classroom as soon as possible, this will be counterproductive if an incautious return leads to another surge in the virus, and the potential for a further period of lockdown. Wider opening must be safe and sustainable.We urged the Prime Minister to commit to 8 March only if the scientific evidence was absolutely clear that this is safe, and at that point to go no further than a phased return of children and young people with sufficient time to assess the impact before moving to the next phase.\u00a0 This advice has not been heeded.Our focus now is on ensuring that the return to full opening happens as safely as possible.\u00a0 Protective measures need to be strengthened. We are asking school leaders to make professional judgements on the pattern of return for pupils in their school and look at ways of staggering the return of year groups in the run up to Easter.\u00a0Support for membersRead our Q&A advice for members.The NEU will provide support to members in any school or college where there are concerns about safety.\u00a0\u00a0 Details of how to escalate matters in your workplace and if necessary contact your branch can be found here.\u00a0Advice on safetyThis updated\u00a0joint union advice considers the measures which need to be in place in schools and colleges.\u00a0 It aims to help ensure that risk assessments are reviewed and covers measures which need to be addressed to\u00a0reflect the known greater transmissibility of the new variant and meet the requirements of full opening.\u00a0 The joint union checklist for full opening in September 2020 (insert new link) remains relevant\u00a0for guidance on more detailed measures that should continue to be in place.We must protect vulnerable and older members of staff who are most at risk if they catch Covid-19. The joint union advice on other vulnerable and higher risk staff remains in place and can be\u00a0found here.The NEU expects the following to be in place in all education workplaces when they return to full opening:\ta\u00a0review of all risk assessments, in consultation with staff, in the light of the much higher transmission of the new variant;\tmeasures to maintain distancing and minimise mixing\u00a0in classrooms and other indoor areas;\tface coverings worn indoors at all times, including in classrooms, by staff and students in secondary and by staff in primary and SEND settings, with any necessary exemptions;\tclinically extremely vulnerable staff to be working at home in accordance with government requirements, and other clinically vulnerable staff, those aged 60 and over and women who in the third trimester of pregnancy to be working from home as well.Arrangements should provide for the employment of supply and peripatetic staff where appropriate, rather than putting obstacles in the way of this.Remote learning arrangementsThere will continue to be a role for remote learning for the duration of the pandemic.
