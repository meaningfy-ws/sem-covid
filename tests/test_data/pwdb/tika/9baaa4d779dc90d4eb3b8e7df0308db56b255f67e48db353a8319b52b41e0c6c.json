In response, the Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry (Malta Chamber), an employers' association, established a thematic group aimed at thinking outside the box and considering multiple scenarios of how the post-pandemic landscape will look. The aim of the process is to develop strategic initiatives to address the possible new realities in the short, medial and long term.\r", "content_of_measure_description": "The Think Tank draws on the experience and expertise of various members of the Malta Chamber and includes leading CEOs, entrepreneurs and academics. Its first assignment was to focus on a multi-disciplinary action plan on how Malta\u2019s economy could recover from COVID-19 and take advantage of the new norm. A series of round-tables were established to focus on specific fields of expertise, engaging the country\u2019s leaders and experts in areas of interest of the economy, namely Tourism, Hospitality, Construction, Financial Services, Education and Training, Retail, Importers, Exporters, Digital and Media, Technology, Manufacturing, Transport and Logistics. The preliminary findings of the Think Tank were presented to the Cabinet of Ministers on the 11 August 2020. Amongst the proposal made to the government were those to improve good governance, government assistance, sustainability, quality, and a series of sector-specific recommendations.

The Opposition too has asked for detailed briefing.\u201cCarmelo Abela, minister within the Office of the Prime Minister, was present when the report was launched,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have now been asked to present its findings to Cabinet next week.\u201dThe think tank brought together business leaders, academics, and various experts from a number of fields who have called for less government and more governance if the country is to truly reach its ambitions for the future.Xuereb said that the think tank was set up before the onset of COVID-19, when Malta\u2019s economy was considered to be booming.\u201cEven then, we realised those levels were not sustainable and set up the think tank and series of round tables to set out a plan for economic sustainability,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the onset of coronavirus, this exercise took on even more importance and relevance.\u201dWith the effects of COVID-19 soon apparent, the think tank\u2019s first assignment was to focus on a multi-disciplinary action plan on how Malta\u2019s economy could recover and take advantage of the new norm.A series of round-tables were established to focus on specific fields of expertise, engaging the country\u2019s leaders and experts in areas of interest of the economy, namely Tourism, Hospitality, Construction, Financial Services, Education & Training, Retail, Importers, Exporters, Digital & Media, Technology, Manufacturing, Transport & Logistics.A series of sector-specific recommendations were presented but a number of proposals common to all industries highlighted the need to act upn them.The report underlined the absolute importance of strong governance. A fundamental requirement mentioned by all sectors is Malta\u2019s reputation being an important ticket for foreign investment and continued prosperity.\u201cThe country needs to have proper frameworks in place and stakeholders need to ensure that they had the right structures and processes to guarantee good governance, as was previously recommended in our Good Governance Manifesto,\u201d Xuereb said.Government assistance also featured highly, as a requirement seen to be a central motor for growth and investment, with incentivisation seen as an important tool for economic development.Sustainability also remained a key topic which cut across all sectors, as it underscored the importance to start thinking more long term than we are actually doing till today.Quality too was identified as key for future prosperity. The Chamber agrees, for example, that in the future Malta should focus on quality tourism rather than seeking to\u00a0 attract record numbers of tourists. It believes that, with the country needing to upgrade to cater solely to four- and five-start tourists, the general population of Malta as a whole would benefit.\u201cWith our Think Tank project, The Malta Chamber is once again taking a proactive role to sit in the driving seat and, using the vast expertise of its membership, propose solid policy recommendations to the movers and shakers of the country for a better and more resilient Malta tomorrow,\u201d Xuereb said.\u201cWe want the wellbeing of our people that drives our economy. Economic growth must respect the country\u2019s sustainability goals and the physical and mental wellness of our people.\u201d                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Good governance, sustainability, quality and government assistance key to future prosperity                                                                                                                                                            Sector-specific proposalsHospitality\tMaintain & Improve Wage Subsidy until vaccine is administered.\tImplement laws on Rent for Force Majeure.\tVAT Reduction 18% to 7%.\tPromote Malta as a Safe Destination.\tKeep Malta\u2019s Ports Open Safely.\tMedia Campaign for locals & tourists to uphold responsibility.\tEnsure Practical & Flexible Employment of TCNs.Tourism\tMarketing & Promoting Malta as a Safe Destination.\tKeep Malta\u2019s Ports Open Safely.\tIncentivise / Subsidise & Diversify Airline Routes.\tLower VAT to 7% for all Travel related services.\tTax Losses carried back.\tA National & Holistic Tourism Strategy.\tFocus on Quality.\tPausing PA Applications & Raising Standards.Financial services\tRebuilding and Safeguarding Malta\u2019s Reputation (Moneyval).\tESG principles must be woven in our country\u2019s fabric Areas for Growth: FinTech, Core Financial Sevices & ESG related offerings.\tImportance of improving E-Gov.\tSupport for Innovation.\tHuman Capital: Address Skills Gap, revise Academic Curriculum & include International Outlook & disruption of the sector.\tIncentivise foreign expertise.\tCreate platform for funding opportunities for start-ups.Education and training\tBack to School within the New Norm.\tSupport to Parents.\tFaster payment for all Funding Schemes.\tA Rescue Plan for EFL Sector.\tIncentivise skilling & reskilling of Workforce.\tResource Education Malta to attract international students.\tVisas Extensions of International Students due to Covid-19.\tSupport for Training Service Providers.Construction\tA Strategic National Vision.\tBetter Regulation & Harmonisation of Laws.\tA resourced Building & Construction Authority (BCA).\tIncentives for the regeneration of dilapidated areas.\tR&I Investment for an improved Built Environment.\tHolistic review of the Local Plans.Retail trade\tImplement laws on Rent for Force Majeure.\tAccess to Finance & minimise collateral for MDB Loan.\tKeep Malta\u2019s Ports Open Safely.\tLevel Playing Field in Taxation and enforce Existing Regulations.\tEnsure Practical & Flexible Employment of TCNs.\tEnsure Accessibility to Retail Destinations.\tNational Campaign of reassurance for consumers.Manufacturing\tNew vision for manufacturing in Malta -
