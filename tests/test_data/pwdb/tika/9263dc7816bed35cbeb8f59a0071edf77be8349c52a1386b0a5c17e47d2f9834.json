As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kotkamills' turnover increased rapidly. The company produces, for instance, cardboard products and the demand for these products has increased rapidly due to changed consumer behaviour. \r\rTherefore, Kotkamills has had to adapt to both the increased demand and COVID-19 safety regulations. Managers and other white-collar workers have worked from distance but blue-collar workers have continued working at the production units. As a result of this, the company had to change their management approach. ", "content_of_measure_description": "According to the company, the autonomy of workers has increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the management is working from home, the workers have to make more decisions on their own, it is not possible to consult the management in the case of every smaller decision. Workers have been careful to follow the COVID-19 safety regulations and actively taken responsibility for quality control. \r\rThe company says that communication between employees is now more frequent and they have organised digital information meetings for the entire staff. The number of meetings between managers have decreased. \r\rIncreasing employees\u2019 responsibility is not new to Kotkamills but they describe their organisational culture as agile. According to the company, they seek to create a frame for the community of people working for Kotkamills and allow a lot of leeway for individuals. A shift towards a flat, less bureaucratic organisation has been their aim even before the COVID-19 pandemic. ", "use_of_measure_description": "No information available.
