The Maltese traditionally do not make use of taxis for the daily commute, favouring private transport and public busses. The popularity of taxis increased over the last few years following an influx of foreign workers coupled with new taxi companies, including platform-based taxi companies. \r\rThe taxi industry's growth was hit by COVID-19 due to a sudden drop in commuters. Workers increasingly made use of remote working options, whereas others sought private transport options in order to reduce the chance of disease transmission. \r\rFaced by these sudden changes, one of Malta's largest taxi companies, eCabs, modified their taxis and procedures in order to protect staff and customers.  ", "content_of_measure_description": "In May 2020, the Public Health Authorities issued guidelines for the taxi industry. eCabs, a leading private taxi operator in Malta, announced that they had both implemented and exceeded these guidelines. \r\rAmongst the changes implemented: \r\r* Mandatory masks to be worn by both the driver and passengers \r* The selling of disposable masks within the vehicle \r* Perspex screens installed between the driver and passenger \r* Encouraging digital payments (via an App) to reduce handling of cash \r* Ventilation policy: air recycler to be switched off at all times and windows to be left ajar \r* Daily in-vehicle sanitation and air-conditioning filters treated with viral disinfectant \r* Drivers equipped with disinfectant spray and wipes\r\rThe taxi company also provides a service for school children. Schools recommenced following COVID-19-related closures and summer holidays in September 2020.

ADVERTISEMENT The new guidelines include amongst others, mandatory masks to be worn by both drivers and passengers who should not be allowed to board the vehicle unless they are wearing a face mask. To help with this directive, eCabs are now also selling disposable face masks in-vehicle.\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping our fingers on the pulse since day one of this public health emergency, following the health authorities\u2019 recommendations and updating our operations accordingly. We have also sought international best practice in our sector and acted on our own initiative to strengthen our safety measures, such as the installation of a dividing perspex screen between driver and passenger.\u00a0 These matters are taken very seriously, not only for the safety of our passengers but also for that of our own drivers,\u201d said Simon Debono Chief Marketing Officer of eCabs.\u201cI believe it is important for everyone to work together to stem this situation and do their part so that normality returns as soon as possible, whatever shape that may be. I\u2019d like to urge our passengers to collaborate with us in respecting these measures in everyone\u2019s interest,\u201d he added, mentioning that eCabs has also been encouraging payments to be effected through credit cards in the App to reduce cash handling.A vehicle ventilation policy has also been adopted in response to these new guidelines and with a view of the rising temperatures. These include the air recycler to be turned off at all times and\u00a0windows to be left ajar for better ventilation. The Air Conditioning filters are also being treated with viral disinfectant as part of a wider, daily in-vehicle sanitisation procedure which has been in effect since the first week of March. This includes extensive steaming and cleaning using the same disinfectant which possesses long residual action.\u201cOur Covid policies are kept consistently updated on our website. Anyone riding with us can be sure that we are doing our best and going beyond what is mandatory. We are doing our utmost to make sure that in these challenging times everyone can get from point to point with peace of mind and in the safest manner possible\u201d, concluded Simon Debono.\tdon't missCompany Newsopen\tTerms of Use\tAdvertising Rates\tContact Us\tPrivacy PolicyDesigned and developed by Deloitte DigitalIndependent Online. \u00a92021.

The guidance below has been developed to help you protect yourself and your passengers during this time. You may determine that you do not want to risk working during this time. For some drivers, this may not be an option. Drivers may be asked to drive customers to a doctor\u2019s office, a health centre or hospital. This may put you at increased risk for COVID-19. Do NOT entertain requests to take persons to any of three swabbing centres: Sptar Santa Marija, \u0126al Farru\u0121 (Luqa); Luxol Grounds (Pembroke) and Gozo Heliport (Xewkija). Know the symptoms of COVID-19 The most common symptoms of coronavirus include one or more of the following: \uf0b7 Cough \uf0b7 Fever \uf0b7 Shortness of breath  Other symptoms may include tiredness, sore throat, runny / blocked nose, headache, muscle pain, loss of smell, loss of taste, diarrhoea or vomiting.  In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia with severe acute respiratory distress. If you develop these symptoms, please stay at home, contact your doctor and contact the Public Health team on (+356) 111 or 21 324086 for further advice and guidance. For more information on when to get tested, see guidance on www.covid19health.gov.mt Practice Social Distancing in daily life Avoid social contact with others, keeping a physical distance of at least two (2) metres in normal circumstances. Practice simple hygiene by covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing and wash your hands frequently.  http://www.covid19health.gov.mt/Use of face masks or visors With the lifting of certain restrictive public health measures instituted as part of the COVID-19 Public Health Response, the Public Health Authorities are advising on the benefits of wearing a face mask or visor by individuals who are not ill when entering closed spaces such as taxis and cabs. Visors can be worn alone or together with a mask. These are the latest mandatory guidelines on the use of face masks or visors in taxis and cabs: \uf0b7 Drivers are to wear face masks or visors at all times whilst providing the transport service; \uf0b7 Only passengers wearing a face mask or visor are to be allowed to board taxis or cabs; \uf0b7 Passengers should be reminded that face masks or visors must be worn throughout the whole journey; \uf0b7 Passengers are to wear a face mask or visor when waiting at taxi stands or booking a taxi from a taxi booth; \uf0b7 Passengers are also to keep the social distance of 2 metres from all other persons at all times before boarding taxis and cabs. Keep yourself and your passengers protected  To ensure you keep yourself and your passengers protected, it is recommended that you take the following steps: \uf0b7 Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 70 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available. \uf0b7 Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. \uf0b7 Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. \uf0b7 Keep all windows open wherever possible and do NOT use the air recycler. \uf0b7 Ask passengers to sit in the back, preferably behind the passenger seat to create physical distance. \uf0b7 Consider adding a partition (e.g. made from transparent plastic) behind the front seats, to create a physical separation from your client. \uf0b7 Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Consider using a normal mask covering mouth and nose if you cannot keep adequate physical separation. \uf0b7 Request online payment  or with a contactless card and avoid handling money, if possible. Otherwise, ask for the correct fare and consider wearing disposable gloves if you must collect money from customers. Use one pair of gloves per customer and throw them away safely after use. \uf0b7 Have tissues and hand sanitizer at the back of the vehicle available for your passengers.  Clean and disinfect your car regularly \uf0b7 Plan to clean your car as often as possible\u2014especially after you drop off passengers who appear to be sick and after every passenger requesting a trip for medical reasons. Pay close attention to surfaces that are touched often by passengers. \uf0b7 Water and household detergents and the use of common disinfectant products should be enough for cleaning and disinfection. Examples of recommended disinfectants include 70% ethanol and products containing sodium hypochlorite (such as household bleach). Always carefully follow the directions on the product label. \uf0b7 Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and safely dispose of them immediately after using them once. "}]}
