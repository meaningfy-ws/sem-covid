The relevant Minister stated that whereas Air Malta would usually have around 20 flights a day, it was down to two flights a day. Air Malta therefore initiated discussions with relevant Unions to save the airline and the workers. Discussions were initiated with unions representing engineers, cabin crew and the pilots (each group has its own union). New agreements were concluded with the former two groups, resulting in no jobs being lost. A new agreement, however, was not reached with the pilot's union, ALPA, resulting in sizeable redundancies", "content_of_measure_description": "Air Malta offered unions representing various employee groups a minimum floor of the average pay of the last twelve months, capped at \u20ac1200, as basic monthly income, included if they were not needed to operate and stayed home. The offer also allowed employees to earn more than this figure; Air Malta stated \"if compensation for actual work performed would (in terms of the applicable collective agreement) result in compensation in excess of \u20ac1200 in a month, they would be remunerated on the basis of the actual amount due in terms of the applicable collective agreement for the work performed.\" The same offer was made to various groups of employees, including engineers, cabin crew and pilots, and covered both those on indefinite and definite contracts. Of the applicable groups, only the engineers thorough their union, the Association of Airline Engineers (AAE), accepted the offer. Air Malta consequently began redundancy procedures against cabin crew and pilots; following further discussions, cabin crew eventually also reached an agreement with Air Malta and redundancies were avoided. ", "use_of_measure_description": "Few specifics are available about the measure. However, all engineer employees of Air Malta were retained. Numbers and futher information is not available. ", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "As COVID-19 struck and Air Malta was practically grounded, the organisation called the unions representing its workers (including engineers, cabin crew and pilots) to either accept a much reduced minimum salary of \u20ac1,200 monthly, including if they were not required to operate, with employees able to earn more if work was performed as per their collective agreement, or to face redundancy. The engineer's union (following a vote by their members, of which 90% voted in favour) accepted the offer, the cabin crews' and pilots' unions rejected the offer.

Not only have its operations dwindled to a mere 2flights per day (as opposed to the scheduled average of 20 dailyflights) but the extraordinary amount of cancellations, andtherefore reimbursements, together with the obligation tocontinue servicing fixed costs, such as aircraft lease payments,have led the Company to necessitate mitigation of costs,including payroll costs.The COVID-19 crisis brought tourism to a halt, meaning that theairline\u2019s cash returns from the sale of flight tickets vanished. TheAirline is currently servicing the country to fly in Maltese citizensstranded abroad, as well as bringing in crucial cargo, essentialmedical equipment and supplies. However, this is not enough tohelp the company maintain its current fixed payroll costs.The Company offered Unions representing different sections ofcompany employees, to agree on a minimum floor of theaverage pay of the last twelve months, capped at \u20ac1200, asbasic monthly income which would be applicable for all those onindefinite and definite contracts, meaning that all employees,including staff at head office, engineers, cabin crew, and pilotswould get a minimum income of \u20ac1200 monthly even if they arenot required to operate and stay at home. This would have alsomeant that no employee is made redundant and that thoseemployed on a definite contract would also have been retainedin employment. The offer also specified that if compensation foractual work performed would (in terms of the applicablecollective agreement) result in compensation in excess of \u20ac1200in a month, they would be remunerated on the basis of the actualamount due in terms of the applicable collective agreement forthe work performed.Despite the company having offered the same proposal to allUnions representing different sections of its employees, it wasonly Engineers union who understood the dire situation thecompany is in and accepted the proposal through a 90% vote byits members.The Union of Cabin Crew (UCC) were offered the same,however they did not accept the company\u2019s offer. The Airlinemade it clear that it could not afford such salaries and gave UCCfour deadline extensions for it to reconsider its position.Unfortunately, UCC was not favourable to the company\u2019sproposal to keep all employees on a salary of at least \u20ac1200.ALPA, the union representing the pilots at Air Malta, also did notreply to the company\u2019s offer insisting that the airline to makefurther counter offers.As a result, the Company regrettably had to announce to itsworkforce that a number of employees falling under thecollective agreement signed with the UCC and ALPA will bemade redundant due to the current circumstances and the failureto reach agreement with the same Unions on cost mitigationmeasures which could have avoided such redundancies.This was communicated to both ALPA and UCC in an officialcommunication letter sent to the them and the Director Generalfor Industrial and Employment Relations, in accordance withapplicable legislation.Air Malta currently employs 333 employees who fall under thecollective agreement signed with the Union of Cabin Crew. Ofthese, 188 are on an indefinite term contract, while 145 are on afixed term contract. Employees on a fixed term contract havealready been notified that their employment will not be extendedfollowing the expiry of its current term. Apart from this, thecompany requires another 139 cabincrew who are on anindefinite term contract to be made redundant. The companyalso employs 134 employees who fall under the collectiveagreement signed with ALPA, all engaged through an indefiniteterm contract. The company requires 108 Pilots to be maderedundant.The employees retained will be sufficient for Air Malta tocontinue operating at current levels which are expected to be thecase for a number of months.At the same time, Air Malta\u2019s top management, has alreadyaccepted a significant pay cut in their salaries as well as theremoval of allowances and perks, despite that they are stillworking to save the airline in these turbulent times.In the circumstances were the airline\u2019s hands are tied to almosta zero-revenue situation, the company can\u2019t do otherwise for itto survive through this storm. The Company is disappointed thatthe Unions were not considerate and sensitive enough to its veryhard financial situation, when the aviation industry is facing theworst crisis in its history. The Company notes that otherEuropean airlines have already made thousands of theiremployees redundant in the light that this economic crisis will bewith us for a good number of months.Airmalta, as a national carrier, remains committed to provide areliable air transport service to the Malta Islands and its citizens,even in the worst of economic times.#TogetherWeStand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Back to Overview                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \t                                    Your Feedback                                \t                                    Join Our Newsletter                                \t                                    Flight Schedule                                                                                                                                                                                                                \t                                                                                                                                                Book Your Trip                                                                            \t                                            Book your Hotel\t                                            Rent a car\t                                            Buy extra baggage\t                                            Reservations Support\t                                            Privacy Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Latest News                                    \tAir Malta launches its second \u2018Lifeline schedule\u2019 as COVID-19 situation worsens all over Europe...more\tAir Malta carries Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to the Islands...more\tAir Malta Safety and Covid19 protection compliance standards recognised...more\tAir Malta unabated efforts to keep the Islands connected...more                                                                                                                                                                                                    Follow Us                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \u00a9 2019 Air Malta plc\u00a0 -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Username required...\u00a0                                        Password required...\u00a0                                        Invalid login details...\u00a0                                        Facebook login failed.
