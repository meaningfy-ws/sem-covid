The temporary provisions are intended \u2018[\u2026] to provide for the registration of certain health and social care professionals to fulfil the need for medical resources to alleviate the risk from COVID-19 to human life and public health and for those and related purposes to amend the Dentists Act 1985, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, the Pharmacy Act 2007, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, and the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011; [\u2026] to enable the re-enlistment of formerly enlisted persons; [\u2026]\u2019. \r\rPrior to this (17 March), this Health Service Executive (HSE) launched the \u2018Be on call for Ireland\u2019 recruitment drive. This was aimed at the recruitment of additional qualified healthcare workers including medical, nursing and therapy personnel as well as healthcare assistants. On 10 April, the HSE announced that there will be an increase in the annual intake of medical interns this year, from 734 to approximately 1,100. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) and the Irish Medical Council also took steps to make it easier for nurses and doctors to return to the register (e.g. by waiving registration fees). \r\rThe COVID-19 Act provides for health and social care professionals who want to return to work to have their applications to be registered with their regulatory bodies accelerated and returned to the register without paying a fee until 30 July 2020 (with possibility extend this date). \r\rMedical and nursing schools have also been fast-tracking students to qualification to deal with the pandemic.\r\rThe Act also offers some protection to healthcare professionals, other than doctors, who may practise medicine during the pandemic (normally prohibited). They can do so under the direction and control of a registered medical practitioner, or in accordance with directions in writing given by a registered medical practitioner.\r\rWith regard to other public servants and teachers, the Department of Education issued a circular to school managers on 27 March 2020 that indicated that all public servants 'must be available to carry out work either to deliver services within their own sector or for temporary assignment within the wider public service [...]'. The possibility to reassign public service staff is set out in Circular 7/2020, issued by the government on 17 March 2020.", "use_of_measure_description": "A few days after the measure was enacted (1 April) the Irish Times reported that around 540 nurses and 140 doctors had re-joined the register. This famously includes the Irish Prime Minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar - who agreed to return to work to his former profession as a medical doctor for one day per week during the pandemic.\r\rIn a statement to the Irish Independent, the HSE said: \"As of July 2, 194 doctors, nurses and health and social care appointees have been deployed from the Be on Call for Ireland initiative to HSE services in both community, acute and public health departments. An additional 715 candidates have full recruitment clearances in place and are 'job ready' as per service need. 940 candidates are in the clearance process'.\r\rAccording to the Irish Times: The nationwide campaign, which was launched by the Health Service Executive when the COVID-19 crisis escalated in early March, attracted responses from more than 73,000 applicants to support the health services.

The act contains some remarkable provisions in thepublic interest to help fight the effects of the coronavirus.Let\u2019s take a look at at some key aspects of the Emergency Measures inthe Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 as the act impacts on employment law inIreland.The Temporary Wages Subsidy SchemePart 7 of the act provides for this scheme which has beenthe subject of two sets of guidelines from the Revenue Commissioners. Here isthe most recent guidelineson employer eligibility to the wages subsidy scheme.Key points regarding the guidelines are\tThe employer must self declare that he has beenseriously impacted and is a statement that as a result of the coronavirus hewill be unable to pay normal wages, wants to retain employees, and will suffera decline of at least 25% of turnover during the COVID-19 pandemic\tAn employer who has significant cash reserveswill be expected to pay a significant proportion of the employee\u2019s wages, evenif he has suffered a decline in business\tThe 25% turnover decrease calculation can becarried out on any basis that is reasonable\tThere is some supporting proofs required for Revenue\tThe names and addresses of employers availing ofthe subsidy will be published\tThere are 2 phases: phase 1 from 15thMarch 2020 to 20th April 2020 and phase 2 from April 20th,2020\tEmployees must have been on the payroll on 29thFebruary 2020There has been criticism of this scheme from various quartersand, no doubt, it is not perfect. But given the circumstances and the need forspeed it is inevitable that some infirmities or anomalies would arise. Nonetheless,with goodwill on all sides it is probably worth a fair chance to see the wagessubsidy scheme in action.Redundancy payments changesPart 8 of the act makes a change to the Redundancy PaymentsAct 1967 and provides clarity concerning layoffs and short time working duringthe COVID-19 crisis.This emergency legislation suspends the employee\u2019s right toa redundancy payment pursuant to section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act1967.Section 12 providesF31[12.\u2014(1) An employee shall not be entitled toredundancy payment by reason of having been laid off or kept on short-timeunless\u2014(a) he has been laid off or kept on short-time for fouror more consecutive weeks or, within a period of thirteen weeks, for a seriesof six or more weeks of which not more than three were consecutive, and(b) after the expiry of the relevant period of lay-off orshort-time mentioned in paragraph (a) and not later than four weeks after thecessation of the lay-off or short-time, he gives to his employer notice (inthis Part referred to as a notice of intention to claim) in writing of hisintention to claim redundancy payment in respect of lay-off or short-time.(2) Where, after the expiry of the relevant period oflay-off or short-time mentioned in subsection (1) (a) and not later than fourweeks after the cessation of the lay-off or short time, an employee to whomthat subsection applies, in lieu of giving to his employer a notice ofintention to claim, terminates his contract of employment either by giving himthe notice thereby required or, if none is so required, by giving him not lessthan one week\u2019s notice in writing of intention to terminate the contract, thenotice so given shall, for the purposes of this Part and of Schedule 2, bedeemed to be a notice of intention to claim given in writing to the employer bythe employee on the date on which the notice is actually given.]This new legislation inserts a new section 12A whichsuspends the employee\u2019s right to claim redundancy during the emergency periodwhich is defined as the period from 13th March 2020 to 31stMay 2020. This period oculd be extended, however, depending on how thecoronavirus is being dealt with.The critical impact of this provision is to give employerssome comfort regarding the fear they had that they would face a large number ofclaims for redundancy arising from forced layoffs or short time working.Here is the bill as it was passed by the Dail on Friday 27thMarch 2020: EmergencyMeasures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Bill 2020.This act also makes emergency provisions regarding theoperation of the Residential Tenancies act 2004, time limits relating toplanning and development, health and social care professions, the Mental HealthAct 2001, the Defence Act 1954, the Civil Registration Act 2004, the RedundancyPayments Act 1967.Follow @TGorrySolicitorTags:coronaviruscovid-19  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch the site\t\t\t\t\tCategoriesCategoriesSelect CategoryBlogData ProtectionEmployment ClaimsEmployment InjunctionsEmployment Law BooksEmployment Law Procedures and PoliciesEmployment PermitsEquality and DiscriminationFixed Term ContractsHealth and SafetyHR/Employment Law ServicesIndustrial RelationsLeave and HolidaysMediationMinimum NoticeNERA-National Employment Rights AuthorityPart Time WorkersPayment of WagesPodcastProtected DisclosuresRedundancyStaff HandbooksTemporary Agency WorkersThe Employment ContractTUPE-Transfer of UndertakingsUncategorizedUnfair DismissalVideocastWhistleblowingWorking Time/Rest PeriodsWorkplace Relations CommissionYoung Persons\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent Posts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourt of Appeal overturns High Court decision in dismissal of employee on probation case\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChoosing the wrong complaint on the WRC complaint form-a fatal mistake\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRemote working-will the National Remote Work Strategy be a game changer for the employee?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid-19 Vaccine-the rollout and the legal issues in the workplace\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployee awarded \u20ac7,500 for penalisation under Safety, Health and Welfare Act, 2005\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended Sites\tTerry Gorry & Co.

                                 COVID-19 - Measures Introduced to Increase the Number of Healthcare Workers in Ireland             22 April 2020                                        A number of steps have been taken in Ireland to increase significantly the number of healthcare workers in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Health Service Executive (HSE) launched the \u2018Be on call for Ireland\u2019 recruitment drive on 17 March 2020. The Chief Executive of the HSE, Mr Paul Reid, announced that the health service is looking for qualified healthcare workers including medical, nursing and therapy personnel as well as healthcare assistants as part of the recruitment campaign. The HSE later announced on 10 April that there will be an increase in the annual intake of medical interns this year, from 734 to approximately 1,100. This number would depend on how many students pass their final exams and accept an internship offer.Steps taken by healthcare regulators in IrelandThe Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) and the Irish Medical Council have also taken steps to make it easier for nurses and doctors to return to the register. The NMBI announced on 16 March 2020 that it is waiving the fees normally charged to nurses in order to return to the Irish Register of Nurses and Midwives. The NMBI also issued a further statement on 1 April to invite European and UK general nurses to support the Irish healthcare system during the emergency on a no fee \u2018temporary and occasional\u2019 basis if they are currently registered with the regulator in their own country.The Irish Medical Council announced on 18 March 2020 that it had launched a dedicated pathway for doctors to re-join the register and that doctors re-joining the register for this purpose would have their registration fees waived.The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, enacted on 27 March, introduced key measures to allow health and social care professionals who want to return to work to have their applications to be registered with their regulatory bodies accelerated. The 2020 Act allows, until 31 July 2020, previously-registered health and social care professionals to include doctors, pharmacists, nurses, dentists and other health and social care professionals to be restored to their respective registers without having to pay a fee. The Minister for Health has the power to extend the 31 July 2020 date if required.Interestingly, the Act also offers some protection to healthcare professionals, other than doctors, who may practise medicine during the pandemic. Normally, it is prohibited for any person, other than a registered medical practitioner, to practise medicine in contravention of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007. However, the 2020 Act provides that healthcare professionals, including nurses, pharmacists, dentists and other health and social care professionals are not practising medicine in breach of the 2007 Act in circumstances where they are acting:\t\tUnder the direction and control of a registered medical practitioner, or\t\t\tIn accordance with directions in writing given by a registered medical practitioner\tThe 2020 Act provides that this exception applies until 31 July 2020.Key Takeaways\t\tA number of important steps have been taken to increase the number of healthcare workers in Ireland.\t\t\tThese steps include:\t\t\t\tWaiving of registration fees.\t\t\t\t\tLegislation to facilitate acceleration of registration.\t\t\t\t\tThese measures are likely to increase significantly the number of healthcare professionals on the register in Ireland, at least temporarily. As a result, there will likely be an increased pressure on the regulators of these professions, both in terms of managing the registration and regulation of the profession and supporting the registrants, particularly at a time when the healthcare service is under considerable strain.\tFor expert guidance on related COVID-19 matters and how they affect your organisation, contact a member of our Public, Regulatory & Investigations team.\u00a0The content of this article is provided for information purposes only and does not constitute legal or other advice.\u00a0                                                                                                                             Discuss your related queries now with Catherine Allen.

Mon, 11 May, 2020 - 09:09Digital Desk staffSiptu says between 1,500 and 2,000 health workers who signed up to be \"On Call for Ireland\" were handed agency contracts with inferior terms and conditions.The trade union says it has been contacted by a number of workers hired under the scheme.It says the contracts do not include death-in-service benefits which could amount to up to two years' salary for a worker with a direct state contract, or Covid-19 leave pay.Siptu divisional health organizer Paul Bell says agency staff are taking all the same risks and should get the same treatment.\"These workers because they are not in that pension scheme have no access to any type of cover should they become a fatality and please god that doesn't happen,\" said Mr Bell.\"We don't want to see a situation where a health worker on that type of contract succumbs to an illness of Covid-19 and then their family and loved ones then have to pursue the State or the employer for some type of compensation.\"Mr Bell said that these workers will not be covered for self-isolation should they have to do so.more Coronavirus articles  Police probe large Rangers gatherings on Shankill Road  More people continue to travel further than 10km from their home  SVP launches click-and-collect services for NI shopsMore in this section  More people continue to travel further than 10km from their home  RT\u00c9 confirm Eoghan McDermott won't be returning to 2FM  Ireland will take spare Covid vaccines from 'wherever we can get them' - Ministercoronavirusperson: paul bellperson: bellorganisation: on call for irelandorganisation: siptuPolice probe large Rangers gatherings on Shankill RoadREAD NOW                   Lunchtime News Wrap                          Sign up to to get the latest\u00a0news direct\u00a0to your inbox daily at 1pm                                                                          Sign Up\u00a0      Latest\tMalala Yousafzai takes her passions to the small screen with Apple\tDeterrents and prosecutions needed to tackle gorse fires\tKeith Earls extends Munster contract to 2022\tPolice probe large Rangers gatherings on Shankill Road                                                                                                War of Independence Podcast                                                                A special four-part series hosted by Mick Clifford                                                                                    Available onwww.irishexaminer.com/podcasts                            Commemorating 100 years since the War of Independence                                                                                                                                                                  Fergus Finlay                                            Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      HOME DELIVERY SERVICE                                                                                        Have the Irish Examiner delivered to your door.\u00a0No delivery charge.

A further 1,000 have passed interview and are going through the final stages of the recruitment process.                                                         The nationwide campaign, which was launched by the Health Service Executive when the Covid-19 crisis escalated in early March, attracted responses from more than 73,000 applicants to support the health services. But only 14,000 have been identified as suitable for this initiative.                                                         The rationale behind the initiative was to create pools of available \u201cjob-ready\u201d healthcare workers available for deployment by the HSE during the crisis.                                                         When the HSE examined the applications 31,000 did not have relevant healthcare skills and were redirected to other State bodies and agencies.                                                         A further 13,000 were people who worked in health management and administration. Any roles using those skills are being filled by public servants redeployed from other departments and agencies.                                                                                                                                                             \t                                                                                    Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker: What's available in the Republic of Ireland and what else is coming?                                                                            \t                                                                                    Steady rise in number travelling further than 10km from home                                                                            \t                                                                                    Electric Picnic hopes vaccination programme will allow festival proceed                                                                                                                                                                                                          \t    In a response to a query from The Irish Times, the HSE has said many of the remaining 29,000 applicants, all registered as healthcare workers, could be deployed.                                                         It emerged that 10,000 of them were already working in healthcare. A further 1,000 were not licensed to practise and so could not be used. Some 1,000 unsubscribed for personal reasons.                                                         Separately, the HSE has recruited 3,000 of the applicants through other routes. It left 14,000 people who self-identified as nurses, doctors, support staff, ambulance and social-care professionals, and who had a \u201cjob-ready\u201d status. In other words, they would be available to replace any HSE staff on a temporary basis, or provide additional resources to services.                                                         The first tranche of those interviewed were priority applicants who had recently been working in the health sector. All had to go through a series of checks including registration confirmation, Garda vetting, assessment of references and work experience.                                                                                                                                                 What roles have been selected?The HSE said it is focusing in particular on doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants, domestic cleaners, porters, dentists, dieticians, radiographers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, pharmaceutical technicians, mortuary attendants, medical scientists and laboratory aides.

The country called for help with the battle against Covid-19 and 73,000 people stood up and answered.

From mid-March, Irish doctors and nurses living and working in Australia, New Zealand and other far-flung places returned home to help with the biggest health crisis the State has ever experienced. The photos of young medics arriving in Dublin Airport provided much-needed comfort at a time when the numbers of cases and deaths were rising rapidly every day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The sobering two-part RT\u00c9 Prime Time Investigates special this week demonstrated the severity of the crisis experienced by our healthcare workers. By capturing what life was like for staff and patients in the busy Covid ward at St James's Hospital, Dublin, the fly-on-the-wall documentary cut through the statistics to show the human strain that went into bringing the coronavirus under control. It captured the pressure our health system was under in April and May - even as it was bolstered by many who had returned from overseas.

Right now, you've got graduates coming into an environment where there are no positions for them, doctors who've returned from places like Australia are struggling to get any sort of guarantees about where they will be working and for how long, and existing staff overwhelmed with a workload and rosters that would be considered utterly unsustainable in a country with a first-class health system.\"                                                                                                                While Be on Call for Ireland provided heart-warming images, some of those who answered the call have had a tough time of it since coming back. Latest HSE figures show that the 73,000 figure was largely composed of people from outside the healthcare professions who felt their skills could be used in the fight against Covid. Some 14,100 were healthcare personnel from various strands of the sector, with a significant proportion already working in healthcare in Ireland and another large group comprising retired doctors and nurses.                                                                                                                                In a statement to Review, the HSE said: \"As of July 2, 194 doctors, nurses and health and social care appointees have been deployed from the Be on Call for Ireland initiative to HSE services in both community, acute and public health departments. An additional 715 candidates have full recruitment clearances in place and are 'job ready' as per service need. 940 candidates are in the clearance process.                                                                                                                \"The Be on Call for Ireland recruitment initiative was part of an overall recruitment effort made by the HSE.

According to Paddy Hillery of the Irish Medical Organisation, many had given up jobs and prospects overseas \"to make sure their families and countrymen would be protected\" underwent two weeks' unpaid quarantine on their return from abroad. Some were left out of pocket, having to pay rent and being ineligible for pandemic unemployment payments, he says.

I feel a bit stupid now, because I had been under the impression that jobs would be there for those who came back.\"                                                                                                                On March 19, the then health minister Simon Harris told RT\u00c9 radio that money was not an issue; the key was to get doctors and nurses to return to Ireland to fight the virus. \"The only restraint,\" he said, \"is the availability of people, not finances. In many cases, we'll be offering people full-time, permanent jobs - in other cases, contracts of at least three months' duration.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Expand                                                                                                                                                Close                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Promise: Former health minister Simon Harris said money was no object when it came to Be on Call for Ireland.

On June 2, in response to a March 17 tweet from Harris launching \"a massive recruitment drive for the health service\", she tweeted: \"Yet to receive even one available shift in the Donegal area since arriving home from Australia 11 weeks ago since this announcement. Now unemployed and unable to qualify for the Covid payment #shambles\".                                                                                                                Gleeson later recounted her experiences on Highland Radio, although attempts by Review to contact her this week were unsuccessful.                                                                                                                Marianne Hennigan had a much better experience. She was working as a hospital doctor in Perth, Australia and was inspired to leave everything and return home to help when Be on Call was launched. She was one of several Irish medics who flew home with assistance from the initiative - her flights and quarantine accommodation in Dublin were paid for by donors to the scheme, which was wound up in May.                                                                                                                                \"We're Irish and we trained in Ireland and I think we wanted to give back,\" she says. \"It was just a case of being able to get home. Flights were being cancelled and those that were going were costing thousands.\"                                                                                                                She got a placing in the emergency ward at a busy Dublin hospital, and quickly found herself in the thick of the work. It was rewarding, but onerous. After the comparative calmness of daily work in Australia, she says it was a tough adjustment. \"Staffing levels are much lower than they are in Australia,\" she says. \"So you can end up working really long hours in Ireland. That's never been addressed.\"                                                                                                                One of the reasons she emigrated in the first place was a sense of burnout from her time as a junior doctor. \"It was exhausting. You'd work 70-hour week for months on end. About half of my colleagues - young interns - flew out [to Australia and New Zealand] that year.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Expand                                                                                                                                                Close                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Credit: Eoin Kelleher/the Medical Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                /                                                                                                                            \t                                    Facebook                                \t                                    Twitter                                \t                                    Email                                \tWhatsapp                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Credit: Eoin Kelleher/the Medical Independent                                                                                                                                                        Hennigan says that on returning to Dublin in May, she was enthused to see so many additional healthcare workers on the wards. \"It was manageable, but as those extra people started to leave in the last few weeks, we started to see a rise in the number of people being left on trolleys, and with huge waiting times before anyone could see them.\"                                                                                                                She is now set to embark on a GP programme to become a much-needed general practice doctor. It's a much-needed role given that the IMO has estimated that the country will be short of 2,000 GPs by 2025.                                                                                                                                For Anthony O'Connor, a consultant at Tallaght Hospital, the adversity of the past few months represented a golden opportunity to sort out staffing once and for all. \"We had all this talent back in the country. We have new doctors coming on stream - many of them would be on planes all over the world [had the pandemic not hit]. Here was a chance to put an end to very long hours and burnout and to help us be ready for a second wave of this virus,\" he says.                                                                                                                \"When it [the pandemic] all kicked off, they were saying - quite rightly - let's get everybody on board and then halfway though they started worrying about the cost. There are a few nurses that got completely left in the lurch and there were no shifts for them at all.\"                                                                                                                O'Connor is anxious about how the health system will cope with the fallout from the coronavirus. \"What worries me is what we're heading into,\" he says. \"There are huge backlogs [for non-Covid-related surgeries and so on that had to be postponed] so we're going to need people more than ever, but instead we're letting people off and telling them they're not needed any more. What if there's a second wave and we put out the call again?

You could make plans. It was the same for nurses. I remember you'd have a nurse saying they had a really busy day if they had to look after five patients - here, it could be 12 or 13.                                                                                                                \"It's down to how money is spent,\" she adds. \"Of course, it's going to cost more to have a larger volume of staff, but surely the care provided is better when you don't have staff suffering from burnout and your workload is more manageable?\"                                                                                                                She is keen to highlight a phenomenon where a glut of trainee doctors will be available for internship this year, but may struggle to get work - and may be unable to travel for employment due to restrictions on overseas travel. \"But if the system remains as it is - where it can feel really hard to be a doctor, to help people - many will simply leave when they get the opportunity.\"                                                                                                                                A doctor who tweets as @IrishHealthInsider paints a stark picture. \"It can be exhausting/soul destroying,\" he tells Review. \"I think what many don't realise is that doctors leave for better conditions and training opportunities rather than pay. Most people I know who leave, especially those who don't return, do so because they want their lives back.                                                                                                                \"They want to be training rather than patching holes in some dreadful small hospital with terrible standards.                                                                                                                \"Essentially, our staffing levels during the day are usually adequate - not enough to get people out on time or take all their holidays - but most services function. At night, and over weekends, it's skeleton staff - often dangerous to patients and, of course, very stressful for the doctors.                                                                                                                \"With Covid, the on-call skeleton staff expanded - pretty much doubled - as well as some services moving to seven days a week rotas so they were always around for their patient. This was the success of hiring more doctors - it felt safe; safer than ever despite a pandemic.\"                                                                                                                                His prognosis for the immediate future is bleak. \"Even without a second surge, I don't know how our current staffing levels will be able to catch-up on the backlog of clinics, diagnostics, procedures, etc - not to mention people who, through no fault of their own, stayed at home with something they should have presented to hospital with [such as a transient stroke], then go on to present later on much sicker. We'll try to [manage the situation] because in fairness to many of the medics in this country, they work themselves to the bone to keep things barely afloat.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Indo Review                                                                                                                                                                              Related Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Irish News                     Premium                                      Why medical staff shortages have been a chronic problem                When the Department of Health moved out of Hawkins House into its shiny new home on \u00adBaggot Street, did anyone bother to bring the dusty old pile of reports on medical workforce planning?
