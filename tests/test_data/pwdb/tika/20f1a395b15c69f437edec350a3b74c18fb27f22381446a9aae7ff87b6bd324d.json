The aim of the measure is to alleviate the impacts of COVID-19 and to reduce the risk of infections. For several years Tesco has not operated overnight shifts, so this measure is strictly for the purposes of protecting employees and customers.", "content_of_measure_description": "The bonus is the equivalent of GBP 100 or about HUF 40,000 and it is a one-off payment, which is supposed to compensate also for the extra burdens related to the expected rise in end-of-year holiday (Christmas) sales. The bonuses will be added to December paychecks that are to be paid out in January 2021. Fears have been expressed by unionists that the new overnight shift may be unusual and hard for staff to get used to as there has not been such a shift for years at the company. The situation of supermarket workers during the second wave of COVID-19 will be monitored by the retail trade union.", "use_of_measure_description": "Tesco employs 12,315 people in Hungary (as of 2020).
