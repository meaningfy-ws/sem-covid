About 2,000 businesses nationwide will benefit.Speaking from K Leisure in Naas, Kildare, the T\u00e1naiste said: \u201cThe past few months have been extremely difficult for businesses across the country and especially for the people of Kildare who have had to endure further restrictions. Those actions were necessary at the time. They helped turn the tide against the\u00a0spread of the virus. I know they also came with an economic impact and that businesses have been under serious pressure over the past few weeks.\u201cKildare is fully open for business, in line with public health guidelines. Today we\u2019re announcing a Fund which will help businesses, not eligible under our other schemes with the costs of re-opening. While many businesses have benefitted from the Restart Grant Plus and other government schemes, this is for small businesses with up to 10 staff that have not been eligible to any scheme to date. It is recognition of the difficulties in adapting to Covid-19 that they have had. Now is the time to shop local and I encourage everyone to think of their local business owner when doing their weekly shop or looking to buy something.\u201dAs part of the July Stimulus, funding is also being increased to local enterprise offices to extend existing programmes, such as the \u2018Lean for Micro\u2019 programme to all businesses employing less than 10. This scheme is designed to encourage Local Enterprise Office clients to adopt Lean business principles in their businesses to increase performance and competitiveness.Interested businesses can apply directly to their Local Enterprise Office.Applications from Kildare, Laois and Offaly are already prioritised for funding under all existing Schemes.ENDS NOTES TO EDITOREligibility criteriaThe initial \u20ac2m for the Micro-Enterprise Assistance Fund is being provided under the July Stimulus for LEO clients that meet the following criteria:\tBusinesses impacted by a 30% reduction in turnover due to COVID-19 restrictions or downturn in trade will be eligible provided they commit to reopening and to hiring and sustaining employment;\tThe grant will be based on the amount of vouched additional expenditure from 14 September, from date of launch of the Scheme;\tEmployers with between at least one and up to 10 full-time employees;\tBusinesses that have a commercial focus, have an up to date tax compliance certificate and within eligible sectors (excluding gambling, coal and steel etc.);\tBusinesses that are ineligible for other state sectoral funding schemes; and,\tBusinesses already in receipt of the Government\u2019s Restart/Restart Plus Grant, F\u00e1ilte Ireland Restart Plus scheme or the DEASP Enterprise Support Grant for Small Business are excluded.\u00a0          Back to Department News                                                                                      Back to Top                                                                            2020\tDecember\tNovember\tOctober\tSeptember\tAugust\tJuly\tJune\tMay\tApril\tMarch\tFebruary\tJanuary                                                                                                                                                                       Cookie ManagementPrivacy Statement and Cookie PolicySocial Media PolicyDisclaimerCopyrightAccessibilitySitemapA-Z IndexFOIFOI Publication SchemeData ProtectionRe-use of Public Service InfoAdvisory CouncilsConstruction Contracts Adjudication Service                            Contact usDepartment of Enterprise,\u00a0 Trade and Employment23 Kildare Street, Dublin 2, D02 TD30Tel: +353 1 631 2121  LoCall: 1890 220 222  Email: info@enterprise.gov.ieEnterprise Information Centre:Tel:\u00a0+353 1 631 2002Email:\u00a0infobusinesssupport@enterprise.gov.ie                                                        Subscribe to our email alerts                                                                                                                                            "}, {"url": "https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/Publications/Publication-files/Take-up-of-COVID-19-and-Brexit-Business-Supports.pdf", "title": "COVID-19 and Brexit Business Supports Tracker", "content_path": "res/a691e8e7f972f3ec89b1386a8949e96fde1e0216a3f689fe58a0f90b79747f5f", "content": "404 - File or directory not found.Server Error   404 - File or directory not found.
