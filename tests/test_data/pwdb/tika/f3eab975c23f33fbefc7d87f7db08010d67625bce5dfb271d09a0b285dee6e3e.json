The Credit Guarantee Scheme does not substitute for conventional lending that would otherwise have taken place. This is a repurposing of an existing SME credit guarantee scheme designed to assist SMEs to remain in business through the COVID-19 crisis.\r\r", "content_of_measure_description": "The Credit Guarantee Scheme can be used by businesses to obtain loans to support changes they need to make to their business in response to COVID-19. It facilitates lending by commercial banks to SMEs by indemnifying banks against potential losses incurred from the lending.\r\rEligible entities for the credit guaranteed loans are viable micro, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The lending decisions are made by the banks and not subject to government intervention. \r\rThe Scheme is targeted towards companies who are unable to access credit because of \rinadequate collateral, difficulty of accessing credit due to novel business market or technology or requirements to refinance given exit of SME lenders from the Irish market.\r\rLoan facilities can be from \u20ac10,000 up to \u20ac1m for terms of up to 7 years with the possibility of \ra three to six-month interest-only payment period (depending on the total loan duration). Borrowing SMEs pay an interest rate premium of 0.5% per annum (initially in 2019/20; rate may vary thereafter) to partially cover the state costs of the guarantee.\r\r\r\r\r\r", "use_of_measure_description": "According to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment: 3,285 applications were received for the scheme.

The scheme, officially launched last September through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, offers an 80 per cent State guarantee to participating lenders to provide Irish businesses, including those in the farming and fishing sectors, with access to low interest loans as they respond to the impacts of Covid-19.

Loan limitsLoans of up to \u20ac1 million are available for up to 5\u00bd years through the plan, though individual lenders may set lower limits.
