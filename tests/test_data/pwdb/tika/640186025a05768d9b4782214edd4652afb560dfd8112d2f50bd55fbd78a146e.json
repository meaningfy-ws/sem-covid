The company employs about 2,000 people across its various restaurants, bars, pubs, breweries and support centres around the world. Following the UK lockdown at the end of March, the company closed its bars. Up until this point, 70% of the company's business revenue was derived from its bars. Thus, as will be described, the business has undergone a fairly radical transformation as a result of the pandemic, focusing on online and supermarket sales and switching distillery production.", "content_of_measure_description": "From the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, health and safety of staff was a priority and BrewDog quickly closed restaurants and pubs to the public so as to protect staff. At first, it offered an online ordering service. This featured a \u201cHop Drop\u201d click-and-collect service, home delivery, and a minimal contact DriveThru service, which meant that customers could drive to their nearest BrewDog bar, and staff would bring their order to their car on arrival. However, this shut down shortly after as staff were still concerned they could be at risk. The firm then focused on supplying supermarkets and food retailers with beer for personal consumption, even creating a new beer called Lockdown Lager in homage to the government\u2019s social distancing mandate. \r\rWith around 70% of (non-production) staff on furlough during the first and second lockdowns, the company's two directors have foregone their salary for 2020, and other senior team members have also taken considerable pay cuts, with the COO and board members each agreeing to take a 50% pay cut so as to ensure there is money within the business to support as many jobs as possible. \r\rA number of furloughed staff asked to come back to work in the firm\u2019s still operational distilleries. For those who remained on furlough, BrewDog worked diligently to keep open lines of communication with all furloughed staff, including blog posts, weekly updates on the business, pub quizzes and even sending a crate of beer to staff who can no longer work. Social distancing was introduced into the factories, with crates placed at every stage of the production line so staff can keep a safe distance from one another. One of the company's founders even shared a tutorial on how the firm has made face visors for its production staff.\r\rFor those who remained on furlough, BrewDog has worked diligently to keep open lines of communication with all furloughed staff, including blog posts, weekly updates on the business, pub quizzes and even sending a crate of beer to staff who can no longer work.\r\rDuring full bar closure, the company also focused on supporting its community and customer base, aiming to ensure that there is still a sense of connection. It launched the BrewDog Open Arms; an online virtual pub which allows its customers to come together and enjoy a beer together.  The virtual bar opened for the first time on Friday, 27 March, and featured a pub quiz, guided beer tastings, and live music. Held over Zoom, it attracted more than 1,000 participants, the maximum number permitted by the online meetings platform.In another move to support the community, the company has also used its vans to deliver meals (and sanitiser - see below) locally.\r\rThe scarcity of hand sanitiser in the region around its headquarters in Ellon, near Aberdeen in Scotland, led BrewDog to dedicate its distillery to producing this important tool in the fight to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The first batch was distributed within a few days, free of charge, to healthcare services, charities, and other frontline workers.  The transition did come with challenges. Given the sudden demand generated by the pandemic, the pump bottles normally used to dispense hand sanitiser could not be sourced immediately, so the team solved this packaging dilemma by using containers they already had on the premises. The first batches of sanitiser were delivered in beer bottles.\r\rThe pump dispenser bottles eventually arrived, and the distillery began running 24 hours a day. It developed the capacity to produce up to 12 hectolitres per day, the equivalent of 12,000 100ml bottles of hand sanitiser. By 28 April, the number of units donated had reached more than 250,000.  \r\rThe gel made in the initial phase of production contained 69% alcohol, above the 60% minimum recommended by the UK Health and Safety Executive and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. In the subsequent phases, learning has prompted adjustments and improvements. In response to feedback from local hospitals that the alcohol content required for sanitiser used in clinical care is higher than that used by individuals, BrewDog worked with the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) to meet that specification. On 3 April, less than two weeks after the first batch was produced, the company received approval and an order for the new version of the sanitiser, which has an 80% alcohol content.

We have been able to place some of our workforce on furlough leave,\u00a0with the support of the Job Retention Scheme,\u00a0and we will also be utilising the Business Rates holiday which\u00a0has been made available.This has allowed us to keep doing our best to ensure our business survives and we protect as many jobs as we can.We have chosen to forgo\u00a0our\u00a0salary for 2020,\u00a0and\u00a0other senior team members have taken considerable pay cuts to ensure there is money within the business to support as many jobs as possible. All\u00a0non-production\u00a0staff within the business are now working from home, and we have installed further safety procedures in our brewery to protect staff who are still on site.Since full bar closure, our focus has been on supporting our community and ensuring there is still a sense of connection. We launched the\u00a0BrewDog\u00a0Open Arms; an online virtual pub which allows our customers to still come together and enjoy a beer together.We have\u00a0also\u00a0begun producing hand sanitiser in our Aberdeen brewery to be given away for free to key workers and local charities \u2013 so far we have packed over 100,000 containers.

When the coronavirus pandemic brought lockdown and social distancing, BrewDog faced the prospect of its 102 bars, from Columbus, Ohio, in the US, to London and from Berlin to Brisbane in Australia, remaining closed for the foreseeable future. This implied a 70% drop in revenue overnight.But the brewer and distiller\u2019s immediate response to the crisis was to look at its resources and work out how they could be put to best use. The sudden public need for vast quantities of hand sanitiser as a result of the pandemic created an opportunity for BrewDog to pivot some of its operations. The company\u2019s experience with making quick strategic changes, which has helped fuel its rapid growth in recent years, enabled the swift introduction of a new product line in the pandemic-altered environment.The scarcity of hand sanitiser in the region around its headquarters in Ellon, near Aberdeen in Scotland, led BrewDog to dedicate its distillery to producing this important tool in the fight to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The first batch was distributed within a few days, free of charge, to healthcare services, charities, and other frontline workers, explained Ben Press, ACMA, CGMA, BrewDog\u2019s retail finance manager.The transition did come with challenges. Given the sudden demand generated by the pandemic, the pump bottles normally used to dispense hand sanitiser could not be sourced immediately, so the team solved this packaging dilemma by using containers they already had on the premises. The first batches of sanitiser were delivered in beer bottles.The pump dispenser bottles eventually arrived, and the distillery began running 24 hours a day. It developed the capacity to produce up to 12 hectolitres per day, the equivalent of 12,000 100ml bottles of hand sanitiser.\u00a0By 28 April, the number of units donated had reached more than 250,000.The vans usually used for local deliveries of beers and spirits are now being used to distribute the sanitiser, as well as to deliver meals to people who are isolated or in rural areas.When the message about the changes to operations went out to employees, \u201ceverybody wanted to chip in and help\u201d, Press said. \u201cWe have this mentality that we\u2019re all in it together, and everyone just does what is needed, so for us this is kind of a normal thing.\u201dIn his three years with the company, as well as being responsible for the management accounts of the company\u2019s bars, Press has packed bottles of gin, done an occasional shift in the bar, and worked in the lab, as well as on the packaging line in the brewery.Since it was founded in 2007, the company has undergone rapid expansion, has operations in the US, Australia, and Germany, and employs 3,000 people. \u201cWe have the ability to react very quickly to any changes, given that we\u2019ve been growing so fast,\u201d Press said. \u201cWe\u2019re used to working at pace, so turning production around pretty quickly wasn\u2019t as scary as it could have been.\u201dThis spirit of innovation and flexibility is rooted in \u201ca shared mentality and a shared vision of what we want the company to be\u201d, he said. \u201cBy making sure we\u2019ve got all like-minded people, it makes things like this so much easier.\u201dCultural fit is the first priority in the company\u2019s hiring decisions. \u201cWhat our recruitment team always looks for is, first, whether the person is a good fit, and then, do they have the skillset to do the role?\u201dOne way of gauging that fit is to seek people with passion. As Press described it, \u201cwe like to get geeky people. You can be geeky about anything; Lego is a popular one. Our former people director was obsessed with Christmas films\u201d. This latter passion involved owning every single one that had ever been released on DVD, categorising them, and starting to watch them three months before Christmas to get through them all in time for the festive season. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird and wonderful things like that \u2014 if you can tap into that geekiness, you can make people geeky about beer, and about BrewDog, and about what we\u2019re doing.\u201dTo keep the business going and preserve as many jobs as possible through the lockdown period, the two co-founders, James Watt and Martin Dickie, announced they will not draw a salary in 2020. The COO and board members have each agreed to take a 50% pay cut. UK government programmes, such as the furlough programme and business rates (local tax) relief, will also help.The aim of the sanitiser project was to meet an immediate need in the local community as quickly as possible. \u201cAs soon as our founder, James, put the word out, we were bombarded with requests, through social media and our mailboxes, from people trying to get hold of hand gel, which just shows how in demand it is,\u201d Press said.The gel made in the initial phase of production contained 69% alcohol, above the 60% minimum recommended by the UK Health and Safety Executive and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. It was welcomed by charities including the Aberlour Trust and the ARCHIE Foundation, which support children and families in the local community.In the subsequent phases, learning has prompted adjustments and improvements. In response to feedback from local hospitals that the alcohol content required for sanitiser used in clinical care is higher than that used by individuals, BrewDog worked with the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) to meet that specification. On 3 April, less than two weeks after the first batch was produced, the company received approval and an order for the new version of the sanitiser, which has an 80% alcohol content.As its bars around the world remain closed, the company has created a virtual alternative, a further example of its adaptability and willingness to innovate. \u201cThe virtual bar was an idea that we came up with so that regulars to a certain bar would still be able to catch up with all the people that they might normally see whenever they go out, and have a drink together, without leaving the comfort of their own home or breaking social-distancing rules,\u201d Press said.The virtual bar opened for the first time on a Friday, 27 March, and featured a pub quiz, guided beer tastings, and live music. Held over Zoom, it attracted more than 1,000 participants, the maximum number permitted by the online meetings platform.Hear more from Ben Press about BrewDog\u2019s pivot in an FM magazine podcast episode.For more news and reporting on the coronavirus and how management accountants can handle challenges related to the pandemic, visit FM\u2019s coronavirus resources page.\u2014 Samantha White is a freelance writer based in the UK.

The company employs about 2,000 people across its various restaurants, bars, pubs, breweries and support centres around the world.\u00a0The impact so farDuring the coronavirus pandemic, BrewDog has closed all its pubs and shifted distillery production to making free hand sanitiser for local hospitals and charities. Although restaurants and pubs are closed, BrewDog has still worked to remain connected to its customer base. The brewery now focuses on supplying supermarkets and food retailers with beer for personal consumption, and the business has even created a new beer called Lockdown Lager in homage to the government\u2019s social distancing mandate. BrewDog has also hosted a series of 'virtual pubs' where people can log in for an online tasting session, watch live music or participate in pub quizzes.\u00a0Karen Bates, people director for BrewDog, says the brewery has gone through a rapid transformation in response to the outbreak, with the focus on preserving the business and protecting its people. \u201cNumber one was to protect our business because we need to be here at the end of this,\u201d Bates says. \u201cAnd number two is that we need to protect as many jobs as possible because we\u2019re protecting the livelihoods of our people.\u201dFurlough and redistribution\u00a0While BrewDog had initially planned to make redundancies, as soon as the government announced its job retention scheme it reversed this decision and put everybody on furlough. \u201cAbout 70 per cent of our workforce are furloughed across the world,\u201d Bates says.BrewDog is the biggest employer in Ellon, a town just north of Aberdeen, and it was important to the business to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d by the community by preserving jobs, says Bates.\u00a0While some staff were happy to be furloughed and not come into work in order to stay safe, others have now asked to come back to work in the firm\u2019s still operational distilleries. \u201cThey\u2019re saying they see what\u2019s going on within the business, and they want to be part of it,\u201d Bates explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve even got some of the people in our head office roles who were furloughed to come and work on our production line.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0It has not, however, been possible to bring everyone back into the workforce due to travel restrictions. Bates says BrewDog has worked diligently to keep open lines of communication with all furloughed staff, including blog posts, weekly updates on the business, pub quizzes and even sending a crate of beer to staff who can no longer work.Health and safetyFrom the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, health and safety of staff was a priority and BrewDog quickly closed restaurants and pubs to the public to protect staff. At first it offered an online ordering service, but this was shut down shortly after as staff were still concerned they could be at risk.Bates says BrewDog has also introduced social distancing within the factory; crates have been placed at every stage of the production line so staff can keep a safe distance from one another. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really creative about how to help staff feel safe in the brewery and distillery,\u201d Bates says. \u201cOne of our founders, James Watt, even shared a tutorial on how we\u2019ve been making face visors for our production staff using a laminator and elastic bands.\u201cIt\u2019s not like in supermarkets where you can easily not pay attention to the lines on the floor,\u201d Bates explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that at our site without hurdling over crates.\u201d                                                                Advertisement                                                                                                            Advertisement                                                                                                                                                        View More Jobs                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Strategic Human Resources                                                                             Torfaen (Tor-faen)                        Grade 8 \u00a332,234 - \u00a337,890 Points 32 - 34                        Torfaen County Borough Council                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Director of HR                                                                            New Cross Gate, London predominantly, but also working across our school sites in south London                        Competitive to reflect experience and expertise.
