The first wave of the crisis put a lot of pressure on the existing care personnel. This alleviated after the peak of the first wave but still many care professionals complained about the lack of recuperation and the mental and physical stress suffered due to the first peak. The second nationwide peak is currently ongoing, with the additional issue that now a number of care professionals are falling out because of illness themselves, either due to the COVID-19 virus or work pressure. At the same time a large number of people are still unable to work and temporarily unemployed (for example in the events and entertainment sectors, with little prospect in the near future). This is why Flemish employment services are currently launching a initiative and accompanying platform in order to facilitate people on temporary unemployment to perform tasks in the care sector.", "content_of_measure_description": "The measure is open to all people making use of the temporary unemployment scheme. The jobs that would be put up on the the platform (www.helpindezorg.be) would be specifically for jobs in the care sector that don't require any additional skills or training, for example logistics, animation, reception of patients, etc.\rThe main goal is to provide an easy channel for hospitals and care facilities to publish vacancies on a centralised platform. The jobs that are posted there are clearly defined and of a temporary nature. If the regular job of the applicant restarts, the person in the temporary care function is able to switch back easily.", "use_of_measure_description": "The measure is only announced and not finalised yet, it is too early to give information about usage.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "Unknown", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "Yes", "private_or_public_sector": "Not specified", "is_occupation_specific": "Yes", "actors": ["Local / regional government", "Public employment service"], "target_groups": ["Particular professions", "Unemployed"], "funding": ["Regional funds"], "sectors": ["Human health activities", "Residential care activities"], "occupations": [{"recordId": "35", "occupations::name": "Cleaners and helpers", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "12", "occupations::name": "Health associate professionals", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "6", "occupations::name": "Health professionals", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "22", "occupations::name": "Personal care workers", "modId": "0"}], "sources": [{"url": "https://www.tijd.be/politiek-economie/belgie/vlaanderen/vdab-koppelt-tijdelijk-werklozen-aan-zorgjob/10259776.htm", "title": "De Tijd", "content_path": "res/1c011b477b73b32259a07a0a697a0d22eab73578527881fa97dbf93e560a89dc", "content": "404 Resource at '/content/tijd/nl/politiek-economie/belgie/vlaanderen/vdab-koppelt-tijdelijk-werklozen-aan-zorgjob/10259776.htm.html' not found: No resource found        Resource at '/content/tijd/nl/politiek-economie/belgie/vlaanderen/vdab-koppelt-tijdelijk-werklozen-aan-zorgjob/10259776.htm.html' not found: No resource found        Cannot serve request to /content/tijd/nl/politiek-economie/belgie/vlaanderen/vdab-koppelt-tijdelijk-werklozen-aan-zorgjob/10259776.htm.html on this server                                        Apache Sling    "}]}
