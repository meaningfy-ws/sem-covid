The advantages include having a wider talent pool inside your company, a greater range of bespoke skills among employees, and the ability to deal with specific skill gaps.\u201cAround 6,500 employers are already running apprenticeship programmes but we want to see many more. The July Stimulus Initiative established the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme, which provides a grant of \u20ac3,000 per apprentice over two years, for employers who register apprentices before the end of the year.\u00a0 It offers greater choice to employers and to school leavers and learners of all ages.\u201cI\u2019m very happy to report that in the three weeks since the Scheme went live, applications have been received from employers representing 310 individual apprentices.\u201dThe Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris said: \u201cAs Leaving Cert results are issued and the focus inevitably turns to CAO offers over the coming weeks it is important for students to remember that there are many routes to a chosen career and I would encourage students to look at all the options available to them, including apprenticeship.\u201d\u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s visit is a prime example of the range of options available to school leavers and learners of all ages \u2013 in this one organisation there are 24 apprentices across laboratory, electrical instrumentation and mechanical automation and maintenance fitting programmes.\u00a0 Not only are these apprentices gaining a recognised qualification, but at the same time they are gaining paid workplace experience.\u201cApprenticeship offers real choice both to business and learners of all ages and stages of experience.\u00a0 The sector has changed radically over the past 4 years, with 58 different programmes now available across all sectors of the economy.\u00a0\u00a0 Last month three new programmes were launched \u2013 the Supply Chain Associate apprenticeship (QQI level 7), the first Recruitment Executive apprenticeship which is a 3 year QQI level 8 award and the Principal Engineer apprenticeship which is the first apprenticeship in Ireland to lead to a QQI level 10 award.\u201dNOTESApprenticeship Incentivisation SchemeFunded under the July Jobs Stimulus programme, the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme is designed to support employers to continue to recruit apprentices during the immediate Covid-19 period. \u00a0 Apprenticeship employers are eligible for a \u20ac3,000 payment for each new apprentice who is registered between the period 01 March and 31 December 2020. \u20ac2,000 per apprentice is payable at the point of registration with a further \u20ac1,000 is payable in Quarter 3 2021 for each eligible apprentice retained in employment.The incentive support covers all 58 national apprenticeship programmes and will apply\u00a0to any new apprenticeship programmes which are launched in 2020.\u00a0 SOLAS, as the statutory agency overseeing the apprenticeship system, has been charged with responsibility for developing, delivering and administering this new scheme.\u00a0 Further information on the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme may be found on www.apprenticeship.ie\u00a0General Additional information for employers and potential apprentices on apprenticeship programmes or available opportunities in apprenticeship may be found on www.apprenticeship.ie or through your local Education and Training Board (ETB).\u00a0The Apprenticeship Jobs Portal is available at\u00a0www.apprenticeship.ie\u00a0and is a free service for employers who are approved by SOLAS to employ apprentices.
