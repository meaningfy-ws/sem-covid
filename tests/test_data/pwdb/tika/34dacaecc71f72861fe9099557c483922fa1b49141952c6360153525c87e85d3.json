Many Maltese organisations were not in a position to carry out this transition seamlessly, with few organisations offering employees the opportunity to work from home prior to COVID-19. In order to facilitate this change of working method, the government introduced a grant to support employers to invest in technology to facilitate this change. \r", "content_of_measure_description": "This call supports employers and self-employed individuals to invest in technology that enables teleworking: the aim of the call is to partially cover the costs involved in making a transition to telework. \r \rSupport is limited up to \u20ac500 per teleworking agreement and \u20ac4,000 per undertaking. The grant shall be awarded against 45% of the eligible cost. In order to be eligible, the employee should not have had an active teleworking agreement prior to the 15th of February 2020. All costs must be incurred after this date. The employee must be able to address their role via teleworking, a formal teleworking agreement must be in place, and they can connect to the work place via a VPN or equivalent solution. \r\r", "use_of_measure_description": "* By the beginning of June, \u20ac300,000 had been disbursed via this scheme, whilst \u20ac376,000 has been approved.  \r* Up to the end of July, 370 businesses benefitted from this scheme with the cost amounting to \u20ac605,613. \r* In September, the CEO of the Malta Enterprise stated that in total, over 500 businesses benefitted from the scheme.  \r* The Economy minister announced that as per 19 October 2020, 662 applications had been received with \u20ac899,813 being disbursed to applicant companies. ", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "The measure was one of the very first to be introduced by the Maltese government. Direct and public communication had occurred between government, unions and government. Amongst the many concerns that were discussed were the costs associated with sudden number of teleworking employees. In view of these concerns, this measure was introduced through the Malta Enterprise by the Government; consultation was limited and social partners were dissatisfied with the package of measures introduced during this early phase of the pandemic.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "No", "private_or_public_sector": "Only private sector",
