Better Food is based in the city of Bristol in the south-west of England. Its stores and cafes are located on three sites in the city and the company employees more than 120 people across these sites.", "content_of_measure_description": "The cafeteria side of the business closed as part of the UK's lockdown measures, but the food stores remained open, given their status as essential retail outlets. At the beginning of the lockdown, around 20 staff were off work, due to illness, the need to self-isolate and/or care for family members (this increased to 40 at one point). The HR head and management team all worked on the shopfloor, so as to ensure staff cover for each shift. Communication across the three sites was deemed essential and thus, in addition to the online HR system which sends staff communication to employees' personal email addresses, HR implemented a 'flash' meeting system, short two to five minute meetings at the start of shifts to share updates, including on health and safety.\r\rGiven the cafe closures, staff were redeployed across the stores and temporary staff were sought to fill gaps and cover staff sickness. HR advertised on the company website and in-stores and 100 applications were received in three days. A streamlined selection process was used so as to get new staff inducted and in place within seven days.\r\rAt the outset, any high-risk employees were placed on paid leave. Moreover, the company changed its sick pay scheme so as to accommodate absences caused by the virus, whether physical illness or mental ill-health exacerbated by the pandemic. The company removed its initial nine-month waiting period, so that all workers could get a minimum of two weeks' paid sick leave.\r\rTo further support employees' mental well being, HR worked to publicise the well being benefits and employee assistance programmes provided through Better Food's partnership with the charity retailTRUST.  HR also kept in constant communication with all staff who were self-isolating, putting together and delivering care packages as well as compiling lists of Netflix recommendations.", "use_of_measure_description": "This is a company initiative and the company is a relatively small business, which has three locations in the city of Bristol. Thus, the number of workers covered is confined to those employed in the business - 120 workers.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "This is a company measure as response to the virus and the subsequent lockdown and thus, there was no involvement of the social partners in design, monitoring or implementation.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "Yes", "private_or_public_sector": "Only private sector", "is_occupation_specific": "No", "actors": ["Company / Companies"], "target_groups": ["Employees in standard employment", "The COVID-19 risk group at the workplace"], "funding": ["Companies", "Employer"], "sectors": ["Retail trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles"], "occupations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/long-reads/articles/how-are-people-teams-responding-to-coronavirus-better-food", "title": "People Management (2020) How are people teams responding to coronavirus? ...Better Food", "content_path": "res/6182e55ba0fd2a57e18abda1b5964c6a30d5aef593d11034239e44ce467bab43", "content": "How are people teams responding to coronavirus? ...Better Food                                                      Advertisement                                                      Skip to main site navigationSkip to main contentSkip to footer           \t                            CIPD                                        \t                            CIPD Events                                        \t                            PM Insight                                                                       People Management                                                                                                    Open                                                                     \t                                                            News                                                    \t                                                            Voices                                                    \t                                                            Long reads                                                    \t                                                            Experts                                                    \t                                                            Contact Us                                                    \t                                                            PM Jobs                                                                                                                            When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.

The stores and cafes can be found in three locations in the city, and the company employs more than 120 people across the sites.\u00a0The impact so farDaisy Roach, head of HR and payroll, says coronavirus contingency planning started at the end of February. This included planning for the possibility of mass panic buying, which she says was \u201con the periphery\u201d back then. At the time she thought the outbreak would be a \u201cmonth or so away\u201d, but almost immediately there was an influx of customers buying products. \u201cIt all changed within an hour and completely flipped on its head,\u201d Roach says. \u201cWe saw a massive increase in sales, and we took in more in the second week of March than we\u2019ve ever taken in any Christmas.\u201dAt the beginning of the outbreak almost 20 staff were out of action because they were ill, self-isolating or needing to be at home caring for family members, so Roach and her management team all worked on the shop floor to help cover shifts. Roach says communication has been key to keeping each store running smoothly.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get 100 people across different sites working as efficiently as possible, and we have an online HR system through which all staff communication can go out to their personal email addresses,\u201d Roach says. \u201cWe also hold \u2018flash\u2019 meetings, a short two to five-minute meeting at the start of shifts to share what\u2019s going on that day or share updates on health and safety.\u201dRecruitmentIn response to the outbreak, Better Food closed its cafes and redeployed staff to work across the rest of the business. Roach says she immediately set to work enlisting temporary staff to fill gaps as many employees were off sick. \u201cWe\u2019re quite lucky in our recruitment that we have a great community of customers who want to work for us so we don\u2019t pay to advertise,\u201d Roach explains. \u201cWe put something up on our website and in store, and we got a really high response rate straight away.\u201dShe says the company received more than 100 applications in three days. Her team streamlined the interview process to reflect the \u201ccriticalness of getting those staff in work in a short amount of time\u201d. Roach says she wrote a new process for group interviews, which the business immediately rolled out: \u201cWe put up the applications on Wednesday, invited people to interviews on Saturday and Sunday and inducted them on Monday and Tuesday.\u201d\u00a0In total, Better Food took on 12 temporary staff, half on guaranteed minimum contracts and the other half on zero-hours contracts.\u00a0PayFrom the start of the outbreak, the company put the health and safety of staff at the forefront of its planning, Roach says. Any high-risk employees, including those with lung conditions or recovering from cancer, were placed on paid leave. \u201cAt one point, we had 38 people self-isolating at one time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a massive thing for us that our staff feel protected and that we are looking after their health and wellbeing.\u201dRoach says Better Food also changed its company sick pay scheme to accommodate absences caused by the virus \u2013 whether physical sickness or mental ill-health worsened by the outbreak. \u201cWe removed our initial nine-month waiting period to make sure that everybody would get a minimum of two weeks\u2019 paid sick leave,\u201d Roach says. \u201cWe knew everybody was, at some point, going to be out of the office \u2013 whether self-isolating, unwell or for other reasons, such as to look after their mental health.\u201dWellbeingTo further support employees\u2019 mental wellbeing, Roach set about communicating those wellbeing benefits and employee assistance programmes provided through Better Food\u2019s partnership with charity retailTRUST. \u201cEverybody\u2019s anxiety levels are heightened because of the lack of control, and there\u2019s no knowing what\u2019s going to happen because of all the chaos going on around us,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect recipe for poor mental health.\u201dRoach also kept in constant communication with all staff who were self-isolating to check-in on their wellbeing; she even came up with creative ways to make sure they felt included. \u201cI put together care packages and was delivering them but, as we got more people going off sick, that became something I couldn\u2019t do anymore because of logistics,\u201d she says.\u201cI also did a list of my Netflix recommendations because quite a lot of people were out, and the people I spoke to were saying they\u2019d run out of things to watch or didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d                                                                Advertisement                                                                                                            Advertisement                                                                                                                                                        View More Jobs                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Strategic Human Resources                                                                             Torfaen (Tor-faen)                        Grade 8 \u00a332,234 - \u00a337,890 Points 32 - 34                        Torfaen County Borough Council                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Director of HR                                                                            New Cross Gate, London predominantly, but also working across our school sites in south London                        Competitive to reflect experience and expertise.
