The issuing consisted of two bonds, with \u20ac10 billion due for repayment in October 2030 and \u20ac7 billion due for repayment in 2040.\r\rSURE is available for Member States that need to mobilise significant financial means to fight the negative economic and social consequences of the coronavirus outbreak on their territory. It can provide financial assistance up to \u20ac100 billion in the form of loans from the EU to affected Member States. SURE would provide additional EU support to finance Member States' short-time work schemes, and other similar measures, helping to protect jobs.", "content_of_measure_description": "There was very strong investor interest in this highly rated instrument, and the bonds were more than 13 times oversubscribed, resulting in favourable pricing terms for both bonds.\rBoth bonds were issued on attractive terms, reflecting the high level of interest.

In particular, we will see high levels of business bankruptcies, reduced investment plans, high unemployment, weaker government finances, and increased protectionist pressures on both the internal market and external trade. Smart European leadership and efficient forms of solidarity will be needed to recover from this unprecedented crisis and strengthen European sovereignty in the post-COVID-19 world.Controlling the virus whilst preserving our economies and societies requires, in the first instance, a co-ordinated EU emergency response and an effective risk-based exit strategy.In addition, the EU and its member states must work with the social partners to immediately define a clear, ambitious, predictable and co-ordinated EU recovery plan in order to give businesses the confidence to keep going through this crisis, ensure that we rapidly address the damage to our economies, and start restoring businesses capacity for investment and employment.BusinessEurope\u2019s EU recovery plan sets out detailed proposals under 4 pillars which if implemented together can help create a regulatory and fiscal environment for businesses that enables them to invest, grow and create jobs:\tA rapid deployment of EU investment funds as part of an ambitious and co-ordinated EU fiscal stimulus, including immediate agreement on a new and revised multi-annual financial framework (MFF), and a specific European recovery fund to bring new money to the table without mutualising existing debt between Member States*.\tA revitalised and open single market and strengthened single currency, as part of a greater focus on supporting sustainable investment, growth and employment.\tThe EU as a leading advocate for rules-based, fair and free trade and investment and a strong supporter of multilateral solutions. \tStrengthened EU governance to ensure EU financial support increases implementation by member states of growth and employment-enhancing structural reforms and upward convergence.* This paragraph is

Ministers and the Council meeting next week to approve the European Commission\u2019s proposal for a \u20ac100 billion \u2018SURE\u2019 scheme to support short-term work and other measures to protect jobs and wages during the coronavirus crisis.The ETUC calls on Member States to swiftly put at the disposal of the European Commission the necessary guarantees to make the scheme operational as soon as possible!The ETUC welcomes the efforts put in place by the European Commission to launch \u2018SURE\u2019 and asks that clear guidelines are issued as soon as possible to recommend Member States to establish short-time work or similar schemes in every country, to ensure they cover all workers and companies, and that social partners are involved in their design and implementation.\u201cA scheme like SURE is urgently needed to prevent mass unemployment and a deep recession\u201d said Luca Visentini, ETUC General Secretary. \u201cTrade unions urge the Eurogroup and the Council to agree SURE and to make it operational immediately. More jobs are being lost every day and ambitious measures to prevent job losses and protect wages cannot wait.\u201d\u201cThe benefit of having the Commission raising money in the markets to finance it is that it will apply to all EU countries and does not come with counter-productive conditions of the kind that did so much damage to Greece and the other countries affected by the Troika after the last crisis.\u201cIt is very important that all Member States establish short-time work or similar schemes with support of SURE, and that they ensure such schemes cover all workers and companies, and that social partners are involved in their design and implementation.\u00a0\u201cPutting SURE in place should not mean that plans for a European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme are abandoned. A permanent scheme is still needed to protect the Euro area from future crises.\u201d                                                                        02.04.2020                        Press release              In              Economic  and Social Cohesion,           Economic and Social crisis,           Employment / Labour Market Policy                      \u00a0Print                                \t   Facebook share   \t   Twitter   \t   LinkedIn                                                                                                                                                                           Browse                          \t                News              \t                Documents              \t                Publications              \t                Campaigns              \t                About us              \t                Call for tender              \t                Communication Department              \t                Jobs              \t                Privacy                                                  About us                                      The ETUC is the voice of workers and represents 45 million members from 90\u00a0trade union organisations in 38\u00a0European countries, plus 10 European Trade Union Federations.
