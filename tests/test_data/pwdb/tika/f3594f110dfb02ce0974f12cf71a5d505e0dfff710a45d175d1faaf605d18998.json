This might include (but will not be limited to) recently retired professionals and students who are near the end of their training. Registered staff can then be used appropriately, with decisions made on a local basis, to increase the available health and social care workforce and enable essential health and care services to function during the height of the epidemic;\r* enable regulators to temporarily add social workers to their registers who may have recently left the profession. This will ensure vital continuity of care for vulnerable children and adults;\r* enable employees and workers to take Emergency Volunteer Leave in blocks of 2, 3 or 4 weeks\u2019 statutory unpaid leave and establish a UK-wide compensation fund to compensate for loss of earnings and expenses incurred at a flat rate for those who volunteer through an appropriate authority. This will ensure that volunteers do not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of performing a public good. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of health and social care services and are particularly important in caring for the most vulnerable in our society, such as the elderly, those with multiple long-term conditions or those suffering from mental ill-health;\r* provide indemnity for clinical negligence liabilities arising from NHS activities carried out for the purposes of dealing with, or because of, the coronavirus outbreak, where there is no existing indemnity arrangement in place. This will ensure that those providing healthcare service activity across the UK are legally protected for the work they are required to undertake as part of the COVID-19 response. This is in line with and will complement existing arrangements; \r* suspend the rule that currently prevents some NHS staff who return to work after retirement from working more than 16 hours per week, along with rules on abatements and drawn-down of NHS pensions that apply to certain retirees who return to work.

Those officers nearing thirty years' pensionable service have also been asked to delay retirement. The request came as\u00a0one in five police officers were off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus.\u00a0 The Met, which is Britain\u2019s biggest force, is already understood to be experiencing absentee rates of 20%.

This already high figure comes before London hits its peak, with officers and staff missing because they have contracted the virus or are having to self-isolate.Absentee rates for other forces is averaging about 10%, and is predicted to rise to about 25% as the virus spreads in their areas.Enforcing the government\u2019s lockdown is adding to pressure on police numbers. Policing a lockdown was not planned for, in the organisation that forces did in the weeks before the crisis started.Under an agreement between the Fire Brigades Union and employers, firefighters have been authorised to drive ambulances to deliver medicines, and retrieve bodies.Matt Wrack, the FBU general secretary, said: \u201cMany fear the loss of life in this outbreak could be overwhelming \u2013 and firefighters, who often handle terrible situations and incidents, are ready to step in to assist with body retrieval.\u201dIn London, the area worst hit by the virus, retired police and ambulance workers are also being asked to return to work to relieve pressure on the overstretched emergency services.Both the Metropolitan police and the London ambulance service have appealed for former staff to return. The Metropolitan police said its officers were being asked to return for up to six months.The ambulance service tweeted: \u201cWe are asking former members of our team to consider returning, if they can, to support us in helping Londoners in need. We\u2019re particularly keen to hear from former 111 and 999 control room team staff.\u201dThe Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, is to write to all officers who retired within the past five years to ask them to rejoin either in a paid or voluntary capacity. Serving officers who are nearing 30 years\u2019 pensionable service are also being asked to delay their retirement.Wrack said: \u201cWe face a public health crisis unparalleled in our lifetimes. The coronavirus outbreak is now a humanitarian emergency and firefighters rightly want to help their communities.\u201dSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cFirefighters are clearly keen to do whatever they can to help in the situation.\u201dWrack added there was a \u201cneed to protect core functions\u201d of the fire service while firefighters may be asked to take on additional roles.He said: \u201cI think this is a huge challenge across public services and also clearly we need to ensure that firefighters and others are protected in terms of personal protective equipment because no one can do their job if their own safety is compromised.\u201dIn a statement he added: \u201cFirefighters are fantastic at teamwork, are experienced in driving emergency vehicles and, as a service rooted in the community, may be best placed to deliver essential items to the most vulnerable.\u201cFirefighters and control staff have always stepped in when the public has been in danger and this crisis is no different. The strain on all emergency services will be great, but we can and will get through it together.\u201dDick said: \u201cDemands on us will grow and vary over the coming weeks but I want people to know and see that the Met is here for them. We must maintain our operational resilience and continue to provide the best possible service to London.\u201cI am hopeful that these exceptionally experienced and knowledgeable former colleagues choose to come and be part of our team and support London at this extraordinary time \u2013 either as a re-employed police officer, special constable or a volunteer.\u201dTopics\tEmergency services\tCoronavirus\tFirefighters\tPolice\tTrade unions\tMetropolitan police\tCressida Dick\tnews\tShare on Facebook\tShare on Twitter\tShare via Email\tShare on LinkedIn\tShare on Pinterest\tShare on WhatsApp\tShare on Messenger\tReuse this contentMost popular\tUK\tUK politics\tEducation\tMedia\tSociety\tLaw\tScotland\tWales\tNorthern Ireland\tNews\tOpinion\tSport\tCulture\tLifestyle\tContact us\tComplaints & corrections\tSecureDrop\tWork for us\tPrivacy policy\tCookie policy\tTerms & conditions\tHelp\tAll topics\tAll writers\tDigital newspaper archive\tFacebook\tYouTube\tInstagram\tLinkedIn\tTwitter\tNewsletters\tAdvertise with us\tSearch UK jobsSupport The\u00a0GuardianAvailable for everyone, funded by readersContributeSubscribeBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Specifically, it detailed:\twhat we know about the virus and the disease it causes\thow we have planned for an infectious disease outbreak\twhat we are planning to do next, depending on the course the coronavirus outbreak takes\tthe role the public can play in supporting this response, now and in the futureThe plan also includes information on the government\u2019s 4-stage strategy: contain, delay, research, mitigate. It sets out advice for how the public should respond in each stage, including what to expect as the outbreak advances.It also envisaged that changes to legislation might be necessary in order to give public bodies across the UK the tools and powers they need to carry out an effective response to this emergency. This paper sets out, subject to final approvals, the elements of the bill and the reasons why they are needed.The development of an effective response to the epidemic requires a number of actions. Some of these involve the use of tools and powers that are set out in statute. The governments of the UK therefore resolved to review and where necessary amend the legislation, to ensure that the UK\u2019s response is consistent and effective.Some of the proposed changes therefore deal with easing the burden on frontline NHS and adult social care staff, some help staff by enabling them to work without financial penalty, and some support people and communities in taking care of themselves, their families and loved ones, and their wider community.The legislation will be time-limited \u2013 for 2 years \u2013 and not all of these measures will come into force immediately. The bill allows the 4 UK governments to switch on these new powers when they are needed, and, crucially, to switch them off again once they are no longer necessary, based on the advice of Chief Medical Officers of the 4 nations.The measures in the coronavirus bill are temporary, proportionate to the threat we face, will only be used when strictly necessary and be in place for as long as required to respond to the situation.We have worked closely with the devolved administrations to develop an effective package of measures to support frontline staff and individuals involved in this vital national response.Contents of the billThe bill enables action in 5 key areas:\t    increasing the available health and social care workforce \u2013 for example, by removing barriers to allow recently retired NHS staff and social workers to return to work (and in Scotland, in addition to retired people, allowing those who are on a career break or are social worker students to become temporary social workers)  \t    easing the burden on frontline staff \u2013 by reducing the number of administrative tasks they have to perform, enabling local authorities to prioritise care for people with the most pressing needs, allowing key workers to perform more tasks remotely and with less paperwork, and taking the power to suspend individual port operations  \t    containing and slowing the virus \u2013 by reducing unnecessary social contacts, for example through powers over events and gatherings, and strengthening the quarantine powers of police and immigration officers  \t    managing the deceased with respect and dignity \u2013 by enabling the death management system to deal with increased demand for its services  \t    supporting people \u2013 by allowing them to claim Statutory Sick Pay from day one, and by supporting the food industry to maintain supplies  The proposals set out in the bill will significantly enhance the ability of public bodies across the UK to provide an effective response to tackle this epidemic. We are therefore aiming for it to reach the statute book and begin to take effect from the end of this month. However, the provisions relating to Statutory Sick Pay are intended to have retrospective effect to 13 March.Increasing the available health and social care workforceAlthough we are implementing measures to save lives through delaying and flattening the peak of the epidemic, it is clear that the next few months will present a significant level of challenge for the NHS and anyone working in caring professions. As in all sectors, there will be pressures from increased staff absence, if staff are unwell or self-isolating with their households.In addition to this, there will be increased numbers of people becoming ill with COVID-19 and some of these people will require medical treatment or need to be admitted to hospital. These additional patient volumes will place pressure on our NHS. To ensure the best possible level of care is provided to those most in need, we may need to take measures to increase the available health and social care workforce and reduce the number of admin tasks they have to perform so they have more time to spend with patients.To support this, the bill seeks to:\t    enable regulators to emergency register suitable people as regulated healthcare professionals, such as nurses, midwives or paramedics. This might include (but will not be limited to) recently retired professionals and students who are near the end of their training. Registered staff can then be used appropriately, with decisions made on a local basis, to increase the available health and social care workforce and enable essential health and care services to function during the height of the epidemic  \t    enable regulators to temporarily add social workers to their registers who may have recently left the profession. This will ensure vital continuity of care for vulnerable children and adults  \t    enable employees and workers to take Emergency Volunteer Leave in blocks of 2, 3 or 4 weeks\u2019 statutory unpaid leave and establish a UK-wide compensation fund to compensate for loss of earnings and expenses incurred at a flat rate for those who volunteer through an appropriate authority. This will ensure that volunteers do not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of performing a public good. Volunteers play a critical role in the delivery of health and social care services and are particularly important in caring for the most vulnerable in our society, such as the elderly, those with multiple long-term conditions or those suffering from mental ill-health  \t    provide indemnity for clinical negligence liabilities arising from NHS activities carried out for the purposes of dealing with, or because of, the coronavirus outbreak, where there is no existing indemnity arrangement in place. This will ensure that those providing healthcare service activity across the UK are legally protected for the work they are required to undertake as part of the COVID-19 response. This is in line with and will complement existing arrangements  \t    suspend the rule that currently prevents some NHS staff who return to work after retirement from working more than 16 hours per week, along with rules on abatements and drawn-down of NHS pensions that apply to certain retirees who return to work. This will allow skilled and experienced staff who have recently retired from the NHS to return to work, and also allow retired staff who have already returned to work to increase their commitments if required, without having their pension benefits suspended  Easing the burden on frontline staff, both within the NHS and beyondIn the NHS and in other sectors who undertake activities that are vital to keeping the country running safely and securely, we may also face particular increased pressures as a result of staff absence or increased work volumes. This could include those caring for children or in education, protecting our borders, detaining and treating people under the Mental Health Act, supporting local authorities and ensuring national security. By reducing the number of admin tasks they have to perform, allowing key workers to perform more tasks remotely and with less paperwork, we will enable these crucial services to continue to operate effectively during periods of reduced staffing.To support this the bill seeks to:\t    enable existing mental health legislation powers to detain and treat patients who need urgent treatment for a mental health disorder and are a risk to themselves or others, to be implemented using just one doctor\u2019s opinion (rather than the current 2). This will ensure that those who were a risk to themselves or others would still get the treatment they need, when fewer doctors are available to undertake this function  \t    temporarily allow extension or removal of time limits in mental health legislation to allow for greater flexibility where services are less able to respond. These temporary changes would be brought in only in the instance that staff numbers were severely adversely affected during the pandemic period and provide some flexibility to help support the continued safe running of services under the Mental Health Act  \t    allow NHS providers to delay undertaking the assessment process for NHS continuing healthcare for individuals being discharged from hospital until after the emergency period has ended  \t    make changes to the Care Act 2014 in England and the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 to enable local authorities to prioritise the services they offer in order to ensure the most urgent and serious care needs are met, even if this means not meeting everyone\u2019s assessed needs in full or delaying some assessments. During a pandemic, a lot of people who work in health and social care could be off sick or may need to care for loved ones. This could mean that local authorities, which are responsible for social care, may not be able to do all the things they are usually required to do  Local authorities will still be expected to do as much as they can to comply with their duties to meet needs during this period and these amendments would not remove the duty of care they have towards an individual\u2019s risk of serious neglect or harm.These powers would only be used if demand pressures and workforce illness during the pandemic meant that local authorities were at imminent risk of failing to fulfil their duties and only last the duration of the emergency. It would ensure that local authorities will continue to be able to deliver the best possible care services during the peak and to protect the lives of the most vulnerable members of society.\t    temporarily relax local authorities\u2019 duties in relation to their duties to conduct a needs assessment and prepare an adult carer support plan/young care statement under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013 and the Carers (Scotland) Act 2016 to enable them to prioritise people with the greatest needs  \t    provide powers to require educational institutions or childcare providers to stay open or relax some requirements around education legislation in order to help these institutions run effectively during the event of an emergency. This could include reducing teacher ratios, adapting school meal standards and relaxing provisions for those with special educational needs. This will ensure that children, young people and those who work with them remain safe, while minimising disruption to everyday life and progression to further and higher education or employment by ensuring schools have the flexibility and support they need to respond pragmatically to the changing situation  \t    enable the Home Secretary to request that port and airport operators temporarily close and suspend operations if Border Force staff shortages result in a real and significant threat to the UK\u2019s border security. This is to ensure the UK can maintain adequate border security throughout the pandemic and protect the public from the threat of criminality or importation of prohibited items that could result from an inadequately controlled border. This would only be used in extremis, where necessary and proportionate, and any direction will be kept to the minimum period necessary to maintain the security of the UK border  \t    expand availability of video and audio link in court proceedings. This would include magistrates\u2019 court hearings taking place by phone or by video, should an individual appeal restriction of movement due to quarantine measures. This will ensure that an appeal takes place but will not require a person to break quarantine in order to attend in person.  It will also enable the expansion of the availability of video and audio link in various criminal proceedings, including full video and audio hearings in certain circumstances, and public participation in relation to these and other court and tribunal proceedings conducted by audio and video. The measures will enable a wider range of proceedings to be carried out by video, so that courts can continue to function and remain open to the public, without the need for participants to attend in person. This will give judges more options for avoiding adjournments and keeping business moving through the courts to help reduce delays in the administration of justice and alleviate the impact on families, victims, witnesses and defendants  \t    ensure that the Treasury can transact its business at all times, by making it possible for a single commissioner or a single Treasury minister to sign instruments and act on behalf of the commissioners, during a COVID-19 emergency period. Under current rules, where any instrument or act is required to be signed by the Commissioners of Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury, it must be signed by 2 or more of the commissioners. This change will ensure that the Treasury can transact its business at all times during a COVID-19 emergency period, should commissioners be unable to fulfil their duty  \t    allow temporary judicial commissioners (JCs) to be appointed at the request of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, in the event that there are insufficient JCs available to operate the system under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. This is the one of the critical pieces of domestic legislation for national security. It creates the statutory basis for the use of the investigatory powers by the intelligence and law enforcement agencies, using warrants issued under the act. These warrants provide the agencies with the capability they need to protect national security and investigate and prevent serious crime. The Home Secretary, again at the request of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, will also be allowed to vary the time allowed for urgent warrants to be reviewed by a JC and how long they can last before they need to be reviewed. The maximum time allowed for a review will be increased to a maximum of 12 days (up from the current 3 days). Maintaining national security capabilities at a time of potential widespread upheaval is critical and it is necessary to ensure that the powers to vary specific aspects of the regime are available to the government should they be deemed necessary, for example if there are fewer JCs available than usual.  Delaying and slowing the virusThe government\u2019s objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time, so that we minimise suffering and save lives. To slow the virus, we will need people to reduce unnecessary social contacts, which, for periods of time, may mean preventing gatherings of people, postponing electoral events over the course of the year or closing schools, further or high education premises or childcare providers. This will help mitigate the risk to public health arising from such mass gatherings.This will happen only where necessary, to help minimise disruption to everyday life and progression of children and young people to further and higher education or employment. The measures would only be put in place for the period of time required to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.To support this, the bill seeks to:\t    enable the government to restrict or prohibit events and gatherings during the pandemic in any place, vehicle, train, vessel or aircraft, any movable structure and any offshore installation and, where necessary, to close premises  \t    provide a temporary power to close educational establishments or childcare providers  \t    postpone the local, mayoral and Police and Crime Commissioner elections that were due to take place in England in May this year until May 2021. Provision will also be made to postpone other electoral events over the course of the year (such as by-elections)  It\u2019s also important that all UK countries have equivalent legal measures in place to delay or prevent further transmission of the virus, to ensure consistency across the whole UK. For example, removing a current restriction in how Scottish territorial Health Boards can deliver vaccination programmes would mean that, when a vaccine becomes available, it can reach as many people as possible. To support this, the bill seeks to:\t    enable the departments of health in Northern Ireland and Scotland to make regulations for additional measures to be introduced to help them delay or prevent further transmission of COVID-19. Equivalent powers already exist in England and Wales and these provisions would bring them in line with the rest of the UK  \t    remove a restriction in how Scottish territorial Health Boards can deliver vaccination programmes so a wider range of healthcare professionals in Scotland would be able to administer a vaccine.  Public support and compliance is crucial and we are grateful for the flexibility people have shown, but we need to ensure police and immigration officers have the authority to enforce these measures where necessary.  Therefore, the bill will enable the police and immigration officers to detain a person, for a limited period, who is, or may be, infectious and to take them to a suitable place to enable screening and assessment.Managing the deceased with respect and dignityThe steps the government is taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic will save lives. However, sadly, as has already been seen, people will lose loved ones as a result of this disease. We want to ensure the deceased are treated with the utmost respect and dignity and that the current procedures in relation to death and still-birth registration and management are modified to enable this and to protect public health. This will take account of the fact that families who have lost a loved one may be self-isolating, and that there may be reduced capacity to register and manage deaths as a result of pandemic-related sickness absence.The bill intends to make changes to:\t    mean a coroner is only to be notified where a doctor believes there is no medical practitioner who may sign the death certificate, or that they are not available within a reasonable time of the death  \t    introduce powers to enable the provisions under the Burial and Cremation (Scotland) Act 2016 relating to the collection of ashes to be suspended and replaced with a duty to retain until the suspension is lifted, except where family wishes are known. Also, suspend an offence in section 49 of the 2016 Act, allowing any relative of the deceased to complete the cremation application form, regardless of the required hierarchy set out by section 65 of the 2016 Act  \t    expand the list of people who can register a death to include funeral directors acting on behalf of the family  \t    enable electronic transmission of documents that currently have to be physically presented in order to certify the registration of a death  \t    remove the need for a second confirmatory medical certificate in order for a cremation to take place  \t    remove the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 requirement that any inquest into a COVID-19 death must be held with a jury. Other notifiable diseases will still require an inquest with a jury  \t    suspend the referral of certificates to the Death Certification Review Service (DCRS) for review in Scotland under the Certification of Death (Scotland) Act 2011. The timing of the suspension to be at the discretion of Scottish ministers  If the scientific advice indicates that the number of people who might die from COVID-19 is likely to significantly exceed the capacity locally to manage the deceased and other contingency measures have been deployed, local government will have the ability to take control of a component or components of the death management process in their area.For example, local authorities may choose to direct local actors such as funeral directors, mortuaries owners, crematoriums owners and others, to streamline the death management process. This may include an increase in the operating times of crematoriums, directing companies to use their vehicles to move bodies, or directing others not directly involved in the funeral sector, to provide necessary support.Only in the most extreme situations where there is a risk to public health would the powers of direction be used and only be used when scientific evidence and operational advice suggests that it is necessary. Activating the powers will ensure the local death management system continues to work effectively to protect public health and the dignity of the deceased. Personal choice will be respected as far as possible, especially in regard to how we handle loved ones after they have passed.Protecting and supporting peopleWe are asking people to stay at home if they have a high temperature or a new and continuous cough, or if anyone in their household has one of those 2 symptoms. In the event of a wider outbreak of COVID-19, the number of people that would be off work would increase significantly. This would include those that were displaying-virus like symptoms and those who were self-isolating as a precautionary measure.We want to ensure the Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) provisions support people in complying with this request and that they have retrospective effect from 13 March 2020. By ensuring that people receive SSP from the first day that they are off work, we will ensure that those who are unwell or have been instructed to self-isolate can do so without the fear of losing pay. This will be an important measure in the event of a severe outbreak. By refunding small businesses, we hope to alleviate the significant financial burden on employers through increased SSP costs.The bill is therefore seeking to:\t    give the government the power to temporarily suspend the rule that means SSP is not paid for the first 3 days of work that you miss because of sickness. These days are known as waiting days. Lifting this rule will enable us to respond quickly to an outbreak  \t    enable employers with fewer than 250 employees to reclaim SSP paid for sickness absences relating to coronavirus during the period of the outbreak. This is because the government wants to ensure that businesses are supported to deal with the temporary economic impacts of an outbreak of coronavirus  \t    require industry to provide information about food supplies, in the event that an industry partner does not co-operate with our current voluntary information-sharing arrangements during a period of potential disruption                            Contents              Print this page                      Is this page useful?

Joining clinical practice during the pandemic and beyond                                            The GMC granted temporary registration to additional doctors under its emergency powers, so that they are able to help with the coronavirus pandemic. This included:\t15,500 doctors who had given up their registration or licence to practise within the last three years\tnearly 6,800 doctors with a UK address who gave up their registration between three and six years ago\ta further 12,000 doctors with a UK address who are GMC registered, but who do not currently hold a licence to practise.\u00a0Approximately 28,000 of these doctors chose to remain on the register.Returning to work in the NHS in the pandemic is entirely up to you. If you do not opt out:\tyou will be asked to complete a short survey to help determine your skills and how you can assist the health service\tyou will remain on the medical register for the duration of the emergency and will be informed when your registration comes to an end\tyou won\u2019t be charged to re-join the medical register\tyou will be granted a licence to practice at no extra charge (if you have left the NHS in the last three years)\u00a0\tyou won\u2019t need to revalidate during your temporary registration.Further information about temporary registration and licences is available from the GMC.The GMC will have shared your details with the health service in the country of your registered address (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales). You should have been contacted by your health service and consulted on potential return most recently in autumn or winter 2020.Secondary care doctors may find it useful to read the BMA\u2019s general advice for returning to clinical practice.GPs may find it useful to read the BMA\u2019s return to practice and GP international programmes and GP retention scheme guidance.VolunteeringIf you haven\u2019t been contacted yet, you can email the GMC at\u202f[email\u00a0protected]\u202for call them on 0161 923 6602. You can let them know that you would like to be added back onto the medical register and/or granted a licence to practice, and confirm your contact details and former branch of practice.\u202fThe GMC will confirm whether you are eligible to return to the emergency register.

They must also ensure you are either fully vaccinated before beginning work or you are set up to work remotely.You should also ensure that you are offered a contract of employment and the level of pay is reflective of your skills, the work you are undertaking and your experience. Please use the BMA contract checking service.Medical support workersThe medical support worker role is suitable for those who have a medical qualification but have been out of clinical practice for over a year and need to work under clinical supervision.It is also suitable for those who do not yet have GMC registration, eg international medical graduates or refugee doctors currently living in the UK.It is likely that some doctors employed as medical support workers may then be suitable to convert into long-term employees who progress their medical careers in the NHS.View NHS England guidance and apply.

If you have recently obtained or maintained one, a new certificate may not be necessary.\u00a0Your pay and contract\u00a0If you are returning to work in a medical role in secondary care you will be paid on the appropriate contract for the role you are fulfilling providing you return to the same responsibility.If you want to return to a more junior role than the role you retired from, you should be paid at the top of the pay scale in the more junior role.See more guidance from NHS Employers on terms and conditions for hospital doctors during COVID-19 in England.If you are returning to general practice, the BMA believes you should be offered terms no less favourable than the model contract for salaried GPs. There is no pay scale for salaried GPs. You must ensure your salary reflects your level of responsibility, experience and qualifications.

They have also suspended rules on abatement and draw down of NHS pensions that apply to certain retirees who return to work. This is to allow skilled and experienced staff who have recently retired from the NHS to return to work, and also allow retired staff who have already returned to work to increase their commitments if required, without having their pension benefits suspended.Death in service coverIn EnglandIn England the Government announced a life assurance scheme for frontline health and care staff during the pandemic. Families of eligible workers who die from coronavirus in the course of their frontline work will receive a \u00a360,000 payment. This will be separate to the death in service benefits within the NHS pension scheme. Read our guidance on how the life assurance scheme works.In WalesWales has a life assurance scheme similar to the England scheme.In ScotlandScotland announced that all staff affected by COVID-19 as a result of providing frontline treatment for COVID-19 patients will receive the full lump sum and survivor\u2019s pension benefits available under the terms of the NHS pension scheme. This includes both permanent and fixed-term staff who are not members of the pension scheme, NHS bank and locum staff. Read more from Scottish Government.In Northern Ireland\u00a0The Health and Social Care Coronavirus Life Assurance SchemeThe HSC Coronavirus Life Assurance Scheme means that in the event of a staff member dying due to COVID-19, a lump sum payment of \u00a360,000 will be made to their estate, if they meet the qualifying work-related criteria for the scheme. The scheme is non-contributory, meaning there is no cost to staff or employers.The new scheme is independent of the HSC Pension Scheme. Any lump sum or pension benefits payable to the relatives or dependents of HSC Pension Scheme members will continue to be processed and paid as before.The HSC Pension Scheme entitlements\u00a0If you die within five years of retirement, a balancing lump sum payment will be payable to your dependents, as well as a spouse\u2019s pension, equal to the lesser of:\t5 x pension less pension already paid or\t2 x actual annual pensionable salary at retirement less any retirement lump sum claimed (for primary care doctors annual salary means is the average annual dynamised remuneration at retirement).See more information on death in service benefits from NHS Employers.More information about your pension is available from the BMA.

Similar levels of cover are being provided in the devolved nations.This state indemnity will ensure that you and your employer are protected against clinical negligence claims for the work you undertake as part of the COVID-19 response and to support efforts to reduce the backlog of non-COVID care.You are also strongly advised to contact your previous medical defence organisation to ensure you have adequate professional (non-clinical negligence) indemnity cover for the role you will be undertaking.\u00a0                                                The type of work you can perform                                            Vaccination programmeMany existing and former members of the NHS workforce can be involved in the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination programme.Registered healthcare professionals will need to carry out the clinical assessment and secure patient consent, but a suitably trained non-registered member of staff can administer the vaccine itself under clinical supervision.Former NHS doctors who were 'registered without license to practise' by the GMC at the start of the pandemic can also get involved unless they actively opted out. A recent amendment to the law also means former NHS doctors in England do not need to be on the national performers list to support the vaccination effort either.You must not, however, work beyond the remit of one of the three national vaccinator roles, unless you have obtained a GMC licence to practise and have been added to the national performers list.If you do so, neither you nor the practice or vaccination site will be indemnified through the clinical negligence scheme for general practice.Read our guidance on COVID-19 vaccination programme extra workforce for more details.Other NHS workTraining authorities and employing organisations will determine the range of work you can do based on your skills and experience.For example, an NHS employing organisation will make sure anyone asked to supervise others is adequately trained and competent to do so.Your training requirements will be assessed based on what is being asked of you, your experience and skills, and how long you have been out of practice.\u202fEmployers must ensure all statutory competence checks take place before you can work.The type of work you may be able to undertake will vary and some work will carry more risk, for example you may be needed to work in:\tpatient-facing roles, including remote consultations\tnon-patient facing roles such as drug management tasks, lab results etc\ttriage support in call centres / NHS111.Once you are back on the medical register there will be no legal barrier to you undertaking training or supervisory roles as long as these are to assist with the pandemic. GMC guidance includes backfilling for staff redeployed to treat COVID-19 patients and working in services to clear backlogs caused by the pandemic.Your employer must make sure that you have the support and training you need to practice safely.\u202f\u202fYour employer must make sure that adequate support is given to your supervising doctor(s) to manage their additional workload.GPs working for CCASNHSEI has been employing returning GPs on a standard contract with the CCAS (COVID clinical advice service). Some GPs have then been utilised by local practices.The standard contract being used does not mirror the standard salaried GP contract, and we do not consider it to provide appropriate rates of pay or conditions.For support on contractual matters please contact [email\u00a0protected].Working outside your specialtyIt is reasonable for you to be asked to work outside your specialty. However, you should work within your competence.\u00a0                                                Your health and wellbeing                                            Your employer should particularly bear in mind those who are at higher risk of illness and consider whether it would be more appropriate for them to be deployed in low-risk settings.\u00a0Your employer should undertake an individual risk assessment with you before starting work. The outcome of the risk assessment will help to determine the type of work you might do.If you have underlying long-term health conditions, you should let your line manager know if there is a worsening of your condition, as it might put you at greater risk.

Many firms are warning of collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is largely put on hold.One proposal under discussion is for the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Denmark, where the government has promised to cover 75% of salaries at private companies for three months, if they promise not to let staff go.In the UK, 144 people with the virus have died, and 3,269 people have tested positive for Covid-19.\tEASY STEPS: How to keep safe\tA SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?\tGETTING READY: How prepared is the UK?\tPUBLIC TRANSPORT: What's the risk?Schools in the UK will close from Friday except for those looking after the children of key workers and vulnerable children.Among those workers listed in government guidance as critical to the virus response are health workers, teaching staff, police and people working in the production and delivery of vital goods such as food and medical equipment. Children with at least one parent working in the listed sectors can continue to attend school but the government is asking parents to keep their children at home wherever possible. Who are \"key workers\"?The full list includes:\tFrontline health workers such as doctors and nurses\tSome teachers and social workers\tWorkers in key public services including those essential to the justice system, religious staff, and public service journalists\tLocal and national government workers deemed crucial to delivering essential public services\tWorkers involved in food production processing, distribution, sale and delivery\tPublic safety workers including police, armed forces personnel, firefighters, and prison staff\tEssential air, water, road and rail transport workers\tUtilities, communication and financial services staff, including postal workers, and waste disposal workersIt comes as England's top nurse and top doctor urged medics who have left the NHS in the last three years to re-register with the regulatory bodies to help in the battle against the \"greatest global health threat in history\".Final-year medical students and student nurses could also be given temporary work to boost the ranks.Those who return will be assessed to see how they can best help the NHS fight the pandemic.Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: \"I am urging all recent former nurses to lend us your expertise and experience during this pandemic, because I have no doubt that you can help to save lives.\"Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS, said returners \"will make more of a difference than ever before - not just to patients, but to colleagues and the wider community\".The Nursing and Midwifery Council will write to 50,000 nurses whose registration has lapsed in the last three years; and the General Medical Council will contact another 15,500 doctors who have left since 2017.Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he hoped \"many, many thousands will respond\" to the letters.Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, a former nurse, has said she will swap Westminster for the hospital ward - tweeting that it is \"important we all help where we can\".Others, such as retired NHS nurse Carolyn Shepherd from Bristol, have expressed concern.She said she had seen \"excellent staff on their knees due to the unrelenting excessive workload\" during her career.She told BBC News she would answer calls on the 111 helpline but added: \"I don't think they'll persuade me back to the front line\".\"I've got family commitments and grandchildren. My GP colleagues are incandescent at their lack of equipment. That doesn't inspire me either.\"\"For 40 years I sacrificed a lot for the NHS but I am not prepared to go one step further and possibly sacrifice myself,\" she added.image captionCarolyn Shepherd told BBC News she felt \"very out of date\" after leaving nursing in late 2017 and would feel \"unsafe\" treating patients nowAsked when the those who would return could start, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast those who left most recently could return \"straight away\", while others will be given refresher training \"over the next couple of weeks\".He also pledged to get protective personal equipment (PPE) to frontline NHS staff and social care providers \"at pace\", following concern workers were being put at risk by shortages.Mr Hancock said 150 lorries had been dispatched overnight to get the equipment to about half the UK's hospitals, and pledged a lorry load would be sent to each before next week.He said more equipment had been sent to GPs and to pharmacists, and a roll out to care homes had also begun.media captionWhat is social distancing?Speaking directly to NHS staff, he said: \"I totally understand that you need protective equipment... because you're literally on the frontline in what we've rightly called a war\".It comes after the government pledged to reach 25,000 tests a day in hospitals within four weeks, and said it had shipped 2.6 million masks and 10,000 bottles of hand sanitiser since Wednesday.\tWhen will the coronavirus outbreak end?\tHow long could schools be closed?\tCalifornia issues 'stay at home' order amid virus\tIsle of Man confirms first coronavirus caseMeanwhile, Mr Hancock said the government appeal for manufacturers to make ventilators had received \"thousands\" of responses, including from Formula One.Asked how many were needed, he said \"no number is too big\". He added that the specifications for making them had now been published online and urged firms to \"get on and start making them\".The government has bought a test that can detect whether someone has had coronavirus - and their immunity to it, he confirmed.He also repeated appeals for people to stop panic-buying after many supermarkets began limiting the number of items that can be bought and reserved certain opening hours for the elderly and vulnerable.media captionCritical care nurse Dawn was driven to despair by the actions of panic-buyersIt comes as an exhausted critical care nurse made an emotional appeal for people to leave some goods for others who need to stay healthy to carry to support the country.Responding to Dawn Bilbrough's video, Mr Hancock suggested supermarkets could consider dedicating a specific hour to key workers.Elsewhere, in a message to the nation on Thursday the Queen urged people to come together for the common good.The 93-year-old praised the work of scientists, medics and emergency staff, but added that everyone has a \"vitally important part to play\".The monarch's comments came shortly before the PM led the government's daily press conference, saying the UK can \"turn the tide\" on the coronavirus crisis within 12 weeks.But pressed on what he meant by the three-month timescale, he said he did not know how long it would go on for.Mr Johnson went on to rule out closing down public transport in London but pointed out people in some parts of the capital were not following government guidance on social distancing and would be \"enforced\" to do so if necessary.In other key developments in the UK:\tTrials of a coronavirus vaccine could begin within the next month, Public Health England has said\tMilitary leaders have been told by the head of the armed forces to be ready by the middle of next month to help respond to the pandemic, in guidance seen by the BBC\tMinisters are asking phone operators if they can use mobile data to help monitor whether people  are following social distancing advice\tTrain operators across Britain will gradually reduce services from Monday\tJaguar Land Rover, is to join Nissan and Vauxhall in suspending production at its UK plants\tThe Bank of England has cut interest rates from 0.25% to 0.1% - the lowest level in its history.\tThe Catholic Church in Britain will suspend public masses from Friday evening until further noticeIn other key developments around the world:\tItaly's death toll rose by 427 to 3,405, overtaking China's toll\tArgentina has become the latest country in South America to ban all citizens from leaving their homes except to buy food and medicines\tAn estimated 400 British nationals are among those stranded in Peru, after the country closed its borders and flights were suspended\tCalifornia, the most populous US state, has issued a \"stay at home\" order to residents\tGlobally, the number of confirmed cases has passed 220,000, with more than 9,000 deathsDo you work in healthcare?
