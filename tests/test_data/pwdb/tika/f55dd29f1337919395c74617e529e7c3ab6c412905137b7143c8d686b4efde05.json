Section 39 is the relevant regulation (which amends The Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992); this section gives the\u00a0Secretary of State the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.Regulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.\r", "content_of_measure_description": "In Budget 2020, the UK Government\u00a0announced that\u00a0Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees would be met in full for up to 14 days per employee. The Chancellor estimates that this will cost up to GBP 2 billion and help up to 2 million businesses. In its factsheet on government support for those affected by Covid-19, HM Treasury said that the eligibility criteria for the scheme would be as follows:\r\r* this refund will cover up to 2 weeks\u2019 SSP per eligible employee who has been off work because of COVID-19;\r* employers with fewer than 250 employees will be eligible;\u00a0the size of an employer will be determined by the number of people they employed as of 28 February 2020;\r* employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19;\r* employers should maintain records of staff absences, but employees will not need to provide a GP fit note;\r* eligible period for the scheme will commence the day after the regulations on the extension of Statutory Sick Pay to self-isolators comes into force;\r\u2022 the government will work with employers over the coming months to set up the repayment mechanism for employers as soon as possible. Existing systems are not designed to facilitate employer refunds for SSP47.\r\rSSP is the minimum that employers have to pay out to qualifying sick employees. It is currently paid at GBP 94.25 per week (GBP 95.85 from 6 April 2020) and can be paid for up to 28 weeks. In order to\u00a0qualify for SSP, an\u00a0employee\u2019s average weekly earnings must be above GBP 118 (GBP 120 from 6 April 2020). Some employers may pay enhanced sick pay over and above the SSP rate. This would be detailed in an employment contract. The self-employed are not eligible for SSP. \r\rThe Statutory Sick Pay (General) (Coronavirus Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/287) came into force on 13 March 2020. These Regulations (as amended) make it clear in law that employees are entitled to SSP if they are unable to work because they are self-isolating as a result of them or someone in their household showing symptoms of coronavirus.\u00a0 Normally, SSP is paid from the fourth day of absence. However, on the\u00a028 March, the Government made the Statutory Sick Pay (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Waiting Days and General Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/374). These provide that SSP is payable from the first day of absence where a worker is self-isolating because they or someone in their household has shown symptoms of coronavirus. The Regulations have retrospective from 13 March 2020.\rUnder the Coronavirus Act 2020, the Secretary of State has the power to make regulations to allow businesses to reclaim SSP payments from the Government for absences related to coronavirus. The Explanatory Notes say that if it is necessary, regulations could be made to allow larger employers to reclaim the costs of SSP as well.\r\rRegulations on the SSP rebate have not yet been made. However, on 3 April 2020 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) published guidance on a forthcoming Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme.\r\rThe guidance says that employers will be covered in the following circumstances: If employers are:\u00a0\r\r* claiming for an employee who\u2019s eligible for sick pay due to coronavirus\r* had a PAYE payroll scheme that was created and started on or before 28 February 2020\r* had fewer than 250 employees on 28 February 2020.\r\rThe scheme covers all types of employment contracts, including:\r* full-time employees\r* part-time employees\r* employees on agency contracts\r* employees on flexible or zero-hour contracts.\r", "use_of_measure_description": "Uptake currently unknown as there is no data available at this stage.

This means they will receive repayments at the relevant rate of SSP that they have paid to current or former employees for eligible periods of sickness starting on or after 13 March 2020.Tax agents will also be able to make claims on behalf of employers.To prepare to make their claim, employers should keep records of all the SSP payments that they wish to claim from HMRC. You can read further guidance on checking whether you can claim back SSP paid to employees due to coronavirus (COVID-19) on GOV.UK.Secretary of State for the Department of Work and Pensions, Therese Coffey, said:  We are committed to supporting Britain\u2019s small and medium businesses through this pandemic with a comprehensive package of support.  This rebate will put money back in the pockets of millions of employers, ensuring they can hit the ground running as the economy re-opens.Angela MacDonald, HMRC\u2019s Director General of Customer Services, said:  Our teams have worked hard to deliver this scheme for employers and their employees to ensure they get the support they need. We want employers to be secure in the knowledge they will receive help as they care for their staff during this difficult period.Employers are eligible if they have a PAYE payroll scheme that was created and started before 28 February 2020 and they had fewer than 250 employees before the same date.The repayment will cover up to 2 weeks of SSP and is payable if an employee is unable to work because they:\thave coronavirus; or\tare self-isolating and unable to work from home; or\tare shielding because they\u2019ve been advised that they\u2019re at high risk of severe illness from coronavirusFurther informationThe current rate of SSP is \u00a395.85 per week[1]. Employers can choose to go further and pay more than the statutory minimum. This is known as occupational or contractual sick pay.Where an employer pays more than the current rate of SSP in sick pay, they will only be able to reclaim the SSP rate.The scheme covers all types of employment contracts, including:\tfull-time employees\tpart-time employees\temployees on agency contracts\temployees on flexible or zero-hour contractsOther SSP eligibility criteria apply.Connected companies and charities can also use the scheme if their total combined number of PAYE employees is fewer than 250 on or before 28 February 2020. Employees do not have to provide a doctor\u2019s fit note for their employer to make a claim under the scheme.Employers can furlough their employees who have been advised to shield in line with public health guidance and are unable to work from home, under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Once furloughed, the employee should no longer receive SSP and would be classified as a furloughed employee. Where an employee has been notified to shield and has not been furloughed, the rebate will compensate up to 2 weeks of SSP from 16 April 2020.[1] For the period 13 March 2020 to 5 April 2020 the SSP rate was \u00a394.25 per week                      Share this page    \t                                                                                                                              Share on                    Facebook        \t                                                                                                                              Share on                    Twitter                    Published 19 May 2020                          Related content              \tClaim back Statutory Sick Pay paid to your employees due to coronavirus (COVID-19)\tCheck if you can claim back Statutory Sick Pay paid to employees due to coronavirus (COVID-19)\tWork out your employee's Statutory Sick Pay manually\tCoronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme: service availability and issues\tStatutory Sick Pay: employee fitness to work        Brexit  \t                    Check          \t                    Change          \t                    Go            Check what you need to do                                Explore the topic  \tFunding and support for businesses during coronavirus\tManaging your business during coronavirus                          Is this page useful?
