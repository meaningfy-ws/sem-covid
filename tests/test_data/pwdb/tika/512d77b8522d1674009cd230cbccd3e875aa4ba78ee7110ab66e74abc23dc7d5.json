Since they recognised that the COVID-19 pandemic is a tipping point for technology dissemination and the digital transformation of MET industries and workplaces.\rParticular attention was paid to the future collaboration of humans and robots in the post-COVID metal industry. Cobots (what means working in tandem with robots) have become a safe option for cooperating with workers. They are one of the major advances of recent years and contribute to a sustainable working life for employees of the MET sector. \r \r\r* The CEEMET is the European employers\u2019 organisation representing the interests of the metal, engineering and technology-based industries. Through its national member organisations it represents 200,000 companies across Europe. \r* IndustriALL European Trade Union represents 7 million workers across supply chains in manufacturing, mining and energy sectors across Europe.\r", "content_of_measure_description": "IndustriAll Europe and Ceemet have expressed their firm belief that the search for tailor-made solutions will become increasingly important as digital transformation occurs at different pace in different regions and enterprises and in the context of rapidly changing technological parameters. The social partners identified four areas where social dialogue can shape ongoing technological change for the benefit of both employers and employees.\r\r* OrganiSation of work - social partners emphasise that during the blockade due to the COVID-19 crisis, teleworking turned out to be a key tool for health and safety protection and ensuring business and work continuity.\r* Skills - In the area of the impact of digitisation on skills, according to the social partners, it is imperative to avoid a skills shortage and a massive loss of strategic know-how that could occur in a rapid digital and green economy transition, combined with large-scale restructuring plans related to COVID-19 if not managed in a strategic and socially responsible manner, and despite measures taken in many countries to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis.\r* Occupational health and safety - sensors in exoskeletons can assist workers in certain activities, such as lifting, and thus be beneficial to their health. Digital workplaces using intelligent sensors can measure noise levels in real time and set parameters to ensure compliance with health and safety standards. Nevertheless, these technologies must be used in conjunction with traditional OSH tools, such as risk assessments, to ensure worker safety.\r* Data protection - the challenge will be to find the right balance between protecting both the respective worker\u2019s personal data and the industries\u2019 international competitiveness. Involving social partners is of key importance as they are closer to the needs of their members and in a position to regularly report on the swift evolution of digitalisation in the world of work.\r", "use_of_measure_description": "Not yet available.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "Joint initiative of social partners.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "Yes", "private_or_public_sector": "Not specified", "is_occupation_specific": "No", "actors": ["EU level social partners"], "target_groups": ["Particular professions", "Sector specific set of companies"], "funding": ["No special funding required"], "sectors": ["Manufacture of basic metals", "Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment"], "occupations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://www.ceemet.org/sites/default/files/iall_-_ceemet_digitalisation_statement_09.11.2020_eng_1.pdf", "title": "The impact of digitalisation on the world of work in the\rMET industries", "content_path": "res/8c7c50ae5e5902ec373d43639e00d60bb5cd9e661b25ea3453c038c51d6efa40", "content": "404 Not Found | Ceemet - European Tech & Industry Employers\t\t        \t\t\t\tConnect\tUser\tOpen Search\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCeemet\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUser\t\t\t\t\tOpen Search\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpen menu\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClose menu\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNews\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolicy priorities\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPosition papers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPublications\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMembership\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch\t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t\t\t404 Not Found\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHome\t404 Not Found\t    \t\t\t\t\tNot found\t\t\t                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCeemet\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFacebook\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwitter\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLinkedin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBd A.

Shaping digital transformation in partnership and with a human-centred approachAn industriAll Europe & Ceemet joint statementThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerates the technology dissemination and the digital transformation of metal, engineering and tech-based industries and workplaces.  It has increased the urgency and need for social partners to find joint approaches to manage a swift and sustainable digital transformation. Ceemet and industriAll Europe have therefore renewed their shared vision of the challenges and opportunities of digitalisation for workers and employers.In the joint statement \u2018Impact of digitalisation on the world of work\u2019 the social partners identify four areas in which social dialogue can shape the ongoing technological change to the benefit of both, employers and workers:\u00a0\twork organisation\tskills\toccupational health & safety\tdata protection.Social partners have reached a growing number of collective agreements to the benefit of employees and employers. Whether the outcome is about facilitating, for instance, the access to remote work or investments in broadening the digital skills set of workers at all levels, the outcome is a win-win for both. The current COVID-19 pandemic translates into an accelerated digital transformation in the metal, engineering and tech-based industries and brought social partners closer together, showing once more that challenges can be better tackled together.A strong social dialogue as cement for societies and companiesWith digital transformation happening at a different speed across regions and companies and in a context of rapidly changing technological parameters, industriAll Europe and Ceemet express their firm believe that finding tailor-made solutions will become increasingly important.This requires strong, mandated and representative social partners that have room for manoeuvre to deal with the new challenges and bargain around emerging new issues. For the latter, Member States need to make sure that social partners can manage and shape the digital transformation of industry. This includes adapting collective bargaining to a changing world of work. The EU, on the other hand, should allocate more and easily accessible EU funds to support capacity building of social partners for an effective and well-functioning social dialogue across Europe.industriAll General Secretary\u00a0Luc Triangle states that: \u201cSector agreements create a level playing field for all companies and workers to ensure equal treatment and standards across an otherwise fragmented landscape.\u201dCeemet Director General Delphine Rudelli comments: \u201cExamples show the key role social partners play in supporting a swift and sustainable digital transformation of industry, whose relevance doubled in times of COVID-19.\u201dPress statementJoint statement 'Impact of digitalisation on the world of work': EN, DE, FRContact: Andrea Husen-Bradley (press and communication)                            DIGITALISATION    SD MET    SOCIAL DIALOGUE    CEEMET    COVID-19                                                                                                        Contact            \t        Contact Us                        \t        About us                                                    Register            \t        Terms & Conditions                        \t        Privacy Policy                        \t        Sign up for the Newsletter                        \t        Previous Newsletters                                                    Constitution            \t        Executive Committee                        \t        Congress III - 2021                        \t        Statutes                        \t        Congress II - Madrid 2016                        \t        Congress i - Brussels 2012                                                    Archive            \t        Admin Login                        \t        Secretariat (legacy)                                                                                            Copyright \u00a9 2021 IndustriAll - design & development by CrunchLab                                            "}]}
