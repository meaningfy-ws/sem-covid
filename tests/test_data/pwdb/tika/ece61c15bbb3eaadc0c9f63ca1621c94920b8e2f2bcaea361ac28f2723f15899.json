The T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar TD, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath TD and the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Catherine Martin TD brought forward the package, which received Government approval this afternoon. The measures include:Topped up Restart GrantEligible businesses will now be entitled to a 20% top-up, bringing the new minimum for affected counties to \u20ac4,800 and the new maximum to \u20ac30,000. Those that applied and received a grant previously, can re-apply and receive a second grant, with 20% additional on the new rate.Prioritised Applications \u20ac1m is being ring-fenced for the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in the three counties to increase engagement with local businesses to ensure they are aware of the loans, grants and vouchers they are entitled to. Applications from affected counties will be prioritised for all existing schemes, including the Sustaining Enterprise Fund.Promotional CampaignF\u00e1ilte Ireland is being allocated \u20ac1m to undertake a promotional campaign focused on increasing the appeal of these counties to visitors and drive bookings.T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar TD said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is about providing a little bit more help to businesses in Kildare, Laois and Offaly as they manage the next couple of weeks.\u00a0 I know the restrictions have come as a blow just as they were getting back on their feet and we need to help out.\u201cThe topped-up Restart Grant Plus will provide some much needed cash to help with the costs associated with re-opening and staying open safely and by prioritising applications from the three counties for existing grants, loans and vouchers, we are ensuring they are top of the queue for what is already available. Once restrictions are eased, we want people to come visit the counties so we are also putting money aside for a promotional campaign. These measures, in addition to what is already available, will hopefully provide some practical assistance to manage what is an extremely difficult situation.\u201dMinister Michael McGrath TD added:\u201cThe measures announced today represent a genuine effort by Government to address the negative consequences for businesses and the local economy in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, as a result of the restrictions imposed last Friday on public health grounds.\u201cThe extra grant support for local businesses will be of help, alongside the additional resources being allocated to promote a range of enterprise schemes across the three counties. It\u2019s hoped that the funding for a promotional campaign will drive footfall into these counties once the restrictions are lifted. Government will work with local businesses, Chambers of Commerce and other representative bodies to roll out the various supports in the period ahead.\u201dMinister Catherine Martin TD concluded: \u201cI am acutely aware of the difficulties being faced by the tourism and hospitality sectors in Kildare, Laois and Offaly following the regulations announced last week. I welcome the Government\u2019s decision to allocate an additional \u20ac1m to F\u00e1ilte Ireland for a promotional campaign which will focus on increasing the appeal of the three counties to visitors and drive bookings.\u00a0 Specifically, F\u00e1ilte Ireland will leverage the existing \u2018Make a Break for It\u2019 and \u2018Keep Discovering\u2019 campaigns. The approach will be a mix of county specific promotional activity and also grouping the three counties under their regional experience brand \u201cIreland\u2019s Ancient East\u201d to help bring to life what the counties have to offer.\u201cTourism and Hospitality businesses in the three counties can also avail of the F\u00e1ilte Ireland business supports to guide them through these unprecedented times. These have been developed in consultation with industry experts to meet the immediate and urgent needs of tourism businesses and to help them re-open and recover.\u201d Notes to Editors:More information on the business supports is available here: COVID-19 supportsThere is an existing package in place to help businesses nationally re-open and stay open, through the July Stimulus.
