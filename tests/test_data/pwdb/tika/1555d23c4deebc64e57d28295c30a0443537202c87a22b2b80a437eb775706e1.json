The measure aims at supporting technological innovation and development within large enterprises undertaking an overall structural change in business processes through: \r\r* an ad hoc recruitment plan for qualified and specialised workers and professionals;\r* a pre-retirement plan, up to 5 years, for the workers eligible to the old-age pension, in exchange for a monthly allowance paid by the employer corresponding to the gross pension treatment accrued at that time;\r* a reduction of working hours combined with access to extraordinary payroll subsidies, up to a maximum of continuous or non-continuous 18 months;\r* a training and re-qualification plan for employees requiring updated skills, in particular in the technological sphere.\r\rCompanies with more than 500 employees are eligible, as well as those with more than 250 employees that combine new hiring with pre-retirement procedures. Eligible companies can resort to this measure by starting a consultation procedure with the Ministry for Labour and Social Policies and with the most representative trade unions or with the employees\u2019 representatives at the workplace level. The company has to present a plan to this consultation including:\r\r* the number of workers to hire and an indication of the related professional profiles, in line with the re-industrialisation plan;\r* the time schedule of the hiring;\r* the indication of the open-ended duration of the contracts; \r* concerning the staffing level, the indication of the reduction of working hours and the number of workers involved. \r\rIf accepted, the plan is included in a company-level agreement signed by the company and by the workplace employees\u2019 representatives.
