The relevant Minister stated that whereas Air Malta would usually have 10 airplanes in the air, no more than one was now flying. Air Malta therefore initiated discussions with relevant Unions to save the airline and the workers. Discussions were initiated with unions representing ground handlers, cabin crew and the pilots (each group has its own union). New agreements were concluded with the former two groups, resulting in no jobs being lost. A new agreement, however, was not reached with the pilot's union, ALPA, resulting in sizeable redundancies. ", "content_of_measure_description": "Following discussions between the government, Air Malta and the Cabin Crew Union, it was agreed that threatened redundancies would not take place. Initially, Air Malta had stated that in view of the pandemic, it had aimed to make 139 cabin crew on indefinite contracts redundant, and fail to renew 145 cabin crew on fixed-term contracts. Air Malta employs 333 Cabin Crew. Of these, 188 are on an indefinite term contract, while 145 are on a fixed term contract\r\rIn order to save the aforementioned workers, it was agreed to cancel all prior agreements between the cabin crew and the airline held in the 2016 collective agreement. Key to the new agreement signed was that cabin crew agreed to forfeit a guaranteed minimum take-home pay that they previously had a right to, with cabin crew now agreeing to being paid for the number of hours that they worked. Furthermore, it was agreed that whilst crew on indefinite contracts would be allocated with a number of hours of work during the week, those on a definite contract would only be called in (and thus paid) once demand increases.", "use_of_measure_description": "To date, the measure saved 139 cabin crew on indefinite contracts from redundancy, whilst 145 cabin crew on fixed-term contracts were provided with new contracts. ", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "As COVID-19 struck and Air Malta was practically grounded, the organisation called the unions representing its workers (including engineers, cabin crew and pilots) to either accept a much reduced minimum salary of \u20ac1,200 monthly, including if they were not required to operate, with employees able to earn more if work was performed as per their collective agreement, or to face redundancy. Whilst the engineer's union (following a vote by their members, of which 90% voted in favour) accepted the offer, the cabin crews' and pilots' unions rejected the offer. Several discussions took place between the unions and the airline with no new offer being agreed. On the 8 April 2020, Air Malta therefore decided to initiate redundancy procedures against a large percentage of cabin crew and pilots. \r\rIn terms of the cabin crew, in-fighting occurred with those on definite contracts, who were generally remunerated less than those with indefinite contracts, pushing for the agreement to be accepted. This resulted in cabin crew workers on definite contracts taking legal action against the union for not accepting the proposal, which would otherwise have resulted in all workers on a definite contract being made redundant. \r\rDespite the Airline initiating redundancy procedures, talks continued between the unions and the airline, and on the 27 May 2020 it was announced that an agreement had been concluded between the airline and cabin crew union, resulting in all jobs being saved. This new agreement was put to a vote of Cabin Crew Union members; of 299 members eligible to vote, 252 voted; 161 members voted in favour of the proposals, whilst 90 voted against.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "Yes", "private_or_public_sector": "Only private sector", "is_occupation_specific": "Yes", "actors": ["National government", "Trade unions", "Company / Companies"], "target_groups": ["Particular professions", "Other businesses"], "funding": ["Employer", "National funds"], "sectors": ["Air transport"], "occupations": [{"recordId": "4", "occupations::name": "Hospitality, retail and other services managers", "modId": "0"}], "sources": [{"url": "https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/102622/watch_air_malta_signs_collective_agreement_with_cabin_crew_union#.Xy165K_is2w", "title": "Air Malta signs collective agreement with cabin crew union", "content_path": "res/78051e2362af4609ab68716964ef1ae50cc33e4cc7cec24bf8a4a7fabedafee9", "content": "[WATCH] Air Malta signs collective agreement with cabin crew union menuToggle navigation\t\tHome \tJobs in Malta\tYellow\tPharmacies\tSponsored\tAnnouncements\tAdvertise\tContact\tDigital Edition\tSMS Alerts\tNews \tNational\tCovid-19\t#EWROPEJ\tCourt & Police\tInterview\tData & Survey\tThe Skinny\tXtra\tBudget 2021Court & Police Yorgen Fenech chats quoted in Daphne inquiry should not have been released\tCourt & Police Motorcyclist seriously injured in Mosta accident\tNational Robert Abela defends ex-PA chief Johann Buttigieg over Yorgen Fenech chats\tNational Removing face mask to eat and smoke is illegalMore in News \tBusiness \tBusiness News\tBusiness Comment\tTechnology\tLaw ReportBusiness News BOV suspends fees on dormant accounts and minimum balance\tBusiness News Neteller and Skrill limit payments for Norwegian players\tBusiness Comment Why RS2\u2019s expansion strategy is considered as a growth story | Calamatta Cuschieri\tBusiness News Economic recovery from COVID-19 'slower than anticipated', business survey showsMore in Business \tSports \tWorld Cup 2018\tFootball\tRugby\tMotor Sports\tBoxing\tTennis\tCricketFootball \u0126amrun football club insists supporters who breached COVID rules were a minority\tFootball Nerazzurri face their next challenge against Atalanta\tFootball Two Premier League giants go head to head\tOther Sports First-Person-Shooters: The best Battle Royale games of 2021More in Sports \tArts \tArt\tBooks\tEntertainment\tMusic\tTheatre & Dance\tFilm\tCultural Diary\tKwartaKtieb\tValletta 2018Music [WATCH] Red Electrick releases new single featuring Destiny\tBooks [LISTEN] The giants of Maltese literature given new life in treasure-trove of 120 soundfiles\tMusic [WATCH] The New Victorians release Maltese debut \u2018Min Jaf\u2019, featuring Lapes\tMusic The road less travelled: a profile of composer Alexey ShorMore in Arts \tComment \tBlogs\tEditorial\tLetters\tCartoonsBlogs Journalists are there to ask the hard questions, not to make you look good\tBlogs D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of a sycophantic nation\tEditorial It is the role of the press to ask uncomfortable questions\tBlogs Taking control of our data | Alex Agius SalibaMore in Comment \tVideo \tArchives \tSponsored \t\tRecipes\tRestaurants\tMagazines\tTV\tVideos\tYellow \tLogin to Digital Edition Loginhomenewslogin\tNational\tCovid-19\t#EWROPEJ\tCourt & Police\tInterview\tData & Survey\tThe Skinny\tXtra\tBudget 2021\tNews\tNational[WATCH] Air Malta signs collective agreement with cabin crew unionAn agreement signed today will see cabin crew on both definite and indefinite contracts retaining their job with Air Malta  28 May 2020, 2:32pmby Karl Azzopardi   Air Malta has suffered like all other airlines from travel restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19 TWEET SHARE  Air Malta has signed a collective agreement which will see all\u00a0cabin crew personnel keeping their job.The agreement covers workers on\u00a0both definite and indefinite contracts, who will be\u00a0retained on the company\u2019s books.\u201cToday is a step closer to a win, for the country and common sense,\u201d Economy Minister Silvio Schembri said, thanking workers for their \u201csacrifice\u201d.The agreement signed between Air Malta and the Union of Cabin Crew will see the workers relinquishing a number of benefits agreed in 2016. These include giving up the guarantee for a minimum\u00a0take-home pay, which will now see crew members\u00a0paid for the number of hours they work.\u201cThanks to the sacrifice by workers, we will be making the airline competitive again,\u201d Schembri said.Crew on an indefinite contract will be allocated a number of hours during the week, while crew with a\u00a0definite contract will be called in once demand increases.Looking ahead, the Economy Minister said the last hurdle for the company\u2019s management is coming to an agreement with the pilots\u2019 union.\u201cI appeal to ALPA to follow suit in understanding the challenges faced by the company,\u201d Schembri said.Following the reforms, government\u2019s next step would be of using state aid to help the company, as had been approved by the European Commission in light of the pandemic.Air Malta Chairperson\u00a0Charles Mangion said the agreement stemmed from two salient points, the safeguarding of jobs, and the viability of the airline.\u201cThe negotiations were not easy, but an agreement was reached because I think everyone kept the workers\u2019 interest at heart,\u201d he said.He also said the company has agile and flexible plans which will help it adapt to the new realties.\u00a0\u201cThe workers\u2019 future depends on the viability of the company,\u201d Mangion said.In April, Air Malta had announced it would be making 108 pilots from its staff of 134 redundant, after ALPA refused to take a radical pay cut of \u20ac1,200 a month due to the coronavirus grounding all flights.The airline had said it would also make 139 cabin crew on indefinite contracts redundant, and stop 145 cabin crew on fixed-term contracts.Asked if today\u2019s decision could be translated as a U-turn, the Economy Minister said the company is adapting to the new realities that are cropping up.Following reports that the airport will be opening in mid-July, Schembri said the announcement will be made official once the health authorities give their\u00a0go ahead.
