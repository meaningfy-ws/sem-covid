This includes  large MRI scanners, X-ray machines and equipment, which assists in the laboratory testing of blood and urine samples. Siemens Health has a workforce of 2,200 employees in the UK, who work in offices, factories and hospitals across the UK. Its operations have been impacted significantly the coronavirus pandemic; not only has production been affected by increased demand but given the nature of its business (ie healthcare), it has responded to the crisis through sharing expertise on a voluntary basis.", "content_of_measure_description": "One of Siemens Healthineers\u2019 four factories in the UK builds blood gas analysers, which are used to monitor the oxygen content in a person\u2019s blood. These have obvious utility as part of  the portfolio of tests available in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. There was obviously an increased demand for these important pieces of equipment from the start of the pandemic and thus, the organisation had to implement some fairly radical changes in shift patterns. However, this need to ramp up production had to be balanced with keeping a number of factory staff home because of their age or underlying health conditions putting them at increased risk of the virus. Other employees have been understanding, given the nature of the crisis, and have increased their working hours accordingly. The workers stationed in factories were classed as essential workers and continued to travel to work, but most office-based employees transitioned to working at home.  Assessing the situation was a big task for the HR team, which organised the fast-tracking of occupational health assessments and identified all workers who were vulnerable, organising for them to shield at home within a day of the risk factors being announced. \r\rSiemens Healthineers does not manufacture ventilators, but the company did produce them around 15 years ago. The firm did not actually build units in response to the government's call for UK manufacturers to produce more of the essential machines via the \u2018ventilator challenge\u2019, but Siemens lent its people\u2019s domain expertise. As an accredited medical device manufacturer that formerly produced ventilators, the company supported ventilator manufacturers to increase their output, and offered guidance on health and safety and regulatory requirements. \r\r**NHS volunteering**\rWith a number of clinically trained staff on the business\u2019s payroll, the organisation had to come up with a creative solution to allow them time off to work in the NHS at no cost to the health service. This was a challenge for the HR team, which ended up creating a special type of annual leave: the company now offers staff trained in disciplines from radiography to biomedical science up to two days a week (for up to 12 weeks) additional paid leave to work for the NHS. This is on the basis that the support is offered without remuneration from the NHS.\r\r", "use_of_measure_description": "It applies to the UK workforce, some 2,200 workers.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "Company initiatives and measures derived and implemented by the company, with no involvement by the social partners in design, implementation or monitoring of those measures.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "Yes", "private_or_public_sector": "Only private sector", "is_occupation_specific": "No", "actors": ["Company / Companies"], "target_groups": ["Particular professions", "The COVID-19 risk group at the workplace", "Workers in essential services"], "funding": ["Companies"], "sectors": ["Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.", "Human health activities"], "occupations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/long-reads/articles/how-are-people-teams-responding-to-coronavirus-siemens-healthineers", "title": "People Management (2020) How are people teams responding to coronavirus? ...Siemens Healthineers", "content_path": "res/f897b823e26de6bc36bc6487b0b44a62a39688f8a27e0e1980ee0e3b102fe13a", "content": "How are people teams responding to coronavirus? ...Siemens Healthineers                                                      Advertisement                                                      Skip to main site navigationSkip to main contentSkip to footer           \t                            CIPD                                        \t                            CIPD Events                                        \t                            PM Insight                                                                       People Management                                                                                                    Open                                                                     \t                                                            News                                                    \t                                                            Voices                                                    \t                                                            Long reads                                                    \t                                                            Experts                                                    \t                                                            Contact Us                                                    \t                                                            PM Jobs                                                                                                                            When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.

With 2,200 employees working in offices, factories and hospitals throughout the UK, its operations have been drastically affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0The impact so farOne of Siemens Healthineers\u2019 four factories builds blood gas analysers, which are used to monitor the oxygen content in a person\u2019s blood. They\u2019re \u201cvery useful to have as part of the portfolio of tests available when you're looking at treating Covid-19 patients\u201d, explains managing director Peter Harrison.\u00a0An increase in demand for these important pieces of equipment has meant some \u201cfairly radical changes in shift patterns\u201d, Harrison says. The company has had to balance the need to ramp up production with sending a number of factory staff home because of their age or underlying health conditions putting them at increased risk of the virus.\u00a0However, employees have been understanding about the increased working hours required of some of them, according to Jamie Wright, head of HR. \u201cPeople are stepping up to the plate [...] this is a healthcare crisis and as a healthcare company everybody feels a duty to support,\u201d he says.\u00a0The ventilator challengeSiemens Healthineers does not manufacture ventilators, but the company did produce them around 15 years ago. While the firm is not actually building units in response to health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s call for UK manufacturers to produce more of the essential machines via the \u2018ventilator challenge\u2019, it is lending its people\u2019s domain expertise. \u201cThere was a generic call out to industry, and some of my manufacturing colleagues in the UK took it upon themselves to say 'you know what? We think we can help\u2019,\u201d he says.As an accredited medical device manufacturer that formerly produced ventilators, the company is supporting ventilator manufacturers to increase their output, and offering guidance on health and safety and regulatory requirements.\u00a0NHS volunteeringWith a number of clinically trained staff on the business\u2019s payroll, Harrison and Wright had to come up with a creative solution to allow them time off to work in the NHS at no cost to the health service. \u201cAs soon as Boris [Johnson] and the team were looking for people to come back to the NHS, we\u2019d already started to get some requests,\u201d says Wright.\u00a0This was a challenge for the HR team, which ended up creating a special type of annual leave: the company now offers staff trained in disciplines from radiography to biomedical science up to two days a week (for up to 12 weeks) additional paid leave to work for the NHS. This is on the basis that the support is offered without remuneration from the NHS.\u201cThey're going back to where they used to work to support their friends, their colleagues, their communities,\u201d Wright says. \u201cThat's really why we thought it was something important that we had to support.\u201dLeadership in a pandemicWhile workers stationed in hospitals and factories across the UK are classed as essential workers and are continuing to travel to work, most office-based employees have transitioned to working at home.\u00a0Assessing the situation was a big task for the HR team, which organised the fast-tracking of occupational health assessments and identified all workers who were vulnerable, organising for them to shield at home within a day of the risk factors being announced. \u201cThat kind of agile working isn't something that's typical for us,\u201d says Wright. \u201cBut we had to work really quickly.\u201d\u00a0Harrison says operating in such uncertain conditions changes the style of leadership needed from the company\u2019s senior team. \u201cWe get the Boris updates at 5pm \u2013 immediately we're expected to know all the answers and all of the details, and we know we don't have that.
