The aim of this measure is to facilitate for health and medical care students to help out in the health care sector without their student aid being reduced. However, the measure does not exclusively cover health and medical students as also other occupations are deemed key in the current crisis, and also so as to support those newly unemployed who now wish to start studying.\r\rThe student aid income ceiling is regulated in The Act (1999:1395) on student aid (Studiest\u00f6dslag (1999:1395)).\r", "content_of_measure_description": "In practice, the removal of the income ceiling means that students who have received higher incomes during 2020 than the initially set limit (of SEK 86,782 during half a calendar year), will keep all of their student grants and loans.\r\rFor students who are short of credits due to their school being unable to provide teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, the administrating authority (The Swedish Board of Student Finance (CSN)), will take this into consideration. And those who have difficulties repaying their loans due to the COVID-19 related situation will be given the possibility to postpone or reduce the payment.", "use_of_measure_description": "As all students are eligible, the use of this measure might be widespread.

Per Bolund is Minister for Environment and Climate and Deputy Prime Minister from February 5, 2021.                02 October 2019     -     04 February 2021                                                                                       Press release from Ministry of Education and Research, Ministry of Employment, Ministry of Finance                    Crisis package for jobs and transition                        Published 30 March 2020                                     The Government, the Centre Party and the Liberal Party are now presenting further measures to alleviate the impact of the virus outbreak on jobs and the economy in Sweden.                                                                                                                                                    The ongoing virus outbreak is having a major impact on the Swedish economy and many people have become, or risk becoming, unemployed. To alleviate the impact on the labour market, a crisis package for jobs and transition is now being presented.The Government will shortly present the proposals to the Riksdag in an additional amending budget and in the coming spring amending budget. The proposals are based on an agreement between the Swedish Social Democratic Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal Party and the Green Party.Temporary reinforcement of unemployment insuranceEven with the powerful measures taken so far to combat the economic impact of the virus outbreak, unemployment is expected to rise sharply. This means that unemployment insurance will have to be adapted. The requirements concerning who can receive money from an unemployment insurance fund will be temporarily relaxed in terms of how much people need to have worked and how long people need to have been a member of a fund. At the same time, it is proposed that both the highest and the lowest amounts paid out by an unemployment insurance fund be raised temporarily to alleviate the economic impact on people who become unemployed. It is also proposed that the six initial qualifying days be removed and that the unemployment insurance funds receive funding for administration.\u00a0\u00a0More active labour market policyTo better address a development in which more people are expected to become unemployed, it is proposed that increased funding be paid to Arbetsf\u00f6rmedlingen (the Swedish public employment service) and labour market policy programmes. It is proposed that the period during which a person may have an \u2018extra job\u2019, a new start job or an introductory job be extended by an additional year for those who already have such jobs. It is also proposed that the maximum time for support for starting a business be extended from six to twelve months. In addition, it is proposed that municipalities receive grants for more summer jobs for young people and funding for green jobs to enable subsidised employment, primarily in the area of nature and forest conservation.More places and more distance learning at higher education institutionsTo increase opportunities to study at higher education institutions, it is proposed that the number of places be increased. A general expansion of the number of places is proposed, as are more places on summer courses and a foundation year so that unemployed people, and others, have the opportunity to obtain eligibility to enter into further education/training, for example in health care professions. In addition, increased funding is also proposed to strengthen capacity and develop work on distance learning at higher education institutions. Funding will also be allocated for internet-based education, also known as MOOCs (massive open online courses), which is free of charge and open to the public. Anyone who is given notice of the termination of their contract will be able to use these courses to quickly begin knowledge acquisition. To compensate for increased workload, it is also proposed that the Swedish Council for Higher Education and the Swedish Board of Student Finance receive increased funding.\u00a0More opportunities for vocational education and training throughout the countryAt a time when unemployment is expected to rise, there will be a need for better opportunities for further education/training throughout the country. It is proposed that funding to regional vocational adult education increase, with the surplus enabling full central government financing of education. It is proposed that vocational higher education be reinforced with new places, short courses and course packages, as well as various kinds of pilot projects so that more people can complete their qualification. It is proposed that folk high school be expanded, with full financing from central government. In addition, improved possibilities are proposed for distance learning, partly through additional support to education providers in vocational higher education in terms of distance teaching, and partly by making more distance courses available via study associations.Removal of income ceiling for student aidSo that health and medical care students can help out in the health care sector without their student aid being reduced, it is proposed that the income ceiling for all those receiving student aid be temporarily removed.

Or due to having to care for a child that is ill or who cannot be at preschool or school? Then you are obligated to report this.How to report illnessIf you are studying with student grants and loans or an education entry grant in Sweden, you should notify F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan (the Swedish Social Insurance Agency) that you are sick. If you are studying abroad, you should notify CSN that you are sick. If your sickness period is approved, you will keep your grants and loans, and your study result requirements will also be lowered. There are also other benefits to reporting your sickness.If you are studying at upper-secondary level with a study allowance, you should report your sickness to the school (if you study in Sweden) or to CSN (if you study abroad).Report illness to F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan (the Swedish Social Insurance Agency)Report illness to CSNRead more about the rules that apply while you are sick (in Swedish)How to report caring for a childIf you cannot study due to you caring for a child, you must report this to CSN. If we approve the care period, you will be allowed to keep your grants and loans from CSN. We can also take the care into consideration the next time we examine your study results. There are other benefits to reporting caring for a child.Caring for a child includes, for example,\tyour child becoming ill\tyour child having to stay home from preschool or school due to being a suspected carrier of the coronavirus\tyour child\u2019s preschool, school, or after-school centre (\u201cfritids\u201d) has closed some time during the period 25 April 2020 \u2013 30 April 2021 due to the coronavirus\tif your child has been seriously ill during 2020 - 2021 and should not be exposed to the risk of being infected by the coronavirus, and therefore must stay at home sometime during the period 1 July 2020 \u2013 30 April 2021.Report caring for a child to CSNRead more about the rules that apply while you are caring for a child (in Swedish)If your study results are affectedNext time you apply for student grants and loans, we will check how many credits you have accumulated. If you are short of credits because the school was unable to provide teaching during the coronavirus pandemic, we will take this into consideration. But you must have some form of documentation showing what has happened. This can be a certificate provided by the school, an e-mail from the school, or screenshots of the school\u2019s website.If you have incomeDue to the corona pandemic, the government has extended the temporarily removed income limit within student grants and loans (studiemedel) until June 30, 2021. It means that everyone who studies with student grants and loans can have incomes without affecting the student grants and loans during the first half of 2021.If the start of your studies is postponedHas your school postponed the start of your studies due to the coronavirus? If you have received a decision from CSN from the original start date, you will still be entitled to student finance from that date, even if teaching at the school has not started by that date.If you study with grants and loans or an education entry grant, you must submit a study assurance to CSN in order for the money to be paid out to you. You submit your study assurance once the studies were due to start. You can for example do this via Mina sidor (My Pages).Have you received a study assurance form which the school must also sign?In some cases, you need to submit your study assurance on a special form that the school normally must also sign. If the start of your studies has been postponed due to the coronavirus, you only need to sign the form yourself.Make a note in the form that the start of your studies has been postponed due to the coronavirus. Send in the form to CSN along with a document of some kind showing that the start of the studies has been postponed. This can be a certificate or e-mail from the school, or screenshots of the school\u2019s website, showing what has happened.If your school closesIf you have applied for and received a decision on student finance and your school after that has closed completely or partially due to the coronavirus, you still get to keep your approved student finance from CSN. This also applies if the school can not offer any distance learning or if they only can offer part-time distance learning. You do not have to report such changes to CSN. We continue to pay your student finance as usual.If you are having difficulty making repayments to CSNProblems paying a repayment claimHave you received a repayment claim which you can\u2019t pay? If so, it is best to call us so that we can find a solution together.Contact CSNProblems making repayments on your student loanIf your financial situation has changed and you have trouble making repayments on your student loan, there are some measures that you can take.If your income has dropped causing you to struggle to make repayments, you can apply to pay less for a specified period. This is called a reduction. You can apply for a reduction on Mina sidor. You will be asked to fill in your estimated income during the year, and based on this information, CSN will determine if you are entitled to a reduction. If your income changes again during the year, it is important that you notify us.Click on the button \"Ans\u00f6k om att betala mindre\" to apply to pay less in Mina sidor (in Swedish).

If this is the case, write to us and explain your financial situation. The easiest way of doing this is via our e-mail form.If you have a temporary difficulty paying, you can postpone a payment for one month. You can do this on Mina sidor. If you need to postpone a payment for more than one month, you can contact us. The easiest way to do this is by telephone. You can also switch to monthly instead of quarterly payments, if this is helpful.Click on the button \"Flytta fram en betalning\" to postpone a payment in Mina sidor (in Swedish).

Then you can apply to repay less or nothing at all (deferment) for up to a full calendar year. Contact us for more information about this.Contact CSNIf you are a foreign national and you or your family member becomes unemployedIf you have Swedish student grants and loans because you are an employee or entrepreneur in Sweden and you become unemployed, please inform CSN. The duty to notify us also applies to persons with Swedish student grants and loans who are a family member of such a person. If the person who becomes unemployed immediately registers as unemployed at Arbetsf\u00f6rmedlingen (the Swedish Public Employment Service), you may still be entitled to Swedish student finance.Contact CSN                                                Updated: 2021-03-01                      \t            Did this page help you?
