It can be carried out electronically, in front of the labour offices or through a licensed postal operator. \r\rThe programme focuses more on the labour market and maintaining employment than on directly supporting business. In this sense, this measure can be considered both economic and social.\r\rThree waves of the programme have been announced by now:\r\r1. From 13 March 2020 until 30 June 2020;\r2. from 1 July 2020 until 30 September 2020;\r3. from 1 October until 31 December 2020.\r", "content_of_measure_description": "The Bulgarian government adopted the Emergency and Measures Act to compensate businesses affected by the pandemic. The programme covers companies, whose activities have been prohibited by restrictive measures related to COVID-19 and companies, whose turnover decreased by 20% compared to the same period in 2019.\r\rThe list of industries that were *not* included in the first wave of the programme (13 March - 30 June 2020) include: agriculture, financial and insurance activities, government, education, human health and social work, households as employers, activities of extraterritorial organisations and services.\r\rA requirement for benefiting employers is that they shall not dismiss employees for whom they received wage compensations, after the end of the state of emergency, for an additional period equal to that for which they were compensated. Employers will be able to establish part-time work for the whole enterprise or units of it and at the same time receive compensation in proportion to the reduced working hours.\r", "use_of_measure_description": "More than 80% of employees can benefit from the measures and most of the employers in the country. Until mid-April 2020, over 800 companies have benefited from the measure.\r\rAccording to the Employment Agency, the measure known as _'60/40'_ covers 5.4% of the country's workforce. In addition, the measure contributed to keeping unemployment at just over 8% in June. Regionally, the most favourable effect was in the districts of Gabrovo and the capital Sofia, and the weakest - in Vidin and Sofia region. \r\rAs of 30 June 2020, 10,000 employers' applications for a total of 177,000 employees have been approved and submitted for payment.The NSSI data on the compensations paid under measure 60/40 shows that the average amount of assistance per employee varies, in March it was BGN 308 (\u20ac154), in April it increased to BGN 515 (\u20ac255) and it dropped again to an average of BGN 400 (\u20ac200) in May 2020.\r\rAccording to estimations of the Bulgarian Prime Minister, during the first two waves of the programme, the measure has helped 300,000 workers to retain employment.\r\rIn September 2020, the Solidarity for Bulgaria Association and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation presented a report that analyses the effectiveness of the current support measure. In the report the researchers argue that there is a considerable delay of payments for many applicants, which worsens the economic climate as employers are left out without necessary resources for months. Furthermore, they criticise the programme's framework for being dependent entirely on employers' decision to apply for the subsidy or not, which in some cases might put workers in unfavourable positions. In addition, the report states that around BGN 330,000 (\u20ac165,000) of the paid compensations were returned and there is a missing explanation as to why. Subsequently, the involved associations demand amendments in the scope of the programme which should include:\r\r* more initiation rights for the workers;\r* easier and time efficient application, processing and payment protocol;\r* transparent data for rejected and returned applications and payments; \r* subsidies of up to 100% of the wages for employees, earning less than BGN 800 (\u20ac400). \r\rBefore Christmas, the government announced that the scheme will continue to operate until September 2021. For the measure 60/40 next year, BGN 600 million are planned, which will reach the month of September.\r\rSo far, BGN 627 million have been paid under this measure, and according to the Minister of Social Affairs, between 250,000 and 300,000 jobs have been preserved with it. However, a significant part of the resource remained unspent - in the spring because of it the budget of the Unemployment Fund of the National Social Security Institute was updated by BGN 1 billion", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "During the negotiations, the social partners were active in drafting the measure. The measure was discussed in detail within the National Council for Tripartite Cooperation (including government representatives, representatives of Bulgarian Industrial Association, Bulgarian Confederation of Independent Unions and others). It was supported by all social partners. \r\rTrade unions have played a key role in contributing to the development of the measure in specific sectors most affected by the crisis, such as tourism and transport. These industries received additional funding. \r\rIn November 2020, the government called for design proposals, as it considers prolonging the programme in 2021. \r\r", "social_partner_form": null,

Afghanistan reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case  on February 24, 2020.  As the infection spread in March, the government progressively tightened containment measures, including introducing screening at ports of entry, quarantine for infected people, and closure of public places for gathering. On March 28, 2020 it imposed countrywide lockdown, which was subsequently extended twice. Most of containment measures have been removed since summer. Afghanistan experienced a relatively moderate second wave of infections during November-December with infections diminishing since the beginning of 2021. Schools reopened on February 28, and universities will resume in person instruction on March 5, 2021.Afghanistan received 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from India and the government rolled out vaccinations in late February in over 600 health centers across the country to priority groups including security forces and health workers. A mass vaccination rollout is planned for July. Through the COVAX program and with donor grants, the authorities have so far secured vaccine delivery pledges covering about 40 percent of the population. The pandemic and containment measures introduced at the onset of the pandemic stifled domestic activity and disrupted trade and transportation. Border closures and panic-buying led to a temporary spike in prices of some foodstuffs in April, which has abated with the re-opening of borders in early June. Income and job losses, in the formal and informal sectors, and higher prices have pushed thousands of Afghan families into poverty and likely reversed social development gains of the past decade. Oxfam estimates that the number of people on the brink of famine in Afghanistan has risen to 3.5 million in May from 2.5 million in September last year. Reopening of the economy: \tThe government progressively eased the lockdown over the summer, with most containment restrictions removed and businesses re-opened by end-August. Social distancing guidelines and the requirement to wear a mask in public places remain in place.\tIn early August, working hours for government and non-government organizations were normalized to its pre-pandemic level. This was a change from alternating between odd and even weekdays from 7 am until 1 pm (and later 8am to 4 pm) instituted in June-July. \tOn May 17, Pakistan re-opened its Torkham and Chaman borders points with Afghanistan, followed by a restoration of bilateral trade and transit at all border crossings to pre-COVID-19 status on July 13. On July 15, trade with India through Wagah border post in Pakistan resumed. At end-June, the authorities announced the resumption of domestic and international flights and exports to Europe via the air corridors.\tFamine Early Warning Systems Network reported that the May easing of containment led to increased labor availability in urban areas and, in combination with assistance and Zakat, allowed some improvement in consumption. Still, many Afghans remain in a crisis phase of food insecurity.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021FiscalThe government initially allocated Af 8 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) from contingency funds for emergency pandemic response, of which Af 1.9 billion (0.1 percent of GDP) for urgent health needs, such as establishing testing labs, including at border crossings; setting up special wards to boost hospitalization and care capacity; and procuring critical medical supplies.On April 29, the government started providing free bread to the poor in Kabul, later extended to other cities. The program was ended in late June. In May, the government waived electricity bills of less than Af 1,000 (US$13) for a family residence in Kabul for two months and paid utility bills of the past two months for 50 percent of households in Kabul. The decision benefited more than 1.5 million Kabul residents. Recognizing the liquidity constraints of many taxpayers, the government extended the tax filing deadline for the first quarter by 45 days. No further extensions have been provided. In late 2020, the government offered to waive tax and customs payment penalties if taxpayers clear their due taxes before the end of the first quarter 2021.In 2020, with the support of the World Bank grant, the authorities rolled out a relief package, amounting to Af 21.6 billion to Afghan households with incomes of US$2 per day or lower (twice the national poverty line). As about 90 percent of all households fall below that threshold, the program is near universal. Households in rural areas have been receiving an equivalent of US$50 in essential food staples and hygiene products, while those in urban areas a combination of cash and in-kind equivalent to US$100. In 2020, Af 12.7 was disbursed with a reminder to be disbursed in 2021. In 2020, the authorities spent 2.2 percent of GDP to fight COVID including: \t    Spending on health package of around  Af 10.2 billion, of which Af 1.4 billion on building hospitals; \tSpending on the social package of around Af 14.6 billion, of which Af 1.9 billion on the bread distribution program, and Af 12.7 billion on the  World Bank supported social distribution program \tSpending in provinces to finance Covid-19 response were around Af 1.5 billion; \tSpending on support to agriculture and short-term jobs were around Af 5.2 billion and Af 1.0 billion.The 2021 budget includes the following COVID-19 related spending:\tHealth package of Af 2.4 billion;\tSocial package of Af 8.9 billion;\tOther Af 3.3 billion.Monetary and Macro-financialThere have been no liquidity pressures in part thanks to Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB)\u2019s actions to maintain confidence in the Afghani and among depositors. The authorities increased the frequency of Financial Stability Committee meetings, enhanced the monitoring of early signs of liquidity stress, and reviewed banks\u2019 business continuity plans. DAB postponed the IFRS-9 implementation to June 2021 and froze loan classifications at the pre-pandemic cutoff of end-February. It also suspended administrative penalties and fees, with no retrospective applications for breaches/noncompliance. DAB phased out emergency pandemic measures in July. It ended the freeze on loan classifications and recommenced the enforcement of all prudential requirements in August with flexible application of penalties and prudential triggers in recognition of persisting risks. The emergency measures for the nonbank sector were allowed to expire at end-July.Exchange rate and balance of paymentsDAB remains focused on achieving price stability in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime. With domestic demand subdued the Afghani has remained broadly stable against the US$. DAB has engaged money-service providers, who play a systemic role in financial intermediation, to ensure uninterrupted services.Back to Top AlbaniaBackground.  Albania was mildly affected in the first wave of the pandemic in spring. Due to its proximity and close links to Italy, Albania adopted some of the toughest lockdown measures in Europe in March as soon as it detected the first confirmed COVID-19 case. The government proclaimed a state of natural catastrophe which enabled it to use extended powers for its three months duration until it ended on June 23. Reopening the economy and additional containment efforts. On June 1, Albania removed all domestic restrictions to movement and travel and re-opened its land borders after virtually shutting them since mid-March. Maritime passenger transportresumed on June 22 and airlines have resumed flights on a lighter schedule since mid-June. There are no quarantine requirements for incoming visitors and tourists. The EU continues to maintain travel restrictionsfor Albanian citizens as with other third countries with high infection rates. On December 22 2020 Albania suspended flights to and from UK to prevent the spread of the new variant of the COVID-19, until further notice, and introduced 14 day-quarantine requirement for travelers coming from UK. With the number of cases rising fast and hospital capacity being strained, some restrictions have been reintroduced, albeit much milder than the spring 2020 lockdown. Since November 2020 a night curfew has been introduced (currently from 8pm-6am), allowing only movements for health emergency and essential needs. Additional measures limit the number of people that can assemble to 10 both outdoors and indoors and impose a ban on social and political gatherings. Wearing masks outside became mandatory as of October 15th, while indoor use has become so since mid-July. Wedding parties are not allowed, and funerals are restricted to family members. Public transport was allowed to resume in June 2020. Pre-university schools re-opened on September 14 with classes divided in smaller groups and multiple shifts to ensure physical distancing. Universities are continuing on-line only and from December, most classes (apart from elementary school and graduating students) will combine on-line with in-person learning. Vaccination of medical staff started on January 11th. As of March 4, Albania had  administered a first dose of the vaccine to 15,115 medical staff and some care home elderly and over 80ies. It has managed to secure 31,000 vaccines, with larger numbers expected later in 2021.     Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government adopted two support packages in 2020 for people and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic of a combined size of Lek 45 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) consisting of budget spending, sovereign guarantees and tax deferrals. The first package adopted on March 19, 2020 through a normative act had support measures of Lek 23bn (1.4 percent of GDP) through a combination of spending reallocations, spending increases and sovereign guarantees to support affected businesses. The key measures are: (i) additional funding for health sector in the amount of Lek 2.5 billion\u00a0 (ii) Lek 6.5bn for the support of small businesses/self-employed that are forced to close activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic by paying them minimum salaries (up to two in the case of family businesses with unpaid family members), doubling of the unemployment benefits and social assistance layouts. (iii) Lek 2bn of defense spending reallocated toward humanitarian relief for the most vulnerablewhich were not used, (iv) Lek 11bn (0.6 percent of GDP) sovereign guarantee fund for companies to access overdrafts in the banking system to pay wages for their employees for up to 3 months with an interest rate capped at 2.85 percent for a maturity of up to 2 years. The government will bear the interest costs. The second package adopted on April 15, 2020, includes (i) Lek 7bn (0.4 percent of GDP) fund to pay for a one-off transfer of Lk40,000 to employees of small businesses affected by the pandemic not covered in the first package, employees of large businesses laid off due to the pandemic, and employees in the tourism sector; (ii) a sovereign guarantee of Lek 15 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) to provide loans for working capital for all private companies that were tax-compliant and solvent before the pandemic. The government will guarantee 60 percent of the loans, and interest are capped at 5 percent. As of November 3, almost 96 percent of the overall budgeted direct support measures had been paid out while the take up for the first guarantee scheme was 59 percent and for the second scheme 42 percent. A third smaller support package was adopted on August 13, providing an additional minimum wage to public transport workers who resumed work one month later than the rest. The measure costing Lk135m is accommodated within the existing transport budget.    The government has also adopted tax deferral measures allowing all large companies (except banks, telecommunication, public enterprises and other essential businesses) to defer payment of profit tax for the second and third quarter of 2020 in 2021. Tourism, active processing and call centers can defer payments for the rest of 2020 to 2021. Small businesses with turnover below Lk14m will not pay profit tax for the remainder of 2021.    In September, the government launched an employment promotion program, that aims to cover part of reemployment costs of those who lost their jobs during the lockdown. For formal sector employees the government will cover half of the wages (at the legal minimum level) and the full employers\u2019 share of social contributions for the duration of the program (4 or 8 months). Informal sector employees who lost their jobs during the lockdown, will have the full cost of social contributions (employees and employers share) covered for one year if they formalize.     The 2021 budget adopted by parliament on Nov 16, allocated Lk14.2bn (0.8 percent of GDP) in COVID-19 related spending. These include Lk7.2bn for COVID-19 treatment, Lk4.5bn for wage increases for doctors and nurses, and Lk2.5bn for a temporary increase in the payments for social assistance and unemployment benefits.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    To address the liquidity bottlenecks of companies and individuals, the Bank of Albania extended a temporary suspension of requirements for loan classifications and provisioning to August 31, 2020, enabling clients to ask banks to defer loan installments without penalties. On May 28, the BoA also adopted regulations to allow banks to restructure loans within 2020 without additional provisioning or downgrades for borrowers\u2019 status. Entry in force of more stringent classification and provisioning measures for reclassified loans was postponed by one year to 2022. Out of court restructuring for distressed borrowers under a special regulation will be possible for an additional year until 2022.\u00a0    On March 25, the Bank of Albania cut its key policy rate-the weekly repo, by 50 basis points to a new historic minimum of 0.5 percent. The Governor announced that the banking sector is liquid and well capitalized, and the central bank stands ready to provide unlimited liquidity for as long as needed.    The Bank of Albania  suspended dividend distribution for banks until the end 2020 in order to boost capital and support lending during this period. On January 13, 2021, the central bank lifted the suspension on the distribution of 2019 dividends, but instituted a suspension on the distribution of 2020 and 2021 dividends until end 2021.    To urge the use of internet banking and reduce the number of people requiring services in bank premises, the central bank also waived the commissions for transfers in local currency.    On July 17, 2020, the Bank of Albania announced it had set up a \u20ac400 million repo line with the ECB. On February 4th, the ECB announced a nine-month extension until March 2022.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    Albania has a floating exchange rate. The Bank of Albania intervenes only in pre-announced purchases to boost reserves or to smooth excessive and disruptive short-term volatility. On June 30, the Bank of Albania announced it had intervened in the market in end-March 2020 to smooth temporary excessive volatility caused by initial disruptions of lockdown measures.     Back to Top AlgeriaBackground. Algeria is being hit by two shocks\u2014the spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. Government policy is responding to both shocks. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 25, 2020. The authorities have been implementing containment measures since early February (e.g., cancelling flights, and imposing quarantines to repatriated Algerians). Confinement measures included closure of schools, universities, restaurants, and shops; cancellation of public and private events; shut down of transportation services (internal and external); putting on mandatory leave half of civil servants and private workers with full compensation. Demonstrations and religious activities were cancelled, a lockdown of affected areas was ordered and a curfew was put in place in several cities including Algiers.Reopening of the economy. The full lockdown of certain cities ended in early June, while the curfews, notably in Algiers, were relaxed. A gradual easing of the containment measured was announced and started on June 7, mostly consisting in allowing certain stores to open, under social distancing rules such as wearing masks and limiting the number of people in the stores. Faced with a resurgence in the daily number of cases, new restrictions to mobility, retail activities and social events were announced in several provinces on June 29. The authorities continue to monitor and adapt the lockdown measures as needed (latest decision on August 8 here). International borders remain closed, but schools reopened in October. The number of daily new cases has fallen sharply since the peak of the second spike in late November, but partial confinement measures are in place in 19 wilayas (provinces). Algeria received 100,000 COVID-19 vaccines and started the vaccination campaign in late-January 2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A national socio-economic recovery plan was discussed at a conference on August 18 and 19. Among other things the plan aims to ensure food and pharmaceutical security, promote a favorable business climate, and foster high value added sectors and international trade and FDI. A supplementary finance law (SFL) was enacted on June 4. It includes provisions amounting to 70bn dinars to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health sector, this includes 3.7bn for medical supplies, 16.5bn for bonus payments to health workers, and 8.9bn for the health sector\u2019s development. For the economic impact, the law includes 20bn for allowances to the unemployed because of COVID, and 11.5bn for transfers to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price environment, the SFL plans for a reduction in current and capital spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared to the initial 2020 budget law. In response to the economic impact on household and enterprises of the lockdown measures, the authorities also announced that: (i) the declaration and payments of income taxes for individuals and enterprises have been postponed except for large enterprises; and (ii) contractual deadlines would be relaxed and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts would be suspended.    Monetary and macro-financial\u00a0\t    On March 15, the Bank of Algeria lowered the reserve requirement ratio from 10 percent to 8 percent, and its main policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.    On April 6, the Bank of Algeria announced that it was easing solvency, liquidity and NPLs ratios for banks. Banks are also allowed to extend payments of some loans without a need to provision against them.    On April 30, the Bank of Algeria announced that it was cutting its main policy rate from 3.25 to 3.00 percent, that it was lowering its reserve requirement ratio from 8 percent to 6 percent, and that it was lowering haircuts on government securities used in refinancing operations.    On September 14, the Bank of Algeria announced a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio from 6 percent to 3 percent and the activation of 1-month open market operations.     On October 14, 2020, the Bank of Algeria announced that the easing of prudential requirements for banks, announced in April 2020, would be extended through the end of the year.    On January 6, 2021, the Bank of Algeria announced that the easing of prudential requirements for banks, first announced in April 2020, would be extended through March 31, 2021.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The authorities announced several measures to cut the import bill by at least USD 10 bn (6 percent of GDP). Authorities banned exports of several products, including food, medical and hygiene items.    On October 11, 2020, the government announced that a previous ban on imports of cars less than 3 years old would be maintained.    Back to Top AndorraBackground. Andorra has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, with the first confirmed case reported on March 2, 2020. To cope with the outbreak, which affected 1 percent of the population in the first wave, the economy was in full lockdown for a month until April 17. A phased reopening, coupled with mandatory use of masks and antibody testing for the entire population, started in May 18 and extended through the summer season. The decline in tourism due to travel restrictions, together with the domestic effect of lockdowns and social distancing measures, have severely impacted the Andorran economy, which shrank by 21.6 percent y/y in 2020Q2.Reopening of the Economy. With the economy\u2019s re-opening and the summer season, activity picked up significantly (real growth of -3.3 percent y/y in 2020Q3) but there was a resurgence of cases, with daily new infections almost tripling those of the first wave. To cope with the health crisis the government adopted more stringent social distancing measures in September, which remained in place throughout October and were only partially relaxed in November and December in lieu of the improvement in COVID statistics. Despite the efforts to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during the holiday season, including by providing free antigen tests to all Andorran residents, active cases, deaths and hospitalizations increased significantly in January, but have been on a downward path since then, allowing for partial relaxation of some containment measures. In addition, both France and Catalonia have partially relaxed the mobility restrictions that were in place since October, by assimilating Andorra to the Catalonian county of Alt Urgell and to the neighboring French regions of Arieja and Eastern Pyrenees for mobility purposes. Andorra has already negotiated the acquisition of vaccines for half the population; a first batch of 2,000 doses arrived in mid-January, a second batch of 3,000 in early March, and the rest are expected to arrive throughout 2020Q1. The Minister of Health established a vaccination protocol that gives priority to: (i) residents and staff of health centers for the elderly and disabled; (ii) health professionals; (iii) disabled people who require in-home professional support; (iv) health professionals involved in COVID vaccination. The vaccination campaign started in January 20th and, so far, vaccines have been administered to about 3.3 percent of the population. In addition, almost 30 percent of the population have already registered voluntarily to receive the vaccine.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Key above-the-line measures in 2020, amounting to 2.7 percent of 2020 GDP (\u20ac68.9 million), include: (i) additional healthcare-related spending (\u20ac15.2 million); (ii) payment of 75 percent of the salary to workers under temporary suspension of contract (\u20ac31.7 million); (iii) social security contributions for workers  who were temporarily laid off due to the pandemic (\u20ac3.4 million); (iv) extraordinary benefit for self-employed workers affected by economic activity suspension (\u20ac8.6 million); (v) rent/mortgage payment support to the sectors most affected by the pandemic (nightclubs, indoor recreation parks, travel agencies, and recreational and arcade game rooms), with the benefit per establishment capped at \u20ac2,000 per month and varying depending on extent of the restrictions imposed to each sector (\u20ac0.9 million); (vi) 30-percent reduction in the advance payment of the corporate tax and deferment or installment payments of tax debts without generating late payment interest (\u20ac9.1 million). The government also relaxed the requirements to access unemployment benefits and rental housing aid for individuals whose economic and social situation worsened due to the health crisis.    In 2020, the telecommunications and electricity public enterprises provided discounts on the monthly bills of firms that had to completely suspend activities or that experienced a significant decline in their business (\u20ac2.4 million, 0.1 percent of 2020 GDP), as well as the possibility of paying the bills in up to 12 monthly installments. In November, the government approved subsidies on electricity and telecommunication services to the businesses most affected by the pandemic that had already received the government\u2019s support for rent/mortgage payments as well as those businesses whose workers are under either temporal suspension of work contracts or short-time work arrangements.    Expecting a protracted crisis, on December 4th, 2020, the authorities approved a new package of measures, which came into force on January 1st, 2021, aimed at supporting the reactivation of the economy. This package extends for up to six months many of the measures already in place, and in some cases, it refines the conditions under which the measures are applicable to adapt to the health and economic circumstances. In addition, on December 16th, the government created a new temporary and exceptional involuntary unemployment benefit to support Andorran workers directly affected by the delayed opening of the ski stations; 65 applications were received, amounting to \u20ac45,515 in December. The benefit will remain in place until the affected companies are able to resume their normal activities in the 2020-21 ski season.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    In 2020, the government provided two packages of government guarantees for new bank loans to businesses, in which the government also takes on the interest payments. The first package, amounting \u20ac130 million (5 percent of GDP), to cover operating costs (\u20ac60 million) or to service existing debts with Andorran banks (\u20ac70 million). The second package, amounting \u20ac100 million (4 percent of GDP), to cover: (i) the service of existing debts with Andorran banks; (ii) the payment of the share of benefits associated with the temporary suspension of contracts; and (iii) investments needed to abide with the new health and social distancing protocols. Most of the second package is still available to use in 2021 and the government has relaxed the conditions to access it, incorporating additional purposes for requesting the guaranteed loans, which now include: the payment of rent and utility bills, leasing operations, fuel expenses for transportation, and the corporate contributions to job retention schemes. In addition, to facilitate repayment of the loans, the authorities approved a six-month extension of the maturity date of all the loans formalized in 2020 under the guarantee program, counting from the maturity date stated in the contract.      The Andorran government approved a legislative moratoria on April 18 to provide repayment relief\u2014and also extension of the repayment period in the case of mortgages\u2014until December 31 2020, to households and businesses affected by the pandemic, which meet the requirements established by the law. This moratoria applies to mortgages and personal loans to finance housing or vehicles in the case of individuals and commercial property in the case of businesses. The new terms of repayment should be agreed with the bank.    On June 11th, the Andorran Banking Association (ABA) adopted non-legislative sector-wide moratoria to provide repayment relief to households and businesses, for 6-12 months depending upon the types of loan and borrower. This private moratoria scheme complements the one approved by the government, and cannot be applied simultaneously. In mid-December 2020, ABA extended until March 31st, 2021, the application deadline for the moratoria.    Supervisory and regulatory action. The financial supervisor, Andorran Financial Authority (AFA), adopted as its own the European Banking Authority guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria. Furthermore, AFA adopted a set of measures, in line with the recommendations by the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank, including: (i) limiting in situ examinations to only those strictly necessary and postpone the non-priority ones to 2021; (ii) postpone stress tests, which are supposed to be done at least every three years for supervisory purposes, to 2021 if conditions allow; (iii) postponing beyond the 2020 exercise the requirement of establishing a capital buffer for systemic risks, which was supposed to be introduced in January 2020; (iv) recommending banks to not distribute dividends from the 2019 exercise. The government also extended the deadline for banks to report on their audited balance sheets to AFA from March 31st, 2020 to April 30th, 2020.

The first COVID-19 case was reported on March 21, 2020, while community transmission started on April 27. On January 11, authorities extended the sanitary restrictions in the country for another month, and movements from and to Luanda still restricted.  On January 14, due to the spread of Covid-19 variant in several countries, the authorities banned flights from the affected countries, including Portugal in an attempt to prevent the spread of the new variant. The measured entered into force in January, 24. Average daily cases has dropped to less than 100 case in January, compared to over 100 in December and about 300 in October 2020. . COVAX announced that Angola is part of the group receiving the vaccines in February. Angola is expected to receive initially, 2.5 million vaccines from the AstraZeneca/Oxford. The authorities also approved a vaccination plan, with an estimate cost of US$ 217 million and aims to cover 20 percent of the population in the first phase. The World Bank, United Nations, European Union and African Development Bank are providing financial support and resources in several ways. In mid-January 2021, the IMF disbursed US$ 487 million in budget support aiming also to help the country cope with the pandemic.Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The National Assembly approved revenue and expenditure measures to fight the COVID-19 outbreak and minimize its negative economic impact. About US$40 million on additional health care spending was announced and about US$80 million are being spent on 250 Cuban doctors who arrived in Angola to help. Tax exemptions on humanitarian aid and donations and some delays on filing taxes for selected imports were granted. On July 28, 2020, the National Assembly adopted a conservative supplementary budget, aiming at securing space for additional health expenditure, while balancing the need to keep debt on a sustainable path. The 2021 budget consolidates the nonoil revenue gains and expenditure restraint of the 2020 budget, while protecting priority health and social spending.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    Since late March 2020, the central bank (BNA) reduced the rate on its 7-day permanent liquidity absorption and expanded its credit-stimulus program to selected sectors. Financial institutions were requested to grant their clients a moratorium of 60 days for servicing debt. In April 3, the BNA increased the minimum allocation required from banks to extend credit to producers of priority products and instructed banks to provide credit in local currency to assist importers of essential goods. In May 7, 2020, the BNA reinstated its Permanent Overnight Liquidity Provision facility to provide liquidity support to banks (Kz 100 billion), and extended access to large non-financial corporations on a discount line created for the purchasing of government securities. However, with inflation steadily rising and the worst of the shock seemingly past, the Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA) appropriately shifted to a gradual tightening in the second half of 2020. Actions included the enhanced use of open market operations to drain excess liquidity from the system and an increase in September in the reserve requirement on banks\u2019 foreign exchange (FX) deposits (to be settled in domestic currency).    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    On April 1, 2020, the central bank introduced an electronic platform for foreign exchange transactions, which will be progressively extended for all such transactions. Oil, diamond and the Treasury are now trading on the platform which has also started to trade exchange rate futures.     Back to Top ArgentinaBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 3, 2020. The authorities adopted sweeping measures to prevent a rapid growth in infections, involving a full closure of borders and a nation-wide quarantine, beginning on March 20. The pandemic and the containment measures had a significant economic impact, with a GDP contraction of around 10 percent of GDP in 2020. The government\u2019s policy of moving from strict lockdown to a gradual reopening of the economy is contingent on the speed of contagion, defined as the length of time it takes for the number of reported cases to double. In May 2020, the government first announced a gradual reopening aimed at raising regional mobilization, excluding the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. However, restrictions were subsequently tightened in response to an acceleration in infections and, in early June, the mandatory lockdown was extended to other selected large cities. Another phased reopening of activities was announced in July, 2020 but rising infections led to an extension of the mandatory lockdown until November, 2020, with tighter enforcement in some inland provinces. On November 7, 2020 with cases levelling off in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, the government announced a move to a stage of social distancing. New cases began increasing in January 2021, once again prompting a tightening of restrictions in some inland districts of Buenos Aires and other inland provinces.. In early March 2021, 16 provinces returned to in-school learning. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Announced measures (totaling about 6.0 percent of 2020 GDP, 4 percent in the budget and 2 percent off-budget, based on the authorities\u2019 estimates) have focused on providing: (i) increased health spending, including for improvements in virus diagnostics, purchases of vaccines and hospital equipment, and construction of clinics and hospitals; (ii) support for workers and vulnerable groups, including through increased transfers to poor families, social security benefits (especially to low-income beneficiaries), unemployment insurance benefits, and payments to minimum-wage workers; (iii) support for hard-hit sectors, including reduced social security contributions, grants to cover payroll costs; and subsidized loans for construction-related activities; (iv) demand support, including spending on public works; (v) forbearance, including continued provision of utility services for households in arrears; and (vi) credit guarantees for bank lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) for the production of foods and basic supplies. In addition, the authorities have adopted anti-price gouging policies, including price controls for food and medical supplies and ringfencing of essential supplies, including certain export restrictions on medical supplies and equipment and centralization of the sale of essential medical supplies.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    Measures have been aimed at encouraging bank lending through (i) lower reserve requirements on bank lending to households and SMEs; (ii) regulations that limit banks\u2019 holdings of central bank paper to provide space for SME lending; (iii) temporary easing of bank provisioning needs and of bank loan classification rules (i.e. extra 60 days to be classified as non-performing); and (iv) a stay on both bank account closures due to bounced checks and credit denial to companies with payroll tax arrears.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    A broad set of CFMs have been in place since August 2019, aimed at restricting financial account transactions (limits on purchase of dollars, transfers abroad and debt service in foreign currency), and some current account transactions (surrender requirements on export proceeds, restrictions on imports of services, dividend payments abroad, and interest payments on foreign currency debt). CFMs helped limit outflows in the wake of the pandemic. The exchange rate has depreciated by over 40 percent vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar since early March 2020.    Back to Top ArmeniaBackground. The first confirmed case was reported on March 1, 2020. The pace of new covid-19 cases has slowed down further in December, after its peak in October. The government extendeda national state of emergency to September 11, and imposed strict containment measures, including school closures, travel bans on foreign citizens from high risk countries, and imposed fines to those who violate isolation orders during the state of emergency. The government announced an assistance package with a headline amount of $300 million (2 percent of GDP) to mitigate the socio-economic issues related to the pandemic, although this includes a variety of direct spending, state-sponsored loans and increased investment.Reopening of the economy. . Since May 2020, the movement restrictions were removed, and containment measures were eased, allowing for resumption of public transport, retail businesses, and restaurants. In September 2020, airspace was reopened, and the government lifted the state of emergency, and established quarantine in effect until July 11, 2021, requiring incoming travelers to have negative PCR tests taken within 72 hours prior to crossing border. As of mid-February, all restrictions on holding public events are removed. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The measures fall into threebroad categories:(i) subsidized 2-3 year loans to provide short-term support to affected businesses and SMEs; (ii) direct subsidiesto SMEs and businessesto help maintain their employees; (iii) grants to entrepreneurs and firms; (iv) lump-sum transfers to the vulnerable including individuals whowereunemployed after the COVID-19 outbreak, families with or expecting children, micro-businesses,  general population who needed help with utility bills, and temporary part-time employment. As of end-October, the authorities have adopted 24 support packages and, together with bank supports, allocated around 192.3billion AMD ($367m) to those. Some measures were adapted to support corporate investment. The government also allocated parts of the budget for investment to support post-crisis recovery.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) reduced the policy rate by another 25 bps to 4.25 percent on September 15. The interbank market has been active, and the central bank has easily met liquidity needs so far and provided a few FX swap operations to assure sufficient liquidity in dram and in FX. The CBA undertook few foreign exchange sales to limit excessive dram volatility around the beginning of April, although since then the dram has strengthened, and the CBA has been able buy some FX. The CBA has not used macroprudential policies actively, except asking banks to consider voluntary prudent loan restructuring and payment holiday period from March to June. The CBA\u2019s authorities are supervising banks\u2019 liquidity positions and will act swiftly if required to safeguard financial stability.

In mid-July, the government announced extensions of the JobKeeper wage subsidies through March 2021 and of the additional income support to householdsthrough December 2020, with payment reductions to facilitate a gradual transition to a recovery. It also instituted a new JobTrainer skills package (A$2 billion).The 2020-21 MYEFO extends the Coronavirus Supplement and other income support measures through March 2021. Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment has been arranged with the State and Territory governments to provide a lump sum payment to help workers during their 14-day self-isolation period. The Commonwealth government will also invest in green technologies (A$1.9 billion) to lower emissions.    Other measures include an allocation of up to A$15 billion to invest in residential mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities to help funding for small banks and non-bank financial institutions, and loan guarantees between the Commonwealth government and participating banks to cover the immediate cash flow needs of SMEs (up to A$20 billion). In mid-July 2020, the latter scheme was extended through June 2021, with the maximum loan size raised from A$250,000 to A$1 million and the maximum maturity extended to five years.     Separately,the Commonwealth government has committed to spend an additional amount ofA$16.6 billion (0.8percent of GDP) to secure access to COVID-19 vaccines, roll out a national Vaccination Program, strengthen the health system, and protect vulnerable people, including those in aged care, from the outbreak of COVID-19. The Commonwealth government has also agreed with the States and the Territories to share the public health costs incurred by the States and Territories in treating the COVID-19.    State and Territory governments also announced fiscal stimulus packages, together amounting to A$49billion (2.5 percent of GDP), including payroll tax relief for businessesandrelief for households, such as discount utility bills, cash payments to vulnerable households, support for health spending, construction, infrastructure packages, and green investment (renewable energy and technologies).     Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 2, 2021, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept the cash rate target (0.1 percent) and the 3-year government bond yield control target (0.1 percent) as well as the parameters of the Term Funding Facility (TFF) unchanged. The RBA also provided forward guidance that the conditions required for an increase in the cash rate are not expected to be met until 2024 at the earliest    On February 2, 2021, the RBA also announced the purchase of an additional A$100 billion of government bonds when the current bond purchase program ends in April 2021. These additional purchases will be at the current rate of A$5 billion a week.    In the  November 2020 monetary policy meeting, the RBA reduced the cash rate target, the 3-year yield control target, and the interest rate on its TFF by 15 basis points to 0.1 percent (the cash rate had been at 0.25 percent following two 25 basis point cuts on March 3 and March 19, 2020). The interest rate on commercial banks\u2019 exchange settlement balances at the RBA was reduced to zero (from 0.1 percent). In addition, the RBA announced secondary market purchases of A$100 billion of 5 to 10-year government bonds issued by the Australian Government and the states and territories over the next six months. It also stepped up its forward guidance by stating that it will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably back in the 2 to 3 percent target range and that it is not expecting to increase the cash rate for at least three years.    At the onset of the pandemic, on March 19, 2020, the RBA announced yield targeting on 3-year government bonds at around 0.25 percent through purchases of government bonds in the secondary market. To support liquidity, the RBA conducts one-month and three-month repo operations daily until further notice. Repo operations of longer-term maturities (six months or longer) are held at least weekly if market conditions warrant. To assist with the smooth functioning of Australian capital markets, the RBA has broadened the range of eligible collateral for open market operations to include securities issued by non-bank corporations with an investment grade. The RBA has established a swap line with U.S. Fed for the provision of US dollar liquidity up to US$60 billion. To support the provision of credit, especially to SMEs, the RBA established the A$90 billion TFF in March for banks to access three-year funding at 25\u00a0basis points until September 2020. The facility was subsequently expanded to A$200 billion, with access extended through June 2021.    The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has provided temporary relief from its capital requirement, allowing banks to utilize some of their current large buffers to facilitate ongoing lending to the economy as long as minimum capital requirements are met. APRA announced on March 30, 2020, that it is deferring its scheduled implementation of the Basel III reforms in Australia by one year to January 2023. APRA is also temporarily suspending the issuing of new licenses for at least six months in response to the economic uncertainty created by COVID-19. On July 27, 2020, APRA updated its guidance issued in April, which expected banks and insurers to consider deferring decisions on the level of dividends or approve a dividend at a materially reduced level, with a 50 percent cap on payout ratios for the remainder of this calendar year. On December 15, 2020, APRA announced that banks and insurers will no longer require to have a minimum level of earnings retention from January 1, 2021. APRA also expects banks to conduct regular stress testing to inform decision-making and make use of capital buffers to absorb the impact of stress to continue to lend to households and businesses.    APRA announced on March 23, 2020, that loans on repayment deferrals in the context of COVID-19 need not be treated as being in arrears for a period of up to six months for capital adequacy and regulatory reporting purposes for borrowers who have been meeting their repayment obligations. On July 7, 2020, the Australian Banking Association announced that banks will extend the period of deferred repayments by up to four months for affected borrowers. APRA also extended the regulatory approach on deferred repayments to cover a maximum period of up to 10 months until March 31, 2021. In addition, APRA clarified that loans that are restructured before March 31, 2021 to put the borrower on a sustainable financial footing may continue to be regarded as performing loans for capital adequacy purposes.    Insolvency relief measures for businesses put in place by the Commonwealth government from March 2020 for six months as part of its response to COVID-19 have been extended through December 2020.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The exchange rate has been allowed to adjust flexibly to absorb economic shocks.    Back to Top AustriaBackground. The pandemic began to spread in Austria since March. During the initial outbreak, the authorities progressively tightened containment measures between mid-March and mid-April.  By March 16, leaving home was banned by law with limited exceptions, restaurants and shops not delivering daily products were closed, and enforced by administrative and police measures. A gradual re-opening of the economy started after April 13, from small shops, construction and garden centers, while other stores and hairdressers were allowed to open at the beginning of May. By mid-May when religious services, outdoor sports, museums, libraries, and archives reopened, and the Bundesliga was allowed to restart. Open air markets and business premises are exempted from the mandate on mouth and nose protective masks since June 1. Some re-opening process was accelerated due to low infection rates, such as the reopening of the borders with Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary from June 5. On 16 June, travelling restrictions were lifted for most European countries. Adhering to EU policies, Austria lifted a travel ban with 15 countries, with the notable exceptions of US, Brazil, India, and Russia.   Subsequent lockdowns.  Since reopening, daily new cases significantly rose and, in October, surpassed the previous peak in March with the effective reproductive rate of above 1. A pickup in the infection rate prompted the authorities to reintroduce containment measures, including reintroducing mandatory mask since July. The authorities eventually announced a partial second lockdown between November 3 and December 6. This lockdown was subsequently tightened from November 17 and new cases have begun to decline again. The second lockdown has been less strict than the first. Industry and manufacturing remain open while restaurants, bars, non-essential shops, hairdressers, and schools are closed. Another lockdown was implemented during December 26\u00a0to February 8. From January 25, a higher-grade face masks (FFP2) are mandated in certain public areas, including air transportation.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The total fiscal package announced on March 15 amounts to 38 billion euros (about 9.5 percent of 2019 GDP). Financing includes: 4 billion euros for the health care system, long-term care, short-term work, and to compensate self-employed, family- and micro-business for the loss of earnings related to the sickness; 9 billion euros in guarantees to companies, including exporters and the tourism industry; 10 billion euros for the deferral of personal and corporate income taxes (for 2020), social security contributions (3 months), and VAT payments (until end-September 2020). The General Civil Code was enacted on March 15 declaring COVID-19 a force majeure enabling companies to force workers to take up to two weeks of leave accumulated in previous years. On March 22, \u20ac22 million were earmarked for research and short-term work was extended to 3 months with the possibility to extend it by another three months (up to September). Under this provision working hours may be reduced to up to 10 percent (later revised to 30 percent), at 80 to 90 percent of regular pay. Employers only pay the hours worked, while the rest is paid from the budget. From April 2, households could delay rent payments to their landlords until end-2020. Households and SMEs may also delay their debt servicing by 3 months. Funding for short-term work was increased from \u20ac 3 to \u20ac 5 billion on April 13, to \u20ac 10 billion on April 30, and again to \u20ac 12 billion on May 19 while the time frame for the submission of applications extended. The authorities are rolling out new fiscal measures including tax relief measures for the hospitality sector of \u20ac 500 million and support to non-profit organizations of \u20ac 700 million open for 6 months. To jump-start the economy, a new tax incentive was introduced for companies that recruit apprentices, with \u20ac 2,000 per position created during March 16 and October 31 of this year. On June 16, the overall package was increased to \u20ac 50 billion (13 % of GDP).  Measures on the expenditure side include investment in climate protection, affordable housing, health, and digitalization and a one-off support for unemployed and families. Several specific tax relief measures are aimed at the agricultural and forestry sectors, culture and publishing. The reduction of the lowest income tax rate from 25 to 20 percent, planned for 2021, was brought forward and made retroactive to January 2020. In light of the subsequent lockdowns, the authorities added a targeted policy of \u201clockdown revenue replacement\u201d (about 0.5-1 percent of GDP) to support directly affected companies during November-December 2020.  Several measures have been extended, including new phase of short-term work arrangement (June 2021), fixed cost subsidy, hardship fund for small businesses, revenue replacement, and unemployment assistance. The 2021 budget, announced in mid-October, envisaged a deficit of over 6 percent of GDP reflecting continuation of key measures.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    For monetary policy at the currency union level, please see Euro Area section.        The Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) has declared readiness to supply    sufficient cash to banks, ATM operators, and the economy in response to    increased withdrawals. Working hours were extended to meet the increased    demand. On March 18, the Financial Market Authority prohibited short sales    for one month following the massive drop in prices on the Vienna Stock    Exchange due to betting on covered share price losses and extended it on    April 16 to May 18.

The authorities reported the first confirmed COVID-19 case on February 29, 2020.The COVID-19 Operational Headquarters has been created under the Cabinet, Ministers and working groups\u00a0within various ministries and at the CBA have been tasked with developing specific response measures. To contain the spread of COVID-19, the authorities introduced a special quarantine regime (state of emergency) starting March 24. It included border closures, mandatory quarantine of citizens returning from abroad, prohibition of mass gatherings, restriction of domestic movements; closure of retail outlets, airports, and transportation hubs; social distancing, and disinfection of public spaces.Reopening of the economy. Starting May 4, the authorities began a staged relaxation of restrictions, enabling many businesses, facilities, and public areas to reopen and reestablishing freedom of private vehicular travel between cities and districts. On June 19, as new COVID-19 cases rose with the reopening (with cases doubling between June 1-18), the authorities announced retightening of the quarantine regime (including the closure of borders until August 1, closure of establishments such as shopping malls, cinemas, and museums in the capital and big cities, and requiring permits for people to leave their homes in these cities). On July 17, the special quarantine regime was extended in 13 cities and districts until August 31, with tighter provisions in place until August 5. With new inflections starting to decline in early August, the authorities relaxed some of the lockdown restrictions in 7 cities (e.g., a few beaches were reopened and the requirement to receive SMS permission to leave home was eased). On August 29, the special quarantine regime was extended until September 30. On September 28, in response to a rise in the number of new coronavirus cases, Azerbaijan has extended some of its lockdown restrictions until November 2 and decided to keep its borders closed. On November 19, following further rise in covid infections, Azerbaijan extend lockdown restrictions until December 28, 2020. On December 14, 2020, the new quarantine measures became effective and the special quarantine regime was extended until January 31, 2021. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities have increased budget spending on public health by AzN 0.37 bn (0.5 percent of GDP). This includes scaling up medical facilities (AzN 0.25 bn) with ten modular hospitals to be built  adding 2,000 beds; purchase medical supplies & equipment, payment of allowances/benefits to medical workers (AzN 0.1 bn); and creation of a COVID Response Fund for public health needs with public and private sector contributions (total AzN 114 million or 0.14 percent of GDP, with government transfer of AzN 20 million (.02 percent of GDP). Azerbaijan's government has also provided AzN 8.5 million ($5 million) to the COVID-19 Fund as part of the WHO\u2019s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan.    On April 4, the authorities announced support to the affected businesses and individuals in the amount of AzN 3.3 billion (4.85 percent of GDP).\u00a0 Measures aimed at redressing damage to entrepreneurs and supporting incomes include: partial coverage of salaries (AzN 215 million); support to microentrepreneurs (AzN 80 million); temporary public jobs (AzN 54 million); subsistence and unemployment payments (AzN 230 million); pensions (AzN 200 million); targeted social assistance (AzN 4.5 million); energy and education subsidies (AzN 20 million); allocation of additional funds to the Entrepreneurship Development Fund (AzN 50 million).    On June 2, the President approved amendments to the Tax Code, providing tax benefits to businesses affected by the COVID pandemic(AzN 0.12 bn or 0.2 percent of GDP). The amendments grant a one-year exemption from land and property tax to selected sectors, including tourism, passenger road transportation, and cultural facilities. Income taxpayers will also receive a 75 percent exemption and taxpayers filing under simplified procedures a 50 percent exemption. Moreover, the rental property tax in the COVID-affected areas is reduced from 14 percent to 7 percent.    On June 23, the Cabinet of Ministers announced a one-time extension of social assistance announced as part of the April 4 relief package for the unemployed and low-income people who lost earnings because of the special quarantine regime. An additional lump-sum payment of AzN 190 was paid once to the individuals who received social assistance under the April 4 relief package.    On August 6, the parliament passed a revised 2020 budget which reflected a lower oil price ($35 a barrel) and growth assumptions (-5 percent). The transfer from the Oil Fund was increased by AzN 850 million to offset lower state budget (SB) revenues, while SB expenditures were increased by some AzN 600 million. Overall, the projected 2020 SB deficit has increased from AzN 2.8 billion to AzN 3.4 billion (4.8 percent of GDP), while the consolidated government deficit increases from AzN 1.9 billion to AzN 8.4 billion (11.9 percent of GDP). Preliminary data for 2020 show actual state and consolidated government deficits lower than projected, reflecting higher oil price and spending control.    The 2021 budget allocated another AzN 261 million (0.3 percent of GDP) for fighting the pandemic.\t\tMonetary and macro-financial\t    On March 19, the CBA left the refinancing rate unchanged at 7\u00bc percent, butraised the floor of the interest rate corridor (within a de facto floor system) by 125 bps to 6\u00be percent.    On May 1, the CBA lowered the ceiling of the interest rate corridor by 100 bps to 8 percent. The authorities have\u00a0extended the blanket deposit guarantee until December 4, 2020.

On December 18, the CBA lowered the refinancing rate by 25 bp to 6 \u00bc  percent. The floor of the interest rate corridor was set as 5.75%, and the ceiling as 6.75%.    On April 23, the CBA undertook several measures to assist the financial sector. This included: (I) a relaxation of capital requirements (system wide and the countercyclical capital buffer) and risk weights on mortgage loans; (ii) a moratorium on late fees and interest rate penalties; (iii) guarantees on insurance premiums; and (iv) suspension of inspections of credit institutions.    On April 27, the CBA appointed temporary administrators in four banks. Two of the banks were closed on April 28, with the other two closed on May 12.    On May 19, the CBA signed a $200 million swap agreement with the EBRD, aimed at improving the flow of financial resources to the real sector. The swap enables the EBRD to provide domestic currency credit support to local companies, including for short-term liquidity needs, working capital and restructuring of exposure for existing clients, as well as trade finance and emergency support to key infrastructure providers.

Borders were initially reopened for international travel on July 1, as part of a phased plan that began with a reopening for boaters and private aviation on June 15. Soon after, confirmed cases increased rapidly, leading the government to issue a new order for travel procedures and restrictions on July 22 and new lockdown restrictions in August. Lockdown restrictions have been gradually rolled back since mid-August. Visitors, returning citizens, and residents need to obtain a RT-PCR test no more than seven days prior to their travel to The Bahamas. In addition, and to ensure that travelers remain COVID free, a rapid antigen test will be conducted four days after arrival in The Bahamas. Weekend lockdown measures, initiated in October, in worst hit islands curtailed the prolonged rise in new cases, as testing capacity and tracing have also improved. Furthermore, protocols on The Bahamas\u2019 health travel visa are continuously being revised to prevent further spread that may arise from international and domestic travel.  The Bahamas is expected to receive 100,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from the World Health Organization.Key Policy Responses as of March 2, 2021Fiscal\t    The government is implementing various support measures totaling B$440 million (3.9 percent of GDP), including (i) B$25 million for health care, (ii) B$5 million for food programs, (iii) B$145 million for income support for job loss workers and self-employed , (iv) B$54 million to support business loans to SMEs with an additional B$5 million allocated to grants to assist with payroll expenses, (v) B$141 million to provide tax deferrals and credits to companies with a minimum of 25 employees and annual sales of B$3 million that retain at least 80 percent of staff, and (vi) B$1.8 million to support to Family Islands (specifically to be used for any COVID-19 related expenditure). Among them, B$103 million (0.8 percent of GDP) was executed in FY2019/20.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of The Bahamas (CBOB) has arranged with domestic banks and credit unions to provide a 3-month deferral against repayments on credit facilities for businesses and households that were negatively impacted by the pandemic. Some financial institutions announced credit support extending well beyond the 3-month period.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t        The CBOB has suspended all exchange control approvals for domestic bank dividends.

For commercial banks, the ceiling on the Bahamian open position on foreign    exchange transactions has been relaxed to the maximum of 5 percent of    Tier11 capital, removing the more binding limit of B$5 million on net long    exposures that constrained most institutions.        The CBOB suspended approval of applications to purchase foreign currency for transactions via the Investment Currency Market (ICM) and the Bahamas Depositary/Depository Receipt (BDR) program. Both programs fund external portfolio investments.        The CBOB has requested the National Insurance Board to repatriate some of    its external assets, excluding any exposures to Bahamas and Caribbean    domestic issuers.        Back to Top BahrainBackground. Bahrain has been hit by the spread of COVID-19 and by the recent sharp decline in oil prices. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 24, 2020. Since then, a total of 123\u2019531 infections (as of March 2nd, 2021) have been recorded. To contain the rapid spread of COVID-19, the authorities have expanded social distancing and stay-at-home measures: closing educational institutions, retail shops, restaurants and cinemas; suspending flights to infected areas; suspending prayers in mosques; rescheduling major events; restricting gathering to 5 people; introducing mandatory use of masks while in public; and switching to remote working at public entities. Recently introduced measures include a reduction of private schools\u2019 tuitions by 5-10 percent and a provision to accommodate expatriates in temporary housing where social distancing practices can be maintained. The authorities are also expanding intensive care units (ICU) facilities should the existing stock of ICU beds become insufficient.  Bahrain began its vaccination campaign in late 2020 and has administered 302\u2019671 vaccine doses (as of March 2nd, 2021), one of the highest per capita rates in the world. Vaccines are offered to all residents free of cost.Reopening measures. In a series of steps over April 9-23, the authorities have permitted reopening of retail stores subject to some strict operational conditions. Stores that reopen should require every customer to wear a mask, operate with a reduced number of employees, and prevent overcrowding at their premises, ensuring continuous sterilization of premises setting up queues to enter to enforce social distancing.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A BD 560 million ($1.5 billion or 4.2 percent of GDP) stimulus package to respond to the economic distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic was announced on March 17.

In addition, to respond to urgent health needs created by COVID-19, the Cabinet has authorized the Minister of Finance and National Economy to withdraw from the general account BD 177 million ($470 million or 1.3 percent of GDP), which has subsequently been added to the 2020 budget on July 13, 2020. On April 8, 2020 a further BD 5.5 million enhancement to social benefits for lower income families was announced. On April 20 the authorities announced their objective to reduce non-priority government agencies expenditure by up to 30 percent and delay some capital expenditure to accommodate lower oil revenues due to the decline in oil prices. Other measures announced include the extension of the existing package to drivers, driving instructors and nurseries, as well as a proposal to delay the collection of some claims on nationals.

In January 2021 the authorities extended the following measures: i) support 50% of salaries of Bahrainis in the most affected sectors; ii) fees exemption for tourist facilities; iii) financial support to SMEs through Tamkeen.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 17, the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) expanded its lending facilities to banks by up to BHD 3.7 billion ($10 billion or 28 percent of GDP) to facilitate deferred debt payments and extension of additional credit. The CBB has also followed the Fed\u2019s interest rate cuts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: the one-week deposit facility rate was cut (in two steps) from 2.25% to 1.0%, the overnight deposit rate from 2.0% to 0.75%, and the overnight lending rate (in one step) from 4.0% to 2.45%. Other key measures to support banks and their clients include: (i) reducing the cash reserve ratio for retail banks from 5% to 3%; (ii) relaxing loan-to-value ratios for new residential mortgages; (iii) capping fees on debit cards; and (iv) requesting banks to offer a six-month deferral of repayments without interest or penalty and to refrain from blocking customers' accounts if a customer has lost his or her employment. The CBB is also following up with banks on suitability of banks' contingency plans. The loan deferral was subsequently extended through the first half of 2021. Finally, the CBB has also been following up with banks on suitability of banks' contingency plans.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top BangladeshBackground. Bangladesh reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 on March 8, 2020. On March 23, the government declared a general holiday from March 26 to May 30, leading to the closure of government offices, private offices, and courts, and shorter operating hours for commercial banks. On April 8, the government restricted operations in Rohingya refugee camps to critical services and assistance only, citing the need to minimize risk within the camp setting. Starting May 31, closures and movement restrictions were gradually lifted. Civil servants have returned to their offices and public transport has resumed. While the number of cases remains low, the reluctance to be tested remains challenging. On December 21, the government announced the \u2018no mask, no service\u2019 policy and the mandatory use of masks when outside. On January 26, 2021, Bangladesh launched its vaccination program. As on March 03, 2021, the total number of registrations for vaccination was 4,636,396 and the total number of people who received vaccinations was 3,460,159. . Beyond the domestic impact of the health crisis, the economy has been sharply impacted by the slowdown in export oriented ready-made garments sector which accounts for more than eighty percent of exports. Following the outbreak, export orders worth several billion US dollars were cancelled or postponed. Foreign remittances (US$ 18.2 billion in FY20) initially declined around the onset of the pandemic but picked up during the fiscal year. The second wave, in the economies of the major trading partners, is expected to dampen the recent pick up in export demand. Remittance inflows have been steadily increasing, starting FY21, partly reflecting the central bank\u2019s incentives to repatriate funds through official channels.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A series of fiscal measures have been introduced to contain and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. At end-March 2020, the Ministry of Finance issued a revised budget for FY20, including Tk. 2.5 billion in additional resources, to fund the Ministry of Health\u2019s COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan and expand the existing transfer programs that benefit the poor. Increased allocation was made to the Open Market Sale program to facilitate the purchase of rice at one-third the market price. On March 31, the Ministry of Finance announced a Tk. 50 billion (about US$ 588 million) stimulus package for exporting industries to be channeled through Bangladesh Bank (BB) and distributed by the commercial banks at a 2 percent service charge. This special fund, for worker\u2019s salary support, was disbursed through mobile financial services and bank accounts benefitting close to 4 million workers over a four-month period. The Ministry of Finance is also subsidizing interest payments on working capital loans of up to Tk. 600 billion (about US$ 7,067.1 million) provided by scheduled banks to businesses. On April 15, the Prime Minister announced the allocation of Tk. 21.3 billion (about US$ 250.9 million) under a housing scheme for the homeless, Tk.15 billion (about US$ 176.7 million) for the poor who faced job losses from the pandemic, Tk.7.5 billion (about US$ 88.3 million) to provide health insurance for government employees most at risk, and Tk. 1 billion (about US$ 11.8 million) in bonus payments for public health workers treating COVID-19 patients. The Prime Minister has also announced that Tk. 20 billion (about US$ 235.6 million) in interest payments on behalf of 13.8 million loan recipients negatively impacted by the national shutdown will be covered by the government. Thus far, Tk. 336 billion (about US$ 3957.6 million) of fiscal stimulus has been announced, of which Tk.162.1 billion (about US$ 1,909.3 million) has been disbursed as of end-November. In addition, the National Board of Revenue has suspended duties and taxes on imports of medical supplies, including protective equipment and test kits. The FY21 Budget includes higher allocations for health, agriculture, and social safety net programs, although effective targeting remains a challenge. As a precautionary measure, the government has decided that 25 percent of budgetary allocations for development projects will be placed on hold, affecting low-priority projects. It has approached donors seeking budget support. In January 2021, the government increased the COVID-19 Emergency Response and Pandemic Preparedness Project costs by Tk 56.6 billion (about US$ 666.7 million) mostly reflecting the procurement, preservation and distribution of vaccines. The government has announced two additional stimulus packages- Tk. 15 billion for the micro and cottage entrepreneurs and Tk. 12 billion cash assistance program for the disadvantaged elderly people, widows and female divorcees.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    To ensure adequate liquidity in the financial system, in March 2020, BB announced the purchase of treasury bonds and bills from banks. The repo rate was successively cut from 6 percent to 4.75 percent over three cuts from March to July. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks was reduced on both a daily (from 5 to 3.5 percent) and a bi-weekly basis (from 5.5 to 4 percent). The CRR was also cut for offshore banking operations, effective July 1, and for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs), effective June 1. The advance-deposit ratio and investment-deposit ratio was raised by 2 percent to facilitate credit to the private sector and improve liquidity. The Export Development Fund was raised from US$ 3.5 billion to US$ 5 billion, with the interest rate slashed to 1.75 percent and the refinancing limit increased. BB has created several refinancing schemes totaling Tk 390 billion (about US$ 4.6 billion), a 360-day tenor special repo facility, and a credit guarantee scheme for exporters, farmers, and SMEs to facilitate the implementation of the government\u2019s stimulus packages. BB also announced an agriculture subsidy program that will be in place until mid-2021. In addition, BB has taken measures to delay non-performing loan classification, relax loan rescheduling policy for NBFIs, waive credit card fees and interests, suspend loan interest payments, relax credit risk rating rules for banks, impose restrictions on bank dividend payments, extend tenures of trade instruments, and ensure access to financial services. Recently, BB imposed an additional 1.0 percent general provision against loans that have enjoyed deferral/time extension facilities.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    Foreign exchange rules were eased by BB to: (i) provide foreign currency to Bangladeshi nationals facing problems while returning home due to travel disruptions; and (ii) allow foreign owned/controlled companies operating in Bangladesh to access short term working capital loans from their parent companies/shareholders abroad to meet actual needs for payments of wages and salaries. International factoring was introduced to accelerate exports. BB has been intervening in the foreign exchange market to keep the exchange rate relatively stable following the COVID-19 outbreak.    Back to Top BarbadosBackground. The government took swift actions to contain the spread of the virus. Within days of the first confirmed case (March 16, 2020), measures to activate isolation and treatment centers, impose limits on public gatherings, and establish supplementary medical facilities were taken. On April 3, a 24-hour curfew became effective restricting non-essential personnel to their residences and closing non-essential businesses. Enhanced screening measures are in place at all ports of entry but the mandatory 14-day quarantine for all travelers arriving in Barbados has been replaced with a testing program to facilitate the resumption of tourism. Spillovers from the global pandemic to the critical tourism sector have been significant with the shut-down of commercial airlift at end-March, which resulted in widespread labor furloughs and temporary hotel closures. Commercial airlift resumed on a limited basis in July but prospects for the recovery of tourism remain highly uncertain. The virtual collapse in tourism during the global pandemic\u2014which accounts for 40 percent of economic activity\u2014will significantly depress overall economic activity in 2020.Reopening of the Economy. The authorities adopted a four-phase approach to reopen the economy following the national lockdown in March 2020. The strategy ranges from a complete lockdown (Phase 1) to a phased removal of social and economic restrictions (during Phase 2 to 3) to a resumption of life as normal once the population has been adequately vaccinated (Phase 4).  An outbreak in COVID-19 cases in early 2021 prompted the authorities to reimpose a second national pause during February. The implementation of the National Vaccination strategy got underway in the second half of February with roughly 20 percent of Barbados\u2019 adult population vaccinated to date.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The Government of Barbados (GoB) identified upfront emergency health and capital expenditures needed to manage and mitigate the spread of infection. This included resources to refurbish the hospital and clinics, build isolation centers, and provision critical medications and supplies. In addition, the GoB have boosted priority capital spending and introduced social programs for displaced workers to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the economy. This included infrastructure investment to renovate schools, government buildings and industrial complexes, as well as a Household Survival Program. The latter involves a minimum income for households made unemployed by COVID-19 and supplemental unemployment benefits though the National Insurance Scheme. Traditional unemployment benefit and severance payment schemes, however, have provided a broad-based first line of defense for displaced workers during the economic downturn. The targeted clearance of roughly 1\u00a0percent of GDP in outstanding income tax and VAT arrears provided an additional infusion of liquidity to households and businesses. The authorities also rolled out a deferred public wage-savings scheme (BOSS) to help finance a stepped-up capital investment program intended to boost growth while the tourism sector recovers from the COVID shock.    On September 15, 2021 the Governor General announced additional policy measures during a Throne Speech to open a new session of Parliament. Key initiatives include a 12-month jobs program and a tourism-sector stimulus and transformation package (available for up to two years). The Governor General reiterated the government\u2019s commitment to long-term debt reduction\u2014which underpins the ongoing financial arrangement with the IMF\u2014while indicating that a reduction in the debt-GDP ratio may not be possible during next two years as the economy works through the impact of the COVID-19 shock. On balance, the pandemic response has prompted the Government of Barbados to lower its primary balance target to minus 1 percent of GDP for FY2020/21 (compared to a surplus of 6 percent of GDP envisaged prior to the pandemic, and a surplus  of 3 percent target announced during the March budget presentation).    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) announced a series of measures (effective April 1, 2020) to help support commercial banks and other deposit-taking institution manage the economic fallout from the coronavirus shock. Specifically: i) the Bank\u2019s discount rate at which it provides overnight lending to banks and deposit-taking non-banks licensed under the Financial Institutions Act was reduced from 7 percent to 2 percent; ii) the securities ratio for banks was lowered from 17.5 percent to 5 percent; iii) the 1.5\u00a0percent securities ratio for non-bank deposit taking licensees was eliminated; and, iv) the Bank indicated it stands ready to make collateralized loans for up to six months as liquidity support for licensees. These measures follow an agreement brokered by the GoB for commercial banks to provide forbearance in the form a 6-month debt-payment moratorium for individuals and business directly impacted by COVID-19 (expired end-September). Banks are now working with individual borrowers as needed on further repayment extensions.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top BelarusBackground. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on February 28.The government has been implementing a range of measures to delay the spread of the disease and to support individuals and businesses. Containment measures currently in place\u2014limited relative to other countries\u2014include travel restrictions, social distancing, and recommendations for schools,education and work places.In mid-October, the Ministry of Health issued enhanced recommendations to businesses and non-profit organization on social distancing, limiting any meeting with more than 5 participants and encouraging video conferencing.In some regions such as Minsk,there has also been cancelation of public events. For travel abroad, the Ministry of Health has developed a certificate of the absence of COVID-19.Policy measures are elaborated below.First re-opening measures became effective in mid-June: The national airline Belavia continues to update its international flight schedule (flights to Russia resumed in late September)and restrictions on transit truckers were lifted. Since October, the duration of self-isolation for those returning from red zone countries is 10 days. In addition to the impact of the Covid pandemic, Belarus faces a gradual loss of oil price subsidies from Russia through the \u201ctax maneuver\u201d till 2024, the economic impact of protests and strikes that are taking place since the presidential election of August 9, 2020, andthe recent oil-price shock and its negative impact on the price of Belarus' exports of refined products.Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government has announced a package of fiscal measures, which include additional resources for the healthcare sector (including salary allowances for essential personnel) and tax relief and tax deferral measures to support businesses. Some of these measures are being implemented on the local government level (e.g. in Minsk on June 1 and June 11). The possible total fiscal impact of these measures has not yet been published. In addition, public sector salaries are being kept at least at the legislated minimum and subsidies are being granted to public sector organizations forced into part-time employment or to stand idle for a specified time.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    Key measures include: (i) credit holidays, i.e., guidance to banks to postpone principal repayments and interest on loans in a targeted manner; (ii) mitigation of a number of prudential requirements: softening of assets classification requirements; including looser requirements on FX loans; increasing the maximum risk standard for one debtor; suspending indexation of regulatory capital of banks or other financial corporations; lowering the liquidity coverage ratio; and softening credit risk requirements for systemically important borrowers when calculating the normative capital adequacy ratio (iii) guidance on suspension of dividend distributions; (iv) softening of recommendations on interest rate ceilings on deposits and credits, and the associated risk assessment; (v) recommendations to banks on restraining from increasing interest rates on restructured debt; (vi) partially releasing the capital conservation buffer; (vii) extending the maturity of the central bank\u2019s refinancing loans for banks. The central bank also reduced the policy rate twice during the Covid pandemic period to 7,75 percent (from July 1).

The government at the time implemented a range of measures to contain the pandemic, including closures of schools and non-essential businesses, limiting movement to essential needs, as well as banning all gatherings and non-essential travel abroad. The economy contracted by 3.4 and 11.8 percent (q/q) in the first two quarters of 2020, followed by a rebound to 11.6 percent in the third quarter, and another contraction of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter; bringing the contraction for the year as a whole to 6.3 percent.Reopening of the economy. Since early May, a reopening plan conditional on health outcomes has seen the reopening in four phases of sectors and activities according to their degree of contact intensity. Following an uptick in cases from mid-July, the fifth phase of the reopening plan was put on hold, with some restrictions tightened. Despite a partial easing from late August, strict social-distancing rules remained in place. Amidst a sharp resurgence of cases and hospitalizations since early October, wide-ranging restrictions on activity and mobility were imposed on October 19, followed by a new lockdown from November 2, albeit less stringent than in spring, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen from December 1. In response to a stagnation in the decline in infection rates and the emergence of new, more contagious strains of the virus, travel and telework rules and controls have been progressively tightened (Consultative Committee decisions of December 18, December 30 and January 22) and containment measures were extended by ministerial decree from January 15 to March 1, 2021 following the Consultative Committee\u2019s meeting on January 8 and to April 1, 2021 in the meeting on February 5.  Some contact-intensive businesses reopened in steps from February 8, 13, or March 1. Further easing was considered premature in the Consultative Committee meetings on February 26 and March 3. In general, the relaxation of restrictions will be guided by infection, hospitalization, and reproduction rates, and differentiated by sector according to epidemiological risks. The vaccination campaign was launched on January 5, 2021, prioritizing the inoculation of nursing home residents and health care staff, with the aim to immunize 9mn Belgians by September but supply side constraints have caused some delays.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government put in place a package of fiscal measures to address the crisis, detailed in its  2021 Draft Budgetary Plan with an estimated budget impactof \u20ac17.5 bn (3.9 percent of GDP) in 2020-21, and complemented by some \u20ac52bn (about 12 percent of GDP) of  loan guarantees. Key measures include: (i) boosting health expenditure and hospital funding; (ii) increasing support for those in temporary unemployment and self-employed; (iii) liquidity support through postponements of social security and tax payments for companies and self-employed;(iv) solvency support through various tax and \"below-the-line\" measures; and (v) additional support to affected firms and households provided by subnational governments. A reinsurance scheme for short-term trade credit insurance, and other socio-economic measures have further supported these efforts. Following a first extension of key existing schemes in June, though more targeted at hard-hit sectors and vulnerable groups, the federal and regional governments have announced additional support in response to the re-imposition of restrictions from mid-October. These are mostly in the form of a further extension or expansion of existing, temporary measures.Additional extensions and new measures have been announced in February 2021.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    For monetary policy at the currency union level, please see Euro Area section.    Other measures taken by the Belgian authorities include: (i) a reduction in the counter-cyclical bank capital buffer to 0 percent, retracting an increase to 0.5 percent that was supposed to become effective inJune, whileproviding forward guidance of no change until at least mid-2021; (ii) a  ban on the short-selling of stocks between March 18 and May 18; and (iii) a  suspension of debt servicing to banks and insurers by households and companies affected by the crisis until end-June 2021, respectively.        Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top BelizeBackground. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 23. In response, the authorities closed the international airport and schools and implemented mandatory quarantines. They also declared a national state of emergency and nighttime curfew during April, under which people were not allowed to leave their homes except for buying essential goods, attending medical appointments, or to work in essential services. The national state of emergency was later extended until end-June, although with less stringent regulations. These measures we effective to contain the pandemic until early June. However, there have been a second wave of infections since then, with the number of cases increasing to around 5000 and the number of deaths to about 100 as of November 20.The COVID-19 pandemic hit when the economy was already in recession due to drought and a slowdown in tourism in the second half of 2019. The impact of the pandemic on the economy is projected to be severe due to the collapse in tourism activity and the indirect effects of the necessary containment and mitigation measures. As a result, Belize is projected to experience a deep recession in 2020 and only a gradual recovery as the pandemic wanes.Reopening of the economy. The national state of emergency ended in June, allowing more businesses to reopen. The international airport reopened on October 1 with appropriate protocols for testing and tracing. However, the number of international flights to Belize is only a fraction of its pre-pandemic levels and tourism activity has been slow to recover.Key Policy Responses as of November 20, 2020Fiscal\t    In March, Belize announced fiscal stimulus amounting to BZ$25 million (1 percent of GDP) in 2020 to provide short term relief to employees affected by the crisis, especially those in the tourism sector. So far, more than 40,000 applications for unemployment relief have been approved. Additional support to the healthcare sector and the unemployed has been financed with loans from bilateral and multilateral creditors.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of Belize has adopted prudential measures to maintain the flow of credit in the economy: (i) reducing the statutory cash reserve requirements; (ii) extending the time period to classify targeted non-performing loans in sectors such as restaurants, transportation and distribution companies, and other affected areas, from 3 months to 6 months; (iii) encouraging domestic banks and credit unions to provide grace periods for servicing interest and/or principal of commercial and ancillary loans, as needed and where commercially viable; (iv) reducing risk-weights for banks on loans in the tourism sector from 100 percent to 50 percent; and (v) reviewing financial institutions\u2019 business continuity and cybersecurity plans to ensure that an adequate level of financial services will be available to the public.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top BeninBackground. Benin reported its first COVID-19 case on March 16, 2020. Although\u00a0the number of active cases has remained lower than in neighboring countries, it is also trending upward slowly. The authorities have swiftly implemented strong containment and social distancing measures, including the partial lockdown (cordon sanitaire) around ten cities most exposed to the pandemic to isolate the contaminated population and contain the spread of the virus. They have also (i) significantly limited the transit of people across land borders; (ii) restricted the issuance of entry visas to the country; (iii) introduced a systematic and compulsory quarantine of all people coming to Benin by air; (iv) suspended all public gatherings; (v) introduced a ban on the movement of public transportation; and (vi) made wearing face mask in public compulsory. Economic activity was mostly affected during the second quarter of 2020, due to containment and mitigation measures in Benin and the global economic slowdown, while some signs of recovery appeared in June 2020. Agriculture, commerce and trade, transport, and the hospitality industry were among the most affected sectors. Inflation has been on the rise, driven by higher food and transport prices. Import and value chains disruptions, lower travel and tourism receipts in addition to diminished inflow of remittances have resulted in widening of current account deficit. The economic impact of the pandemic has also materialized through higher sovereign spreads, which remained elevated since the outset of the pandemic. The fiscal position has deteriorated as a result of the implementation of the authorities\u2019 COVID-19 response plan (see section on fiscal response below).In addition to Covid-19, Benin continues to be impacted by the closure of border with Nigeria. On 20 August 2019, Nigeria decided unilaterally to close the border with some neighboring countries, including Benin. The Nigerian authorities motivated their decision by the need to curb smuggling and spur local agricultural production. Following a 16-month border closure, the Nigerian authorities announced in December 2020 the immediate reopening of Nigerian land border-crossing point with Benin. Nonetheless, traffic remains limited to private vehicles and pedestrians. Following the meeting of the presidents of two countries in January 2021, a working group has been set up with objective of resuming the land trade by end-May 2021.Reopening of the economy. The authorities have announced measures to gradually start reopening the economy, with the cordon sanitaire lifted on May 6, 2020. Middle schools, high schools and universities resumed their activities on May 11, 2020. Public transportation, places of worship and bars resumed their activities on June 2, 2020. International flights resumed on July 15th, 2020, accompanied by strict protocols for testing and quarantine for new arrivals. The gradual reopening is subject to continued social distancing guidelines and mandatory use of masks, among other measures.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities acted swiftly to contain the spread and mitigate the economic impact of the virus. Cognizant that the impact of the virus will spill over into 2021, they have adopted a set of measures in 2020 amounting to CFAF 323 billion or 3.7 percent of GDP, and extending over 2020-22, with the majority of the plan already having been executed in 2020 (2 percent of GDP, or CFAF 178 billion). These measures comprise (i) a health preparedness and response plan for 2020 (0.9 percent of GDP) and 2021 (0.7 percent of GDP), and (ii) a socio-economic response plan to support formal sector companies (0.9 percent of GDP) and vulnerable households\u2014for the latter, through cash transfers, electricity and water bills subsidies, and urgent social projects (0.2 percent of GDP). In addition, a public guarantee plan (1.0 percent of GDP) and credit lines and refinancing measures (0.7 percent of GDP) were established to foster access to finance for micro, small, and medium enterprises.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks\u2019 demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity. In April 2020, the BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25 basis points lower than before the crisis. In June2020, the Monetary Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO has also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance institutions to accommodate demands from solvent customers with Covid19-related repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period up to end-2020 debt service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims as non-performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of 3-month \"Covid-19 T-Bills\" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The amount of such special T-Bills initially issued initially by Benin amounted to 1.5 percent of GDP, with some rollover possibility through similar bonds benefitting from a refinancing rate equivalent to the prevailing monetary policy rate but to be all paid back by end-2020. The BCEAO has launched in February 2021 a special 6-month refinancing window at the floor of the interest rate corridor to help WAEMU governments meet Covid recovery funding needs. Through this special window banks shall be able to refinance all bonds with maturity of 3 years or more governments currently plan to issue on the regional financial market in 2021. The amount of bonds eligible to the new refinancing window for Benin is equivalent to 5.3 percent of projected 2021 GDP. The new refinancing window is expected to remain in place for the term of the eligible bonds issued in 2021. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basle II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead of 2022 initially planned. In addition, in June 2020, the West African Development Bank (BOAD) decided to create a CFAF 100 billion window for extending 5 to 7 year refinancing of banks\u2019 credit to SMEs in the 8 WAEMU member countries. In December 2020, the BCEAO instructed WAEMU banks to refrain from distributing dividends with a view to strengthening their capital buffers in anticipation of the impact of the Covid crisis on asset quality.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top BhutanBackground.  Bhutan confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on March 6, 2020. Active cases have increased since December 2020, following the outbreak in Thimpu. On December 23, 2020, Bhutan announced a second lockdown following a local transmission detected in Thimpu (the first lockdown was in August 2020). Under the lockdown, only designated shops within the zones and essential services were available but all schools, institutions, offices and business establishments were  closed. Since the start of the pandemic, the economic impact of COVID-19 has been substantial, driven by the adverse impact on the tourism and related services sector.Reopening of the economy. An Air Travel Bubble Arrangement has been agreed between the Royal Government of Bhutan and the Government of India, subject to standard quarantine and testing procedures. On January 7, 2021, the lockdown in the border town of Phuentsholing was eased. From February 1, 2021, following the conclusion of mass testing, the lockdown in Paro and Thimpu has been eased, allowing economic activities, schools, offices and business to resume.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Linked to the Build Bhutan initiative, the government has launched the Specialised Firms initiatives to boost youth employment in various construction schemes. The government announced a National Resilience Fund for mitigating COVID-19 linked to job losses and salary cuts. The support included grant for individuals directly affected by the pandemic and full interest waiver on loans contracted since April 10, 2020 until June 2020. These measures were extended until September 2020, and partial (50 percent) interest waiver will continue until March 2021. In addition, fiscal stimulus in the FY 2020-21 budget includes the implementation of an Economic Contingency Plan (ECP) aimed at helping different sectors, including tourism resilience, agriculture, Build Bhutan (BB) and improvement of farm roads over and above annual budget (Nu 4 billion) and allocating higher level of capital outlay to frontload and accelerate activities from the 12th Five Year Plan. Current expenditure has been rationalized in response to expected fall in revenues and to ensure that it is covered by the domestic revenue. A budget of Nu.1.3 billion has been re-appropriated for health, essential food and fuel, quarantine and related initiatives. Support will be provided to FCB to stock essential food and non-food items. It is deepening fiscal decentralization with upscaling of national grants. Other measures: an additional resource of Nu. 2 billion will be provided to the Ministry of Health to meet health-related spending; Business Income tax (BIT) and Corporate Income tax (CIT) filing for the income year 2019 was deferred until June 30, 2020 and tax payments, for tourism and related sectors (hotel, airlines and tour operators) are deferred until December 31, 2020, while for other sectors until September 30, 2020; deferred payment of sales tax and customs duty on essential items (March to June 2020); waiver of payment of rent and other charges (April-December 2020) by tourism-related business entities leasing government properties, deferral of electricity charges payment for industry (till December 2020), free electricity and wi-fi services to hotels serving as quarantine facility (July-September 2020). As of May 25, the government will be refunding the 5 percent sales tax collected on telecom services collected on or after January 16, 2020. The government is mobilizing additional resources such as grants and concessional borrowing as well as bilateral and in-kind financing to support capital spending. Investments in GovTech is allowing Bhutan to reap benefits during COVID-19 including fast disbursement of cash relief funds. In late September, the first sovereign offering of a 3-year domestic bond of US$ 41 million (or Nu. 3 billion) at 6.5 per cent was issued to support increasing fiscal needs.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On October 5, the government launched the National Credit Guarantee Scheme (NCGS), to boost investments of both small and medium enterprise, by providing collateral requirement relief and a substantial credit guarantee.  Effective April 14, Phase I monetary relief measures were introduced by the RMA. Many of these measures were extended under Phase II (July 8), including the waiver of interest on loans (until September 2020) and partial waiver (until March 2021), extension of deferred monthly loan instalment repayment (until June 2021), granting financial institutions the provision of bridging loans as concessional term-based loan (5% interest rate for the tenure of the loan) for CIT and BIT filing business agencies, conversion of concessional working capital soft loans to tourism, manufacturing and wholesale business (April-June 2020) to term loans for 4 years at 5% rate, extension of soft loans to cottage and small industries through the CSI Development Bank (microloans at 2 percent interest for agriculture and rural activities and working capital loans at 4 percent interest rate) by 12 months to June 2021. The government and the RMA will conduct an in-depth assessment of NPLs from July 2020 to facilitate rehabilitation and/or foreclosures of NPLs. To facilitate the implementation of  Phase I measures, RMA further reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 200 basis point to 7 percent. RMA will open a liquidity window for FSPs (inter-bank borrowing system) and will release liquidity through reduction of CRR only if the liquidity crunch is of a systemic nature. The RMA is further promoting the use of digital banking platforms during the current lockdown situation. On November 2, the RMA announced a forward-looking web-based domestic liquidity management system (DLMS) to improve systemwide liquidity management and to facilitate the development of a reference rate. On December 25, 2020, in response to the second lockdown, the RMA activated the 24/7 Command Call Centre to ensure uninterrupted financial services and have notified financial institutions to make their digital financial services available round-the-lock. On February 11, 2021, the RMA has announced a NPL resolution framework recommended by the National High Level NPL Committee to support new credit supply in the economy.         Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    On March 24, ban on select food product (e.g., betel leaf, betel nut) import from India has been imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19. As of June 29, import of luxury motor vehicles and bikes have been suspended. The pandemic is presenting opportunities for increasing regional bilateral co-operation including recently agreed Preferential Trade Agreement with Bangladesh, Small Development Project Committee (SDPC) from Bhutan and India supporting frontloading of projects under the 12 th FYP as well as continuing support from development partners.     Back to Top BoliviaBackground. The first confirmed case was reported on March 10, 2020. While Bolivia was initially spared from the full force of the pandemic, it suffered a peak in new cases during July and August, after which the situation gradually improved until the start of December. However, new cases have been increasing over the last month, reaching a new peak at end-January.  As of March 3, there are 250,557 confirmed cases, and 11,703 deaths have been reported. The previous government took a series of measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including a generalized lockdown, entailing the temporary closure of many businesses, border closure and suspension of schools, and postponed the general elections scheduled initially on May 3. On March 25, the previous authorities announced the state of health emergency until April 15 and further tightened the quarantine orders, completely closing the borders, restricting the movement of people to once a week, and prohibiting movements of vehicles except for security and health reasons. The national quarantine has been extended several times and the country is now in a stage of post-confinement with reopening modifications (see below). Wearing a facemask in public places is mandatory, certification of a negative COVID-19 test is required to enter the country and public events have reopened but must comply with biosecurity measures regulated by municipalities and local government. Efforts are underway to strengthen Bolivia\u2019s health care system, which has struggled to accommodate the demands arising from the pandemic. During 2020, the former interim President, several members of her cabinet, and the ex-president of the central bank tested positive for COVID-19. National elections, which occurred on October 18, were delayed twice owing to the pandemic. Reopening of the economy. By decree the post-confinement phase started on September 1 and has been extended by the new government. On September 1 entry into Bolivia by air on commercial flights was reopened. From December 1 entry by air, land and water has been permitted provided that nationals and foreigners entering the country present a negative test result for COVID-19, with the time allowed between test and arrival dependent on country of departure. Cultural, sporting, social and religious activities, electoral and recreational processes are permitted subject to biosecurity measures and other restrictions to avoid generate crowds decided by the regional governments. Restrictions on working hours have been lifted and commercial activities are permitted to operate on a continuous basis, however workplaces must try to avoid crowded workspaces through alternating schedules, and teleworking as a preferred option where possible. To protect the health of the older population their family members can be authorized to collect benefits on their behalf, such as Renta Dignidad, among other social transfers. Face-to-face classes are prohibited and schools returned after their summer break on February 1 in a virtual capacity. Departmental and municipal governments will determine commercial activity and other services not governed by the national decree and may add restrictions as needed by local conditions. The free virus testing was significantly increased since January. The government has agreements to receive the Russian Sputnik-V vaccine, and Astrazeneca-Oxford and Pfizer vaccines through the international agreement Covax. January 29 marked the first vaccination in Bolivia using the Sputnik-V vaccine, with the first batch of 20,000 doses of this vaccine (of 5.2 million committed). In March, Bolivia expects to receive 1 million vaccines from Covax, and other 1.7 million Sputnik-V vaccines and 100,000 from the Chinese Sinopharm.Key Policy Responses as of March 3, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities have provided direct relief payments of about $US 73 per child to households with children in public schools, a measure calculated to provide most of its benefits to poorer households. This payment was extended to students in private schools from May 18. In addition, the government instituted a program (Canasta Familiar) to make direct payments for food to 1.5 million families ($US 58 per family), pay the electric bills for three months for the consumers with lower consumption, and pay 50 percent of the potable water and gas for all households. From April 30, the government provided $US 73 to citizens who do not receive any other benefits or draw a salary from the public or private sector. The authorities also postponed the payment of some taxes (corporate income tax, VAT, and transaction tax) with the possibility to pay them in tranches. Payment of corporate income tax was deferred and independent workers can claim tax deductions against their expenses on health, schooling, food and related expenditures. The government created a $US 219 million fund to support the operations of micro, small and medium businesses. This fund will provide soft loans to companies to pay wage bills without layoffs for two months (companies can withdraw $US 1230 per employee, repayable in 18 months). Imports of $US 200 million worth of respiratory equipment are under way, while ICU capacity is being doubled.     The latest transfer to households (Bono Contra el Hambre) became available starting on December 1st. It provides a one-off transfer of about $146 for all eligible individuals, such as those who receive the universal transfer, mothers who are already recipients of targeted cash transfers, people with disabilities and citizens over the age of 18 who do not receive any type of public or private salary. On December 28 the government announced RE-VAT, a measure to refund VAT equivalent to up to 5% of an individual\u2019s purchase for those with an average monthly income equal to or less than about $1,311.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) injected 3.5 billion bolivianos (more than $500 million) into the financial system by purchasing bonds from the pension funds, which, in turn, are expected to deposit the money at banks, increasing the banking system liquidity by about 50 percent. Liquidity has also been increased by reducing reserve requirements in both local and foreign currency. The authorities announced that were suspending borrowers\u2019 loan repayments in the financial system up to the end of 2020, with the delayed installments to be paid at the end of the loan closure date. Starting in January 2021, the Financial System Authority (ASFI) has instructed banks to establish a \"grace\" period up to end-June, during which time borrowers will not pay interest  nor capital on the already suspended loans.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top Bosnia and HerzegovinaBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 5, 2020. In March, the government declared a state of emergency throughout the country, closed schools and universities, shuttered restaurants and shops, suspended public transportation, banned public gatherings, and imposed severe restrictions on the movement of people. Border are closed to non-BiH citizens. Incoming BiH citizens are quarantined for 14 days.Reopening of the economy. Both entities have ended their curfews for individuals of all ages. Most public events remain cancelled and public gatherings face limitations on total number of people present. Grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants, and cafes throughout the country are open, along with most other businesses.  Restaurants and bars must close by 11:00pm. There are still social distance restrictions in place. Social distance restrictions include limitations on the number of people who can attend public gatherings and a requirement to wear masks indoors, on public transportation, and in public areas when social distancing is not possible. Sarajevo airport has reopened to passenger traffic.\u00a0 BiH citizens and residents, and citizens of Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro may enter the country. Starting July 16, BiH borders are open for citizens and residents of EU and Schengen countries with a negative PCR test not older than 48 hours. Starting November 11, a new nighttime curfew has been imposed on most businesses as part of new measures to contain a second surge in the coronavirus.During January 2021, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) continued to see a high number\u2014although declining\u2014of daily COVID-19 cases, and COVID vaccination had not started. Restrictions remain in place and include a curfew on most businesses from 11:00 pm to 5:00 am, limitations on the number of people who can attend public gatherings, requirements to wear masks in outdoor and indoor public spaces and on public transportation.Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The BIH deployed substantial resources in 2020 to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 and support the economy and the households. These included strong support to the health sector and severely affected firms[It sounds misleading as if the amount of unemployment benefit (per worler) is increased. I know your writing is factually correct, but it is just to avoid misperception by the public.]. The health-sector support packages amounting to KM 223 million or 0.6\u00a0percent of GDP covered funding for medical supplies and facilities, hiring professionals, and raising their wages. Total support to households and firms amounted to KM603 million (or 1.9 percent of GDP). Both entities [Solidarity fund was already there before the pandemic in the RS. It was used in the natural disaster event such as flooding in the past.]used compensation/solidarity funds to help firms subsidize Social Security Contributions (SSC) and provide minimum wages to workers in affected sectors[In the RS, all firms received subsidies, while in the FBiH, the threshold was 20% decline in sales revenue.]. At the entity level, the FBIH provided KM55 million support to the health sector, KM180 million support for firms, and KM 256 million other support to cantons and municipalities. In contrast, the RS entity provided KM148 million support to the health sector, KM94 million support to firms, and KM36 million in the form of other support to municipalities and other public entities. In addition, the FBIH and RS governments established guarantee funds amounting to KM100 million and KM50 million, respectively. However, some delays in implementation occurred, particularly with regards to the provision of loan guarantees[I don\u2019t think coordination with local governments is required by legislation.].    Monetary and macro-financial\t    At the onset of the pandemic, banking agencies have adopted a six-month loan repayment moratoria for restructuring credit arrangements for individuals and legal entities that were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The application period for the aforementioned moratoria expired on December 31, 2020. Banking Agencies asked banks to closely monitor portfolio\u2019s exposures, in particular clients\u2019 affected by COVID-19. Banks have been also required to consider additional customer relief, including reviewing current fees for services and avoiding charging fees to handle exposure modifications. Further, a temporarily suspension of dividends or bonuses was applied to all banks, although the restriction on bonuses was relaxed at end-2020.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top BotswanaBackground. Botswana recorded its first case on March 31, 2020. The government has declared a state of emergency, effective April 2, 2020, and has adopted a list of containment measures, including social distancing and travel bans. The government has lifted some restrictions on May 22 after 7 weeks of lockdown. Since end-June, the country has recorded a resurgence of cases, resulting in a partial 2-weeks lockdown limited to the capital starting June 30. The state of emergency was also extended to April 2021, along with an extension on curfew period to the end of March but restrictions on travel, alcohol sales, and curfew have been eased. On the economic front, diamond sales, and tourism and travel activities have fallen sharply, and lockdowns in neighboring countries could disrupt both regional supply and demand. The parliament has approved the mid-term review of NDP 11 including a 14.5 billion stimulus to support the recovery and facilitate structural transformation. Botswana has made an upfront payment to COVAX, the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s vaccine arrangement, to acquire 940,800 vaccines under a two-dose regime, enough to cover about 20 percent of the population. In addition, Botswana has paid US$7.1 million to the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT) to secure more vaccine doses.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government established a COVID-19 Relief Fund with a 2 billion Pula (about 1.1 percent of GDP) contribution from the government that will: i) finance a wage subsidy amounting to 50% of salaries of affected businesses (1000-2500 pula per month for a period of 3 months; ii) finance a waiver\t on training levy for a period of 6 months (150 million pula). The MoF also decided a tax deferral of 75% of any quarterly payment between March and September 2020 to be paid by March 2021.; iii) Build-up of fuel and grain reserves, as well as acquisition of relevant medical equipment and improvement of water supply (475 million Pula); iv) Fund a government loan guarantee scheme of 1 billion Pula (20% financed by commercial banks) for businesses that are tax compliant (including those who are not eligible to pay taxes/). Guarantee covers a period of 24 months with a max of 25 billion pula per borrower. Reduce the VAT refund period (from 60 days to 21 days).    Monetary and macro-financial\t    At the meeting held on April 30, 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Botswana decided to reduce the Bank Rate by 50 basis points from 4.75 percent to 4.25 percent to support the domestic economy, and reduced the primary reserve requirement (PRR) from 5 percent to 2.5 percent to inject liquidity. The bank rate was further reduced by 50 basis points on October 8.    Banks and nonbanks have agreed to offer loan restructuring (including for mortgages and vehicles) and payment holidays for affected sectors. Life insurance payment premiums and retirement fund contributions have been rescheduled for at least three months. The Bank of Botswana relaxed rules to meet capital requirements and introduced measures to improve liquidity. Capital adequacy ratio for banks has been reduced from 15 to 12.5 percent, and regulatory forbearance for non-performing loans. Overnight funding costs were reduced, access to repo facilities broadened, collateral constraints for bank borrowing from the BoB extended to include corporate bonds and traded stocks, and electronic payments transaction limits have been raised.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The Bank of Botswana will implement a new annual downward rate of crawl of 2.87 percent with effect from May 1, 2020, representing a change from the current 1.51 percent. This is complementary to the reduction in the Bank Rate and contributes to further easing of real monetary conditions in the economy.    Back to Top BrazilBackground. The first confirmed case was reported on February 26, 2020, and over 10.5 million people have been infected. The case fatality rate is 2.4 percent. The pandemic reached a first peak in mid-August and had steadily receded through early November. However, a second wave has brough the number of daily cases and deaths to new highs. ICU vacancies have again fallen below 20 percent in nearly all states, prompting renewed lockdown measures. . There are no barriers to entry in Brazil by air travel but a negative PCR test is required. Restrictions to entry by land remain in place. Vaccination has started in mid-January and has reached 3 percent of the population. President Bolsonaro was diagnosed with Covid-19 on July 7 and has recovered.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the authorities announced a series of fiscal measures in 2020 adding up to 12 percent of GDP, of which the direct impact on the primary deficit was 8.2 percent of GDP. Congress declared a state of \u201cpublic calamity\u201d at the onset of the pandemic, lifting the government\u2019s obligation to comply with the primary balance target in 2020. The government has also invoked the escape clause of the constitutional expenditure ceiling to accommodate exceptional spending needs. Emergency measures were included in a separate (so called \u2018war\u2019) 2020 budget, not bound by the provisions of Brazil\u2019s Fiscal Responsibility Law and the constitutional golden rule. The fiscal measures included the expansion of heath spending, temporary income support to vulnerable households (cash transfers to informal and low-income workers, bringing forward the 13th pension payment to retirees, expanding the Bolsa Familia program with the inclusion of over 1 million more beneficiaries, and advance payments of salary bonuses to low income workers), employment support (partial compensation to workers which are temporarily suspended or have a cut in working hours, as well as temporary tax breaks), lower taxes and import levies on essential medical supplies, and new transfers from the federal to state governments to support higher health spending and as cushion against the expected fall in revenues. Public banks expanded credit lines for businesses and households, with a focus on supporting working capital (credit lines add up to 4.5 percent of GDP), and the government has backed over 1 percent of GDP in credit lines to SMEs and micro-businesses to cover payroll costs, working capital and investment. Most measures have expired in end 2020, but a renewal of the cash transfer prgram is under discussion in Congress.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The central bank lowered the policy rate (SELIC) by 225bps since mid-February 2020, to the historical low of 2 percent. Measures to increase liquidity in the financial system (reduction of reserve requirements and capital conservation buffers, and a temporary relaxation of provisioning rules, among others) have been implemented. The reserve requirement has been reduced from 25 to 17, on top of a reduction of 6 bps in early March, and the remuneration on reserve requirements on savings accounts was lowered to encourage lending. The central bank also opened a facility to provide loans to financial institutions backed by private corporate bonds as collateral, changed capital requirements for small financial institutions, and allowed banks to reduce provisions for contingent liabilities provided the funds are lent to SMEs. In addition, the Fed has arranged to provide up to US$60 billion to the central bank through a swap facility that remains in place.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The BRL/USD exchange rate has depreciated by about 29 percent since mid-February 2020. The central bank has intervened various times in the foreign exchange market since mid-February 2020 (both with spot and derivative contracts sales), by a total of 44.5 USD billion (about 12 percent of gross reserves) until end-2020 and 11.6 USD billion since then. The central bank resumed repo operations of Brazilian sovereign bonds denominated in US dollars, having released US$9 billion into the money market.    Back to Top Brunei DarussalamBackground. Brunei Darussalam reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 9, 2020. Since the outbreak, the authorities have prioritized policy measures to contain the pandemic, while rolling out economic relief packages to mitigate the impact on vulnerable sectors and support economic activities. Continuing testing/tracking of cases has enabled early isolation and treatment, with significant resources being channeled to the health sector. To meet the increasing needs of COVID-19 tests, an auxiliary virology laboratory has been constructed, which commenced operations on April 1. By early May, the number of confirmed cases has stabilized, allowing the authorities to gradually implement COVID-19 de-escalation measures. A contact-tracing app (\u201cBruHealth\u201d) has also been widely implemented, which is a necessary pre-condition for re-opening, in order to minimize the risk of a \u201csecond wave\u201d. Despite the impact of containment measures on domestic demand in the first half of the year, growth outturn was better-than-expected\u2014due to an exceptional pickup in downstream activities. However, latest data in Q3 showed that real GDP growth decelerated to 0.5 percent yoy, due to a larger drag from the oil and gas sector.Reopening of the economy. With the pandemic broadly under control, Brunei started relaxing COVID-19 restrictions since May 16, in phases. Since the re-opening, the total number of cases have remained largely stable. Confirmed new infections are limited to imported cases, with no local transmissions. Travel restrictions have also been gradually relaxed, where Brunei has established a reciprocal green lane with Singapore for short-term business and official trips effective September 1\u2014marking the country\u2019s first steps to re-establishing international travel. From September 15, foreigners are allowed to enter Brunei for essential travels (official business, education and health purposes). All inbound visitors will be required to undergo a minimum 2-14 days self-isolation period, depending on risk categories of the countries the travelers are from. So far, the health ministry has secured vaccine for 50 percent of the population through the COVAX Facility and sought additional vaccine through bilateral arrangement.  Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    On March 21, the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) announced targeted measures centered mainly around tax, utility and social security deductions/deferments to assist hardest-hit households and firms affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, while supporting demand. An interim fiscal package (effective April 1) has been deployed to support SMEs and self-employed groups in sectors such as tourism, hospitality, transport and restaurants. The fiscal measures include amongst others, the deferment of payments on Employees Trust Fund (TAP) and Supplementary Contributory Pension (SCP) contributions, discounts on corporate income taxes, rents and utilities.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 19, the Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD), working closely with MOFE as well as the financial industry, announced interim measures (effective April 1) to alleviate the financial burden on sectors hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective April 1, (i) businesses in the tourism, hospitality/event management, restaurants/cafes, and air transport sectors (\u201cAffected Sectors\u201d) will be given a six-month deferment of their principal repayments of financing/loans; (ii) the deferment is also extended to importers of food and medical supplies; and (iii) all bank fees and charges (except third party charges) that are related to trade and for payments of transactions in those Affected Sectors will be waived for a period of six months. To encourage social distancing and promote the usage of digital banking, online local interbank transfer fees and charges will be waived for a period of six months for all customers. Banks are also encouraged to review their lending rates in this current environment.    On March 30, the MOFE announced additional financial support measures amounting to an estimated total of BND250 million, effective April 1. This Economic Relief Package (i) extends the deferment on principal payments of financing or loan to all sectors, (ii) provides for the restructuring or deferment on principal repayment of personal loans and hire purchase such as car financing, for a period not exceeding 10 years, (iii) provides for the deferment on principal repayments of property financing, (iv) provides for the conversion of any outstanding credit card balances into term loans not exceeding 3 years for affected individuals in the private sector only (including the self-employed), and (v) waiver of all bank fees/charges related to these facilities (except third party charges). The deferment measures are effective from date of application approval until March 31, 2021.Coupled with the earlier fiscal assistance, the value of Brunei's Economic Stimulus Package amounted to a total of BND450 million (or 3.2 percent of GDP).    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top BulgariaBackground.After a mild and well contained first wave of the epidemic and severe second wave of infections, Bulgaria has entered a third wave with four-digit number of daily new cases. The extraordinary epidemic situation, which replaced the state of emergency introduced in mid-March, has been extended until April 30, coupled with partial lockdown. Despite the recent increase in the number of cases a gradual easing of the restrictions is underway, including reopening of restaurants as of March 1. Overall however, as the emergency epidemic situation has been prolonged much more than initially anticipated, the government announced a new set of social and economic measures.Preliminary data suggest a significant economic impact from the pandemic. The Bulgarian economy contracted by 3.8 percent in 2020. Exports decreased by more than 11 percent, while consumption and investment went down by 5.7 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively. As a result, imports dropped by 3.9 percent. Registered unemployment increased by 0.8 percentage point in the period February 2020-January 2021 and reached 7 percent. Meanwhile, the budget recorded a BGN 3.5 bn deficit (3.3 percent of GDP according to NSI data) in 2020, including an estimated COVID-response of around 2.4 percent of GDP, which comprised entirely nationally funded measures and the national co-financing of EU funding, redirected to cope with the pandemic in Bulgaria.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021FiscalThe key fiscal policy responses cumulative for 2020 and planned for 2021 include:Revenue measures: (i) tax relief for households with children with disabilities (BGN 143 mn); (ii) reduced VAT rate of 9\u00a0percent for restaurant services, books, baby food, wine, beer, tour operators and tourist trips, gyms and sports facilities and food delivery until end-2021 (BGN 343 mn) and (iii) VAT and customs duties relief for import of key medical supplies (BGN 3 mn).Expenditures for household support: (i) bonuses to pensions and minimum pension increase (BGN 1322 mn); (ii) parental support \u2013 BGN (180 mn); (iii) active labor market policies (BGN 14 mn); (iv) purchase of vaccines and medicines (BGN 106 mn); (v) tourism vouchers of BGN 210 for the people of the frontline (BGN 10 mn); (vi) increased unemployment benefits and other social support (BGN 297 mn);Expenditures for business support: (i) 60/40 wage subsidy scheme (BGN 1019 mn); (ii) support for artists, who have been hit by the lockdown (BGN 5 mn); (iii) tourism support (BGN 47 mn) and (iv) agricultural producers support (BGN 85 mn).Expenditures in the healthcare sector and public administration: (i) provision of PPA and other equipment to the state administration (BGN 35 mn); (ii) support of personnel on the frontline of the fight with COVID-19 (BGN 192 mn); (iii) additional financing of medical activities (BGN 748 mn); (iv) provision of PPA and other equipment to the medical establishments (BGN 130 mn); (v) subsidies and capital transfers to medical establishments (BGN 70 mn); (vi) COVID-related expenditures in education (BGN 68 mn) and (vii) additional remuneration in healthcare (BGN 237 mn).National co-financing of EU-funded measures at the amount of BGN 168 mn.Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Bulgaria National Bank has implemented the following measures. (i) capitalization of the 2019 profit in the banking system (about 1.4\u00a0percent of 2019 GDP) and capitalization of 2020 profit (about 0.68\u00a0percent of 2020 GDP); (ii) increase in liquidity of the banking system by BGN 7 billion (6\u00a0percent of 2019 GDP) by reducing foreign exposures of commercial banks; (iii) cancellation of the increase of the countercyclical capital buffer planned for 2020 and 2021 with effect amounting to BGN 0.7 billion, or about 0.6\u00a0percent of 2019 GDP; (iv) agreement on a moratorium on bank loan payments for up to 6 months but no later than December 2021 with deadline for requests set at end-March 2021; (v) establishment of EUR 2 billion swap line with the ECB until end-2020 or as long as necessary, with the maximum maturity of 3 months for each drawing. In addition, the government has put forward liquidity support measures, utilizing national and EU resources. The measures include (i) capital increase of the state-owned Bulgarian Development Bank (BDB) by BGN 700 million (0.6\u00a0percent of 2019 GDP), of which BGN 500 million to be used for the issuance of portfolio guarantees to commercial banks for the extension of corporate loans and the remaining BGN 200 million to provide interest-free loans to employees on unpaid leave, self-employed, and seasonal workers (up to BGN 6900, with extended deadline for applications up to end-June 2021).

Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    None.    Back to Top Burkina FasoBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 9, 2020. The government immediately adopted several containment measures, including social distancing, a nationwide curfew, closure of schools and universities, cancelation of major public events, closure of terrestrial borders, suspension of commercial flights, quarantine of the affected cities and the mandatory nationwide use of masks. The first wave of the outbreak ended with a decline in new infections since late April 2020. Following the general elections in November 2020, there has been a second, more aggressive, wave of infections.Reopening of the economy. The authorities eased some social and economic restrictions related to the first wave of the outbreak in late April 2020, including the reopening of some urban markets and venues of religious worship and suspension of quarantine of some cities. The reopening of passenger flights took place on August 1st. With the second wave of the outbreak ongoing since late November 2020, the authorities continue to enforce social distancing guidelines and mandatory use of masks, among other measures. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The Parliament on July 9, 2020 approved the revised 2020 budget which seeks to address the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. Several measures have been taken under the revised budget, including: (i) lowering import duties and VAT for hygiene and healthcare goods and services critical to tackle COVID-19, and for tourism businesses; (ii) lowering other selected tax rates; (iii) delaying tax payments, and waiving late payment fines and penalties; (iv) suspending government fees charged on informal sector operators for rent, security and parking in urban markets; (v) lowering the licensing fee for companies in the transportation and tourism sectors; (vi) suspending on-site tax inspection operations; (vii) Donating food and providing assistance to households and local small businesses; (viii) supporting the water and electricity bills, including through cancelation, of the most vulnerable social groups; and (ix) securing adequate stocks of consumer products and strengthening surveillance of prices.     The emergency response plan, initially prepared for March \u2013 June 2020, was updated to cover both health-related measures and measures to support the social and economic recovery. This includes a partial guarantee fund, which the government expects to leverage to help the financial sector inject fresh credit into the economy during 2020-2021 in support of private businesses in hard-hit sectors.     The revised 2020 budget widens the overall fiscal deficit to 5.3 percent of GDP, reflecting the impact of Covid19 especially on revenue collection, which is now projected to be 2.6 percent of GDP lower relative to the original budget. On the expenditure side, the authorities made room for COVID19-related health and transfers expenditures by keeping the wage bill unchanged, cancelling non-priority spending on goods and services and reducing transfers. The widening of the deficit is fully financed by additional external budget support.    On April 27, Heads of states of the West-Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) declared a temporary suspension of the WAEMU growth and stability Pact setting six convergence criteria, including the 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit rule, to help member-countries cope with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. This temporary suspension will allow member-countries to raise their overall fiscal deficit temporarily and use the additional external support provided by donors in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The Heads of States\u2019 Declaration sets a clear expectation that fiscal consolidation will resume once the crisis is over.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks\u2019 demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity. In April 2020, the BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25 basis points lower than before the crisis. In June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance institutions to accommodate demands from solvent customers with Covid19-related repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period up to end-2020 debt service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims as non performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of 3-month \"Covid-19 T-Bills\" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The amount of such special T-bills initially issued by Burkina Faso was equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP, with some rollover possibility through similar bonds benefitting from a refinancing rate equivalent to the prevailing monetary policy rate but to be all paid back by end-2020. The BCEAO has launched in February 2021 a special 6-month refinancing window at the floor of the interest rate corridor to help WAEMU governments meet Covid-19 recovery funding needs. Through this special window banks shall be able to refinance all bonds with maturity of 3 years or more governments currently plan to issue on the regional financial market in 2021. The amount of bonds eligible to the new refinancing window for Burkina Faso is equivalent to 5.9 percent of projected 2021 GDP. The new refinancing window is expected to remain in place for the term of the eligible bonds issued in 2021. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basel II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead of 2022 initially planned. In addition, in June 2020, the West African Development Bank (BOAD) created a CFAF 100 billion window to extend 5 to 7 year refinancing of banks\u2019s credit to SMEs in the 8 WAEMU member countries. In December 2020, the BCEAO encouraged WAEMU banks to refrain from distributing dividends with a view to strengthening their capital buffers in anticipation of the impact of the Covid19 crisis on asset quality.      Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top BurundiBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on April 1, 2020. A large-scale testing campaign was conducted from July 6, 2020 to October 6, 2020. Testing now costs US$ 50 per test, except for cases when it is necessary.Measures taken to minimize the risk of the pandemic spreading in Burundi have been very limited: The population has been instructed to follow some basic rules of limited social distancing and frequent handwashing. Hand sanitizers and water for handwashing have been installed in public places. The\u00a0authorities have\u00a0subsidized the price of soap and water for standpipes, up to 50\u00a0percent.\u00a0 Covid-19 certificates are required for travelers entering or leaving the country. The Melchior Ndadaye International Airport was reopened on November 8, 2020 with some restrictions. There is a mandatory seven-day quarantine for all passengers who must also undergo two mandatory tests (one test on arrival and another on the 6th day of quarantine). Land and sea borders were closed to passengers starting January 11, 2021 though they remain open for merchandise. The ban will be reviewed depending on how the pandemic evolves.Burundi\u2019s health care system is extremely weak. The authorities\u2019 pandemic response plan aims to strengthen the health care system, the social safety net, and parts of the road network to facilitate access to sick people. To strengthen the health system, the authorities intend to intensify the communication on the risks of COVID-19 and enhance the screening capacity, the equipment of hospitals and health centers, and the stock of drugs. IMF staff estimates that the cost of the response plan will reach at least US$150 million (4.6 percent of GDP) cumulatively over 2020 and 2021. With the exception of the US$5 million from the World Bank, the authorities currently do not have cash buffers or credit sources that allow them to make these expenditures. They have already contacted and will continue to contact their development partners to request additional support for their pandemic response plan.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    \u2022\tIn addition to spending on the pandemic response plan, the authorities are providing support to hard-hit sectors such as the transport and hotel sectors. The cost of this plan will depend on the evolution of the pandemic, and they intend to meet it largely by reprioritizing the existing budget, mobilizing donor support and borrowing.    Taxes owed will be forgiven for hotels and industries that will not be able to pay. Subsidies are planned to help pay salaries in these sectors and avoid massive layoffs. Salaries for suspended government services such as those provided at the Melchior Ndadaye International Airport continue to be paid by the government.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The authorities continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 shock on loan performance as part of their efforts to protect financial stability. In particular, they are working with banks to encourage, on a targeted and time-bound basis, an extension of loan maturities to borrowers in hard-hit sectors, applying existing regulation in a flexible manner. They have also asked commercial banks to reduce bank fees for electronic transfers, and mobile money transfers in order to reduce the need to go to banks.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measure has been officially announced. Burundi has been engaged in multiple currency practices, with a parallel market exchange rate that is substantially more depreciated than the official exchange rate.     CBack to Top Cabo VerdeBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 20, 2020. Prevention measures taken by the authorities include: installation of body temperature scans in airports, suspension of official travel and flights to China and other heavily affected countries, preparation of quarantine areas in hospitals, suspension of flights from European countries affected by COVID-19, the United States, Brazil, Senegal and Nigeria, as well as maritime traffic (with few exceptions), and quarantine of the island of Boa Vista where the community spread started inside a resort hotel. The authorities have also prepared a contingency plan and put in place a rapid response team. In late March, they declared the state of emergency, put in place social distancing measures, restricted travel between the nine inhabited islands, and put the country in lockdown for non-essential activities. Commercial air and passenger traffic resumed on October 12.Reopening of the economy. On May 29, 2020, the government lifted the State of Emergency for all islands. In line with it, the Prime Minister announced a deconfinement plan that includes : (i) resumption of inter-island air travel on July 15, (ii) resumption of maritime connections for passenger transport, originating and destinating to Boa Vista island on June 1 and to Santiago island on July 15, (iv) restarting of cultural and sport events on October 1, (v) reopening of restaurants with regular hours on June 1, (vi) increased rapid tests in Praia\u2019s laboratories, (vii) creation of an incentive framework to support companies to adapt their activity to the new requirements and standards of the deconfinement plan, and (viii) implementation of a digital platform for tracking positive cases of COVID-19. Commercial air and passenger traffic resumed on October 12, 2020.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities have reprioritized spending through a revised budget, which is currently in parliament. In the meantime, they have taken measures to support the private sector, including loan guarantees and tax obligations facilities as follows: loan guarantees of up to 50 percent for large companies in all sectors (CVE 1 billion, about \u20ac9 million); up to 80 percent for companies in the tourism and transport sectors (CVE 1 billion); up to 100 percent for small-and medium-sized enterprises in all sectors (CVE 300 million, \u20ac2.7 million) and for micro-enterprises in all sectors (CVE 700 million CVE, about \u20ac6.7 million). Other measures include faster settlement of invoices and VAT refunds, extension of the tax payment period, payment in installments for VAT and other withholding taxes, cancellation of contributions to the Pension Fund for three months, and funding of an emergency plan with CVE 76 million through the reallocation of budgetary appropriations, to cover additional expenses for personnel, training and medical equipment.     For the most vulnerable, mitigating measures are estimated at CVE 2.2 billion (1.2 percent of GDP). They comprise: (i) income compensation to provide financial support to individuals operating in the informal sector; (ii) social inclusion emergency measures for vulnerable people without income; (iii) social inclusion income, with support from the World Bank ; (iv) support to microfinance institutions to support interest-free loans to vulnerable households and; (v) care for the elderly with food assistance and other financial support.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    In late March, the central bank decided to loosen the monetary policy stance and to increase liquidity in the banking system. Key measures included a reduction in rates as follows: the policy rate by 125 basis points to 0.25 percent, the minimum reserve requirements from 13 to 10 percent, and the overnight deposit rate by 5 basis points to 0.05 percent; and the setting up at the central bank of a long-term lending instrument for banks. The central bank (BCV) also called on banks to grant a moratorium on loans obligations to borrowers in good standing with their payment record as of end-March 2020.     On April 1, 2020, the authorities introduced a moratorium on insurance payments and loans repayment during April-September 2020 for household, companies, and non-profit associations, as well as the SMEs. The moratorium on loan repayment was extended to December 31, 2020 and will now remain in place until the end of the third quarter of 2021.    The BCV also implemented prudential measures, including the reduction in capital adequacy ratio and provision for banks depending on requests by borrowers to place a moratorium or forbearance on loan repayment for three months.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top CambodiaBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on January 27, 2020. There have been no deaths so far. All foreign arrivals into Cambodia need to obtain a visa at a Cambodian diplomatic mission abroad, a health certificate before departure to Cambodia, and a deposit of USD2000 (to cover potential health care costs). All arrivals are required to be tested and quarantined. Returning migrant workers are to self-isolate for 14 days. Domestic travel restrictions were lifted on April 16, 2020. Massage parlors, sports arenas, fitness centers, and public transports have been closed since last March. Public events and gathering (including religious gathering and concerts) have been banned. Since June, casinos, cinemas, museums and theatres varyingly reopened. Entertainment venues (e.g. karaoke and clubs) reopened as restaurants since July; schools  reopened in phases starting from last September. Cambodia was hit by the first large-scale local transmission late February this year (so called \u201cFeb 20 incident\u201d) and schools/cinemas/museums have been closed again. The crisis has hit the Cambodian economy very hard during the first half of 2020, through exports of garments and textiles and tourism. Key Policy Responses as of March 3, 2021Fiscal\t    A package worth USD 60 mn has been allocated for virus testing, containment, and treatment. Social assistance of nearly USD 400 mn is being implemented, including USD 300 mn for a new monthly cash transfer program for poor and vulnerable households (5-7 months from June 2020) and USD 100 mn cash for a work program. Measures to target poorer households are being scaled up with more frequent updates of IDPoor, especially because of the extent of informal work and returned migrant workers. USD 64 mn has been allocated for wage subsidies and skill training program for suspended workers/employees in the garments and tourism industries. Other spending has been rationalized, yielding savings of roughly USD 900 mn, of which around USD 500 mn will be from capital spending. Several tax relief measures, worth around USD 200 mn, have been introduced. The government has allocated USD 600 mn as special low-interest loans to specialized banks (USD 200 mn in Credit Guarantee Fund and USD 300 mn in Additional Financing Facility), in addition to packages issued to SMEs in manufacturing (USD 50mn) and SMEs in agricultural sector (USD 50mn). In December 2020, the government extended until the end of March this year: i) allowance subsidy for garment and tourism sectors; ii) tax exemption for tourism and aviation sector; and iii) cash relief program for poor and vulnerable families.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) implemented four measures to improve liquidity in the banking system early in the crisis: (i) delaying additional increases in the Capital Conservation Buffer; (ii) cutting the interest rate in its Liquidity Providing Collateralized Operations, decreasing banks\u2019 funding costs in domestic currency; (iii) cutting the interest rate on Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (the collateral for LPCOs), to encourage banks to disburse loans; and (iv) lowering required reserves that banking and financial institutions must maintain at NBC both for local (Riel) and foreign currency (USD). In February 2021, NBC announced to keep the reserve requirement on hold at 7 percent both for Riel and USD until the end of June 2021.     NBC has also issued guidelines to allow financial institutions for loan restructuring for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties (but still performing) in priority sectors (tourism, garments, construction, transportation and logistics) temporarily by the end of this year. In November 2020, NBC announced to extend the forbearance by another 6 months to the end-June 2021, taking account of the adverse impacts from the recent nation-wide flooding in addition to the COVID-19 shock.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    Cambodia continues to maintain managed floating system. Suspension of white rice, paddy and fishexports have been lifted.    Back to Top CameroonBackground. The first cases were reported on March 6. Cameroon continues to record daily increases in the number of COVID-19. Following a reduction in the infection rate from end-July to end-September, the WHO reports a resurgence in recent months, but with a reduced fatality rate. On March 17, 2020, the government announced a package of 13 containment measures including closure of land, air and sea borders, quarantine for travelers returning from a country with a high level of infection, closure of schools and universities, prohibition of gatherings of more than 50 persons, closure of bars, restaurants and entertainment spots after 6 pm, suspension of missions of civil servants and parastatals abroad, cancellation of school and university games, and a ban on overloading taxis and public transportation. Social distancing and sanitation measures include the use of electronic communications and digital tools for meetings of more than 10 persons, and compliance with hygiene measures recommended by the WHO.On April 10, 2020, the government took seven additional measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. These measures took effect from April 13, 2020 and include wearing a mask in all areas open to the public, local production of drugs and screening tests, establishment of specialized COVID-19 treatment centers in all regional capitals, intensification of screening and an awareness campaign, among others. In October 2020, the Ministry of Public Health reinforced COVID-19 screenings for all travelers landing in Cameroon, after a network of fake negative COVID-19 tests sold to travelers was dismantled.Since July 2020, the authorities have been following a decentralized approach, based Cameroon\u2019s on health districts and regions, and aimed at strengthening the monitoring of cases and strengthening the continuity of the health services and systems. The country is currently developing a national vaccine readiness and deployment plan. Reopening of the economy. On April 30, 2020 the government announced a set of reopening measures. The restriction prohibiting bars, restaurants and leisure facilities from operating after 6 p.m. was lifted, provided customers and users respect social distancing and wear protective masks. The limit on the number of passengers in public transportation vehicles (buses and taxi.) was also relaxed but masks remain compulsory and overloading is prohibited. Primary and secondary school students returned to school on June 1, 2020.Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    On April 30, 2020, the president announced fiscal measures aimed at alleviating the adverse socio-economic impact of the crisis. A set of measures provide temporary tax accommodation to businesses directly affected by the crisis through tax moratoria and deferred payments, notably (i) exemptions from the tourist tax in the hotel and catering sectors for the rest of the 2020 financial year; (ii) exemption from the withholding tax for taxis and motorbikes and petty traders for the second quarter; (iii) the allocation of a special envelope of CFAF 25 billion for the expedited clearance of VAT credits awaiting reimbursement, and (iv) the postponement of the deadline to pay land taxes for the 2020 financial year, to 30 September 2020.    Other measures aim to alleviate the impact on households, in particular (i) an increase in the family allowance from CFAF 2,800 to CFAF 4,500; (ii) a raise of 20 percent for pensions that did not benefit from the 2016 reform; (iii) continued payment of family allowances from May to July to staff of companies which are unable to pay social security contributions or which have placed their staff on technical leave due to the crisis; (iv) spreading the payment of the social security contributions for the second quarter over three instalments and canceling late fees.    Specific measures support the fight against the pandemic, notably (i) full income tax deductibility of donations and gifts made by companies for the fight against COVID-19, (ii) three-month suspension of the payment of parking and demurrage charges in the Douala and Kribi ports for essential goods; and (iii) the establishment of a MINFI-MINEPAT consultation framework aimed at mitigating the crisis and promoting a rapid resumption of activity.    The authorities\u2019 three-year preparedness and response plan presents a total financing cost close to US$ 825 million, of which about US$750 million have been identified or made available. The plan includes five pillars, namely: (i) health strategy to prevent the spread of the pandemic and take care of infected persons (US$101 million); (ii) mitigation of economic and financial repercussions of the pandemic (US$646 million); (iii) supply of essential products (US$9.5 million); (iv) local development of innovative solutions (US$16.5 million); and (v) social resilience to alleviate the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable people and households (US$52 million). These pillars include tax relief to affected businesses estimated at about US$200 million. In addition, the government has continued efforts to extend the Unified Social Register, which covers socially vulnerable persons.    A special COVID-19 account, dedicated to financing the national response plan to the pandemic, has been created and is governed by a circular issued by the Minister of Finance. The circular specifies the modalities of organization, operation, and monitoring-evaluation mechanisms of the account. For 2020, the Revised Finance Law enacted in June 2020 allocates about US$310 million to the special COVID-19 account financed at 76 percent by resources released by debt service suspension and external budgetary support.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary operations.  The BEAC  also reduced haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as collateral for refinancing operations until end-2020, which it extended by 6 months from January 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting  Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities purchases for the next 6 months, which it extended by another 6 months starting onMarch 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting. The purchase program is meant as a safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances, while being consistent with BEAC Charter, which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program is based on revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.    On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use their capital conservation buffers of 2.5 percent to absorb pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive policy with regard to dividend distribution. In July 2020, the COBAC prevented all banks from distributing any dividend for the years 2020 and 2021. The COBAC also put in place ad-hoc reporting to closely monitor financial stability developments following the COVID-19 crisis.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top CanadaBackground. Canada has experienced more than 877,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 22,000 deaths. Federal and provincial governments have implemented a range of measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. The rate of new cases peaked in early May, remained at low levels throughout the Summer, but has since risen to much higher levels. The second wave of the pandemic peaked in early January 2021. Reopening of the economy. On April 28, Prime Minister Trudeau released a joint statement with premiers across Canada on their shared public health approach to support restarting the economy; all provinces began to implement detailed, data-driven plans to reopen in May. The surge in new virus cases that began in September has prompted a tightening of restrictions in many parts of the country.Since the end of February, the pandemic restrictions are gradually unrolled, again. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Key spending and tax measures (18.5 percent of GDP, $407.7 billion CAD) include: i) $52.7 billion (2.4 percent of GDP) to the health system to support increased testing, vaccine development, medical supplies, mitigation efforts, and greater support for Indigenous communities; ii) $270 billion (12.3 percent of GDP) in direct aid to households and firms, including wage subsidies, payments to workers without sick leave and access to employment insurance, an increase in existing GST tax credits and child care benefits, and a new distinctions-based Indigenous Community Support Fund; and iii) around $85 billion (3.9 percent of GDP) in liquidity support through tax deferrals.

Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top Central African RepublicBackground. The first case has been identified in mid-March and the number of new cases has declined since September 2020 and stabilized afterward, owing in part to the discontinuation of widespread testing. To help contain the pandemic, the authorities adopted a response plan for the health sector and enacted social distancing measures, including the closing of borders, schools, and most public establishments, a ban on meetings of more than 15 people, and restrictions on the movement of people from Bangui. They have also been working on a more exhaustive plan, which, in addition to the strengthening of the health sector, would provide financial support to the most vulnerable households and companies.Reopening of the Economy. As the number of new cases has been declining, the president has announced some reopening measures to enable the restart of the economic activity. Restaurants, bars and places of worship have been allowed to re-open. Moreover, international travels have resumed gradually, and most travel restrictions have been lifted, and the quarantine for people arriving from abroad has been reduced from 21 to 14 days. This reopening is conditional on following some measures such as frequent hand washing and social distancing. However, self-quarantine for confirmed cases remain in place.Vaccinatione strategy360 000 AstraZeneca doses of vaccines, enough to cover 180 000 people, have been allocated to CAR under the COVAX program. The vaccines are expected to arrive in mid- March 2021 and will be given to health workers and elderly in priority.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The response plan for the health sector was prepared in strong collaboration with the WHO, with an estimated cost of 27 billion of FCFA (1.9 percent of GDP). It goes beyond an immediate response plan and contains measures to strengthen the ability of the healthcare system to deal with such pandemics in the future. It notably aims at: (i) providing medical care of confirmed cases, (ii) improving the monitoring of the country\u2019s points of entry; and (iii) strengthening the capacities of the medical staff, laboratories and hospitals. In addition to the health sector plan, the authorities are envisaging providing financial support to the most vulnerable households and companies, while increasing access to water. Other specific fiscal measures to help the private sector, such as tax relief or suspension and easing of public procurement procedures, are also being considered. The government has requested the help of its development partners to finance this plan, through grants and loans. A draft supplementary budget law has been adopted and includes around 44 billion of CFAF of donors additional support related to COVID-19. The additional spending related to COVID-19 amounts for about 15 billion of CFAF, mainly broken down as 12 billion for prevention and management of the pandemic, 0.5 billion as support to vulnerable household and 2.6 billion for the support to the private sector.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary operations. The BEAC also reduced haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as collateral for refinancing operations until end- 2020, which it extended by 6 months from January 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting . Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities purchases for the next 6 months, which it extended by another 6 months starting on March 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting.

Back to Top ChadBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 19, 2020. As of March 3, 2021, the total number of COVID-cases is 4,056 (of which 3,542 recoveries, 140 deaths and 374 patients under treatment). After increasing since mid-December 2020, the number of new cases declined gradually starting mid-January 2021, and has broadly stabilized since the beginning to February, 2021. The initial surge prompted the authorities to temporarily reinstate some of the preventive measures that were relaxed in May 2020. These include bringing forward the curfew; the closure of land and air borders; the closure of schools and universities; the closure of places of worship; the closure of bars, restaurants, shops and large markets; among other procedures. After the stabilization of the situation in mid-January, the authorities decided to relax some of these measures on January 20, 2021 (mentioned below), on gradual basis and considering the compliance of the remaining preventive measures. The state of medical emergency continues since its extension on October 17, 2020, for six months. Wearing a face mask remains mandatory in public places starting May 7, 2020. The curfew (9:00 PM to 5:00 AM) has been extended for two weeks on February 24, 2021. The authorities have also taken steps to acquire vaccines through the COVAX facility, which is expected to arrive in the first half of 2021.Reopening of the economy and additional containment measures.

Back to Top The Kingdom of the Netherlands\u2014Cura\u00e7aoBackground.Following the first COVID-19 case in March 2020, Prime Minister Rhuggenaath declared the state of health emergency and announced travel restrictions, quickly followed by a border closure. As the number of cases increased, the government introduced a curfew followed by a full lockdown in late March. These measures helped to contain the spread of COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, although the economic activity came to a halt. Following a gradual phasing out of the domestic restrictions, the number of COVID-19 infections has been rose sharply between late August and mid-December, necessitating tightening of restrictions including a curfew, capping gatherings in various establishments at 50 percent of capacity  and banning of alcohol in bars and restaurants. On December 11, the government has declared a state of emergency for 90 days. These measures reduced the number of active COVID-19 cases substantially by end-January.Reopening of the economy. The authorities have gradually reopened the borders by allowing travel from several low and medium risk countries since mid-June 2020.  Stayover arrivals in Q3 2020 increased to 26 percent of the same period in 2019 and further to 32 percent in Q4, although December arrivals were negatively affected by the Netherlands\u2019 tightening of the travel advice for Cura\u00e7ao on December 15 from code yellow to orange, encouraging residents to only make necessary trips to the country and to go into quarantine for ten days upon return. The Netherlands has also introduced a mandatory PCR test up to 72 hours prior to departure for all passengers travelling from Cura\u00e7ao, and this included people with a Dutch passport. As of January 1, Cura\u00e7ao requires a PCR test except from \u201clow risk\u201d countries. As the number of active COVID-19 cases declined in January-February 2021, the domestic restrictions were partially relieved in late February 2021, shortening the daily curfew and expanding business hours. On March 1 2021, the U.S. Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classified Cura\u00e7ao as a country of Level 4: COVID-19 Very High (highest in the CDC warning).The Netherlands provided the first batch (19,000 doses) of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines and vaccination started on February 25.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The first package (Alivio 1) was introduced in March. It included tax measures of NAf 33 and some first-response spending. The second, more comprehensive package (Alivio 2) elaborated the following assistance programs: (i) payroll subsidies to support employment in the private sector up to 80 percent of pre-crisis wages conditional on the revenue loss; (ii) support for the self-employed (NAf 1,335 per person per month); (iii) job loss benefits (NAf 1,000 per person per month) for workers laid off since mid-March 2020; (iv) additional benefits for welfare recipients; (v) credit facilities for SMEs, and (vi) compensation of premium losses for the Social Security Bank. The Netherlands provided financing of NAf 381 million (8\u00bd percent of GDP) to support Alivio 2 in the second quarter. Given available financing, measures implemented during April-September period included the payroll subsidies, support for the self-employed, job loss benefits and food vouchers. On November 2, Cura\u00e7ao and the Netherlands reached an agreement on the establishment of the Caribbean Entity for Reform and Development and a landspakket (country package) of reform measures necessary to improve Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s financial, economic and administrative resilience. On November 24, Cura\u00e7ao received an additional tranche of liquidity support in the amount of NAf 181 million (4.1 percent of GDP), increasing total financing in 2020 to 15.1 percent of GDP. The agreement also envisages targeted support for several areas such as education and border control.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 20, 2020, the Centrale Bank van Cura\u00e7ao en Sint Maarten (CBCS) reduced the pledging rate--at which the commercial banks can borrow from the CBCS--by 150 basis points to 1 percent and suspended the 200 basis points surcharge on the pledging rate on loans exceeding NAf 20 million. Furthermore, the CBCS reintroduced the overdraft facility for commercial banks. The CBCS also announced that it would lower the interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) to ease the money market by absorbing less liquidity.

On early January 2020, Chinese authorities determined that a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a novel coronavirus. The government imposed strict containment measures, including the extension of the national Lunar New Year holiday, the lockdown of Hubei province, large-scale mobility restrictions at the national level, social distancing, and a 14-day quarantine period for returning migrant workers. Reflecting these containment measures, the economy contracted by 6.8 percent (yoy) in 2020 Q1.Reopening of the economy. . Starting in mid-February 2020, the government has gradually removed mobility and activity restrictions, prioritizing essential sectors, specific industries, regions, and population groups based on ongoing risk assessments. Most businesses and schools have reopened nationwide, but social distancing rules remain in place at the micro level and foreign entry remains restricted to contain imported cases. Localized movement restrictions have been re-imposed in new hotspots, including in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hebei. Testing and individualized health QR codes are used to gauge the path of the virus and contain outbreaks. The authorities encouraged less inter-city travel during the 2021 lunar new year holiday, while imposing strict testing and quarantine requirements. With normalizing economic activity, real GDP rebounded by 3.2 percent (yoy) in 2020 Q2 and continued to recover by 4.9 and 6.5 percent in Q3 and Q4, respectively. Thus, real GDP grew by 2.3 percent in 2020.  VaccineChina has approved four COVID-19 vaccines, including three inactivated vaccines requiring 2 shots and a recombinant vaccine requiring 1 shot.

Colombia confirmed its first COVID-19 case on March 6, 2020. The government declared a state of emergency on March 17, and a quarantine began on March 25. On August 25 the end of the quarantine was announced effective September 1 with some restrictions (consistent with the extension of the health emergency) including gatherings of more than 50 individuals, the operation of bars and land and sea borders will remain close. Restrictions will remain in place until at least February 28. On Jan 7, curfews were announced on selected cities where ICU utilization is high. Limited international air travel resumed on September 19. Land and sea borders will remain closed until June 1 2021.Reopening of the economy. The construction and manufacturing sectors were allowed to restart operations on April 27, and an expanded list of industrial and commercial services sectors restarted on May 11. Other services, including selected retail segments, were allowed to reopen on June 1, although local jurisdictions (including Bogota) have been slower to ease restrictions.  Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A state of emergency decree created a National Emergency Mitigation Fund (FOME), which will be partially funded from regional and stabilization funds (around 1.5 percent of GDP) and will be complemented by 1.3 percent of GDP from domestic bond issuance and other budgetary resources. The Fiscal Rule Consultative Committee had allowed a 2020 fiscal deficit of 6.1 percent given the expected economic impact, but on June 15 allowed the government to temporarily suspend the fiscal rule in 2020 and 2021. The government now projects headline deficits of 8.9 and 7.6 percent of GDP for 2020 and 2021 respectively. Additional budgetary support for health has been announced including part payment for Covid-19 tests and vaccines, along with faster direct contracting for services associated with the emergency response, payments to health providers for ICU availability and the creation of a National Tracking and Contact Center, a one-off bonus for health workers, new credit lines providing liquidity support to the coffee sector, the education sector, public transportation sector, technology sector, health and public sector providers, and all tourism-related companies, new credit lines for payroll and loan payments for SMES, for working capital for large corporates, and for corporates in the sectors most affected by the pandemic trough the National Guarantee Fund, a two-month suspension of pension contributions by both employees and employers, delayed tax collection, an exemption of tariffs and VAT for strategic health imports and selected food industries and services, delayed utility payments for poor and middle income households,  expanded transfers for vulnerable groups, and additional benefits for recently unemployed workers. In addition, the government announced a payroll subsidy equivalent to 50 percent of the minimum wage per worker for businesses with a fall of over 20 percent in revenues for a period of three months. The 2021 government budget includes measures to reactivate the economy, with extensions to the programs supporting households and firms and increases in infrastructure investment. Unspent emergency resources from 2020 can be used for 2021.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank has cut the policy rate by 250 bp and has implemented several measures to boost liquidity in both domestic and foreign currency. These include: (i) an expansion of their liquidity overnight and term facilities in terms of amounts, applicable securities and eligible counterparts, (ii) purchase of debt issued by credit institutions, and (iii) TES purchases in the secondary market. The Central Bank also lowered the reserve requirement applicable to savings and checking accounts from 11 to 8 percent and the one applicable to fixed-term savings accounts (less than 18 months) from 4.5 to 3.5 percent.    Superfinanciera has allowed supervised entities to reprofile all loans that were less than 30 days over-due on Feb 29. These new provisions can include grace periods or extended deadlines and the PAD (Program to Support Debtors) to support viable borrowers which was due to end in December 2020 was extended to June 30, 2021 on December 16. Banks cannot increase interest rates on loans, charge interest on interest, or report entities to credit registries for availing themselves of any forbearance measures. Countercyclical provisions have been released, and SFC has authorized certain related-party transactions for fund managers, including the purchase of Certificados de Deposito a Termino (term deposit certificates) issued by an associated entity. Fund managers can also invest, directly or indirectly up to 15 per cent of the value of each fund, in other investment funds managed by them.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    To provide liquidity in FX markets, the central bank has auctioned FX swaps (in US dollars), but suspended this program on June 30 due to vacant auctions. In addition, a new mechanism of exchange-rate hedging was introduced through auctions of Non-Deliverable Forwards with a 30-day maturity. Colombia also obtained access to the FIMA Repo facility and the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement with the IMF was renewed for two years on May 1. The existing FCL arrangement was augmented on September 25, and Colombia announced a drawing of US$ 5.4 bn on December 3.    Back to Top ComorosBackground. The pandemic in Comoros did not initially turn into a deep health crisis with only seven deaths being officially reported between the reporting of the first on May 1 and December 2020. A new wave began in December 2020 and cases are rapidly increasing through the beginning of 2021. The presence of the new and more transmissible strain originally found in South Africa has been confirmed in Comoros, and the authorities are very concerned. The COVID-19 shock came less than a year after Cyclone Kenneth, which necessitated emergency Fund financial support. Remittances through exchange houses increased throughout the months of lockdown. Reopening of the economy. The economy had gradually started to reopen but this is now in reverse given recent developments in cases. The authorities have prepared a public-health related plan that describes the measures to be taken to minimize risks from pandemics. Implementation of the plan appears to be proceeding slowly, however, reflecting the authorities\u2019 severe financial and capacity constraints. The authorities\u2019 full response to the new wave is yet to be determined. The WHO ranks the health system\u2019s preparedness at the lowest level in international comparison.Key Policy Responses as of February 5, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities are implementing their pandemic preparedness plan. Their top priority is to substantially expand spending on health care in line with pandemic-related needs, trying to overcome to the greatest extent possible the health care system\u2019s capacity constraints. The government granted a delay in the payment of taxes for the formal sector businesses. Import taxes on food, medicines, and items related to hygiene were reduced by 30 percent.    The government announced a program to support agriculture and tourism with US$25 million financing from the World Bank. A supplementary budget with additional budgetary allocations for addressing COVID is in process of approval by the parliament.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The authorities intend to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 shock on banks\u2019 asset quality. The central bank reduced reserve requirements to 10 percent. The authorities also announced a restructuring of commercial loans and freezing of interest rates in some commercial loans.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The authorities intend to monitor inflation developments and continue preserving the peg against the euro.     Back to Top Congo, Democratic Republic ofBackground. The Democratic Republic of Congo(DRC) declared its first case of COVID-19 on March 10, 2020, and the virus continues to spread across the country with thousands of confirmed cases and hundreds of deaths. During the first COVID-19 wave in March 2020, the government declared a state of emergency and imposed the confinement of the capital, Kinshasa, which included restrictions to travel between Kinshasa and the rest of the country and the prohibition of all gatherings of people in public spaces. Passenger flights from abroad were not allowed and border posts were closed to non-cargo shipments. Additional restrictions included the closure of all education centers, suspension of all religious and sporting events, and closure of bars and restaurants. In late June 2020, the government announced the deconfinement of the Gombe business district in Kinshasa and the gradual deconfinement of workers in mining sites. Entry restrictions in airports, ports and borders were also lifted. As a result of a second COVID-19 wave, the government announced new restrictions, effective December 18, 2020, such as the establishment of a curfew between 9 pm and 5 am, the obligation of wearing a mask, or compulsory COVID testing for domestic and external travelers. In 2020, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced real GDP growth, increased consumer prices (particularly of imported products), reduced fiscal revenues, and increased fiscal spending through the implementation of a COVID-19 response plan which included the opening of new COVID-19 test centers in Lubumbashi and other cities. A new 9-month multi sectoral response plan against the pandemics (PMUAIC-19) was launched in June 2020, which included actions to strengthen the health system, stabilize the economy, and reinforce security and social protection. The World Bank is preparing emergency vaccine financing projects in DRC and other African countries. Financing would be on grant or highly concessional terms. Several partners such as COVAX, the WHO, and UNICEF would be involved in the program implementation and deployment.Vaccination.In early March 2021, a first shipment of 1.7 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine arrived at Kinshasa. This is part of the first wave of supplies sent to the country by COVAX, an alliance comprising the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance), UNICEF and the World Health Organization, that aims at equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine. Medical authorities have decided to use the Astra Zeneca vaccine because it meets the country\u2019s cold storage conditions. A plan for the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines across the country is being finalized. The goal of this first stage of the vaccination is to cover 20% of the population, including health workers, people aged over 55, and people suffering from serious health conditions. Financing of the deployment of the vaccine would be on grant or highly concessional terms.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A preparedness and response national plan to deal with the pandemic was designed with support from development partners, and was coordinated by Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe. The plan mainly focused on actions to (i) strengthen early detection and surveillance and foster technical and operational coordination within the government; (ii) improve the quality of medical care to infected patients; and (iii) develop effective preventive communication strategies and enhance medical logistic platforms. The plan\u2019s budget is estimated at US$135 million (0.3 percent of GDP).     The following measures were approved the week of April 12, 2020, by the Prime Minister: i) a three-month VAT exemption on pharmaceutical products and basic goods, ii) suspension of tax audits for companies, iii) a grace period for businesses on tax arrears, iv) full tax deductibility of any donations made to the COVID relief fund. The week of April 19, 2020, an additional set of measures were adopted, namely: i) provision of water and electricity for a period of two months, free of charge, ii) prohibition to evict renters in case of no payment of financial obligations from March to June 2020, iii) suspension of VAT collection on the production and on the sales of basic goods.    In the context of sustained increases in inflation and exchange rate depreciation, on August 18, 2020, the central bank (BCC), the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Budget formally signed a Stability Pact, which sets a number of policy and operational commitments by those institutions that would contribute to maintaining \u201cmacroeconomic stability, as a prerequisite for strong and sustained growth\u201d.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 24, 2020, the BCC announced several measures to ease liquidity conditions by: (i) reducing the policy rate by 150 bps to 7.5 percent; (ii) eliminating mandatory reserve requirements on demand deposits in local currency; and (iii) creating a new collateralized long-term funding facility for commercial banks of up to 24 months to support the provision of new credit for the import and production of food and other basic goods. The BCC also postponed the adoption of new minimum capital requirements and encouraged the restructuring of non-performing loans. In addition, the BCC announced measures to reduce contamination risks in bank notes and promote the use of e-payments.     In order to re-anchor inflation expectations and maintain a positive in real terms policy rate, on August 10, 2020, the BCC increased its policy rate to 18.5 percent.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    On August 5, 2020, the BCC undertook a limited US$25 million foreign exchange intervention to help stem depreciation pressures.    Back to Top Congo, Republic ofBackground. Congo, as most of oil producers, is being hit by two shocks\u2014the potential spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 15, 2020. As of end-February, there were slightly over 8820 cumulative cases, with a fatality rate of about 1.5 percent. The Ministry of Health has prepared a national contingency plan in collaboration with WHO and other international partners. In the meantime, the authorities started to adopt containment measures, including social distancing, travel bans on visitors from high-risk countries and quarantine for nationals/expatriates returning from those countries, screening at ports of entry, and school closures. A lock-down was established in the country from April 1 to mid-May, and extended through end July but with a reduced time interval of 10PM to 5AM. In late July, in response to the surge in cases, the authorities have increased the time interval for the lockdown to 8PM-5AM in the two major cities of Brazzaville and Pointe Noir. In late September, the lockdown period was reduced to 11PM-5AM but subsequently was reversed to 8PM-5AM on weekends following a surge in cases.Reopening of the economy. On May 18, the lockdown was eased with opening up of public transportation, primary schools final year class and graduation class. As of late June, restaurants, hotels, and most private services have opened in the two main cities, while the rest of the country had opened up completely previously. Since May 30, a large scale screening for teachers and administrative staff has been occurring. The flight space reopened fully as of August 24 with the requirement that each arrival is equipped with a negative covid19 test result dating from at most 3 days. The official school opening date on campus was to October 12, but since early December a number of private schools have returned to online schooling. As of early February, schools have returned to face-to-face learning.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The overall cost of the response plan to the COVID 19 epidemic has been estimated at US$170 million (100 billion XAF), equivalent to 1.6 percent of 2020 GDP. The EU, WFP, France are coordinating support for the poorest segments of the population with combined support amounting to about 3 billion XAF as of now. Other UN agencies have provided about 7 billion XAF to support COVID-19 efforts. Up to mid-November, the total amount of funding provided for COVID-19 expenses is about 75 billion XAF. In early February, the Chinese government offered 35 billion XAF to support the Congolese and promised to provide vaccines to cover 100,000 people.    The government has adopted some measures to ease tax and duty payments for private enterprises. In particular, more time has been given to companies to pay their taxes and tax assessments on site have been abandoned. The import duty directorate is also strongly encouraging electronic payment of dues and allowing more electronic documents to be accepted at the port. Corporate income tax has been reduced to 28 percent from 30 percent and the turnover tax has been reduced to 5 percent from 7 percent for small businesses with turnover below 100 million XAF, although these measures will apply in 2021.        Monetary and macro-financial\t        On March 27, 2020, BEAC    announced    a set of monetary easing measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary operations. The BEAC also reduced haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as collateral for refinancing operations until end-2020, which it extended by 6 months from January 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting. Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities purchases for the next 6 months, which it extended by another 6 months starting on March 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting. The purchase program is meant as a safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances, while being consistent with BEAC Charter which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program is based on revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.    On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use their capital conservation buffers of 2.5% to absorb pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive policy with regards to dividend distribution. In July 2020, the COBAC prevented all banks from distributing any dividend for the years 2020 and 2021. The COBAC also put in place ad-hoc reporting to closely monitor financial stability developments following the COVID-19 crisis.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No new measures.    Back to Top Costa RicaBackground. Costa Rica reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on Mar 6, 2020 and as of March 3, 2021 the country has registered 205,890 confirmed cases and 2,824 deaths. In response, the government has implemented a range of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, including declaration of a state of yellow alert and a national emergency, restrictions and bans on non-essential private and public vehicle circulation, international travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines for close contacts and those who enter the country, closures of schools, churches, beaches, national parks, bars, clubs and casinos, entry restrictions for foreign truck drivers, increased testing, and the conversion of a rehabilitation center into a hospital specializing in COVID-19 treatment. 2020Q1-3 GDP declined by -5.0 percent y/y. A monthly indicator of economic activity so far points to 2020 growth of around -4.8 percent y/y.Reopening of the economy. Costa Rica began easing some coronavirus measures starting May 1. Theaters, gyms and athletic centers will be permitted to reopen during the week but with limited capacity and under strict rules (cleaning, distances etc.). The Health Ministry announced a further loosening of restrictions, to be implemented in four phases over 80 days. The first phase started on May 16 when some national parks and hotels re-opened at limited capacity and contact sports were permitted without spectators, among other easing measures. The second phases began on June 1 when restaurants, gyms, museums, and remaining hotels re-opened at 50 percent capacity. Phase 3 started on June 26 with extended hours for shops, cinemas, museums, theaters, and beaches. Houses of worship could open at limited capacity and under social distancing rules. The authorities subsequently slowed down the reopening of the economy in districts that have a high number of new infections and reintroduced localized vehicle circulation restrictions and business closures. Since August 31, restrictions have been relaxed further in the entire country, with a focus on increasing economic activity. Restrictions were further relaxed starting September 9, when hotels could operate at 100 percent capacity, among other measures (a mandatory face mask order for public enclosed places was introduced at the same time). The border opened to international tourists from countries/regions that have controlled the pandemic on August 1 and to visitors from all countries by November 1. Vehicle circulation restrictions and limited capacity requirements remain in place.  Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government implemented a package of revenue and expenditure measures to protect workers and companies against the economic effects of COVID-19, including (i) an interest-free 3-month moratorium on the payment of value-added taxes, business income taxes, and customs duties; (ii) a temporary adjustment to social security contributions by making them proportional to the time worked for a period of 6 months, as well as a deferral of the payment until the end of 2020;  (iii) a deferral of the roll-out of the VAT on construction and tourism services; (iv) a one-off tax relief on car registration tax in 2020; (v) a 4-month moratorium on taxes to be paid to the Costa Rican Tourism Institute for firms in the tourism sector facing liquidity constraints; (vi) a monthly subsidy of  \u00a2125,000 (\u2248US$205) for three months to about 375 thousand households economically affected by the crisis with a monthly income of less than CRC 750,000 (\u2248US$1,230) prior to COVID-19; and (vii) an increase in public health spending, including construction of a specialized hospital for COVID-19 treatment and purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.. In addition, wage for public employees (except for the police) 4953 public vacancies were frozen in 2020 and 2194 positions were eliminated  to direct more resources to the attention of COVID-19.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    \u2022\tThe Central Bank cut its policy rate by a full percentage point to a record low of 0.75 percent to soften the economic damage caused by the pandemic and to improve credit conditions for households and businesses. In addition, the Central Bank has been authorized to purchase government securities (up to a maximum of \u00a2250,000 million) in the secondary market to provide liquidity during systemic distress. Further measures that aim at protecting workers and companies included (i) reducing the cost of credit (including through \u00a2900,000 million loans at preferential interest rates to firms across all sectors from state-owned banks); (ii) relaxed regulations on restructuring of loans and on buybacks; (iii) a minimum 2-month moratorium on the payment of principal and/or interest for personal credit, mortgages, auto loans, credit card loans, consumer loans, and education loans for affected households and firms; (iv) a temporary reduction in the minimum accumulation of countercyclical provisions for financial entities to zero; (v) the temporary suspension of provisioning rules for financial entities that record losses for at least 6 out of 12 months; (vi) authorization for complementary pension operators to provide partial funds to employees affected by COVID-19; and (vii) \u00a2700,000 million medium-term repo facilities that the Central Bank is offering to financial intermediates expanded by \u00a2142,887 million in January 2021. Since December 2020, the authorities started to rebalance some of the measures, including by (i) requiring banks to update the credit ratings of borrowers for new restructured loans; (ii) allowing already accumulated countercyclical provisions to be used for specific provisions; (iii) extending the suspension of a requirement for banks to stress test individual borrowers.      Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The BCCR continues to maintain exchange rate flexibility and intervenes in the FX market to limit disorderly market conditions.    Back to Top C\u00f4te d\u2019IvoireBackground. The first confirmed case was reported on March 12, 2020. The authorities swiftly adopted containment measures including (i) declaring a state of emergency and establishing a curfew from 9pm to 5am; (ii) banning all international travels, except for humanitarian aid purpose; (iii) prohibiting public gatherings of more than 50 people; (iv) closing schools, nightclubs, restaurants, bars, theatres and other recreational facilities; and imposing restrictions on public transportation and movements between regions in the country; (v) making wearing masks mandatory and encouraging teleworking. On March 30, 2020, the authorities launched a vast cleaning and disinfection operation in Abidjan. On January 21, 2021, the authorities declared a one-month national health emergency and strengthened controls at the airports and borders.Reopening of the economy. On May 7, 2020, the authorities announced the relaxation of the containment measures, which were further eased on May 14, 2020. In the Grand Abidjan district, they lifted the curfew and the closure of restaurants on May 15, while the reopening of schools and universities occurred on May 25. The isolation of the Grand Abidjan has been ended from July 15. The recreational centers will be opened on July 31. Though, the state of emergency will remain in place. Regarding the remaining regions, the curfew and the closure of restaurants, schools and recreational facilities were lifted on May 8; the prohibition of public gatherings was lifted on July 30. Domestic flights resumed on June 26 and international flights on July 1. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government adopted an emergency health response plan of 96 billion CFAF (or 0.3 % of GDP). It will (i) provide free care for those with the infection and equipping intensive care units; (ii) strengthen epidemiological and biological surveillance (virus testing; creation of a free call center, rehabilitating and equipping laboratories); (iii) reinforce capacities of pharmaceutical industries and financing research on the virus. On March 31, the government announced a package of economic measures to prop the income of the most vulnerable segments of the population through agricultural input support and expanded cash transfers, provide relief to hard-hit sectors and firms, and support public entities in the transport and port sectors to ensure continuity in supply chains. In this regard, the authorities created 4 special Funds to be spent over 2 years, including the National Solidarity Fund of 170 billion CFAF (0.5 % of GDP), the Support Fund for the informal sector of 100 billion CFAF (0.3 % of GDP), the Support Fund for the small and medium enterprises of 150 billion CFAF (0.4 % of GDP) and the Support Fund for large companies of 100 billion CFAF (0.3 % of GDP). They will also provide financial support to the agriculture sector by 300 billion CFAF (0.8 % of GDP). On April 27, 2020, Heads of states of the West-Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) declared a temporary suspension of the WAEMU growth and stability Pact setting six convergence criteria, including the 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit rule, to help member-countries cope with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. This temporary suspension will allow member-countries to raise their overall fiscal deficit temporarily and use the additional external support provided by donors in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The Heads of States\u2019 Declaration sets a clear expectation that fiscal consolidation will resume once the crisis is over.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks\u2019 demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity. In April 2020, the BCEAO adopted of a full allotment strategy at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25 basis points lower than before the crisis. In June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO also: (i) extended  the collateral framework to access central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance institutions to accommodate demands from solvent customers  with Covid19-related repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period up to end-2020 debt service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims as non-performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of 3-month \"Covid-19 T-Bills\" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The amount for such special T-Bills initially issued by Cote d\u2019Ivoire was equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP, with some rollover possibility through similar bonds benefitting from a refinancing rate equivalent to the prevailing monetary policy rate but to be all paid back by end-2020. The BCEAO has launched in February 2021 a special 6-month refinancing window at the floor of the interest rate corridor to help WAEMU governments meet Covid recovery funding needs. Through this special window banks shall be able to refinance all bonds with maturity of 3 years or more governments currently plan to issue on the regional financial market in 2021. The amount of bonds eligible to the new refinancing window for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is equivalent to 1.9 percent of projected 2021 GDP. The new refinancing window is expected to remain in place for the term of the eligible bonds issued in 2021.    Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basle II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead of 2022 initially planned. In addition, in June 2020, the West African Development Bank (BOAD) decided to create a CFAF 100 billion window for extending 5- to 7- year refinancing of banks\u2019 credit to SMEs in the 8 WAEMU member countries. In December 2020, the BCEAO encouraged WAEMU banks to refrain from distributing dividends with a view to strengthening their capital buffers in anticipation of the impact of the Covid crisis on asset quality.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top CroatiaBackground: The Croatian economy has been significantly affected by COVID-19, given its dependence on tourism and its largest trading partner being Italy. Containment started early and was gradually tightened from border controls, to closure of schools, universities, open markets, and restrictions on intercity travel. Croatia quickly adopted 63 different economic measures and additional measures were announced beginning of April in order to preserve jobs and alleviate the impact of COVID-19. Reopening of the economy: On April 23, the government announced a gradual easing of containment measures in three phases, but subject to a review after each stage. Beginning April 27, some retailers (except shopping malls), libraries, museums, galleries, service-based activities not requiring close client contact (e.g., tailors, photoshops, locksmiths) reopened. Public transportation in cities and suburbs and boat connections for islands that do not have ferries resumed. Beginning May 4, service industries where close contact with people is unavoidable (e.g., hairdressers, beauticians) could reopen. Public and private health systems became fully operational except for special cases decided by epidemiologists. Playgrounds and sports fields reopened. Beginning May 11, public gatherings of up to 10 people were allowed outdoors (previously capped at 5 people). Shopping malls, preschools and elementary schools (grades 1-4), cafes and restaurants, sports and fitness centers and national parks have reopened. Inter-county public transportation and domestic air traffic have resumed. Shopping centers have begun to operate. Public gatherings for cultural and sport events are permitted as of June 15.As of July 1, 2020, all EU/EEA nationals and individuals holding permanent residence in the EU/EEA countries can enter Croatia freely, without restrictions. As of July 1, 2020, all EU/EEA nationals and individuals holding permanent residence in the EU/EEA countries could enter Croatia freely, without restrictions, while all other foreign nationals could enter Croatia for business, tourism, or other pressing personal reasons, if they provided relevant proof.

Monetary and macro-financial\t        The Croatian National Bank (CNB) has provided additional liquidity,    supported the government securities market, and temporarily eased the    regulatory burden on banks (    https://www.hnb.hr/en/home).    Liquidity was provided via: (i) the structural repo facility, used for    the first time since December 2018 (5-year kuna liquidity of HRK 3.8    billion at a fixed interest rate of 0.25 percent); (ii) regular weekly    repos used by banks for the first time since December 2017 (but no bidders    at recent auctions). This repo rate has been reduced from 0.30 to 0.05    percent; and (iii) a reduction of the reserve requirement ratio (from 12 to 9 percent). The CNB has bought government securities in the secondary market (five times since March 13, in total HRK 17.9 billion). The European Central Bank and the CNB have agreed on a \u20ac2 billion swap line. The agreement is in place until end-June 2021.            A moratorium for three months on obligations to banks has been introduced.    Banks will not apply enforcement measures during this period. The Croatian    Banking Association has agreed to defer repayment of loans to the tourism    sector until end-June 2021. Depending on clients' possibilities and needs,    regular interest may be paid for the duration of the moratorium, according    to the existing payment schedule, or the loan maturity may be extended to    adapt monthly loan instalments to clients' possibilities and cash inflow.    The CNB has temporarily adjusted its supervisory practices in line with the    EBA statement of March 12 (    https://eba.europa.eu/eba-statement-actions-mitigate-impact-covid-19-eu-banking-sector).    Banks will not distribute dividends.        The Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HBOR) has issued a moratorium on debt service for three months, can provide liquidity loans, export guarantees, and restructure obligations. In mid-June, HBOR announced it would extend its export loan insurance program (to \u20ac 150,000 from the current \u20ac 50,000) and will take on 95 percent of the risk of non-payments by foreign buyers, thus protecting liquidity for SMEs. The program can insure short-term export claims by SMEs with an annual export revenue of up to \u20ac 2 million. Entrepreneurs just starting a business can also benefit from this program. The European Commission has approved several subsidized loan programs. On October 1st, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and HBOR agreed on a financial package that could enable up to \u20ac 200 million in loans for faster recovery of Croatian SMEs from the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 5, it was proposed that banks will be encouraged (by means of profit tax breaks) to write off their NPLs instead of selling them to collection agencies.

Coverage under the existing program Comer es Primero, paying RD$5,000 (about US$90) per month, increased from 0.8 to 1.5 million households; 452,817 families will receive additional transfers of RD$2,000 (about US$36) per month; (ii) the newly created Employee Solidarity Assistance Fund (FASE) (RD$15 bn), which benefits about 754,000 families of formal workers who were laid off with a monthly transfer up to 70 percent of last formal wages (minimum of RD$5,000, RD$8,104 on average); (iii) On May 17, a new program called Pa\u2019ti was introduced to support independent workers, providing RD$5,000 (about US$90) a month to each beneficiary with an additional allowance made available for healthcare workers, the military and police officers, amounting to RD$2.4 bn. The newly elected President Luis Abinader announced the extension of all social aid programs until the end of 2020. The government increased healthcare spending on medical supplies and equipment, tests in private labs, rent of two private medical centers, and support of the pharmaceutical industry, including through budget reallocations. On the revenue side, tax relief is provided through extended payment deadlines and some tax benefits. The government accumulated more than RD$10 million from fines for the violation of the COVID-19 curfew established in March.    On October 8, the government approved a 2020 budget increase for RD$202 bn (4.5 percent of GDP) with the aim of mitigating the crisis generated by the pandemic. To cover the financing gaps, the authorities mobilized loans and commercial credit lines from the IMF , World Bank , the Interamerican Development Bank, Latin American Development Bank, and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration; and raised private donations for healthcare needs. On October 5, the European Union disbursed a budget support grant in the amount of RD$725 million (US$12.4 million). The government also placed domestic debt in the amount of US$0.7 bn (in 4 series), with the maturities of 10-20 years at an interest rate of 10-11 percent. Despite the continuing global uncertainties, the country successfully issued a record US$3.8 bn in sovereign bonds in September, comprising new global bond (US$1.8 bn; maturity 12 years; yield of 4.875%); reopening of the 2060 US dollar global bond (US$1.7 bn; yield of 6.25%); and reopening of the 2026 peso-denominated bond (US$0.3 bn; yield of 10.0%).On December 1, the government announced its plan to reopen its 2032 global bonds to finance a buyback of four different dollar notes maturing between 2021 and 2025, amounting up to US$3.5 bn. On January 23, 2021 the government placed an additional US$2.5 bn, with maturities of 10 and 40 years, and interest of 4.5% and 5.875%, respectively.     On December 7 the Government presented a new bonus that will be distributed for Christmas of RD$1,500 to one million beneficiaries. This bonus will replace the traditional food boxes the Government used to hand during the holidays to the poorest households.    On December 30, the government announced that the FASE I program (for formal workers with suspended labor contracts) would be extended until April 2021. FASE II (for formal workers with active labor contracts) would be replaced by another program to be announced in January. On January 4, 2021, the President announced the extension until April  2021 of the Quedate en Casa program and its eventual replacement with a new program (Superate), which will double the assistance under the existing Comer es Primero and cover an additional 200 thousand vulnerable households (thus reaching a total of 1 million households).    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 16, the Monetary Council of the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) eased its policy stance and took measures to provide additional liquidity and support the economy. Interest rate measures include monetary policy rate cuts (from 4.5 to 3.5 and then to 3.0 percent per annum), reduction of the 1-day REPO facility rate (from 6.0 to 4.5 and then to 3.5 percent), and the overnight deposit rate cut (from 3.0 to 2.5 percent). Banks were allowed to cover reserve requirements with public and BCRD bonds up to RD$22.3 billion (about \u00bd percent of GDP), which is equivalent to a 2 percent reduction in the reserve requirement rate and a release of RD$30.13 billion (US$553.7 million; about 2/3 percent of GDP) to the economy. These resources will be used for credit to households and businesses at an interest rate capped at 8.0 percent. On April 16, the Monetary Board lessened the criteria to access these resources by allowing financial intermediaries to lend to any economic sector and extended the maturity of the loans from 1 to 4 years. The BCRD has also made available liquidity for loans to small businesses and personal microcredits. The first window amounts to RD$15 billion accessible through Banco de Reservas. It will be available for 3 years and loans would carry an interest rate of up to 8 percent. At the same time, the BCRD released RD$5.7 billion from the reserve requirement (about 0.5 percent of reserve requirements) for new loans, refinancing of previous debt and debt consolidation for small businesses and personal microcredit under loans for 4 years at an interest rate of up to 8 percent.\t\tThe IMF Rapid Financing Instrument was approved on April 29, 2020, for US$0.65 billion.\tUS$150 million from a contingent line of credit for disasters and health-related events approved in March and another loan of US$100 million to support the response to the COVID-19 emergency approved on June 20.\t    Liquidity measures include easing other REPO operations for RD$50 bn (about 1 percent of GDP) to provide funds to the financial system, and provisions of U.S. dollar liquidity (US$0.622 bn, roughly 3/5 percent of GDP) through REPO operations and allowing banks to use public bonds towards reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits. Interest rate on these REPOs was lowered from 1.8 percent to 0.9 percent. In addition, the BCRD made arrangements with the Federal Reserve for a liquidity facility worth US$1-US$3 bn through short-term repos. Debt relief measures include a temporary freeze of debtor ratings and provisioning; classifying overdue loans for a 60-day period; and giving 90 days to debtors to update loan guarantees. In addition to these measures, on May 7, the BCRD announced a new facility to provide financing up to RD$20 bn for businesses operating in tourism, construction, exports, and manufacturing. Loans under this facility would carry an interest rate of 8 percent and would receive the same regulatory treatment as all other facilities put in place so far.     On July 22, 2020, the Monetary Council of the Central Bank announced new expansionary measures: a new Rapid Liquidity Facility (RLF) to provide funds for up to RD$60,000 million for productive sectors, consumption loans and small and medium firms. Admissible collateral to access this facility are private and public debt, as well as loans with ratings A and B. In addition, the maximum amount for REPO operations was increased from RD$50,000 million to RD$60,000 million, providing additional resources to financial institutions, while extending its maturity for up to 360 days. Moreover, the interest rate on REPO operations for up to 90 days was lowered from 5.0% to 4.5%, while the interest rate on operations for up to 180 and 360 days was set to 5.0% and 5.5%, respectively. On August 22, the BCRD announced the further flexibilization of the conditions to access the RLF to allow for the refinancing of loans for businesses regardless of size and households.    At the August 2020 monetary policy meeting, the BCRD lowered its monetary policy rate by 50 basis points to 3.00 percent, while also reducing its interest rate on the Repo standing facility by 100 basis points to 3.50 percent and left unchanged the rate on the deposit standing facility, thus narrowing the corridor to a \u00b1 50 basis points width. The decision regarding the policy rate and the corridor comes despite a recent uptick in inflation. At the September and October meetings the BCRD kept its MPR unchanged, considering market expectations and internal forecasts point towards inflation remaining within the target range of 4.0 percent \u00b1 1.0 percent in the monetary policy horizon.    On October 23rd, the CBDR announced that RD$40 bn of the resources previously put forth to the financial system on the form of REPOS would be made available through the Rapid Financing Line. These funds were previously used under the REPO facility and were not rolled over at maturity. This decision does not increase the total amount made available so far, which stands at RD$190 bn. On November 25, the CBDR announced that the resources available through the RLF could be used for loans to all productive sectors, including mortgages.    The CBDR has kept its MPR unchanged in February, despite upward trend in annual inflation due to temporary increases in food and fuels prices. While current inflation remains above the target range, it is expected to converge towards it during the second semester of 2021. On March 1st, 2021 the CBDR announced the increase of the RLF by RD$25 bn, with the new resources to be allocated for specific sectors including construction, manufacturing, mortgages for lower-priced housing, commerce, and SMEs. Each sector has been allocated with RD$5 billion   As of February 23, of the RD$190 bn (about 4.0 percent of GDP) made available to financial intermediation entities to provide liquidity to economic agents, approximately RD$165.9 bn have been disbursed, providing financing to sectors such as commerce, manufacturing, exports, agriculture, construction, and tourism.          Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The BCRD has intervened in the foreign exchange markets to prevent disorderly market conditions and maintains a relatively strong international reserve position (about US$11.9 bn, or about 15.1 percent of GDP, as of March2, 2021). In July, the BCRD announced that it would expand its operations with Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDFs) to offer hedging instruments for international investors in local bonds denominated in domestic currency.

The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union consists of eight members (Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) with a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank). The first case was found on March 13 (in Antigua and Barbuda), and the number of new cases continued to increase until mid-May. The COVID 19 case has since fallen and stabilized with no active case in most of the ECCU countries today. The global COVID-19 shock, if prolonged to the hurricane season (August-November), could compound recurrent risk of natural disasters, aggravating the impact on the economy and society. Reopening of the economy. Many ECCU authorities have begun a gradual phased approach to easing containment measures and reopening the economy since early May, including the expansion of the list of businesses that are permitted to operate and more recently the reopening of borders.

Over those six months, decisions on pandemic control were concentrated in the Emergency Operations Committee (COE). On December 21, President Moreno announced a new 30-day state of emergency and two weeks of night curfew to prevent new outbreaks during the holiday season and in response to the new UK strain of the virus. The new restrictions limit the time of traveling by car and reduce capacity at shopping centers restaurants and hotels. Key Policy Responses as of March 1, 2021Fiscal\t    The early containment measures focused on limiting the spread of the virus by closing the borders, public spaces and non-critical commercial activities, and imposing a nationwide curfew. These measures seem to have stabilized the pandemic outbreak, as the spread of the virus has slowed lately compared to other countries in the region (chart). Policy measures to protect lives and livelihoods amounting to $1.2 billion in 2020 included exceptional cash transfers to poor families ($250 million), distribution of food baskets, temporary relaxation of eligibility criteria for unemployment insurance ($372 million), and additional spending on health ($550 million). These measures were supplemented with a deferral of payroll contributions, tuition, health insurance, utilities, and housing support as well as temporary price controls for basic food items. Measures to support employment included the possibility of mutually agreed changes in labor contracts and introduction of shorter work week and more flexible work arrangements on a temporary basis.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    To address liquidity shortage in the financial system, the authorities reduced the banks\u2019 contribution rate to the Liquidity Fund by three percentage points of deposits (to 5 percent), freeing up about $950 million in liquid assets. This measure helped rebalance internal liquidity while the demand for cash also slowed gradually. In addition, they introduced an extraordinary deferral of private credit obligations on a voluntary basis (recently extended), mandated the revision of ceilings on interest rates, and introduced a working capital facility (Reactivate Ecuador) for enterprises financed by the World Bank. While the deferment measures will help support the real economy, if maintained for a prolonged period, they could weaken balance sheets of the financial institutions and represent downside risks for the financial system, especially during the transition to the post-emergency period.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top Egypt, Arab Republic ofBackground. According to the WHO, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 14, 2020. The pandemic is likely to impact the Egyptian economy primarily due to declining travel and tourist activity, reduced worker remittances, capital outflows, and slowdown in domestic activities as people are asked to stay home. The weaker demand in the global market will also reduce Egypt's exports as well as earnings from the Suez Canal. The authorities have taken a host of precautionary measures to improve testing as well as to limit the community spread of the virus, including setting up testing centers, imposing a nighttime curfew, temporarily closing places of worship, temporarily halting all air travel, and encouraging civil servants to work from home in non-essential sectors. Authorities also suspended the export of all types of legumes for a period of 3 months - which has been extended further for 3 more months in June 2020, and they plan to start increasing strategic food reserves to meet domestic demand. Egypt have resumed the export of medical supplies, after a temporary halt in March 2020. Around 77,000 Egyptians have been repatriated since the start of the pandemic. The central bank and the government are actively implementing measures to contain economic implications of the pandemic.Reopening of the economy. According to a Cabinet statement on April 30, 2020, the government had started to draw up plans to \u2018coexist\u2019 with COVID-19 in the long term. Since the last week of April 2020, shopping malls and retail outlets had been allowed to open on weekends until 5 pm, while restaurant customers had been allowed to place takeaway orders in-store.

Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    At the outset of the pandemic, large capital outflows had resulted in a drawdown of reserves to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility from the severe turbulence in financial markets. Portfolio flows have started recovering since June 2020.    Back to Top El SalvadorBackground. El Salvador has reported 26,773 positive cases (777 deaths, 17,433 recovered) as of September 11, 2020. The government has implemented a range of measures to contain the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, closure of schools, universities and the non-essential public sector, social distancing, and closure of restaurants. It has also transformed a convention center into a hospital specialized in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. On March 21, 2020, the government issued a nationwide stay-at-home order and closed all non-essential businesses. 2020Q1 y/y growth is 0.8 percent. Reopening of the economy. On June 2, the government allowed hardware stores and maintenance firms to re-open. The construction sector was granted permission to re-open for works related to the damage from a tropical storm. The government began the gradual reopening of the economy on June 16. The economy will reopen in five phases, each lasting 21 days. About 50 percent of the economy is open during phase 1. On July 19, President Bukele postponed indefinitely the move to phase 2 of reopening, which previously was scheduled for July 5 and moved to July 21. Economy reopened on August 24, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting the executive decree on phases of reopening.Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020Fiscal\t    Key spending and tax measures include: (i) a US$ 150 salary raise for all employees of the Ministry of Health and other public institutions affected by COVID-19; (ii) a one-time US$ 300 subsidy to approximately 75 percent of all households; (iii) distribution of 2.7 food baskets to affected families worth US$ 56 each; (iv) a 3-month deferral of utility payments; (v) a 3-month extension for income tax payments for taxpayers operating in the tourism sector with a taxable income lower than US$ 25,000, taxpayers operating in the electricity and telecommunication provision sectors, and all taxpayers with a tax obligation below US$ 10,000; (vi) a 3-month exemption from the special tourism tax for companies operating in the tourism industry; and (vii) a temporary elimination of import duties on essential medical and food imports (medical textiles, sanitizer, flour, rice, beans).

Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top Equatorial GuineaBackground.The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 14, 2020 and the government was proactive in implementing substantial preventive measures at an early stage. As of mid-June and early August 2020, preventive measures had been loosened to a large extent, lifting the stay-at-home order and closing of the airspace and allowing businesses to reopen. However, since mid-December, due to onset of a second wave, the authorities gradually reintroduced preventive measures. These measures include limiting the number of international flights to one per airline; requiring foreign visitors to present a negative PCR test and to quarantine for 5 days upon arrival in Equatorial Guinea; requiring local travelers between the continental and insular regions to present a negative PCR test; and restricting social gatherings, including through closure of all pubs/nightclubs and a 7pm-6am curfew. From February 15, 2021, in-person classes at all public and private schools in the main cities of Bata and Malabo have been suspended, while continuing with the monitoring of the evolution of the pandemic in the country.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Fiscal policy has been  facing two large  shocks: the Coronavirus and lower oil prices.   Regarding the latter, Equatorial Guinea has been facing a large fiscal revenue shock, given that hydrocarbons accounted for more than \u00be of fiscal revenues. To address this shock, the government has been postponing execution of non-priority capital expenditures, identifying savings to non-wage current expenditures and financing sources, urging public enterprises to cut personnel and costs as well as continuing implementation of plans to strengthen the tax administration. To address the Coronavirus, the government approved various measures in 2020. A broad emergency health spending package (1.0 percent of GDP) deepened investments focused on the first response system, quarantine facilities for incoming travelers, and laboratory facilities/testing. Furthermore, other spending measures were also taken (0.4 percent of GDP), mainly to ensure continuity of education and a social assistance scheme (0.3 percent of GDP) has been initiated for the most vulnerable and plans envisage to expand gradually to cover approximately 15 percent of the population. On the revenue side, the authorities have provided in 2020 some targeted and temporary support to the private sector (estimated cost of 0.3 percent of GDP), including halving withholding tax rates and delaying tax payment deadlines for small and medium-sized firms, and reducing electricity bills. In February 2021, the government started its vaccination campaign, for which the government secured 2.1 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine to cover at least 70 percent of the population in 4 phases. Phase 1 of the vaccination campaign has already begun with a focus on health workers, security/military personnel, and high-risk individuals for a total of about 10 percent of the population.         Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the range of private instruments accepted as collateral for refinancing operations. The BEAC also reduced haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as collateral for refinancing operations until end-2020, which it extended by 6 months from January 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting. Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities purchases for the next 6 months, which it extended by another 6 months starting on March 1, 2021 at its December 21, 2020 MPC meeting. The purchase program is meant as a safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances, while being consistent with BEAC Charter which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program is based on revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.    On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use their capital conservation buffers of 2.5 percent to absorb pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive policy with regard to dividend distribution. In July 2020, the COBAC prevented all banks from distributing any dividend for the years 2020 and 2021. The COBAC also put in place ad-hoc reporting to closely monitor financial stability developments following the COVID-19 crisis.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top EritreaBackground. The State of Eritrea reported its first positive COVID-19 case to the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 21, 2020, and since then, the cases have been increasing. The government imposed a 21-day national lockdown effective from April 2, which was extended on April 22, with restrictions being eased incrementally. However, as the pandemic has been spreading in all the regions including in some rural areas, the government issued new Guidelines to implement vigorous and stringent measures, effective on December 22, 2020.Under the new Guidelines, movement of all citizens is restricted except in cases of indispensable developmental, service and security tasks. Travel from one village/city to another village/city in the country is banned. The use of private cars and other individual means of transport (excluding trucks) is not allowed without permits. Trade services which are related to the daily livelihood of people may operate but close at 8:00 pm every evening, while all other trading services are closed. Major productive and service sectors (manufacturing, agriculture, food processing, construction, etc.) continue their functions while all government institutions stop routine services and functions to focus on indispensable developmental and security tasks. Any individual who violates these Guidelines will be punished.The Guidelines will be assessed periodically and relaxed depending on the trajectory and threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reopening of the economy. On June 28, the government published the guidelines on partial reopening of schools aiming to reopen all schools by end of July, 2020.Key Policy Responses as of March 1, 2021Fiscal\t    No measures.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    No measures.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures. The exchange rate is fixed.    Links21-day national lockdownGuidelines on partial reopening of schoolsNew Guidelines effective on December 22, 2020Back to Top EstoniaBackground. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the Estonian economy. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 27. The government has implemented a range of measures aimed at containing and mitigating the impact of the pandemic for workers and businesses. The measures include travel restrictions, social distancing, declaration of state of emergency, distance learning for schools, ban of public gatherings and sanitary inspections.  In recent weeks, the continued deterioration of the epidemiological situation as a result of a second wave of COVID-19 infections, has prompted the authorities to reintroduce travel restrictions, and a series of containment measures. As of February 3, 2021, the government led by Prime Minister Kaja Kallas shifted from targeted restrictions to harmonized restrictions across Estonia. GDP dropped by 2.9 percent in 2020, among the lowest in the EU, reflecting strong initial conditions and less stringent restrictions. Reopening of the economy and additional containment measures. The Government is rolling out the exit strategy approved on April 27, 2020. After being in place for 68 days, the emergency situation ended on May 18. Shopping centers and restaurants reopened on May 11; ferry links between Tallinn and the Finnish capital, Helsinki partly reopened for work-related traffic on May 14; schools reopened on May 15 with most of the learning remaining online; Baltic states now allow travel among the three nations but travelers from outside the region need to undergo 14-day quarantine. However, children\u2019s playrooms, casinos, slot machine halls and entertainment facilities including bowling alleys, billiard halls and adult clubs will remain closed. Gyms and swimming pools restarted operations on May 18. From June 1, Estonia reopened its borders to travelers from the EU and EEA nations without having to undergo a 14-day quarantine period. Bars and restaurants are now permitted to remain open and sell alcoholic beverages after 10 PM. Public events of up to 100 participants are now permissible with a maximum of 50 percent audience/space occupancy. Estonia has started to test digital immunity passports, seeking a safer return to workplaces following the coronavirus lockdown. Government has changed the requirement to adhere to the 2+2 rule to a recommendation. Government has decided to ease restrictions on spectator capacity at public events, from 500 to 1,500 persons for indoors and from 1000 to 2000 for outdoors, starting from July 15. The restrictions on indoor events, however, are strengthened again in September 29 from 1,500 to 750 persons in an effort to mitigate the second wave. Until August 31, it is forbidden to open direct air services from Estonia to high-risk countries experiencing 25 cases or more per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 14 days. The travel restrictions are regularly updated on the government websiteThe 14-day cumulative infections per 100,000 inhabitants remaind high and rapidly increasing reaching 1153 cases, as of  March 4, 2021. There were 572 COVID-19 patients being treated in hospitals (of which 28 people in intensive care) and the COVID -19 death toll stood at  623 people. The second wave of the COVID-19 has proven hard to curb, with Estonia now having one of the highest daily cases in Europe. As of February 3, 2021, the new government led by PM Kaja Kallas, harmonized restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus nationwide.  Tighter coronavirus containment measures were introduced on February 22, 2020 including: (i) requiring students from grade five and above to switch to distance learning for one week; (ii) prohibiting extra-curriculum group activities for at least two weeks; (iii) closing spas and water parks for two weeks; and (iv) tighter limits on the number of people that can attend indoor and outdoor events.   Meanwhile, Estonia has secured enough vaccines orders to cover its population, mainly from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca. On February 2, Estonia ordered more vaccine doses from two other firms on the EU's common vaccine portfolio: Novavax and Valneva. In line with the government strategy approved on December 15, the first to be vaccinated are priority groups healthcare professionals and people older than 70 with preexisting conditions. As of March 4, about 126,848 vaccine shots had been administered, of which 87,086 people only received the first dose, while 39,762 people received two doses. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    In addressing the socio-economic impact of the health crisis, the parliament approved a supplementary budget on April 15, 2020. Under this budget, the government is considering a support package of about \u20ac2 billion (7 percent of GDP) that would bring the nominal fiscal deficit to above 9 percent of GDP. The package would help among other things to buy supplies for the health facilities and to support workers and businesses. The package includes support to the Unemployment Insurance Fund to cover for wage reduction (\u20ac250 million); health insurance fund (\u20ac213 million); business loans to rural companies through the rural development fund (\u20ac200 million); guarantees/collateral for bank loans to allow for rescheduling of payments (\u20ac1 billion); business loans earmarked for liquidity support to companies (\u20ac500 million); support to local authorities (\u20ac130 million); investment loans to companies (\u20ac50 million); and compensation for direct costs of cancelled cultural and sporting events (\u20ac3 million). The government has also suspended payments to the Pillar II pension fund. The government signed an order raising the maximum volume of short-term notes that can be issued by Estonia by \u20ac600 million from previously \u20ac400 million bringing the total to \u20ac1 billion.  In December 2020, the Government approved new measures to support the areas and sectors most affected by the new restrictions to contain the second wave. A package of \u20ac5 million euros was approved on  December 17 to support businesses in Ida-Viru county and more generally culture, sports, and education all over Estonia. On December 30, the government approved a \u20ac30-million package to further support businesses in Harju and Ida-Viru counties, which are under the most stringent restrictions.  The measures mostly consisted of  wage support covering the period where. The government has signed with the Nordic Investment Bank a 15-year loan of \u20ac750 million. On June 3, Government successfully raised \u20ac1.5 billion (more than the \u20ac1 billion that was originally planned) through a 10-year Eurobond issue that has an interest rate of 0.125 per annum. Government has signed a \u20ac200 million loan with the council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) to finance local government\u2019s crisis mitigation measures.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    For monetary policy at the currency union level, please see Euro Area section.        Additionally, the Eesti Pank reduced the systemic risk buffer for the commercial banks from 1 percent to 0 percent on March 25, 2020 to free up resources for loan losses or new loans. The measure is expected to free up about \u20ac110 million for the banks. The Eesti Pank also announced that it will allocate \u00be of its 2019 profits equivalent to \u20ac18.9 million and maximum amount possible to support the state budget in the wake of COVID-19.        Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top EswatiniBackground. Eswatini reported its first COVID-19 case on March 14, 2020 and cases have been rising rapidly since then. In response, on March 17, the government declared a national state of emergency, and implemented containment measures, including suspension of private and public gatherings of 20 people or more, schools closures, suspension of non-essential travel within cities for all citizens, closure of borders to all but goods, cargo, returning citizens, and legal residents, and mandatory self-isolation for residents/citizens coming from abroad. On March 27, a partial lockdown went into effect, and a month later the Manzini region, where a third of the population resides, went into full lockdown. The authorities in collaboration with the WHO have built domestic detection capacity. Economic activity was affected by the closure of some ports of entry with South Africa and weak demand, registering a contraction of 9.1 percent in 2020Q2. The exchange rate against the USD which depreciated significantly in early 2020 had largely recovered to the pre-crisis level by the year end. On July 29, the IMF Executive Board approved US$110.4 million in emergency financial assistance under the Rapid Financing Instrument to support authorities\u2019 efforts in addressing the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 19, the World Bank has approved a US$40 million loan to support the economic recovery in the country.Reopening of the economy.Since May 8, the government has begun the process of carefully easing the partial lockdown by allowing some businesses to operate. The national emergency was further extended until November 19. Schools have reopened since July 6 in the completing classes, while other class levels will remain closed until January 2021 or further notice, and the government issued new guidelines allowing for religious and social gatherings under strict conditions. More businesses have been allowed to operate under established WHO and health guidelines since July 13. On September 30, the government lifted restrictions on international travel and issued a new travel advisory, requiring that international travelers present a negative COVID-19 certificate taken within 72 hours and discouraging non-essential travel. The ban on the production and sale of alcohol was initially lifted on October 26 but since then has been reinstated on January 21. Due to rapidly increasing COVID-19 infections in mid-December, the government implemented stricter restrictions on travel and gatherings and on January 9, the government implemented a new partial lockdown mandating restricted hours of operations for retailers. On February 19, the partial lockdown was extended for a further two weeks (still in effect).Eswatini has joined the COVAX Facility through which the country will secure vaccine doses to cover 20 percent of the population, of which 108,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine are expected in early March, and the remaining balance will arrive in 2021Q2. Government has further ordered 2 million doses from the Serum Institute of India and 237,328 doses from the AU, both expected to arrive in 2021Q2. The Eswatini National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (ESWANITAG) was appointed to provide scientific recommendations during the introduction of new vaccines and the implementation of immunization strategies.Key Policy Responses as of March 2, 2021Fiscal\t    \u2022\tIn FY21/22 the government has budgeted E200 million to procure vaccines for Eswatini's entire population.  In FY19/20 (ending March 31, 2020), a supplementary budget was approved for additional public healthcare of E100 million (0.14 percent of GDP). In addition, the authorities have put in place a response package in FY20/21 of E1 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) to increase healthcare capacity, ramp up food distribution and social protection transfers, and improve access to water and sanitation facilities for the most vulnerable. Food assistance has been provided, benefiting over 360,000 people. Low priority recurrent spending will be redirected to the fight against the pandemic and a portion of the capital budget will be reallocated towards refurbishing hospitals and completing new hospitals. The government has set up a revolving fund of E45 million (0.07 percent of GDP) to assist SMEs, which is currently near finalization in Parliament, and a E25 million (0.04 percent of GDP) relief fund to aid laid off workers, E12.8 million of which has been disbursed to laid off workers thus far. Revenue measures to mitigate the impact of the virus include: (i) taxpayers projecting losses will file loss provisional returns and no payment will be required; (ii) extension of returns filing deadlines by 3 months before penalties kick-in; (iii) payment arrangements for taxpayers facing cash flow problems; (iv) waiver of penalties and interest for older tax debts if principal is cleared by the end of September 2020; and (v) up to E90 million (0.13 percent of GDP) in tax refunds for SMEs that have complied with tax obligations, retain employees, and continue to pay them during this period. The authorities have reduced the price of fuel twice and postponed the planned increase in water and electricity prices. The government is also subsidizing the cost of required COVID-19 tests for informal cross-border traders, many of whom are women whose livelihoods depend on this trading activity. For more information see\u00a0 http://www.gov.sz/.        Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of Eswatini has: (i) reduced the discount rate by a cumulative 275 basis points to 3.75 percent and kept it unchanged during its meeting in September; (ii) reduced the reserve requirement to 5 percent (from 6 percent); (iii) reduced the liquidity requirement to 20 percent (from 25) for commercial banks and to 18 percent (from 22) for the development bank; (iv) encouraged greater use of electronic payments; and (v) encouraged banks to consider loan restructuring and repayment holidays.

The first confirmed case was reported on March 13, 2020. Despite a slow rate of initial community transmission, the pace of confirmed infections accelerated through the summer, with a peak of 1829 daily new cases reached on August 21, 2020. In the early response to the pandemic, the authorities declared a 5-month State of Emergency from April-September 2020 and closed land borders, banned inter-regional public transport and public gatherings, closed schools, ordered the shuttering of nightclubs and entertainment outlets, announced social distancing measures, and called in retired and in-training medical personnel. The authorities postponed the elections due to the pandemic from August 29, 2020 to the recently announced date of June 5, 2021. As new cases fell steadily from the August peak, the authorities lifted several measures. However, since late January 2021 a another surge in infections seems to be underway as daily new cases have risen sharply.Ethiopia is highly exposed to the shock through the large contribution of air transportation to exports: the national carrier, Ethiopian Airlines, which has the largest fleet in Africa, originally announced the suspension of 80 flight routes, but resumed flights to 40 destinations on July 13. The latest information shows that the airlines is operating flights to 116 international destinations and 23 domestic destinations. Ethiopia\u2019s goods exports were up 21 percent y/y in the first six months of the current fiscal year (2020/21), supported by gold exports while non-gold exports recovered from a decline in the first three months likely due to lower demand from the main destinations and closure of airports.  Services exports, dominated by revenues generated by international air transportation, have bottomed out but remained below the levels seen a year ago. Finally, Ethiopia benefits from improved terms of trade that arises not only from lower global oil prices, but also from the prices on its main export commodities such as coffee, oil seeds and flowers. The potential risk for COVID-19 transmission is high due to the large number of internally displaced persons living in collective sites with no options to implement the recommended norms of social distance, and no access to proper sanitation facilities and essential supplies. The dire health situation and the capacity challenges of the health system are exacerbated by other public health challenges such as cholera and measles outbreaks. According to projections of National Disaster Risk Management Committee, an estimated 30 million people could experience food consumption gaps. The urban poor are likely to be highly affected. In rural communities, food insecurity will worsen among households that rely on market purchases. COVID-19 prevention measures in some regions will likely contribute to delays in movement of commercial goods (and humanitarian goods) in the country, resulting in localized food insecurity due to shortages of food items or price increases. Finally, the humanitarian community is concerned about the ongoing deportation of Ethiopian migrants from Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Kenya and Somalia, considering the risk of COVID-19 contagion into Ethiopia, and challenges related to their reception and assistance in quarantine centers.  Growth in FY 2019/20, while below trend, surprised on the upside as the two largest sectors - agriculture and construction - shrugged off the impact of the pandemic. Growth for FY 2020/21 is expected to be 4 percentage points lower than the pre-crisis baseline.Reopening of the economy. The state of emergency, declared in April, ended in September, and since then there has been a steady decline in COVID related restrictions. Remaining measures include a requirement that all people entering Ethiopia from another country have a negative COVID test 120 hours prior to entering the country and undergo a mandatory 7-day quarantine at designated hotels at the traveler\u2019s expense. In addition, mask wearing remains a requirement in public spaces and schools generally operate on a rotational basis, with students assigned shifts to reduce in-person class size. Ethiopian Airlines resumed flights to about half of previously suspended destinations in July.Key Policy Responses as of March 1, 2021Fiscal\t    Ethiopia initially announced a Br 300 million package to bolster healthcare spending in early March. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced the aid package would be increased to Br 5 billion (US$154 million or 0.15 percent of GDP) but details on the precise modalities of the assistance were not made available. On April 3, the Prime Minister\u2019s office announced a COVID-19 Multi-Sectoral Preparedness and Response Plan, with prospective costing of interventions of US$1.64 billion (about 1.6 percent of GDP). The funds were expected to be allocated as follows: (i) $635 million (0.6 percent of GDP) for emergency food distribution to 15 million individuals vulnerable to food insecurity and not currently covered by the rural and urban PSNPs; (ii) $430 million (0.4 percent of GDP) for health sector response under a worst-case scenario of community spread with over 100,000 COVID-19 cases of infection in the country, primarily in urban areas; (iii) $282 million (0.3 percent of GDP) for provision of emergency shelter and non-food items; (iv)The remainder ($293 million, 0.3 percent of GDP) would be allocated to agricultural sector support, nutrition, the protection of vulnerable groups, additional education outlays, logistics, refugees support and site management support. Implementation of measures, which began in late-2019/20, have continued in the current fiscal year. For the fiscal year 2019/20, the authorities indicated that the COVID-19 related spending was 52.4 billion birr ($1.6 billion).    On April 30, the Council of Ministers approved measures to support firms and employment. These include forgiveness of all tax debt prior to 2014/2015, a tax amnesty on interest and penalties for tax debt pertaining to 2015/2016-2018/2019, and exemption from personal income tax withholding for 4 months for firms who keep paying employee salaries despite not being able to operate due to Covid-19.     On June 25, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office released a statement detailing measures intended to support FDI in the country through the crisis and recovery, including: (i) operational facilitation of logistics in export and import process (such as free railway transport of manufacturing goods between Ethiopia and Djibouti); (ii) removal of taxes from the import of raw materials for the production of Covid-19 essential goods, and lifting of the minimum price set by the NBE for horticulture exports.    For the fiscal year 2020/21, the authorities plan to allocate about 30 bn birr (or $0.8 bn) for COVID-19 related spending, including buying medical equipment; additional payment for health workers; food assistance for quarantines and isolation areas; procurement of hygiene facilities, disinfectants, and personal protection equipment.    Ethiopian authorities have received IMF support in the form of an RFI at 100 percent of quota (given maxed out use of PRGT resources under the ongoing ECF/EFF program).    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The central bank has provided 15 billion birr (0.45 percent of GDP) of additional liquidity to private banks to facilitate debt restructuring and prevent bankruptcies. It has also provided the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) with an ETB 16 billion 3-year liquidity line and has injected liquidity into hotel and tourism sectors through commercial banks.

Since the first reported cases on January 24, 2020, COVID-19 has  spread  across the European Union (EU) with a severe impact. The first wave, which peaked in April 2020, resulted in a surge of infections and deaths in some euro area countries. Cases and mortality subsided during the summer months, partly thanks to the unprecedented containment measures. However, as countries reopened in the fall, infection rates picked up again, requiring re-introduction of containment measures ranging from lockdowns and travel restrictions to school closures and bans on large gatherings. New daily cases in the last quarter of 2020 far exceeded the first wave\u2019s peak while mortality rates\u2014albeit increasing\u2014has so far remained below the levels seen in April. Overall in 2020,real GDP contracted by 6.8 and 6.4 percent in the euro area and the EU, respectively. On December 2, the European Commission adopted a  strategy for managing the pandemic over the winter months, recommending continued vigilance and caution until safe and effective vaccines become available in early 2021. The European Commission, acting on behalf of all EU countries, has signed six advance purchase agreements with major vaccine producers, for a total of 1.5 billion vaccine doses, with options to expand the total supply to 2 billion. Member states have agreed to abstain from negotiating with vaccine manufacturers with whom the EU has already reached agreements. Reopening of the economy. The European Commission presented  guidelinesfor exit strategies and called for a common framework across member states. The criteria include: (i) sustained reduction and stabilization of new cases, (ii) sufficient health system capacity such as adequate hospital beds, pharmaceutical products, and equipment, and (iii) appropriate monitoring capacity to quickly detect and isolate infected individuals as well as to trace contacts. The Commission recommendedSchengen Member States and Schengen Associated States to lift internal border controls by June 15, 2020, extend the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 30 June, and set out an approachto progressively lifting the restriction afterwards. As of July 1, residents of certain third countries, which have met a set of criteria, should not be affected by temporary external borders restriction on non-essential travel into the EU. On May 20, the European Commission proposed country-specific recommendationsproviding economic policy guidance to all EU Member States, with a focus on the most urgent challenges brought about by the pandemic and on relaunching sustainable growth.Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    On December 11, EU leaders finalize the agreement on the EU budget and Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery fund on December 11. The Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery fund will provide \u20ac750 billion in total, financed by borrowing at the EU level. The funds are split between grants (\u20ac390 billion) and loans (\u20ac360 billion) which will be channeled through a special Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and a top-up to existing EU budget programs. Most of the money is set to be committed in 2021-23, with 70 percent of grants to be committed in 2021-22. To ensure a frontloading of disbursements, national expenditures undertaken since February 1, 2020 will potentially be eligible for funding. While the exact allocation of some of the funds remains to be determined, high-debt countries hit hard by the pandemic (e.g., Italy, Spain) and Eastern European countries will be the biggest net beneficiaries from the RRF. Overall, 30 percent of the NGEU and the 2021-27 EU budget will be targeted towards climate change related spending. The European Council and European Parliament now need to take steps to adopt the relevant legislation, including the OwnResources Decision, which must also be ratified by member states' parliaments.     The European Commission\u2019s latest package    of about \u20ac540 billion (4 percent of EU27 GDP) includes (i) allowing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to provide Pandemic Crisis Support (based on existing precautionary credit lines) up to 2 percent of 2019 GDP for each euro area country (up to \u20ac240 billion in total) to finance health related spending; (ii) providing \u20ac25 billion in government guarantees to the European Investment Bank (EIB) to support up to \u20ac200 billion to finance to companies, with a focus on SMEs (which augments previously agreed guarantees of \u20ac40 billion for the EIB\u2019s on-lending activities); and (iii) creating a temporary loan-based instrument (SURE) of up to \u20ac100 billion to protect workers and jobs, supported by guarantees from EU Member States. The Pandemic Crisis Support from the ESM has become operational and the European Council has adopted the SURE.    Key measures from the EU Budget (about \u20ac37 billion and 0.3 percent of 2019 EU27 GDP) include (i) establishing the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII) and the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+) in the EU budget to support public investment for hospitals, SMEs, labor markets, and stressed regions; (ii) extending the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund to include a public health crisis, with a view of mobilizing it if needed for the hardest-hit EU Member States (up to \u20ac800 million is available in 2020); (iii) redirecting \u20ac1 billion from the EU Budget as a guarantee to the European Investment Fund to incentivize banks to provide liquidity to SMEs and midcaps; (iv) announcing credit holidays to crisis-affected debtors; and (v) adopting a proposal for a \u20ac3 billion macro-financial assistance (MFA) package to ten enlargement and neighborhood partners to help them limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The European Commission proposed modifications    to its 2020 budget to make \u20ac11.5 billion for crisis repair and recovery available already this year. The European Commission also activated the general escape clause in the EU fiscal rules, which suspends the fiscal adjustment requirements for countries that are not at their medium-term objective and allows them to run deficits in excess of 3 percent of GDP. After announcing a flexible interpretation of EU State Aid rules to support national support measures for critical sectors, the European Commission has further directed Member States to apply Article 107(2)(b) TFEU, which enables them to compensate companies for the damage directly caused by exceptional occurrences, such as COVID-19, including measures in sectors such as aviation and tourism. To date, national liquidity measures, including schemes approved by the European Commission under temporary flexible EU State Aid rules amounted to \u20ac3 trillion.        On May 8, the European Commission adopted    a second amendment to extend the scope of the State Aid Temporary Framework to recapitalization and subordinated debt measures to further support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. The amended Temporary Framework will be in place until the end of December 2020, except for recapitalization measures which has an extended period by the end of June 2021. The Commission will assess before these dates if they need to be extended    Monetary and macro-financial\t    At the onset of the pandemic the ECB decided to provide monetary policy support\u00a0 through (i) additional asset purchases of \u20ac120 billion until end-2020 under the existing program (APP), and (ii) temporary additional auctions of the full-allotment, fixed rate temporary liquidity facility at the deposit facility rate and more favorable terms on existing targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) between June 2020 and June 2021, with interest rates that can go as low as 50 bp below the average deposit facility rate. The ECB introduced a new liquidity facility (PELTRO), which consists of a series of non-targeted Pandemic Emergency Longer-Term Refinancing Operations carried out with an interest rate that is 25bp below the average MRO rate prevailing over the life of the operation. The PELTROs commenced in May will mature in a staggered sequence between July and September 2021.The ECB also introduced an additional \u20ac750 billion asset purchase program of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, PEPP), initially through end-2020. On June 4, the ECB announced further measures including an expanded range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase program (CSPP), and relaxation of collateral standards for Eurosystem refinancing operations (MROs, LTROs, TLTROs). The ECB also announced a broad package of  collateral easing measures    for Eurosytem credit operations in early April. These include a permanent collateral haircut reduction of 20 percent for non-marketable assets, and temporary measures for the duration of the PEPP (with a view to re-assess their effectiveness before the end of 2020) such as a reduction of collateral haircuts by 20 percent, an expansion of collateral eligibility to include Greek sovereign bonds as well as an expansion of the scope of so-called additional credit claims framework so that it may also include public sector-guaranteed loans to SMEs, self-employed individuals, and households. In a move to mitigate the impact of possible rating downgrades on collateral availability,    on April 22, the ECB also announced that it would grandfather until September 2021 the eligibility of marketable assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations falling below current minimum credit quality requirements of \u201cBBB-\u201c (\u201cA-\u201c for asset-backed securities) as long as their rating remains at or above \u201cBB\u201d (\u201cBB+\u201d for asset-backed securities). Assets that fall below these minimum credit quality requirements will be subject to haircuts based on their actual ratings. On June 25, the ECB set up the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks    (EUREP) to provide precautionary euro repo lines to central banks outside the euro area, which complements existing bilateral swap and repo lines. The EUREP addresses possible euro liquidity needs in case of market dysfunction that might adversely impact the smooth transmission of ECB monetary policy.    On December 10, the ECB Governing Council extended the duration and scale of several monetary policy instruments, reflecting a weaker inflation outlook. The recalibration of the ECB's instruments included: (i) increase in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) by \u20ac500 billion to \u20ac1,850 billion and extension of its duration by nine months to at least the end of March 2022 (from June 2021), (ii) modification of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) terms, including by extending the period over which banks can secure favorable terms through June 2022, increasing the borrowing limits, and announcing three additional operations to be conducted between June and December 2021, (iii)extension of theApril 2020 collateral easing measures to June 2022, (iv) announcing four additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) in 2021 to act as a liquidity backstop.        The ECB Banking Supervisionallowed significant institutions\u00a0    to operate temporarily below the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer, and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). In addition, new rules on the composition of capital to meet Pillar 2 Requirement (P2R) were front-loaded to release additional capital. The ECB considers that the appropriate release of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities will enhance its capital relief measures. In addition, the ECB Banking Supervision allowed banks under direct supervision (i.e., the largest banks) to exclude cash holdings and central bank reserves from the calculation of their leverage ratio    until end-June 2021. The leverage ratio is currently not a prudential requirement for banks but will become mandatory next year. If further decided    to exercise \u2013 on a temporary basis \u2013 flexibility in the classification requirements and expectations on loss provisioning for non-performing loans (NPLs) that are covered by public guarantees and COVID-19 related public moratoria; it also recommended that banks avoid pro-cyclical assumptions for the determination of loss provisions and opt for the IFRS9 transitional rules. The ECB Banking Supervision also provided some temporary capital relief for market risk    by adjusting the prudential floor to banks\u2019 current minimum capital requirement.    On December 15, the ECB Banking Supervision relaxed its recommendation that banks suspend dividend payments and share buybacks. Nine months after the ECB had asked banks to cease all dividends and share buybacks to conserve \u20ac30 billion of capital in March, the region's strongest banks can now resume dividend payments until September 30, 2021, within strict limits if their capital buffers are sufficient to absorb expected loan losses.    On June 18, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted    the \"banking package,\" which was proposed by the European Commission on April 28. The package provides targeted and exceptional legislative changes to the capital requirements regulation (CRR 2), including greater flexibility in the application of the EU\u2019s accounting and prudential rules, which are aimed at facilitating bank lending to support the economy.    The European Commission proposed on July 24 a Capital Markets Recovery Package    with targeted adjustments to capital market rules, which aim to encourage greater investments in the economy, allow for the rapid re-capitalization of companies, and increase banks' capacity to finance the recovery.    On September 21, the European Banking Authority (EBA) announced    that its temporary guidance    (April) emphasizing flexible provisioning for loans that have been granted debt repayment relief would lapse after end-September. Banks have been asked to reinstate their steady-state risk management and asset valuation processes. On December 2, EBA reactivated    its guidelines until March 31, 2021 to ensure that loans, which had previously not benefitted from moratoria, can now also benefit from them. The guidelines were amended and include two safeguards, a 9-month eligibility limit on loans and the requirement for banks to submit plans that help avoid these exposures from becoming impaired.    On November 30, the Eurogroup agreed to proceed with the ESM reform and introduced a common backstop for the SRF by early 2022, pending ratification of the amended ESM treaty by member state parliaments.    The European Commission published an action plan on non-performing loans (NPLs)on December 16, amid fears of rising NPLs due to COVID. In its plan, the Commission proposes for instance a systemic risk exception under its legal framework (BRRD) for COVID-19, which would enable member states to extent state aid to otherwise solvent banks and national asset management companies (AMC).    On December 17, the European Securities and Markets Authority set guidelines for mitigating leverage risks of hedge funds. The agency published    common criteria for assessing leverage risk as well as the design, calibration and implementation of leverage limits.

The early imposition of travel restrictions limited imported infections. The authorities reacted to the first confirmed case with a broad set of measures, including massive screenings of the population, the closure of the international airport, restrictions on domestic travel and public gatherings, closures of schools and certain types of businesses (e.g. cinemas, gyms, etc.), a nationwide curfew and lockdowns of affected areas halted the spread of cases in the country. The repatriation of Fijian citizens since July led to a temporary rise in border cases. These were quarantined in government-designated facilities and there have been only few confirmed cases since. Under the COVAX initiative, Fijian authorities are in the process of acquiring COVID-19 vaccines and the initial batches will be used to safeguard frontline health workers.      Reopening of the economy.The authorities started relaxing containment and mitigation measures at the national level on April 26th. Phase 2 of Fiji\u2019s COVID-safe Economic Recovery Plan, announced on June 21, led to the gradual easing of some restrictions (e.g. national curfew, limitations on public gatherings) and the reopening of schools and certain recreational facilities under strict conditions. The reopening of the economy under Phase 2 has been tied to the launch of Care FIJI, a contact-tracing mobile application. On Oct 15, the tourism ministry launched Care Fiji commitment program to promote tourism and to increase awareness among the visitors about pandemic related safety measures. It also removed mandatory 14 days quarantine requirements for visitors from COVID contained countries. Further, Tourism Fiji announced the first ever virtual Fijian Tourism Expo on November 25, 2020, to promote tourism and business activities in the country. The Expo is aimed at bringing together potential investors from Australia, New Zealand and leading industrialists in Fiji.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021 Fiscal\t    The authorities have announced two major fiscal stimulus packages in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, one on March 26 and one on July 17. The first package entailed up to FJ$1 billion (8.7 percent of GDP) in supplemental expenditures on public health, lump sum payments through the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), tax and tariff reductions, and loan repayment holidays (up to F$ 400 million of the total envelope) aim at protecting public health, supporting the economy and ensuring food security. The second fiscal package was announced as part of the FY2020-21 budget for the fiscal year beginning in August. The stimulus mainly consists of sizeable tax and tariff cuts. Fiscal and import excise duties on over 1,600 items were reduced or eliminated. Similarly, the budget includes cuts to the service turnover tax, environmental tax and departure tax. The budget also entails a total of F$100 million for unemployment assistance and a subsidy to Fiji Airways of F$60 million to incentivize first 150,000 tourists in new fiscal year.    The government has also implemented several additional measures in between the two stimulus packages, including an Agricultural Response Package to ensure food security was also announced. It includes the scaling up of the existing Home Gardening program and a new Farm Support Package which aims at boosting the production of short-term crops through seeds and materials distribution. The government also introduced several additional allocations amounting F$50.9 million for the development of sugar sector. In addition, the government expanded its unemployment assistance, guaranteed the debt of Fiji Airways and announced a concessional loans initiative for MSMEs impacted by COVID-19, approving loans of in the amount of F$ 23.5 million (as of Oct 12, 2020). The government\u2019s initiatives aim to improve the investment ratio, which has fallen to 12.8 percent against an average of 20 percent in the last three years. The authorities also announced a new hiring subsidy program under which the government will pay the minimum wage of F$ 2.68 per hour and the remainder will be paid by the employers.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Reserve Bank of Fiji reduced the overnight policy rate to 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent on March 18 to counter the economic impact of COVID-19.

Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    Fiji\u2019s currency is pegged to a basket of currencies amid limited capital mobility. The Fijian dollar depreciated by 9 percent against the U.S. dollar between January 1 and March 20, 2020, before gradually appreciating since then, rising above its end-2019 level. The Reserve Bank of Fiji tightened exchange controls on April 3 and June 11 to ensure that adequate foreign reserves can be maintained. It reported foreign exchange reserves stood at F$2,187 million as of February 26th 2021. The reserves increased on account of fresh loans from ADB and World Bank and a grant by the European Union. The ADB has announced to provide US$ 2million to Fiji from its Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund (APDRF) to respond to pandemic crisis in the country. In early February, the World Bank approved F$102.7 million to support pandemic and cyclone relief. Moreover, the Japanese government provided an emergency loan of F$ 200 million to strengthen its public health system against the pandemic.    \t        The Fijian Government and the United States signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) to promote trade and investment ties between the two countries.

The number and incidence of new coronavirus infections remains small nationally (one of the lowest in Europe) but a third wave is underway and cases surged dramatically in recent weeks. In response to the crisis, in addition to measures announced by the euro area, the Finnish government announced a package of fiscal, liquidity and regulatory measures which \u2013 combined with existing automatic stabilizers \u2013 would (if fully utilized) constitute an impulse of nearly 30 percent of GDP. On March 16, the government invoked the Emergency Powers Act, which was used to close borders, restrict domestic movements, and expand service obligations of essential personnel.  In response, unemployment climbed to nearly 12 percent in March.  Reopening of the economy. Restrictions to and from the region of Helsinki were lifted on April 14. On May 4, the government announced a plan to lift broad restrictions in favor of more targeted containment measures, including: on May 14, resumption of primary and lower secondary school and cross-border movement of essential traffic; on June 1, reopening of restaurants and public facilities and limits on public gatherings increased from 10 to 50 people; on July 31, resumption of public events with more than 500 people. Effective June 16, the government repealed the use of powers under the Emergency Powers Act, declaring that the country is no longer in a state of emergency. Barring any significant setbacks, the restrictions on gatherings will be lifted altogether on October 1. On June 23, the government announced the lifting of internal border control and restrictions on traffic between Finland and countries with similar incidence of COVID-19 with a limit value of 8 new cases per 100,000 persons in the previous 14 days. As of July 13, travel between Finland and non-EU countries on the \u2018green list\u2019 approved by the Council of the European Union will be permitted subject to restrictions which depend on the incidence of COVID-19. On August 13, the government adopted resolutions on recommendations for wearing face coverings and face masks, and for remote work. On August 18, the government reinstated travel restrictions on traffic between Finland and several countries based on their 14-day incidence rates. This is in addition to entry restrictions for three countries introduced on August 6. The government adopted on September 11 a decision to continue internal border checks and restrictions on border traffic, which entered into force on September 19 and will continue through October 18. The government also adopted a resolution on a hybrid strategy for cross-border traffic and travel which requires a rapid increase in cross-border testing capacity and analysis by 10,000 tests/day. This would allow a more flexible approach to border restrictions. On September 24, the government reintroduced travel restrictions between Finland and several Schengen area countries. The government has imposed new restrictions starting October 8 on the opening and licensing hours of food and beverage service businesses. As of November 20, restrictions on the activities of food and beverage service businesses in five regions will continue due to their epidemiological conditions. On November 19, the government decided to extend till December 13 the entry restrictions into Finland due to the acceleration of the COVID-19 epidemic elsewhere. The government continues to recommend that Finnish citizens and residents avoid unnecessary travel to high-risk countries. On December 10, the Government adopted a resolution on Finland\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine strategy: Vaccination will be offered based on medical risk assessments with priority given to healthcare and social welfare workers caring for COVID-19 patients, homecare workers, elderly persons, and persons at high risk for severe disease due to underlying health conditions. Finland is participating in the European Union\u2019s joint vaccine procurement. The cumulative number of vaccinations per 100,000 people is roughly 8,900 as of March 4, 2021.  On February 4, 2021, the government submitted a proposal to parliament to extend the validity of the temporary provisions of the Communicable Diseases Act on restrictions concerning food and beverage service businesses till the end of June 2021. On March 1, 2021, the government declared a state of emergency and proposed the closure of restaurants and bars through March 28. The government is yet to invoke the Emergency Powers Act but stands ready to do so depending on epidemiological developments. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Key discretionary tax and spending measures(around 3 percent of GDP) include additional spending for (i): healthcare and testing, protection and medical equipment, public safety and border controls, and research on the coronavirus epidemic, in particular to develop methods for rapid diagnostics and vaccines and a knowledge base for timely decision-making on coronavirus measures, (especially on the exit strategy) (\u20ac3 billion); (ii) lower pension contributions through the remainder of 2020 (\u20ac1.05 billion); (iii) grants to SMEs and self-employed (over \u20ac1 billion); and (iv) expanded parental allowance, social assistance and unemployment insurance (\u20ac3 billion). In addition to discretionary measures, automatic stabilizers are expected to increase the fiscal deficit by about 4-5.0 percentage points of GDP. Deferral of tax and pension payments for 3 months are expected to provide additional short-run relief of 2 percent of GDP (\u20ac4.5 billion). Finland is also contributing \u20ac5 million to international non-profit companies working on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. On April 15, the Finnish Government agreed to increase funding for the World Health Organization (WHO) to \u20ac5.5 million. This brings funding to the 2015 level and marks a \u20ac1.9 million increase from 2019. On April 29, the government announced a \u20ac500 million recapitalization scheme for Finnair (which is 56% state-owned) and other state-owned companies.

On July 9, the government adopted an amendment that allows Business Finland to grant temporary financing to companies with financial difficulties that ordinarily fail to meet eligibility requirements for support from the Decree on Funding for Research, Development, and Innovation Activities. On September 3, the government published a fifth supplementary budget proposal for 2020 which included \u20ac60 million to support the most vulnerable in society for which restrictive measure imposed due to the pandemic have generated additional costs. The proposal also included an increase of \u20ac1 billion in revenue estimates due to less than anticipated use of flexible tax-related payment arrangement introduced to support liquidity. On September 24, the government submitted to parliament a sixth supplementary budget proposal for 2020 which included \u20ac200 million to support the rapid increase in cross-border testing capacity and analysis as part of the hybrid strategy for cross-border traffic and travel.

Key measures within Finland    include:(i) Bank of Finland to support liquidity through investing in short-term Finnish corporate commercial paper (\u20ac1 billion); (ii) 1 ppt reduction in the structural buffer requirements of all credit institutions by removing the systemic risk buffer and adjusting institution-specific requirements (increases Finnish banks\u2019 international lending capacity by an estimated \u20ac52 billion \u2013 that, plus other countries\u2019 measures, increase lending capacity to Finnish households and firms by an estimated \u20ac30 billion); (iii) Finland\u2019s Export Credit Agency is expanding its lending and guarantee capacity to SMEs by \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac12 billion  (and the government increased its coverage of the agency\u2019s credit and guarantee losses from 50 to 80 percent); (iv) the State Pension Fund will also invest in commercial paper (\u20ac1 billion); (v) a state guarantee for Finnair (\u20ac600 million); (vi) state guarantee for shipping companies (\u20ac600 million); and (vii) easier re-borrowing of pension contributions allowed; support restaurants in employing workers (\u20ac40 million) and compensation for the imposed restrictions on activities (\u20ac 83 million). The fourth supplementary budget contains financial and liquidity measures including increased capitalization into the national climate fund (\u20ac300 million) and capital funding for state-owned enterprises (\u20ac770 million). On June 29, Finland\u2019s Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) relaxed to 90 percent the macroprudential limit on loan-to-collateral ratios for residential mortgages. On September 30, the FIN-FSA Board decided not to extend the validity of the 15% risk weight floor on housing loans which is due to expire January 1, 2021. On February 17, 2021, FIN-FSA amended its regulations and guidelines related to the common reporting framework and EU Capital Requirements Regulation to reflect European Banking Authority (EBA) COVID-19 related guidelines.

The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on January 24, 2020. After a steady decline since mid-April, infections are surging again, with daily new cases past the previous first-wave peak. Localized clusters with outbreaks are being continuously monitored. In mid-March the government introduced a range of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including school closures, the ban of all non-essential activities, outings and long-distance travel, and the introduction of night-time curfews in some cities. The French economy contracted by 5.9 percent in Q1-2020, compared to the previous quarter, and by 13.7 percent in Q2-2020. Activity rebounded strongly in Q3-2020, with GDP growing by 18.5 percent and fell again by 1.3 percent during the last quarter of 2020. Overall,  France\u2019s GDP contracted by 8.3 percent in 2020.Reopening of the economy and additional containment efforts.  As of May 11, France started to ease the first round of containment measures, beginning with the reopening of primary schools, shops, and industry, on a differentiated regional basis.  Most major domestic restrictions associated with the first lockdown were lifted as of June 22 (including travel restrictions). The resurgence of infections at end-August prompted the government to first apply regional night curfews, and, eventually a second lockdown beginning October 30. Schools remained open but non-essential retail and services were ordered to close. Regional and international travel restrictions were also applied. A progressive lifting of the lockdown rules began at the end of the November with the opening of retail stores. As of mid-December, the lockdown was replaced by a curfew from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m. The curfew was tightened in mid-January, scheduled to begin earlier at 6 p.m., and is currently in force throughout France.  Bars, restaurants, gyms and all cultural places remain closed. Covid-19 vaccinations commenced on December 28, 2020, with over 3 million people already vaccinated with at least one dose.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities have introduced four amending budget laws between March and November increasing the fiscal envelope devoted to addressing the crisis to about \u20ac180 billion (around 8 percent of GDP, including liquidity measures). This adds to a package of public guarantees of \u20ac327 \u00bd billion (close to 15 percent of GDP), including \u20ac315 billion in guarantees for bank loans and credit reinsurance schemes. Key fiscal support measures include (i) streamlining and boosting health insurance for the sick or their caregivers; (ii) increasing spending on health supplies; (iii) liquidity support through postponements of social security and tax payments for companies and accelerated refund of tax credits (e.g. CIT and VAT); (iv) support for wages of workers under the short-time work scheme; (v) direct financial support for affected microenterprises, liberal professions, and independent workers, as well as for low-income households; and (vi) postponement of rent and utility payments for affected microenterprises and SMEs; (viii) additional allocation for equity investments or nationalizations of companies in difficulty; (ix) facilitating granting of exceptional bonuses exempt from social security contributions; (x) extension of expiring unemployment benefits until the end of the lockdown and preservation of rights and benefits under the disability and active solidarity income schemes; and (xi) support measures for the hardest-hit sectors (e.g. including incentives to purchase greener vehicles and green investment support for the auto and aerospace sectors).    Some support measures had been gradually phased out after June 2020 (e.g. by scaling down the generosity of the reduced-hour scheme, with exceptions for heavily affected sectors, like tourism) but were subsequently expanded in response to the reintroduction of lockdown measures since end-October. The 2021 budget voted in December included additional funding for emergency programs amid ongoing containment measures (around 0.7 percent of GDP, with about 0.4 percent of GDP financed by unused appropriations from 2020).    The 2021 budget also incorporated key elements of the fiscal package (\u201cPlan de Relance\u201d) announced in September 2020 to support the recovery of the French economy. The recovery plan includes measures amounting to about 100 billion euros over two years and focuses on the ecological transformation of the economy, increasing the competitiveness of French firms, and supporting social and territorial cohesion. About 40 billion of the plan is expected to be covered by grants from the EU Recovery Fund.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    For monetary policy at the currency union level, please see Euro Area section.        Other measures include: (i) reducing the    counter-cyclical bank capital buffer    to 0 percent (an increase from 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent was to become    effective by April); (ii)    a temporary ban on short-selling stocks    was in place until May 18; and (iii) credit mediation to support    renegotiation of SMEs\u2019 bank loans.

GBack to Top GabonBackground. Gabon, as all oil exporters, is being hit by two shocks\u2014the global impacts of COVID-19 and the decline in oil prices last year. Government policy is responding to both these developments. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 12, 2020. Authorities have taken early action attempting to suppress COVID19. They have been following WHO-recommended measures and enhancing them over time. The primary measures, which included bans on social gatherings and travel restrictions have been enhanced over time to closing all borders, the air space, imposing a night curfew and a full lockdown in Libreville since Easter Sunday, as cases started to increase.  Reopening of the economy. Since April 27, some of these measures were relaxed, including the full lockdown in Libreville. A second reopening wave started on July 1 with the reopening of commercial flights twice per week per company from Libreville and a reduced night curfew from 8pm till 5am. Since mid-August commercial flights were further relaxed to three flights per company per week departing from Gabon. Public schools reopened on November 7, 2020. Since early September, the test for domestic trips could be performed up to 14 days prior to departure. All passengers arriving in Libreville\u2019s airport from abroad must show a negative test performed in the last five days. At arrival, they are once more tested by Gabonese authorities in the airport for posterior tracing. On October 10, a new round of relaxation of the preventive measures was announced, allowing restaurants and religious centers to resume activity and shortening the night curfew from 10pm till 5am. Such gradual reopening of the economy was based on a comprehensive-testing strategy with a capability of around 10,000 tests to be performed per day and with the equivalent of more than twenty-five percent of the population tested, making the country one with the highest rates of testing per capita of sub-Saharan Africa. The Gabonese parliament has also launched at the end of the first semester a Parliamentary Inquire Committee to investigate the quality and transparency of the Covid-19 expenditures by the government. The Ministry of Health is currently preparing a national vaccination strategy against the disease. At the same time an aggressive second wave of infections has hit the country and the preventive measures have been strengthened. The night curfew has been re-enlarged from 6 pm until 5am, causing business to close around 3pm. The capital, Libreville, has been put in confinement for domestic travelers and only two international flights per company can land in Gabon per week again. Masks became compulsory for the population above 5 years-old and restaurants and shops must demand a negative test from clients within the last seven days.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The Amended Budget Law approved in end-June 2020 proposed the control of non-priority expenditure and redirects savings and development partners support of FCFA 73.9 billion (USD 138.1 million or 0.83 percent of GDP) to COVID-19 related spending. The government also plans to allocate additional FCFA 108 billion (USD 194.1 million or 1.2 percent of GDP) as an economic response, including through food stamps, electricity and water subsidies, direct support to SMEs and tax holidays. The Minister of Finance has created a fund available at their Caisse de Depots et Consignation (CDC) and designated a public accountant in order to facilitate disbursements of the health-related spending of that fund. An additional mechanism of around USD 375 million has further been announced to facilitate access to commercial banks financing for private (formal and informal) companies, including SMEs. The promulgated 2021 Budget Law allocates FCFA 3 billion (USD 6 million) for additional Covid-19 expenditures.        Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary operations. The MPC also supported BEAC\u2019s management\u2019s intent to propose to reduce haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as collateral for refinancing operations, and to postpone by one-year principal repayment of consolidated central bank\u2019s credits to member states, but these possible additional measures are not effective yet. Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities purchases for the next 6 months. The purchase program is meant as a safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances during the second half of 2020, while being consistent with BEAC Charter which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program will be based on revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.    On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use their capital conservation buffers of 2.5 percent to absorb pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive policy with regard to dividend distribution.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top The GambiaBackground.  The Gambia registered its first COVID-19 case on March 17, 2020, involving a female Gambian returnee from the United Kingdom. The number of cases and the rate of infection increased, albeit at a slow rate, until mid-July. The President declared a state of public health emergency starting from March 27, including closing all non-essential public and private businesses, following an earlier order to close the airspace and land borders. Emergency powers were used to freeze prices of essential commodities such as rice, meat, fish, cooking oil soap, sanitizers, and cement. To enforce social distancing, all commercial vehicles were allowed to carry only up to half of their licensed number of passengers. All public gatherings, including funerals, were limited to a maximum of 10 people. Nevertheless, there was a surge in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by mid-July, mainly through community transmission involving many healthcare workers and high-level government officials. The surge strained the already fragile health system and stretched government\u2019s ability to properly respond to the pandemic, especially in terms of testing and management of treatment centers.  The imposition and extension of the state of public health emergency have not been plain sailing. The National Assembly declined to approve a second 45-day extension of the state of public health emergency after the expiration of the first. However, based on the role played by the emergency measures in containing the spread of the disease, the President used executive powers to extend it by 21 days, effective May 19 (which is the maximum allowed under the Constitution, as the National Assembly was then not in session). Since the expiration of the extension, the President used executive powers again (on June 10, July 1, and July 7) to extend the state of public health emergency, mainly for 7 days, which is the maximum permissible period under the constitution, when the National Assembly is in session. Concerned by the extensions of the state of public health emergency without parliamentary approval, the Gambia Bar Association, and the National Assembly in particular, questioned the legitimacy of such extensions. The Attorney General and Minister of Justice presented a motion at the National Assembly around July 13 for a 45-day extension of the public health emergency laws, but it failed after majority of the lawmakers voted against it. The situation led the President to announce another 7-day extension of the public health emergency to July 22, 2020. At the same time, the presidency urged the public to observe strict social distancing, and imposed a mandatory wearing of facemasks in all public places, including inside taxis and other public transports, markets, and schools, while  empowering the Minister of Health to take any restrictive measures required to contain the disease. With the mid-July surge in the number of new Covid-19 infections, the presidency announced another 21-day public emergency regulation, effective August 6, 2020. The regulation imposed a night-time curfew between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. and re-introduced a ban on all public gatherings and closure of all non-essential businesses, educational institutions, and places of worship. A subsequent extension of the emergency regulation on August 27 eased some of the emergency restrictions, including the opening of places of worship, albeit under strict COVID-19 protocols. It also maintained the ban on public gatherings and the night-time curfew, which was relaxed subsequently on September 17 together with market restrictions. In anticipation of the re-opening of the tourism season in October, and in the bid to attract tourists, the authorities announced, on September 4, an amendment to their guidelines on COVID-19 prevention. They abolished the two-week mandatory quarantine for inbound travelers and required evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result of less than 72 hours from all passengers prior to departure to The Gambia. Those without the required certificate as well as those who are COVID-19 positive will be quarantined. Meanwhile, following the second wave of the surge in Covid-19 cases and the emergence of a new strain of the virus in America, Europe and parts of Africa, the authorities have amended their rules regarding visits to The Gambia. Effective January 9, travelers coming from countries where the new strain of the Covid-19 virus is identified will have to undergo (i) testing for the virus upon arrival, in addition to the requirement to have a valid COVID-19 PCR test result of no more than 72 hours; and (ii) mandatory quarantine at their own cost. The resumption and continued surge in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases have compelled the authorities to announce on February 17 the suspension of police permits for all forms of political and social events, including music festivals. The new measures, the details of which the authorities will lay out in due course, come into effect on March 8, 2021.Tourism, a key driver of trade and foreign exchange inflows, has halted. Interest rates on T-bills increased at the onset of the pandemic but have eased on the back of subdued inflation and measures taken by the Central Bank to support market liquidity. Remittances from official channels have remained exceptionally high, in part, due to a reduction in private transfers through informal channels (which have since migrated to formal channels) and remittances from the Gambian diaspora in response to COVID-19. At the onset of the pandemic, a supplementary appropriation bill was approved by the National Assembly to accommodate spending on the health emergency and social support, and to facilitate the recovery through infrastructure spending and support to the tourism sector. Vaccination.The Gambia is part of the African Union\u2019s COVAX initiative that is supporting the country with AstraZeneca vaccines to cover about 20 percent of the population. The World Bank is providing AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines estimated to cover 40 percent of the population; while the African Centre for Decease Control (CDC) is providing 12, 000 doses (specific vaccines not stated). The authorities received some 37,000 syringes under the COVAX initiative, ahead of the arrival of 36,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on March 3. The first tranche of syringes, shipped from the Gavi-funded stockpile at UNICEF\u2019s humanitarian warehouse in Dubai, also included 375 safety boxes for the safe disposal of used syringes. Reopening of the economy. A government announcement on Wednesday July 22 lifted the state of public health emergency and thus re-opened the economy, which first started with a gradual easing of emergency restrictions that helped a partial re-opening of businesses. Fuel prices were reduced to prevent transport price hikes and help ease the burden on commercial transport operators who were then required to carry 3/4 of their vehicle capacities. The authorities also eased restrictions, including the re-opening of markets up to 6 p.m., the re-opening of Mosques, Churches, and schools for Grades 9 and 12 students who were preparing for their sub-regional junior and senior secondary school leaving certificate exams. The government issued on October 6 a press release announcing the re-opening of all weekly markets dubbed \u2018Lumos,\u2019 which are very popular in the rural areas. It also announced a two-thronged resumption of face-to-face learning, which began with the re-opening of all Junior & Senior Secondary schools, and tertiary institutions on October 14; followed by a re-opening of kindergartens and primary schools on October 28. The authorities also announced on October 16, the immediate re-opening of the country\u2019s borders, although the airport remained closed for renovation until it was reopened at end-October. They authorities also relaxed the restrictions on the night clubs and casinos, following an earlier decision to only allow the re-opening of hotels, bars, restaurants, and gymnasia.Meanwhile, in response to the initial easing of emergency restrictions earlier in Senegal, and the possibility of increases in cross-border infections, The Gambian authorities resolved to protecting the country\u2019s international borders (air, land, and sea) and enhanced cross-border monitoring and control. They have built testing centers across the regions, increased the number of quarantine centers, and converted one of the country\u2019s main referral hospitals into a COVID-19 treatment center. The authorities also announced a plan to embark on a mass country-wide testing campaign. This plan was seriously affected by an overwhelming surge, in mid-July, in the number of COVID-19 cases, with many healthcare workers and high-level government officials testing positive. The WFP\u2019s Passenger Air Service made its inaugural flight to The Gambia on June 8, 2020, with planned two trips per week. SN Brussels Airlines started weekly ad-hoc flights to The Gambia on June 22 and had since the beginning of November, increased the frequency of their flights to three per week. Turkish Airline also resumed its weekly flight to Banjul on October 4, while Royal Air Maroc, Asky and Air Senegal resumed their flights to Banjul in late November\u2013early December. The Gambia Experience\u2019s maiden flight for the 2020/2021 first tourists flight landed, on Wednesday December 9, with 147 passengers. The company suspended its flights in early January until late March as the number of COVID-19 cases surged in The Gambia and passengers from England were required to quarantine at own cost. Key Policy Responses as of March 02, 2021Fiscal\t    In mid-March, the authorities prepared a US$ 9 million (0.5 percent of GDP) COVID-19 action plan, for which they had already obtained grant financing. The government reallocated GMD 500 million (0.6 percent of GDP) from the current budget to the Ministry of Health and other relevant public entities for containment measures to prevent and control the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. The government also launched a student relief fund to support Gambian students abroad and a GMD 800 million (US$ 15.8 million) nation-wide food distribution program to benefit 84 percent of the households. In addition, 2,000 tons of fertilizer were distributed to support the needs of farmers. These actions benefitted from technical support from the country\u2019s development partners, including WFP and FAO, and are subject to enhanced oversight by the National Assembly. The supplementary appropriation (SAP) approved by the National Assembly in July included GMD 2.3 billion in additional measures. The SAP included a GMD 737-million relief package to various sectors, including the municipal councils, public entities, the tourism sector, the media, and GMD 224.3 million in additional food assistance delivered through WFP. The SAP also provisioned for GMD 250 million in additional health spending and GMB 854.3 million for targeted public investment outlays to fill critical infrastructure gaps and support the economy. RCF and CCRT financing from the IMF (see below) helped to cover some of these costs.    Donor agencies, including the UNDP, WFP, WHO, FAO, UNICEF, UNFP and UNICEF, have focused financial assistance (about US$ 1.5 million cumulatively, so far) to strengthen social assistance support for programs aimed at vulnerable groups impacted by COVID-19 by improving communication, safeguarding nutrition, and ensuring food security. The WFP provided technical support and training on targeting, design, and distribution of the government food relief program, and it is also working on a food distribution program. On April 2, The World Bank approved a US$ 10 million grant for the COVID-19 Response and Preparedness Project to enhance case detection, tracing, prevention, and social distancing communication as well as the provision of equipment to isolation and treatment centers. The WB is accelerating the rollout of its Social Safety Net project to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the most vulnerable households. The European Commission provided, at end-April, a 9-million Euro COVID-19 support to The Gambia and intended to provide an additional 5.5 million Euro financing in Q4 2020 but it was eventually postponed to 2021. Many of the other donors will also be expanding their social assistance support through cash transfers using mobile money and direct payments targeted to poor households, new mothers and farmers using existing databases of past recipients, village lists and voter rolls. The Gambia Revenue Authority extended, by two months that expired in end-May, the filing of the 2019 annual tax return and the payment of final 2019 tax, as well as the filing of the first quarter 2020 declaration and the payment of the first quarter installment. It has also revised down its annual revenue target by about 2.2 percent of GDP. However, the revenue performance thus far points to a much lower revenue loss than anticipated.    Monetary and financial\t    Domestic financial conditions tightened in early 2020 but have eased since late May. The average yield on the most utilized 364-day T-bills went above 11.5 percent in late May before declining to around 5.37 percent on February 24, 2021, well below its end-2019 and end-December 2020 levels of 7.5 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively. The GMD 600 million 3-year T-bond issuance on December 7, which the Central Bank intends to reopen for GMD 50 million on December 23 with a yield of 9 percent has reduced banks\u2019 appetite for short-term T-bills causing the interest rate to rise. Encouraged by the drop in headline inflation from 7.7 percent at end-2019 to 5.6 percent in April 2020, the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) during its monetary policy committee meeting of May 28, reduced the monetary policy rate by 2 percentage points to 10 percent, a cumulative 2.5 percentage points reduction since end-2019. The Bank also reduced the reserve requirement from 15 to 13 percent, thus, releasing close to GMD 700 million (US$ 14 million or 0.7 percent of GDP) liquidity to the banks. The CBG maintained the policy rate at 10 percent in its monetary policy committee sittings of August 26-27, and December 2-3, 2020. Meanwhile, the CBG had used GMD 855 million of its retained earnings from 2019 to increase its statutory capital and settle some of the central government\u2019s liabilities to the Central Bank, thus providing additional fiscal space to the government. The CBG is also actively monitoring developments in the financial sector. It remains in close contact with the commercial banks and stands ready to respond to the situation as inflationary pressures warrant. Additional measures are available to provide emergency liquidity support if needed, together with increased intensity and frequency of supervision to address any financial stability concerns. As per end-September FSIs, non-preforming loans of banks edged up relative to end-2019 but capital adequacy and liquidity indicators remained strong. The CBG successfully completed a remote IMF 2020 safeguards assessment mission, which found good progress since the last assessment in 2018. The 2019 CBG audit is about to be completed with a clean audit opinion. The CBG has also prepared a strategic plan based on the 2019 FSSR recommendations, which it will implement along with the recommendations from the 2020 safeguards assessment.    Exchange rates and balance of payments\t    The CBG stepped up the monitoring of banks\u2019 FX net open positions but has not imposed any specific exchange measures. It is committed to maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime to help absorb balance-of-payments (BOP) shocks.    On April 15, the Executive Board of the IMF approved a US$ 21.3 million for The Gambia under the\u00a0Rapid Credit Facility\u00a0(RCF), which was on-lent to the Treasury. The RCF support supplements earlier financing from the IMF under a\u00a039-month US$ 47.1 million Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement\u00a0approved on March 23, 2020. To accommodate the worsened BOP outlook, the IMF also agreed to modify the performance criteria on net usable international reserves and net domestic assets of the CBG under the ECF-supported program. The Gambia has also benefited from debt relief under the catastrophe containment window of the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) approved on April 13, 2020, with an expected total relief of US$ 10.8 million, if resources are identified to extend the initiative for 24 months (US$ 5.9 million of the expected relief have already been approved). The already approved amounts were in two tranches. The first tranche of US$ 2.9 million (corresponding to debt service due to the Fund in the first six months covered by the initiative, April 14\u2013October 13, 2020) has been already approved for delivery. The second six-month tranche (covering October 14, 2020-April 13, 2021) of US$3 million was approved on October 5, 2020. The Gambia is also seeking debt service deferral under the G20 debt service suspension initiative, which could provide between US$ 2.19 million (from the creditors that have already endorsed the initiative) and close to US$ 6.68 million, if The Gambia\u2019s plurilateral and private creditors endorse the initiative.    On January 15, 2021 the IMF Executive Board completed the first review of The Gambia\u2019 performance under the program supported under the Extended Credit Facility arrangement and approved a SDR 20 million augmentation of access to be disbursed after completion of the first and second reviews of the program to help address the additional balance-of-payments and fiscal (health and social support) needs created by the surge in COVID-19 cases and support the post-pandemic recovery. As a result, the disbursement associated with the first review was increased from SDR 5 million to SDR 20 million (US$28.8 million).     Back to Top GeorgiaBackground. Thanks to the new set of the containment measures effective from late November 2020, the number of active cases fell significantly to  less than 200 cases a day on average by early March 2021.  As of March 2 , 2021, Georgia has reported 2,000 active positive cases, 265.6 thousand recovered and 3,532 deaths. Georgia is preparing to commence vaccination of the most vulnerable groups starting from March 2021.  As a result of the improving COVID statistics, the containment measures that were effective countrywide since November 28, are being gradually lifted: (i) public intercity and intracity transport service (rail, bus, and minibus) reopened; (ii)  schools, colleges and universities resumed in-person classes  are allowed to conduct in-person tests  ; kindergartens opened ; the libraries and museums opened ; (iii) restaurants were allowed only to have delivery services since Nov 28,  serve the clients in outdoor spaces starting since Feb 15 and are fully open since March 1; (iv) fitness centers, swimming pools, sports and arts activities, will reopen on March 15, and the theatres will reopen on April 1, 2021; (v)   trade centers and shops have been open since February 1; (vi) food/agricultural markets, banks, pharmacies, pet shops, beauty salons, and repair shops operated even during the lock-down months without restriction since Nov 28. Stricter containment measures that were in effect on the weekends (closed shops, no transport) are lifted from March 1. The extended curfew hours from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m remains in effect.  As an exception, the curfew was temporarily lifted on December 31 (New Year\u2019s Eve)  and January 6 (Christmas Eve).   Hotels and ski lifts opened in winter resorts of Georgia (Gudauri, Bakuriani, Goderzi, Mestia) from March 1, 2021. Regular international flights resumed in February 2021.   Starting from March 1, 2021 Georgia accepts travelers from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus arriving by plane and holding negative covid tests. Earlier, Georgia already opened up for the citizens of EU, Israel, Turkey, Switzerland, Norway, USA, UK and Northern Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Bahrain.

Back to Top GermanyBackground. Germany registered the first confirmed COVID-19 case on January 27, 2020. The government has responded with a range of measures to contain the spread of virus through border closures, closure of schools and non-essential businesses, social distancing requirements, enforcement of mask-wearing, and a ban on public gatherings. Following a steady decline since early-April, infections are again on the rise, with daily new cases gradually trending up since late July and now exceeding the previous peak. Mortality rates, although rising, remain low to date compared with peer countries.Reopening of the economy. On April 20, smaller shops re-opened subject to social distancing requirements. Select grades in schools gradually re-opened on May 4, as did cultural and leisure venues. On May 6, the government announced further easing of containment measures extending to all shops, restaurants and sports facilities, with the exact timeline to be determined at state level. Re-opening is subject to an \u201cemergency brake\u201d, whereby an occurrence of more than 50 new infections per 100.000 inhabitants over 7 days will require state governments to reverse the re-opening and re-institute containment. Border controls to neighboring countries are being gradually lifted starting May 16. Quarantine requirement for travelers from EU-countries has been lifted in several states starting May 18. On May 26, federal and state governments agreed to ease restriction on public gatherings for up to 10 people or two separate households subject to minimum distancing and face mask requirement in public places. The travel warning to all EU countries, Schengen states, the UK and Northern Ireland, has been lifted on June 15 though some \u201chigh risk\u201d destinations have been put under travel warning as infections resumed On June 16, the government launches a Corona Warning App that allows users to trace potential contact with COVID-infected individuals on a voluntary and anonymous basis. On July 1, the entry restriction for travelers from 11 non-EU countries is lifted (3 of which conditional on reciprocity). Renewed lockdowns.In light of the rising number of new infections in Germany since the summer vacation season, a mandatory COVID-19 test requirement, in addition to 14 day quarantine, for people entering from around 130 \u201chigh risk\u201d countries upon their arrival came in effect on August 8th. Mass events remain banned until at least end-2020, and local governments have committed to tightening local containment measures where infections exceed the \u201cemergency brake\u201d. Non-essential travel from and to high-infection hot spots are discouraged. On October 14th, federal and state governments agreed on common hot-spot strategy: whenever and wherever the threshold of 50 (new cases per 100K inhabitants over 7 days) is exceeded, local governments shall tighten mask-wearing mandates, limit public and private gatherings, and introduce curfews for restaurants and bars.Against a rising second wave of infection, a nation-wide \u201clockdown light\u201d was introduced for the month of November: Restaurants/bars, leisure/sports and personal services providers will be closed nationwide, though schools remain open. Private gatherings are limited to maximum 5 persons from two households. Non-essential travel is strictly discouraged, and hotels must not offer accommodation to tourists. These lockdown measures have now been extended until January 10.Since December 16, the lockdown has been tightened in light of continued high infection rates and rising death rates. All non-essential shops are closed, as are schools and daycares, until at least January 10 2021. Some states have also introduced nightly curfews. On January 5th, the lockdowns have been further tightened and extended until end-January 2021. On January 19th, federal and state governments extend the lockdown to February 14th 2021. On January 30th, inbound travel from countries with high incidence of new COVID variants is banned under some exceptions.On February 10, the German federal and regional governments agreed to prolong the hard lockdown  measures until March 7. However, states can proceed to open schools and day cares; hairdressers can start opening March 1. On March 3, lockdowns are further extended until March 28 but with gradual re-opening according to a five-step program, subject to the evolution of regional infection incidence.Key Policy Responses as of March 4 , 2021Fiscal\t    To combat the COVID-19 crisis and subsequently support the recovery, the federal government adopted two supplementary budgets: \u20ac156 billion (4.9 percent of GDP) in March and \u20ac130 billion (4 percent of GDP) in June. The authorities plan to issue \u20ac218.5 billion in debt this year to finance the packages. Early measures include: (i) spending on healthcare equipment, hospital capacity and R&D (vaccine), (ii) expanded access to\u00a0short-term work\u00a0(\u201cKurzarbeit\u201d) subsidy to preserve jobs and workers\u2019 incomes, expanded childcare benefits for low-income parents and easier access to basic income support for the self-employed, (iii) \u20ac50 billion in grants to small business owners and self-employed persons severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in addition to interest-free tax deferrals until year-end and \u20ac2bn of venture capital funding for start-ups, (iv) temporarily expanded duration of unemployment insurance and parental leave benefits.

In August, the government extended the maximum duration of short-term work benefits from 12 to 24 months.    At the same time, through the newly created economic stabilization fund (WSF) and the public development bank\u00a0KfW, the government is expanding the volume of available guarantees and access to public\u00a0 guarantees for firms of different sizes, credit insurers, and non-profit institutions, some eligible for up to 100 percent guarantees, increasing the total volume by at least \u20ac757 billion (24 percent of GDP). The WSF and KfW also include facilities for public equity injection into firms with strategic importance.    In addition to the federal government\u2019s fiscal package, many local governments (L\u00e4nder and municipalities) have announced own measures to support their economies, amounting to \u20ac141 billion in direct support and roughly \u20ac70bn in state-level loan guarantees.    Parallel to the renewed lockdown to combat the second wave of COVID infections, the government introduced additional fiscal measures and enhanced existing ones to support affected businesses, including revenue compensation (of up to 75 percent), as well as, public loan guarantees andbasic income provision.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    For monetary policy at the currency union level, please see Euro Area section.    The authorities extended all ECB-issued regulatory and operational relief to German banks under national supervision.

As an oil exporter, Ghana is significantly affected by the volatility in oil prices.Reopening of the economy. The partial lockdown was lifted on April 23 following expansion of treatment and isolation centers, enhanced testing and contact tracing capacity, increased capacity to produce sanitizers and medicines, and the severe impact of the lockdown on the most vulnerable. Phase One of the process of easing restrictions began on June 5. Provided social distancing restrictions were met, religious services for fewer than 100 congregants were allowed, and schools and universities re-opened so that older students could resume classes ahead of exams.

Another GHc 600 million were used initially to support preparedness and response.    To compensate for larger spending related to the COVID-19 crisis, the government plans to cut spending in goods and services, transfers, and capital investment (also reflecting the lower absorption capacity due to the pandemic), for a total of at least GHc 1.1 billion (0.3 percent of GDP). In addition, the government has agreed with investors to postpone interest payment on non-marketable domestic bonds held by public institutions to fund the financial sector clean-up for about GHc 1.2 billion (0.3 percent of GDP). The government has also drawn US$218 million from the stabilization fund, and will borrow up to GHc 10 billion from the Bank of Ghana.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut the policy rate cut by 150 basis points to 14.5 percent on March 18, and announced several measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic shock, including lowering the primary reserve requirement from 10 to 8 percent, lowering the capital conservation buffer from 3 to 1.5 percent, revising provisioning and classification rules for specific loan categories, and steps to facilitate and lower the cost of mobile payments. The committee also signaled it would continue to monitor the economic impact of COVID-19 and take additional measures if necessary. For 2021, initial projections from the ministry of health point to a total costs of about $205 million for the vaccination campaign.    At subsequent meetings, the MPC has kept the policy rate unchanged. A 10-year government bond with a face value of GHc 10 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) has been purchased by the Bank of Ghana.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures    Back to Top GreeceBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on February 26, 2020.

On November 5, the government extended selected support measures in parallel to the imposition of new movement restrictions.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    While Greece is not eligible to additional asset purchases of \u20ac120 billion until end-2020 under the existing APP from the ECB, Greece is eligible for other ECB monetary support measures, including temporary additional auctions of the full-allotment, fixed rate temporary liquidity facility at the deposit facility rate and more favorable terms on existing targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) from June 2020 through June 2021. Greece is also eligible for the new liquidity facility (PELTRO), which consists of a series of non-targeted Pandemic Emergency Longer-Term Refinancing Operations carried out with an interest rate that is 25bp below the average MRO rate prevailing over the life of the operation.Further measures by the ECB for which Greece is eligible include an additional \u20ac1.350 billion asset purchase program of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, PEPP) until at least June-2021 and the corresponding maturing principal payments will be reinvested until at least end-2022. In addition, Greece is eligible for an expanded range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase program (CSPP), and relaxation of collateral standards for Eurosystem refinancing operations (MROs, LTROs, TLTROs).    The ECB Banking Supervision is allowing significant institutions to operate temporarily below the Pillar 2 Guidance, the capital conservation buffer, and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). In addition,new rules on the composition of capital to meet Pillar 2 Requirement (P2R) were front-loaded to release additional capital. The ECB considers that the appropriate release of the countercyclical buffer by the national macroprudential authorities will enhance its capital relief measures. The ECB Banking Supervision entity, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) further decided to exercise \u2013 on a temporary basis \u2013 flexibility in the classification requirements and expectations on loss provisioning for non-performing loans(NPLs) that are covered by public guarantees and COVID-19 related public moratoria; and recommended that banks avoid pro-cyclical assumptions for the determination of loss provisions. Furthermore, the ECB recommends that banks opt for the IFRS9 transitional rules.        Banks have launched loan moratoria for household and corporate borrowers through end-2020 (in addition to the interest payment subsidies mentioned above).

Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A National Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for a COVID-19 outbreak was prepared, with the support of international development partners. Key measures focus on strengthening surveillance at ports of entry; reinforcing capacity for COVID-19 detection; increasing the number of quarantine centers; expanding treatment facilities and acquiring needed medical equipment; and conducting a communication campaign. The implementation cost of the National Emergency Plan is estimated at US$47 million (0.3 percent of GDP).    In addition, a COVID-19 economic response plan was announced on April 6, 2020. The Plan aims at strengthening infrastructure in the health sector, protecting the most vulnerable, and supporting the private sector, notably small and medium enterprises. The authorities estimate the cost of the Plan at about US$ 328 million (2.3 percent of GDP). Key measures include: the introduction of temporary exonerations on taxes, social contributions and payment of utilities for firms in the most affected sectors; the implementation of labor-intensive public works, provision of cash transfers, a waiver on the payment of utilities for the most vulnerable.     On June 23, the authorities announced additional measures, including a three-month extension of some measures initially planned till end-June. The additional cost is estimated at about US$ 50 million (0.34 percent of GDP). Additional measures include: support to the agricultural sector; exemption from the payment of utility bills for businesses in the tourism and hotel sectors; reduction of taxes on health and life insurance contracts; exemption from the payment of the apprenticeship tax as an incentive to retain workers; and import duty exemption on fishing equipment.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    As announced in the April 6 COVID-19 economic response plan, the central bank of the Republic of Guinea (BCRG) unveiled on April 16 some support measures to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic on the financial sector. The policy rate and the reserve requirement ratio were both reduced by 100 basis points to 11 and 15 percent respectively. The BCRG allows banks, for the duration of the pandemic, to count against their reserves credit provided to SMEs, businesses in the services sector affected (hotels, restaurants and transport), and major importers of food and pharmaceutical products. The central bank also announced a program of liquidity injection, including a window for the provision of long-term liquidity.    Moreover, the central bank announced measures to mitigate prudential requirements. These include: lowering the liquidity coverage ratio from 100 to 80 percent; suspending the NPL classification for businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic and the provisioning of such loans; and relaxing the limits on foreign exchange positions (from 20 to 25 percent of capital for the net position, and 10 to 12.5 percent for the position in each currency). Dividend payments have been suspended while financial institutions are required to limit technical assistance fees paid to their parent companies to the strict minimum. Financial institutions have been granted a three-month postponement of the payment of supervision -related fees as well as contributions to the deposit insurance scheme. Insurance companies are to postpone the payment of premia falling due during the epidemic and to suspend policies at the request of customers. Identification requirements for e-money accounts have been eased and companies are encouraged to reduce e-money transfer fees.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top Guinea BissauBackground. The first cases were reported on March 25, 2020. A state of emergency was declared on March 28, followed by a state of calamity declared on September 9, and a state of health alert declared on December 10. In response to signs of a second wave, as numbers of new cases started exceeding 100 per week since the last week of January 2021, a state of calamity was reestablished by presidential decree and extended until March 25. Except for the reopening of schools on March 3, containment measures remain broadly the same: borders remain open subject to sanitary inspections; all travelers are obliged to present a negative PCR test obtained no more than 72 hours before travelling; social gatherings, public meetings, discos and bars, gyms and cultural events are prohibited; restaurants can only operate on take-away mode. The country is covered by COVAX and received offers from Senegal and Portugal but does not yet have the logistics to handle vaccination. Guinea-Bissau was amongst the 28 beneficiary countries of the IMF debt service relief through the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT), approved on April 13 and October 2, 2020. It requested to join the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in December 2020. A request for a Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) arrangement of SDR 14.2 million (50 percent of quota) was approved by the Board on January 25, 2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    To mitigate the immediate impact of the pandemic the government made emergency allocations of: (i) CFAF 222 million (US$ 0.4 million) to provide medicine, food, and medical equipment; and (ii) CFAF 580 million (US$ 1 million) to distribute 20,000 bags of rice and 10,000 bags of sugar throughout the country, including in distant areas. As additional actions, the government has increased its targeted number of families to benefit from food supply from an initial 3,000 to 20,000 and provided other family support (CFAF 100 million). The government has provided direct support to the agricultural campaign for CFAF 790 million. It has used the BCEAO special refinancing window for \"Covid-19 T-Bills\" issued by the State for an amount of about US$27 million (CFAF 15 billion or 1.8 percent of GDP) for on-lending by domestic commercial banks to the cashew nut sector. The authorities have been seeking international financial support to complement its assistance program.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks\u2019 demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity. In April 2020, the BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25 basis points lower than before the crisis. In June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance institutions to accommodate demands from solvent customers with Covid19-related repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period up to end-2020 debt service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims as non-performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of 3-month \"Covid-19 T-Bills\" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The amount of such special T-Bills initially issued by Guinea-Bissau was equivalent to 1.9 percent of GDP, with some rollover possibility through similar bonds benefitting from a refinancing rate equivalent to the prevailing monetary policy rate but to be all paid back by end-2020. The BCEAO has launched in February 2021 a special 6-month refinancing window at the floor of the interest rate corridor to help WAEMU governments meet Covid recovery funding needs. Through this special window banks shall be able to refinance all bonds with maturity of 3 years or more governments currently plan to issue on the regional financial market in 2021. The amount of bonds eligible to the new refinancing window for Guinea-Bissau is equivalent to 6.9 percent of projected 2021 GDP. The new refinancing window is expected to remain in place for the term of the eligible bonds issued in 2021. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basle II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead of 2022 initially planned. In addition, in June 2020, the West African Development Bank (BOAD) decided to create a CFAF 100 billion window for extending 5 to 7 year refinancing of banks\u2019s credit to SMEs in the 8 WAEMU member countries. In December 2020, the BCEAO encouraged WAEMU banks to refrain from distributing dividends with a view to strengthening their capital buffers in anticipation of the impact of the crisis on asset quality.

Guyana has been one of five countries in the Caribbean including the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Aruba and Curacao, to benefit from pre-manufactured housing units from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The international organization handed over 48 housing units to the Ministry of Public Health through the Civil Defense Commission (CDC) to boost the regional capacity of the COVID-19 response in the country. On July 21, the Ministry of Education received a donation of 2000 face shields from the United Nations International Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to support measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus in schools, when they open. The new government announced the establishment of a new Covid-19 response unit to replace the previous National COVID-19 Task Force, including G$4.5 billion (US$21.6 million) for the COVID-19 response effort, and started making efforts to mobilize US$60 million from international financial institutions. More recently, the government received US$2 million from India, and announced G$25,000 per household for COVID-19 relief assistance. It is still unclear whether the aid would be in cash or kind, how often this will be provided and whether all or affected households will be getting assistance. In addition, authorities announced packages for essential workers, and under the childcare assistance program, direct payments would be made to licensed childcare facilities for disbursements to parents of children under seven years of age. On November 25, the World Bank approved US$7.5 million for Guyana\u2019s Covid response and strengthening the health system. Most recently, the authorities announced that members of the disciplined forces along with healthcare workers are among the more than 60,000 public servants set to receive the $25,000 one-off cash grant. While the initiative also extends to current workers of the Guyana Sugar Corporation, the cash grant does not apply to agencies that granted salary increases or bonus payments during 2020.Reopening of the economy.

Vaccinations:Guyana received  3000 doses of vaccines from Barbados in February, and 20 000 from China on March 2, and is expected to receive  80 000 from India mid-March and 100 000 through the Covax facility end March A total of 35 health teams have undergone training to administer the injections as part of the vaccine deployment plan. The expansion of storage facilities will be completed soon, and once the administration starts; they will be able to deliver 70,000 vaccines per day.    Key Policy Responses as of March 3, 2021Fiscal\t    The Ministry of Finance and the Guyana Revenue Authority have implemented waivers of VAT and duties on COVID-19 medical supplies and lab testing kits, as well as tax deductions for all donations made by local businesses to staff and health institutions for the treatment of the virus. The authorities have also implemented the removal of VAT on water and electricity effective from April 01, 2020 to September 30, 2020; domestic air travel effective from April 08, 2020 to September 30, 2020; and the extension of the April 30th deadline for the filing of tax returns to September 30, 2020.

The Ministry of Business has started providing relief grants to small businesses experiencing challenges to sustain operations and retain employees and for training and development. Most recently, the Ministries of Business and Agriculture began working to assist farmers affected by the pandemic with stimulus grants, and the Department of Tourism in the Ministry of Business has collaborated with the Guyana Tourism Authority, and other bureaus to establish the Tourism Recovery Action Committee (TRAC). On July 1, the government resumed the public assistance program after 2 months pause to facilitate a long-term strategic approach to Covid relief efforts. The assistance includes vouchers and packaged hampers for the coastland and the hinterland respectively. On September 10, the new government presented its G$330 billion emergency budget, which includes various tax measures (selected VAT removals, corporate tax reductions, tax concessions, reversal of land lease fees), funds for combating COVID-19, and revitalizing productive and infrastructure sectors. Most importantly, the allocations for each of the health and education sectors account for approximately fifteen percent of GDP each. On December 14, 2020, the government has launched a childcare subsidy for essential workers. Frontline workers who are providing an essential service or key public services during the COVID-19 pandemic can apply. On December 31, the government announced the disbursement of the grant, valued over GYD 2 billion, which would benefit more than 60,000 people, as a part of the broader effort to bolster the economy     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Bank of Guyana (BoG) has extended the moratorium to allow banks to deter repayments and to classify affected accounts as non-performing, and the waiver on the regulatory treatment or condition for renegotiating loans under the supervisory guidelines to December 2020.

Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The Bank of Guyana maintains an accommodative monetary stance.     HBack to Top HaitiBackground. The COVID-19 pandemic comes at a time of economic contraction and considerable macro-economic imbalances. Haiti reported its first confirmed cases of COVID-19 on March 20, 2020 and the country remains at high risk of rapid contagion given the weak health system and the proximity and porous border with the Dominican Republic. Tourism had already declined sharply in 2018-2019 due to the political instability and social unrest.Reopening of the economy. The Government of Haiti has communicated many important instructions to minimize the spread of the disease, particularly: closure of schools and factories, closure of airports and ports to passengers, banning of meetings of more than 10 people, nationwide curfew between 20:00 and 5:00 and plea for social distancing guidelines to be respected. Some of these restrictions were lifted or modified by the Haitian government as of 30 June 2020. The state of health emergency that had been declared by the Government over the spread of COVID-19 has been lifted on July 20. The Prime Minister announced the end of restrictive measures and the resumption of business operations across the country, including, among others, the reopening of textile factories at 100% and the resumption of religious services across the country.  Public sector workers have been instructed to work on a rotational basis, and remote working has been encouraged as much as possible. In order to guarantee jobs provided by subcontracting companies in the textile industry, the Government authorized these factories to gradually resume their activities from April 20th, while respecting the measures to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures include, among others, the operation of the factories on rotating basis with only 30 percent of their workforce, measuring the temperature of the workers upon entry to the factory, and the obligation to wear facial masks. From February 9, all arrival by plane will require a negative COVID-19 test of less than 72 hours. The authorities are in negotiation with the WHO to participate in the COVAX initiative. If successful Haiti could immunize about 876000 vulnerable people.Key Policy Responses as of March 1, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities launched a public health preparedness plan for containment and treatment; they boosted some social programs, and engaged into additional health care and security spending, as well as transfers to support workers and households, including supporting wage payments temporarily in some sectors. However, as the spread of COVID-19 was much lower than expected, the authorities spent less on COVID-related needs than anticipated. Of the HTG 18.2 billion (1.3 percent of revised GDP) allocated in April for COVID-related spending, actual expenditures amounted to HTG 8.4 Bn (0.6 percent of GDP). Most of this (HTG 5.6 billion) was dedicated to health, while transfers to households, businesses and schools were trimmed to HTG 2.3 billion from HTG 8.3 billion. Nonetheless, the level of spending on health, education, and social protection combined was well above pre-COVID-19 projections\u2015by 0.6 percent of GDP. The authorities have also committed to report monthly on COVID-related expenditures and undertake an ex post financial and operational audit on COVID spending.       Monetary and macro-financial\t    The central bank moved immediately to ease conditions in the financial system, including reducing the refinance and reference rates, lowering reserve requirements on domestic currency deposits, easing loan repayment obligations for three months, and suspending fees in the interbank payment system.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top HondurasBackground. Honduras has reported 172,577 (4,231 deaths) as of March 4, 2020. The country went into lockdown on March 16, with only essential services operating. The government declared a national state of emergency and adopted containment measures, including restrictions on freedom of movement, a nation-wide night-time curfew, and closing of national frontiers. The authorities have taken fiscal and monetary and macro-financial actions to respond to the healthcare and humanitarian crisis, protect employment and mitigate the impact on economic activity.Reopening of the economy. The government reopened national frontiers in August (subject to presentation of negative Covid test results by inbound travelers), and lifted restrictions on freedom of movement and reduced the duration of the night-time curfew in October. . At the same time, the national state of emergency remains in place, and the duration of the night-time curfew was extended again selectively by region following tropical storms Eta and Iota in November, and again after the surge in Covid cases in January. The central government also returned to a work from home policy for 75 percent of its labor force in February.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities are deploying a well-targeted fiscal response to the pandemic while establishing strong transparency and accountability frameworks. In this context and following a request to Congress to make use of the escape clause included in the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), the authorities\u2019 initial fiscal response to the pandemic envisaged a deficit of the Non-Financial Public Sector of 4 and 3 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2021\u2014after 1 percent deficit in 2019 in line with the FRL\u2014with additional borrowing by the government of $2.5 bn in 2020-21, about 10 percent of GDP in total. As the impact of the Covid crisis deepened, Congress approved in November a revision in the escape clause, increasing fiscal deficit limits of the NFPS to 5 and 4 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2021. After tropical storms Eta and Iota, Congress approved in December a new revision in the escape clause to 5.6 percent NFPS deficit in 2020, while maintaining the 4 percent for 2021.     Efforts have concentrated on supporting the fragile health system and providing targeted support to families, workers, and firms. Additional crisis-related spending needs were initially estimated at 2.1 percent of GDP in 2020, including emergency healthcare expenditures (0.9 percent of GDP), temporary unemployment benefits to formal workers (0.6 percent of GDP), delivery of food supplies to poor families (0.2 percent of GDP), and cash transfers to informal workers (0.4 percent of GDP). The authorities identified significant nonpriority spending reallocations to partly finance these emergency expenditures. Congress approved a decree authorizing expedited purchasing procedures for emergency expenditures related to the crisis.    On the revenue side, Congress approved reduced advance payments in corporate income tax to provide cash flow relief to companies, as well as a temporary VAT exemptions for medical supplies. There was also a one-off income tax credit (10 percent of salary expenses) for companies maintaining pre-crisis employment levels. Congress also approved deferrals to the second half of 2020 and early 2021 for payments of income taxes and social contributions, favoring especially SMEs. VAT payments were also deferred for SMEs in non-essential sectors not operating during the curfew.      The temporary freezes in prices of goods in the basic consumption basket was discontinued in January.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    Since the start of the pandemic, the central bank has cut the policy rate by 225 bps to 3 percent\u2014following cumulative cuts of 50 bps in December and January\u2014and reduced the spread over the policy rate for its emergency lending facility (by 50 bps) and its repo operations (by 25 bps). The BCH also suspended liquidity absorption operations (resumed in October), and accelerated the implementation of previously announced elimination of obligatory investments in the central bank. In September, the BCH reduced reserve requirements from 12 to 9 percent, while reintroducing temporary mandatory investments of 3 percent to incentivize new credits backed by the guarantee funds.    Second-tier public development bank Banhprovi committed to provide L6,875 mn (1.1 percent of GDP) in guarantees to cover potential losses on new loans to SMEs and other companies, with varying coverage of commercial banks' exposures on the loans covered by the guarantee scheme. The bank also intended to deploy additional L5,625 mn (0.9 percent of GDP) to finance loans to SME and other sectors affected by the pandemic. These guarantee and lending schemes are funded with loans from the regional development bank CABEI. A dedicated L4,000 mn (0.7 percent of GDP) rediscount facility funded with accumulated profits at Banhprovi was also created for loans restructured as a result of the pandemic.     The government also issued a decree mandating all supervised financial institutions to provide temporary debt service relief to companies and individuals whose incomes have been affected by the crisis. Debt service of affected sectors was suspended until end-June, without penalties or impact on credit classification; at end-June, financial institutions were granted discretion to extend these measures until end-December for most affected households and corporates. In October, the government agreed with banks on a scheme to support further restructuring of SME and microcredit loans according to repayment capacity. The scheme is available to high quality borrowers that were current on their debt obligations before the pandemic and includes: rolling over debt service arrears accumulated during the grace period, without capitalizing interest; extension of loan maturities; and reductions in interest rates. The government also initially introduced a 3-month moratorium on service of bank loans financed by Banhprovi (covering about 5 percent of total bank credit to the private sector), and later reprofiled those loans to borrowers whose payment capacity had been more durably affected by the pandemic.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top HungaryFirst wave. . The first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 4, 2020.The economy was hit hard by the outbreak as it is tightly intertwined globally through supply chains and tourism. The government declared a state of emergency on March 11 and implemented various containment measures, including travel and activity restrictions, and mandatory distance learning for schools and universities.

Social distance rules were expected to be heeded everywhere and policies and fines regarding wearing masks recently have become stricterSecond and third waves. While the first wave of the pandemic relatively spared Hungary, cases rose rapidly starting the end of August. In response, border restrictions were imposed in early September and the state of emergency reintroduced on November 4th. The government reintroduced a number of containment measures, including a curfew from 8pm-5am, restricted opening hours for shops and other businesses, and restaurants closures, and restriction on hotels guests and gathering, and has been reviewing and adjusting them periodically. The second wave abated by end-November 2020, but cases rose again rapidly in February 2021, including as new, more contagious, variants of the virus reached Hungary. In light of this situation, the state of emergency has been extended until June 15, 2021. All non-primary shops services will be closed for two weeks starting March 8. Kindergartens, schools, and gyms are also to close.Vaccination:Vaccinations started in late December. Hungary was the first EU country to authorize vaccines other than collectively procured by the EU. If deliveries are timely, the authorities are hopeful that most of the population could be vaccinated by mid-to end-summer. Key Policy Responses as of March 1, 2021Fiscal\t    A first wave of fiscal measures were introduced earlier in the epidemic, including, on the revenue side, measures to alleviate the fiscal burden on businesses: (i) employers' social contributions will be lifted in the most affected sectors; (ii) the health care contributions will be lowered through June 30; (iii) around 80,000 SMEs (mainly in the services sector) will be exempt from the small business tax (the payment of the tax by other companies in affected sectors will be deferred until the end of the state of emergency); (iv) the tourism development contributions will be temporarily cancelled; (v) media service providers will be given a tax relief for incurred losses of advertising revenue; and, (vi) procedures for collecting tax arrears will be suspended during the state of emergency.

On May 20, the government announced a new wage subsidy program for new hires, with the condition for a company of keeping a worker for at least nine months. Interest-free loans to SMEs will be available from June 12. Half of the program\u2019s budget will be available for investments, while the other 50 percent is intended to finance liquidity and operations. The highest amount available for investments is HUF 150 million, while asset and liquidity financing loans are capped at HUF 300 million. On August 25th, the government announced that it will not be expanding the wage subsidy scheme for all as of end-August, but only for most affected sector till June 2021. Will March 22, wage subsidies and tax relief available to the hospitality sector will be extended to all sectors subject to the new lockdown.      Monetary and macro-financial\t    Since the start of the pandemic, the central bank (MNB) increased access to liquidity through: (i) an increase in the regular forint-liquidity swap stock at regular auctions; (ii) the introduction of the daily provision of one-week forint-liquidity swaps; (iii) the expansion of eligible collateral; (iv)\u00a0the introduction of a long-term unlimited collateralized lending facility; and (v) suspension of penalties for unmet reserve requirements. On April\u00a01st, it introduced a one-week deposit tender at the Lombard rate, which effectively tightened overall liquidity and eased depreciation pressures on the HUF. On April 7, the MNB announced (i) a change in the overnight lending rate by 95 bps to 1.85 percent, making the interest rate corridor symmetric (with the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent; the base rate at 0.9 percent; and the overnight lending rate at 1.85 percent); (ii) an increase in the one-week lending rate to 1.85 percent; and (iii) the elimination of the target on the amount of the liquidity injection or withdrawal to give greater flexibility to monetary policy. On June 23 and July 21, the MNB reduced the base rate by 15 basis points each time, from 0.90 to 0.60 percent, while the interest rate corridor remained unchanged (-0.05 to 1.85 percent). On 4 May, quantitative easing program was also launched, consisting of buying government securities on the secondary market, and the mortgage bond purchase program re-started. On October 6, the MNB raised the limit on its purchases of certain government bonds from to 33 to 50 percent of the outstanding bond stock while extending the range of assets available for purchase to government-guaranteed debt securities. On September 24, the MNB hiked the 1-week deposit rate by 0.15 percent to 0.75 percent in order to reduce inflationary pressures and currency depreciation. On September 8, the MNB introduced a new forex-liquidity swap facility. The facility seeks to improve the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and reduce the volatility of yields on the domestic forex swap market.    On April 7, a new SME lending program was also announced (FGS GO!) with increased amounts and increase in the interest rate subsidy. On July 2, the MNB relaxed its conditions, including allowing the use of loans for investment abroad and loosening conditions for borrowing working capital loans. On November 18, the NBH expanded program by HUF 1 tn. The corporate bond purchase program (BFGS) remained in place and maturities of eligible bonds were extended and amount per business group was increased. On September 22, MNB raised the amount available under the program to 750 billion forints from HUF 450 bn previously. On November 18, it raised the ceiling to HUF 2 tn (4.3% of GDP) having already purchased HUF 793 bn (1.7% of GDP) of bonds under the program. The MNB intends to sterilize liquidity injected through both the FSG GO! and BFSG programs through a preferential deposit facility bearing tiered interest rates up to 4 percent.     Measures were also taken to provide financial relief to households and corporates borrowers, including: (i) the provision of a grace period of repayment of loans to the Growth Funding Facility (subsidized lending to SMEs supported by the MNB); (ii) the extension of short-term loans to businesses until June 30; (iii) a repayment moratorium on all existing loans, corporate and retail, until the end of this year, with a reprofiling of debt payment thereafter to avoid an increase in monthly payments; and, (iv) a cap on the average annual percentage rate (APR) on new unsecured consumer credit at the central bank base rate (currently, 0.9 percent) plus 5 percent. On September 20, the government extended debt repayment moratorium by six months for select groups.    Regarding macro-prudential measures, (i) the Foreign Exchange Coverage Ratio (FECR), which imposes a limit on the difference between forex-denominated assets and liabilities of credit institutions as a percent of total assets, was reduced from 15 to 10 percent; and (ii) the additional capital buffer requirement for systemically-important banks will be temporarily eliminated as of July 1. On September 8, regulatory forbearance for unmet reserve requirements was reversed.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The exchange rate has been adjusting flexibly.    IBack to Top IcelandBackground. As a country dependent on tourism, Iceland has been highly exposed to health, economic, and financial contagion from the global spread of the COVID-19 virus. By March 4, 6058 domestic cases COVID-19 have been confirmed, of which 11 are active. Twenty-nine have died. The recovery rate from the latest wave of infections already exceeds 99 percent. The strategy to contain the disease has involved a national pandemic plan with significant focus on mass testing, contact tracing, and quarantines. Vaccination of the population is being rolled out, subject to vaccine availability. The economic impact of the pandemic is partially being offset by Iceland\u2019s use of its available policy space. GDP fell 6.6 percent in 2020 from 2.6 percent in 2019.Containment measures. With virtually no new domestic cases for weeks, domestic relaxation of containment measures has accelerated, while those at the border remain tight. Since August 19, to avoid a 14-day quarantine, arriving passengers must take two COVID-19 tests in between a 5-day quarantine. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Parliament approved an array of fiscal measures to ease the strain on households and firms and, looking forward, to help the economy recover. Key measures to support households and firms include tax cuts, deferrals, and loss offsets; increased unemployment benefits, child allowances, quarantine grants, subsidies, state contributions to firms\u2019 dismissal costs to prevent bankruptcies of viable firms and protect workers\u2019 rights; early pension withdrawals, and state-guaranteed loans to companies. Key measures to restart the economy include public investment, tax incentives for real estate improvement, temporary tax relief for the tourism sector, and marketing efforts to encourage tourism in Iceland. Parliament also approved simpler temporary rules for financial restructuring of companies. A number of supporting fiscal measures were extended beyond their original sunset clauses to deal with flareups in contagion. The 2021 budget and accompanying medium-term fiscal strategy plan envisage continued fiscal support and a gradual reduction in the general government deficit. See also: Link1, Link2 , and Link3.    Monetary and macro-financial\t        The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) has provided monetary support and has taken measures to preserve financial stability. Since the outbreak, the Monetary Policy Committee has cut policy rates by 200 basis points to 0.75 percent and reduced deposit institutions\u2019 average reserve requirements to 1\u00a0from 2\u00a0percent to ease their liquidity positions. To increase liquidity in circulation, the CBI eliminated its intake of 30-day deposits. The CBI Financial Stability Committee reduced the countercyclical capital buffer to 0 from 2\u00a0percent. A voluntary loan moratoria program is being phased out.  See also:    Link4    and    Link 5.        Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The CBI has allowed the exchange rate to adjust, while preventing disorderly market conditions through discretionary foreign exchange intervention. On September 9, the CBI announced a program of FX sales, which currently involves selling a minimum of \u20ac3 million a day. As of end 2020, international reserves stood at US$6.2 billion. Through February, the CBI sold over \u20ac1 billion (350 through auctions) and bought about \u20ac80 million.    Back to Top IndiaBackground. The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020 and the number of cases continues to rise. Prime Minister Modi announced on March 24, 2020 that the entire country will go under lockdown, with localized containment measures extended to March 2021 in some states in the latest announcement. Prior to the March 24 announcement, numerous containment measures had already been imposed, varying in intensity across the country, including travel restrictions; closing educational establishments, gyms, museums, and theatres; bans on mass gatherings; and encouraging firms to promote remote work. The economic impact of COVID-19 has been substantial and broad-based. GDP contracted sharply in 2020Q2 (-24.4 percent year-on-year) due to the unprecedented lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19. The contraction moderated to -7.5 percent year-on-year in 2020Q3, and growth returned to positive territory in 2020Q4, at 0.4 percent. The national statistical office released the second advance estimate for FY2020/21 GDP growth to be -8%, in line with the January WEO projection. Reopening of the economy. On April 15, with a view to supporting economic activities, the government announced several relaxation measures in geographical areas designated as non-hotspot, with effect from April 20, 2020. On April 29, the government permitted inter-state movement of stranded people, including migrant workers, managed by the nodal authorities who are designated by the states. Some graded relaxations in economic activities have been allowed in geographic areas designated as orange and green zones on May 4 and domestic air travel restarted on May 25. On May 12, the PM announced a relief package of around 10 percent of GDP, including previously announced monetary and fiscal measures. On July 29, the central government issued \u2018Unlock 3.0\u2019 guidelines further paving the way for a phased re-opening of activities across the country and limiting the lockdown only to containment zones till August 31. On August 29, the government issued (\u2018Unlock 4.0\u2019) to further re-open the economy in September, removing restrictions on metro rail in a graded manner from 7 September, and allowing for social, academic, sports, entertainment, and other congregations of up to 100 people. On September 30, the central government issued \u201cUnlock 5.0\u201d guidelines to allow state/union territory governments to decide on reopening schools and coaching institutions after October 15 in a graded manner. Cinemas/theatres/multiplexes will be permitted to open with up to 50% of their seating capacity and entertainment parks will be permitted to open from October 15. The ceiling on congregations has been extended to 200 people. The latest government announcements extended localized containment measures to March 2021 in some states. On January 3, 2021, India\u2019s Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) has provided emergency use authorization (EUA) to the AstraZeneca vaccine and the Covaxin (developed by local firm Bharat Biotech). Both are manufactured domestically in India. On January 11, 2021, the Prime Minister announced the start of the world\u2019s biggest vaccination campaign from January 16th aiming to vaccinate about 300 million people in the coming months.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    India\u2019s fiscal support measures can be divided into two broad categories: (i) above-the-line measures which include government spending (about 3.2 percent of GDP, of which about 2.2 percent of GDP is expected to fall in the current fiscal year), foregone or deferred revenues (about 0.3 percent of GDP falling due within the current year) and expedited spending (about 0.3 percent of GDP falling due within the current year); and (ii) below-the-line measures designed to support businesses and shore up credit provision to several sectors (about 5.2 percent of GDP). In the early stages of the pandemic response, above-the-line expenditure measures focused primarily on social protection and healthcare. These include in-kind (food; cooking gas) and cash transfers to lower-income households (1 percent of GDP); wage support and employment provision to low-wage workers (0.5 percent of GDP); insurance coverage for workers in the healthcare sector; and healthcare infrastructure (0.1 percent of GDP). The more recent measures that were announced in October and November include additional public investment (higher capital expenditure by the central government and interest-free loans to states, of about 0.2 percent of GDP) and support schemes targeting certain sectors. The latter includes a Production Linked Incentive scheme targeting 13 priority sectors and is expected to cost about 0.8 percent of GDP over 5 years, a higher fertilizer subsidy allocation benefiting the agriculture sector (0.3 percent of GDP) and support for urban housing construction (0.1 percent of GDP). Several measures to ease the tax compliance burden across a range of sectors have also been announced, including postponing some tax-filing and other compliance deadlines, and a reduction in the penalty interest rate for overdue GST filings.  Measures without an immediate direct bearing on the government\u2019s deficit position aim to provide credit support to businesses (1.9 percent of GDP), poor households, especially migrants and farmers (1.6 percent of GDP), distressed electricity distribution companies (0.4 percent of GDP), and targeted support for the agricultural sector (0.7 percent of GDP), as well as some miscellaneous support measures (about 0.3 percent of GDP). Key elements of the business-support package are various financial sector measures for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and non-bank financial companies, whereas additional support to farmers will mainly be in the form of providing concessional credit to farmers, as well as a credit facility for street vendors. Agricultural sector support is mainly for infrastructure development. On February 1, the central government budget for FY2021/22 was tabled in the parliament. The budget expanded spending on health and wellbeing, including a provision for the country\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination program (350 billion Rs).    Monetary and macro-financial\t    Since March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo and reverse repo rates by 115 and 155 basis points (bps) to 4.0 and 3.35  percent, respectively, and announced liquidity measures across three measures comprising Long Term Repo Operations (LTROs), a cash reserve ratio (CRR) cut of 100 bps, and an increase in marginal standing facility (MSF) to 3 percent of the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) (now further extended to September 30, 2021) and open market operations (including simultaneous purchases and sales of government securities), resulting in cumulative liquidity injections of  5.9 percent of GDP through September. The RBI has provided relief to both borrowers and lenders (through end-August) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) temporarily relaxed the norms related to debt default on rated instruments and reduced the required average market capitalization of public shareholding and minimum period of listing. The implementation of the net stable funding ratio and the last stage of the phased-in implementation of the capital conservation buffers were delayed by six months (on September 29 the delay was extended till April 2021). On April 1, the RBI created a facility to help with state government's short-term liquidity needs, and relaxed export repatriation limits. Earlier, the RBI introduced regulatory measures to promote credit flows to the retail sector and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and provided regulatory forbearance on asset classification of loans to MSMEs and real estate developers (later extended to loans from NBFCs).

Back to Top Iran, Islamic Republic ofBackground. Iran reported its first confirmed COVID-19 cases on February 19, 2020 in the city of Qom. After the outbreak, the government introduced a range of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including stopping flights from China, closing schools, malls, markets and key religious sites, and banning cultural and religious gatherings. On March 25, President Rouhani announced a partial lockdown, closing businesses and government offices for two weeks and banning travel between different cities. Accordingly, the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index in March and April collapsed.Reopening of the economy. Concerned about the economic damage from the outbreak, the government ordered a step-by-step reopening of businesses that it considered to be at low or average risk in terms of spreading the virus starting on April 8. On April 27, Iran reopened all international borders to revive regional trade, while mosques and schools reopened in mid-May. On May 26 all businesses and major religious sites were opened. While the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index in May and June suggested that industries had started to recover, it registered a 6 percent contraction in July. Second and third wave: : A \u201csecond wave\u201d of virus cases hit Iran during the summer. Following this, the government instituted mandatory mask-wearing and new restrictions in Tehran. Based on this order, all schools and universities, restaurants, cafes, cultural facilities and beauty salons were closed and a third of government employees in Tehran worked remotely. Iran entered a \u201cthird wave\u201d of COVID-19 cases in the fall, with the number of new infections peaking at 14,000 a day in November. Border crossings between Iran and Iraq have been sealed to prevent Iranian pilgrims from traveling to the neighboring country for the annual Arbaeen pilgrimage which took place on October 7th. Tehran and six other provinces have closed down recreational centers, universities, schools and places at high risk of contagion for one week to stem the spread of the pandemic.\u00a0 Facemasks became compulsory in public (indoors and outdoors) in Tehran starting from October 10 with fines for those who breach the law. A slew of new restrictions, including partial lockdowns and curfews, came into effect on November 28 in the most affected regions. A mandatory mask rule is implemented across the country. At end December 2020, the Bashmaq border crossing between Iran and Iraq was closed until further notice due to concerns over the new COVID-19 variant. In January 2021 the coronavirus infection rate has slowed but night-time curfew and distance learning has been extended to keep the contagious outbreak at bay. Iran Air has resumed flights to Qatar, Dubai, and Turkey.Vaccine: The human trial of the Iranian COVID-19 vaccine started, and the first volunteers received the vaccine in Tehran at the end of December 2020. Moreover, Iran has imported 16.8 million doses of vaccines from COVAX, after the US approved $244 million for Iran to purchase vaccines. Iran also plans to import some 2 million doses of vaccines from each of India, Russia, and China by the end of the current Iranian year, to be facilitated by several Iranian and European banks through the WHO. The country has already imported two million doses of Sputnik V from Russia; the first shipment of 500 thousand doses arrived in early February, and vaccinations have started with healthcare professionals. In February, China also donated 250,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine to Iran. The government plans to vaccinate 60 million Iranians (majority of adult population) in four phases during the next fiscal year, starting with essential workers, high risk groups, and injured war veterans.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021At the end of March President Rouhani announced over 10 percent of GDP in COVID-19 relief and recovery measures. Iran has also received a $50mn loan from the World Bank in July, which was used for financing imports of medicine and medical equipment through the WHO. In response to a new surge in cases, the government unveiled another round of relief measures for households in November, totaling 1 percent of GDP.Fiscal\t    Key measures include (i) extra funding for the health sector (2 percent of GDP); (ii) cash transfers to vulnerable households (0.5 percent of GDP); (iii) support to the unemployment insurance fund (0.3 percent of GDP); and (iv) subsidized loans for affected businesses and vulnerable households (4.7 percent of GDP).

Sukuk bonds, the National Development Fund, and privatization proceeds will provide part of the financing.    On April 15, the government embarked on its biggest-ever initial public offering, selling its residual shares in 18 companies (including 12 percent share of Social Welfare Fund (SHASTA), the largest public company) to generate income as it struggles with the economic consequences of COVID-19 and U.S. sanctions. The estimated privatization proceeds are at around 165 trillion rials (0.6 percent of GDP) from banks and insurance companies and 70 trillion rials (0.2 percent of GDP) from SHASTA. On May 3, the government\u2019s spokesman said that shares of four state-owned oil refineries will begin to be offered to the public soon.

Back to Top IraqBackground.Iraq\u2019s first confirmed case was on 22 February 2020, however in the early weeks of the crisis the number of new cases was relatively contained. At the end of Ramadan in late May 2020, the number of new cases escalated rapidly, and the crisis intensified over the summer. By October 2020, daily new cases had declined significantly. Cases started rising again in January 2021 and recently surpassed 4000 cases a day approaching the first wave\u2019s peak.In the early stages of the crisis, the authorities implemented a range of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including closing borders, travel restrictions (including on international flights and internal public transportation), and closing schools and universities. A nationwide lockdown and curfew were first introduced on March 22, 2020. By September 2020, most containment measures were relaxed to some extent and the curfew was removed after cases had declined. Containment measures were reimposed in February 2021 due to the renewed rise in cases including a full weekend curfew, a night curfew on weekdays as well as travel restrictions, the closure of restaurants, malls and places of worship.In September 2020, Iraq joined the COVAX Facility, a global initiative aiming to secure access to COVID-19 vaccines. Initially this facility will provide vaccines to cover 20 percent of the population. In addition, the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNtech, and Sinopharm vaccines were approved for emergency use and Iraq has agreed a deal to obtain 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.  In early 2021, the Cabinet approved the allocation of $100 million for the purchase of vaccines, funded by the World Bank. The first batch of the vaccine arrived in early March 2021 and the rollout is just beginning.The containment and mitigation measures have had a significant negative impact on non-oil activity, predominantly from 2020 Q2 onwards. Non-oil GDP is projected to have contracted significantly in 2020. In addition to the direct impact of COVID-19, the decline in oil prices has resulted in a sharp fall in oil revenues. Revenues are likely to remain low for a prolonged period, albeit recovering somewhat recently, reflecting both a lower profile for oil prices and a decline in production, following the OPEC+ agreement. Reopening of the economy. After cases started declining in 2020, most containment measures were relaxed to some extent. In June 2020, the curfew restrictions began to be eased, and were completely removed in late September. All land border crossings reopened for trade and airports reopened in July 2020 and schools reopened in November 2020, albeit with limited in-person teaching. In late December 2020, there was a reversal in some of the easing measures, following a spike in COVID-19 cases in other countries and the discovery of new strains of the virus. A ban on travel to the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Iran, South Africa, Australia, and Japan was introduced, and only Iraqi citizens can enter from these countries. In addition, land border crossings were shut again, except for emergency cases. In February 2021, with the renewed rise in cases, most of the containment measures were reimposed, initially for two weeks.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    To support the Ministry of Health's efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank of Iraq established a fund to collect donations from financial institutions which raised a total of $37 million, with initial donations of $20 million from the Central Bank and $5 million from the Trade Bank of Iraq. The authorities have reduced spending in non-essential areas and have safeguarded budgetary allocations to the Ministry of Health. The Supreme Committee for Health and National Safety introduced a cash transfer scheme, targeting the families of workers in the private sector that do not receive salaries or benefits from the government. Each eligible individual received 30,000 Iraqi dinars ($25), with the scheme costing around 300 billion Iraqi dinars ($254 million) in total.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of Iraq reduced its reserve requirement from 15 percent to 13 percent. At the onset of the crisis, it also announced a moratorium on interest and principal payments by small and medium-sized enterprises through its directed lending initiative (the \u201cone trillion ID\u201d initiative) and encouraged banks to extend the maturities of all loans as they deem appropriate. More recently, the Central Bank has offered 5 million Iraqi dinars ($4200) of additional support to existing projects under the \u201cone trillion ID\u201d initiative and reduced the interest rates on loans extended through the scheme. The Central Bank also encouraged the use of electronic payments to contain the transmission of the virus and instructed vendors to eliminate commissions on such payments for six months.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The CBI announced a 22.7 percent devaluation of the ID/USD exchange rate in December 2020.    Back to Top IrelandBackground. Since the start of the pandemic on March 2020, the scale of the economic impact has fluctuated in line with the path of the virus and the severity of the containment measures. The impact of the pandemic has been mitigated by a range of fiscal, monetary, macro-prudential and micro-prudential policy actions to support vulnerable households and businesses and to minimise the potential that regulatory capital requirements act as a constraint on the provision of lending. Supported by the resilience of some key MNE-dominated exporting sectors, GDP growth was positive in Q1-Q3 at an average 3 percent y-o-y, (the contraction in Q2, at 3.5 percent y-o-y, was the smallest in Europe). However, Ireland had a sharp decline in consumption and underlying domestic demand. Over the summer, as the infection rate receded, containment measures were eased, and domestic economic activity rebounded strongly in the third quarter. However, as the severity of the virus increased again in the fourth quarter, and Level 5 restrictions came into effect from late October , there was a renewed slowdown in domestic economic activity, though, to a much lesser extent, than in the Spring. This, primarily, reflected the fact that more sectors remained open than in the Spring and also the effects of adaptation by both individuals and businesses to living with Covid-19. Notwithstanding this, in February 2021, the Covid-adjusted unemployment rate stood at  around 25 percent. Reopening of the economy and containment measures. On May 18, Ireland started a gradual reopening plan in five phases and progress was made up to phase 4. In August, the government adapted a medium-term national framework for living with Covid-19. It consists of five levels depending on the pandemic indicators, with lower level having less social restriction. Ireland move to the level 3 on October 5 due to a surge in the new covid cases. In response to the second wave of the pandemic, on October 19, a second lockdown was imposed which ended on December 1st, and Ireland moved to the level 3 restrictions with non-essential retail outlets, churches, gyms, hairdressers and other businesses allowed to open. However, a large spike in case numbers after the holidays, necessitated another lockdown, moving to level 5 restrictions January through April 5th 2021. From 4 February 2021, a legal requirement to home quarantine has been introduced for all passengers arriving in Ireland. Government has also introduced a place for phased return of in-school education and childcare services, with the first phase on March 1. The government has started vaccination in end-December following the published plan by allocation groupsKey Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The Irish authorities have announced a comprehensive fiscal package of \u20ac24.5 billion (about 14 percent of GNI*), distributed over 2020 and 2021, which includes \u20ac20.5 billion in direct support and \u20ac4 billion indirect support through (a) \u20ac2 billion credit guarantee scheme and (b) \u20ac2 billion Pandemic stabilisation and recovery Fund (ISIF).

Draft Budget 2021 contains an additional stimulus of 1.7 percent of GDP and is focused on extending the income support measures, providing targeted support to the hospitality sector, and increasing health and housing spending, as well as strengthening the green agenda. In addition to that, the government has increased unemployment and wage subcidy supports to cushion the negative shock from the tightening of restrictions announced this week. Furthermore, the automatic stabilizers operate in full, i.e., tax revenues have automatically fallen in tandem with the decline in economic activity, while unemployment spending has risen. Key discretionary policy measures include:     I. Employment Wage Support Scheme. Employers, whose turnover has fallen 30%, will receive a flat-rate subsidy of up to \u20ac203 weekly per employee.    II. The Pandemic Unemployment Payment\u2014a payment available to those who have lost employment due pandemic at a flat rate of \u20ac350 per week.     III. Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) provides 10 to 5 percent turnover compensation payments to the affected firms in several sectors (accommodation, food and the arts, recreation and entertainment). It will only apply at the time of increased restrictions, and is capped at 5 thousand euros per week.    IV. Additional \u20ac200 million investment in training, education, skills development, work placement schemes, recruitment subsidies, job search and assistance measures, to help those who have lost their jobs find a new one, retrain, or develop new skills, in particular for emerging growth sectors.     V. Measures to support SMEs  include but not limited to: (a) The Restart Grant for Enterprises ( \u20ac550 million); (b) Waiver of commercial rates; (c) Credit Guarantee Scheme: 80% gov\u2019t guarantee for a wide range of credit products from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac1 million up to a maximum term of 6 years; (d) MicroFinance Ireland and the Local Enterprise Measures: a package of liquidity and enterprise investment measures worth \u20ac55 million to reduce lending rate for micro and small businesses; (e) The Future Growth Loan Scheme (\u20ac500 million) with the European Investment Bank Group, so businesses with up to 499 employees can invest for the longer-term at competitive rates.

Additional measures announced by Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) include: (i) the\u00a0release of the countercyclical capital buffer , which will be reduced from 1% to 0%.; ii) payment breaks available for mortgages, personal and business loans for customers affected by COVID-19 that were extended from three to six months. The payment break will not affect borrowers\u2019 credit records, and recording on the Central Credit Register will be adjusted; this will result in any arrears being exempt from the classification and loan loss provisioning as NPLs.    Additionally, there are moratoriums on evictions and rent increases for the duration of COVID emergency; and notice period for tenancies of less than six months was increased to 90 days; the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has issued a moratorium on disconnections of domestic customers for non-payment to the gas and electricity suppliers.    \u00a0    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.

Israel has been significantly affected by the global spread of COVID-19. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 21. The government has implemented a range of measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus, and to support people, jobs, and businesses. Measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak have included increased testing, travel restrictions, social distancing measures\u2014including restricting Israelis to 100-meter radius of their home for recreation, and closures of businesses\u2014except essential services\u2014and indoor premises. While the impact on economic activity was quite large in the first half of the year, with output declining by 7 percent (on an annualized basis) in the first quarter and 29.2 percent in the second quarter of 2020; a strong rebound in the second half entailed a decline of only 2.4 percent for the year as a whole.Reopening of the economy. Starting on April 17, the authorities took gradual steps to ease containment measures by increasing the share of allowed employees in the workplace and reopening most stores. In May, the authorities also allowed schools to gradually open by the end of the month, eased movement and gathering restrictions. Malls opened early in the month, while restaurants towards the end of the month. The authorities have issued safety guidelines for distancing and sanitation in businesses and requiring the use of face masks in public places. On June 29, following a resurgence in morbidity, the authorities imposed new restrictions on gatherings and increased telework for public sector employees. This was followed by further restrictions in early July including on capacity use for restaurants and public transportation buses, closing bars and gyms. The authorities eased some restrictions in late July and early August. The reopening of the economy allowed for a strong rebound in economic activity, with output increasing 38.9 percent (on an annualized basis) in the third quarter. In early September, the government imposed a lockdown in several cities with high morbidity, followed by a second nationwide lockdown on September 18, which was tightened on September 25. The lockdown started to ease on October 18, including gradually opening schools throughout November. On December 27, a third nation-wide lockdown was imposed as the number of new cases increased sharply. Lockdown restrictions were tightened further as of January 10. A gradual lifting of restrictions began in February 7 . A vaccination campaign has been rolled out since December 20, and administered dosses have already exceeded 92 per 100 people. About 40 percent of the population has received two doses. Key Policy Responses as of  March 4 2021Fiscal\t    On April 8, the parliament approved a package of NIS 80 billion (about 6.1 percent of 2020 GDP), which includes NIS 11 billion for health expenses.

On September 29th , parliament approved additional NIS 10.5bn to support businesses and  to increase eligibility for social benefits. In total, approved measures amount to about NIS 208 billion, of which NIS 105 were implemented in 2020, while the rest of the funds remain available for 2021.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    Key monetary policy measures include: (i) the announcement of government bond purchases up to NIS 50 billion, expanded to 85 billion in late October (NIS 50.4 billion as of end-January),  (ii) repo operations to provide shekel liquidity to the banks (NIS 1.5 billion as of end-January), (iii) a cut in the policy rate of 15bp to 0.1 percent, (iv) expanding the acceptable collateral for repos to include corporate bonds rated AA or higher, (v) a term funding scheme that has provided 3-year loans for banks to fund credit for small and microenterprises (22.7 billion as of end-January) (vi) launched a plan to purchase corporate bonds on the secondary market for up to NIS 15 billion (NIS 3.5 billion as of end-January).

As of March 4, the number of active cases has increased slightly to about 437,000. The number of hospitalized patients and those in intensive care units have also reversed its declining trend. Nearly 99,000 people have died.  Reopening of the economy and additional containment measures. The nation-wide lockdown expired on May 4. Since then, manufacturing and construction reopened under new safety rules (e.g., staggered shifts, spaced workstation, temperature checks, masks). The government moved forward some of the reopening plans. In addition to retail shops, restaurants, cafes and hairdressers reopened on May 18 (the initial reopening plan was June 1). Sports facilities reopened on May 25, followed by cinemas and theatres on June 15. Regional governments are allowed the discretion to adjust the dates in both direction. People can now travel within their own region, and mobility restrictions across regions has been lifted on June 3, when international borders also reopen without restriction to and from other EU countries.Following the increase in confirmed cases beginning in early August, the government reintroduced some containment measures, including closing night clubs, capacity limits at cultural sites. Mask wearing in public places (both in and outdoors) is required through end January 2021. Fines were raised for those who do not follow anti-contagion and quarantine rules. Rapid Covid tests are required for travelers coming back from a number of countries in Europe, and have been authorized for use in schools to identify and quarantine infected individuals, thereby avoiding the need to close entire schools. The state of emergency was extended through January 2021 A series of additional containment measures have been rolled out since mid-October and have been extended until mid-February 2021 and more recently to early April. Closures of services and mobility restrictions are more focused and vary by risk levels assigns to regions. Regions with the highest level of infections must close schools at all levels, bars, restaurants, and most non-essential shops. Travelling into high risk regions (and between municipalities in these regions) is only permissible for essential work- and health-related reasons. In early 2021, the ban on travelling between regions has been introduced for low risk areas. The cross-region travel ban has been extended several times and most recently until end-March. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    On March 17, the government adopted a \u20ac25 billion (1.6 percent of GDP)\u00a0\u201cCura Italia\u201d emergency package.

The guarantee envelope from this and earlier schemes is aimed to unlock more than \u20ac750 billion (close to 50 percent of GDP) of liquidity for businesses and households (see below).            On May 15, the government adopted a further \u20ac55 billion (3.5 percent of GDP) \u201cRelaunch\u201d package of fiscal measures. It provides, among other things, further income support for families (\u20ac14.5 billion), funds for the healthcare system (\u20ac3.3 billion), and other measures to support businesses, including grants for SMEs and tax deferrals (\u20ac16 billion).        Following the Parliament\u2019s approval for a further \u20ac25 billion (1.6 percent of GDP) deficit deviation, on August 8, the government adopted a new third support package. Labor and social measures (\u20ac12 billion) include, among other things, additional income support for families and some workers, an extension of the short-time work program, and a suspension of social security contribution for new hires. Other key measures are extensions of the moratorium on SMEs\u2019 debt repayment and the time to pay back tax obligations.        On October 27, the government adopted a \u20ac5.4 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) package that seeks to provide quick relief to the sectors affected by the latest round of COVID containment actions. Measures include grants to 460 thousand SMEs and the self-employed, and further income support for familes. The government has also extended social contribution exemptions for affected businesses.    In mid-January 2021, the government has annoucned another stimulus package of about \u20ac32bn aiming at extending supports for business and workers affected by the pandemic as well as kickstarting the economy in early 2021.

The government has taken early and proactive measures to contain the spread of infection across the island, including cancellation of all large public and private events, school shutdowns, quarantine of entire communities. The daily curfews across the island remain in place, while the closure of the island\u2019s borders to incoming visitors has been lifted for returning Jamaican citizens and non-citizens since June 1, and June 15 respectively. The government has instituted protocols for arriving visitors, including pre-arrival documentation, in-airport screening and risk assessment, followed by a risk based approach to quarantine and movement limitations. The government has also issued guidelines on the reopening of beaches, rivers and theme parks, which are key tourism attractions. In addition, guidelines have been issued for the safe capacity limits for social gatherings (e.g. weddings and funerals) and operation protocols for gyms, barbershops and hair salons.Key Policy Responses as of July 14, 2020Fiscal\t    The Minister of Finance announced tax cuts of around 0.6 percent of GDP, along with targeted measures for up to 0.5 percent of GDP to counteract the effects of COVID19. This is largely expected to be financed by ongoing asset divestment. Additional measures have been announced to support the most affected sectors by the virus and contain labor shedding, including SCT and custom duty waivers on medical supplies and sanitizers and a COVID-19 Allocation of Resources for Employees (CARE) program, which envisages (i) temporary cash transfers to businesses in targeted sectors based on the number of workers employed; (ii) temporary cash transfer to individuals where loss of employment can be verified since March 10; (iii) grants targeted at the most vulnerable segments of society. The Minister also noted that the Fiscal Responsibility law contains an escape clause that would allow for some temporary flexibility in meeting the fiscal targets, should the economic situation deteriorate further. On May 13, the Ministry of Finance tabled in Parliament a Supplementary Budget for FY2020/21 targeting a primary balance of 3.5 percent of GDP to account for the expected revenues shortfalls and necessary spending reallocations as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The overnight policy rate remains unchanged at 0.5 percent, but Bank of Jamaica has taken additional actions to ensure uninterrupted system wide liquidity, with an estimated J$57 billion liquidity injection to date, and removal of limits on the amounts that deposit taking institutions can borrow overnight without being charged a penalty rate and a broadening of the range of acceptable repo collateral. The authorities are also encouraging the banking sector to conserve capital by postponing dividends payments to shareholders reschedule loans and mortgages, in addition to the mortgage rate cuts already announced by the National Housing Trust.

Back to Top JapanBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Japan was reported on January 16, 2020. In response to the outbreak, the authorities have taken several measures targeted towards health and containment efforts. Japan expanded entry bans; as a result, this brings to a total of 152 countries/regions currently subject to Japan\u2019s entry ban which will restrict the entry of foreigners who have visited COVID-19 affected countries and regions within the last 14 days. Then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared the state of emergency for seven prefectures (including Tokyo, Saitama, Kanagawa, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo, and Fukuoka) on April 7 and expanded the coverage of the state of emergency to all Japanese prefectures on April 16, effective through May 6. The state of emergency enabled prefectural governors in the designated areas to request people to stay at home, order closures of schools and public facilities, build temporary medical facilities, and adopt actions to support medical and food supplies. On May 4, PM Abe extended the nationwide state of emergency through May 31. The 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games have been postponed to July 23-August 8, 2021.Reopening of the economy. Amid the declining trend of daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the beginning of May, the state of emergency was lifted for 39 prefectures out of a total of 47 prefectures on May 14 and for Osaka, Kyoto, and Hyogo on May 21. On May 25, the state of emergency was lifted for all prefectures, earlier than the previous May 31 expiry date. Restrictions on inter-prefectural travel were lifted on June 19.Following the second wave of infections, Tokyo raised the COVID-19 alert level to the highest on July 15. Amid that backdrop, it requested residents to refrain from traveling outside Tokyo and karaoke venues and restaurants serving alcohol to close by 10 p.m. In August, Aichi, Osaka, Miyazaki, Okinawa also requested restaurants that serve alcohol and karaoke venues to shorten operating hours to close at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. As new infections continued to trend down, Tokyo lowered the alert level by one notch from the highest level on September 10 and lifted a measure that shortened hours for restaurants and karaoke from September 16.As new infections increased, on November 19, Tokyo raised the COVID-19 alert level to the highest and requested residents to refrain from going outside and karaoke venues and restaurants serving alcohol to close by 10 p.m. until mid-December. Hokkaido, Ibaraki, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Aichi, Osaka also requested karaoke venues and restaurants serving alcohol to shorten operating hours to close at 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. until mid-December. Sapporo and Osaka were temporarily removed as destinations from the Go-to-Travel campaign\u2014a government\u2019s subsidy program to promote domestic travel\u2014through December 8. On December 14, the government temporarily suspended the Go To Travel campaign nationwide from December 28, 2020. On January 7, 2021, PM Suga declared the state of emergency for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures (Saitama, Kanagawa, and Chiba)\u2014seven prefectures (Gifu, Aichi, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Tochigi and Fukuoka) were added on January 14\u2014effective from January 8 to February 7. The government has asked restaurants and bars to shorten operating hours to close by 8 p.m., urged teleworking to reduce the number of workers at offices by 70 percent, requested residents to stay at home and refrain from non-essential outings especially after 8 p.m., and limited the number of audience at large events to 5,000 people. On February 2, PM Suga extended the state of emergency for 10 prefectures (except Tochigi) through March 7. On February 26, Japan decided to lift the state of emergency, except for the greater Tokyo area, from the beginning of March.Regarding cross-border travel, Japan has resumed re-entry into Japan by all foreign nationals who possess the status of residence since September. Japan has agreed on \"Residence Track\" which allows essential business exchange between the two countries, on condition they take preventive and quarantine measures, with Brunei, Cambodia, China, Lao's People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, Japan has agreed with China, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam on \"Business Track\" which enables limited business activities during the 14-day stay at home period (partially relaxes restrictions on such activities), immediately after arrival at those countries/regions or Japan, on condition that travelers accept additional quarantine measures such as submission of \"Schedule of Activities in Japan.\" Starting from October, the holders of statuses of residence of \"Student\", \"Dependent\" and others, in addition to cross-border business travelers of all countries and regions have been permitted to enter Japan under the condition that the person is hosted by a company/entity that can assure observation of quarantine measures. On October 30, the Government of Japan decided to remove the entry ban on Australia, Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and VietNam. However, on January 13, 2021, the government suspended \u201cBusiness Track\u201d and \u201cResidence Track\u201d until the state of emergency is lifted.As a precautionary step against coronavirus variants of concern, Japan has suspended new entry into the country of nonresident foreign nationals from December 28, 2020 until the state of emergency is lifted. New entry of nonresident foreign nationals from the United Kingdom and South Africa is suspended until further notice from December 24 and 26, 2020, respectively. Ireland, Israel and Brazil (Amazonas) were added to the countries/regions with community transmission of coronavirus variants of concern on February 2, 2021. The government requires all Japanese citizens and foreign nationals to submit negative COVID-19 test results within 72 hours prior to departure and undergo tests upon arrival. This requirement is effective until the state of emergency is lifted. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    On April 7 (partly revised on April 20), the Government of Japan adopted the Emergency Economic Package Against COVID-19 of \u00a5117.1 trillion (20.9 percent of 2019 GDP) and subsumed the remaining part of the previously announced packages (the December 2019 stimulus package (passed in January 2020) and the two COVID-19-response packages announced on February 13 and March 10 respectively). The April package aims at five objectives, including to: (i) develop preventive measures against the spread of infection and strengthen treatment capacity (expenditure of 0.4 percent of 2019 GDP), (ii) protect employment and businesses (15.8 percent of 2019 GDP), (iii) regain economic activities after containment (1.5 percent of 2019 GDP), (iv) rebuild a resilient economic structure (2.8 percent of 2019 GDP), and (v) enhance readiness for the future (0.3 percent of 2019 GDP). The key measures comprise cash handouts to every individual and affected firms, deferral of tax payments and social security contributions, and concessional loans from public and private financial institutions.    On May 27, the Government of Japan announced the second FY2020 draft supplementary budget (passed on June 12). The package, worth \u00a5117.1 trillion (20.9 percent of 2019 GDP), covers (i) health-related measures, (ii) support to businesses, (iii) support to households, (iv) transfers to the local governments, and (v) raising the ceiling of the COVID-19 reserve fund. The specific measures include expansion of the work subsidies, provision of subordinated loans by the public financial institutions to affected firms, and subsidies to affected firms for their rent payments.     On December 8, the Government of Japan adopted the Comprehensive Economic Measures to Secure People's Lives and Livelihoods toward Relief and Hope. The package, worth \u00a573.6 trillion (13.1 percent of 2019 GDP), covers measures to: (i) contain COVID-19, (ii) promote structural change and positive economic cycles for Post-Corona era, and (iii) secure safety and relief with respect to disaster management, together with allocation of the COVID-19 Reserve Fund. The specific measures include incentives for firms to invest in digitalization and green technologies, as well as an extension of the ongoing COVID-19 responses such as concessional loans to affected firms.     Japan is the largest contributor to IMF financial resources and the Fund\u2019s concessional lending facilities, as well as the longest standing partner in capacity development activities. In early April, Japan pledged an additional US$100 million contribution to the IMF\u2019s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust as immediately available resources to support the Fund\u2019s capacity to provide grant-based debt service relief for the poorest and most vulnerable countries to combat COVID-19. In order to provide emergency financing for broader emerging markets and developing countries to meet their prospective imminent needs, on April 16, Japan announced that it is aiming at doubling its contribution to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) from the current SDR 3.6 billion. Japan made available the first SDR 1.8 billion immediately. Japan calls on other ember countries to follow quickly, and Japan will match an additional SDR 1.8 billion with their contributions. In October, Japan announced a new contribution of US$10 million to the COVID-19 Crisis Development Initiative.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 16, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) called a monetary policy meeting and announced a comprehensive set of measures to maintain the smooth functioning of financial markets (notably of U.S. dollar funding markets), and incentivize the provision of credit. These include targeted liquidity provision through an increase in the size and frequency of Japanese government bond (JGB) purchases, special funds-supplying operation to provide loans to financial institution to facilitate financing of corporates, a temporary increase in the annual pace of BoJ\u2019s purchases of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Japan-Real Estate Investment Trusts (J-REITs), and a temporary additional increase of targeted purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds. The BoJ has provided lending support through the special funds-supplying operation, and made purchases of Japanese government securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and exchange-traded funds.        At its April 27 monetary policy meeting, the BoJ announced additional measures to maintain stability in financial markets and support credit provision. The BoJ decided to purchase a necessary amount of JGBs without setting an upper limit on its guidance on JGB purchases. In addition, it raised the maximum amount of additional purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds, lifting the upper limit of commercial paper and corporate bond holdings to \u00a520 trillion (US$186 billion) in total. The special funds-supplying operations have been scaled up by expanding the range of eligible counterparties and collateral to private debt (including household debt), as well as by applying a positive interest rate of 0.1 percent to the outstanding balances of current accounts held by financial institutions at the BoJ that correspond to the amounts outstanding of loans provided through this operation. On May 22, the BoJ introduced a new fund-provisioning measure to support financing of mainly small- and medium-sized enterprises, providing funds against loans such as interest-free and unsecured loans made by eligible counterparties based on the government\u2019s emergency economic measures. The total size of the special funds-supplying operation and the new fund-provisioning measure amounts to about \u00a590 trillion (US$838 billion).    The BoJ in coordination with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank enhanced the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity on March 15, by lowering the pricing on the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 25 basis points. Japan also has several important bilateral and regional swap arrangements with Asian countries.    The government expanded the volume of concessional loan facilities (interest free without collateral) primarily for micro, small and medium-sized businesses affected by COVID-19 through the Japan Finance Corporation and other institutions. The government will also enhance access to loans with the same conditions from local financial institutions, such as local banks. To support borrowers during this period of stress, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) has reassured banks that they can assign zero risk weights to loans guaranteed under public guarantee schemes, draw down their regulatory capital and systemically important bank buffers to support credit supply, and draw down their stock of high-quality liquid assets below the minimum liquidity coverage ratio requirement. The FSA has also asked banks to defer principal payments on mortgage loans as needed, and refrain from charging fees for modifying mortgage loan conditions.        On June 12, the Diet approved an amendment of the Act on Special Measures for Strengthening Financial Functions, which extends the deadline for regional banks\u2019 application to government capital injection from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2026, and provides for relaxed application conditions for those regional banks affected by COVID-19. The Act aims to strengthen regional banks\u2019 financial intermediary function through facilitating government capital injection to them. In addition, as precautionary measures, the Diet also approved the expansion of the limit of government guarantees for capital injections into regional banks from \u00a512 trillion to \u00a515 trillion.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The exchange rate has been allowed to adjust flexibly.    Back to Top JordanBackground.  Jordan has reported 330,474 cumulative cases, and 4,344deaths related to COVID as of February 5. At the onset of the global epidemic, the authorities implemented a range of measures to try and limit the spread of the virus. Early measures included the suspension of all international flights, the enforcement of strict curfews, restrictions on movement, and the closure of businesses, schools and universities. As the number of contagions remained low, restrictions were progressively relaxed over the summer. In parallel, the authorities launched a public communication and awareness campaign to inform the public on examination and treatment facilities and imposed social distancing measures and the use of masks.  In the Fall, the sharp rise in COVID cases led the authorities to enforce local lockdowns. In early October, the Government re-instated a nationwide lockdown for Fridays until the end of 2020, and closed schools and universities until the end of the semester. Most restrictions were lifted in early 2021, as the number of daily new cases dropped to much safer levels. Vaccinations started on January 13, and are currently available to health-vulnerable residents, including refugees, but the pace has been constrained by supply shortages.Reopening of the economy. A phased-out easing of the first wave lockdown started on April 6, when factories located in industrial zones were allowed to resume operations. The re-opening of the economy continued through the month of April, with work partly resuming for selected sectors on April 21t , as well as most commercial activities on April 30. .On May 4 , Jordan lifted most lockdown measures and allowed most economic sectors to operate under strict safety guidelines. In late May 2020, the government allowed companies in hard-hit sectors to cut employees\u2019 May and June salaries by 30%. The authorities announced that transport between governorates would resume, night curfews would be shortened, hotels and cafes would be allowed to re-open, along with sporting events with no spectator effective June 6. Universities remained closed and a curfew continued to be in effect at night. On July 15 , the Ministry of Education announced that schools would reopen on September 1 for the new academic year. The Ministry of Health and local companies developed the \u201cAman\u201d (\u201cSafety\u201d) application, which alerts users when they come into contact with someone who has COVID-19. The phased-out approach also entailed the complete restart of economic activities in certain regions that remained closed to the rest of the country. The government also started organizing the return of Jordanians that were abroad at the onset of the crisis and had not been able to return given the interruption of international flights. On August 13, Jordan closed its border with Syria due to virus concerns following an uptick in new cases. The Government reinstated Friday curfews starting August 27 in Amman and Zarqa. On September 8, Jordan re-opened airports for regular commercial flights with strict measures to contain the pandemic. Passengers from green-listed countries (low COVID cases countries) were able to enter Jordan if they proved they had resided for at least 14 days in the origin country, presented a negative PCR test conducted less than 72 hours before departure and took another test at the airport in Jordan. Passengers from other countries would need to quarantine for 7 days and take another PCR test at the end of the quarantine \u2013 in November, the 7-day quarantine was introduced for passengers from all countries who tested negative when entering Jordan. The Government enacted Defense Order 16 in mid-September, which introduced new measures designed to contain the pandemic (e.g.: limits to social gatherings) and includes strict penalties on people and businesses which do not comply with health safety measures (incl. fines, establishment closure and potential imprisonment). On October 6, the Government announced that a total lockdown would be imposed on all governorates on all coming Fridays and Saturdays until further notice. On October 20, the newly formed Government of Prime Minister Bisher al Khasawneh announced that total lockdowns would apply to all governorates only on Fridays, and introduced a daily curfews from 11pm to 6am for citizens and from 10pm to 6am for businesses across the country. Schools and universities were also closed and distance learning re-instated until the end of the first semester. On October 22, the Government issued defense orders 19 and 20 which allowed Friday prayers while introducing strict safety guidelines, restricted restaurants' operations to only 50 percent of capacity with no more than six people per table, and introduced new fines for establishments and persons not abiding by the defense orders rules. On November 3, the Ministry of Health struck a deal with the Private Hospitals Association to allocate at least 1,000 beds and 150 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients who would be referred to private hospitals by public hospitals. The authorities announced that starting from November 11, a total lockdown would be implemented for 4 days. In early December, the number of new weekly cases started to decline for the first time since the beginning of the second wave and reached safer levels in early January 2021. The first phase of vaccinations started on January 13, with the goal to vaccinate about 1.75 million people. Priority is being given to healthcare workers, and health-vulnerable populations (including refugees). An electronic registration system was open to all residents, regardless of nationality or status and 300,000 people have registered thus far.Relationship with the IMF: On May 20, 2020, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Jordan's request for emergency financial assistance under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) equivalent to SDR 291.55 million (about US$ 400 million, or 85 percent of quota). The purchase under the RFI is expected to cover part of Jordan's financing needs stemming from the COVID-19 shock. IMF has conducted (virtually) the 1st review mission under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) that was approved in March 2020, and reached staff level agreement in November, 2020. On December 14, 2020, the IMF Executive Board approved the completion of the 1st review of the EFF. The completion of the review will make SDR 102.93 million (about US$148 million) immediately available.Key Policy Responses as of February 5, 2021Fiscal and structural\t    On March 18, the Ministry of Finance announced a host of measures in response of the epidemic. Measures included (i) sales tax exemption on sanitizers, face masks, and medical equipment; (ii) the allocation of 50 percent of maternity insurance revenues (JD 16 million \u2013 about USD 23 million) to material assistance for the elderly and the sick; (iii) the introduction of price ceilings on essential products; (iv) the postponement of 70 percent of customs duty collections due from selected companies and the reduction of social security contributions from private sector establishments (from 21.75% to 5.25%). On March 31 , Prime Minister Omar Razzaz issued the Defense Order No. 4, establishing a coronavirus relief fund under the name \"Himmat Watan\" (a nation's effort), to which local and foreign donations will be deposited to support the Kingdom\u2019s efforts to eradicate COVID-19. The government allocated additional spending (JD 50 million \u2013 about USD 71 million) for purchases of health equipment and supplies, rental of hotels for quarantines, and additional COVID-related security costs. It also instituted a temporary cash transfer program for the unemployed and self-employed (JD 81 million \u2013 about USD 114 million). On June 15, Prime Minister Razzaz announced a battery of measures to support the tourism sector, by: : (i) allowing tourism sector to pay its 2019 tax liability in installments with no penalty; (ii) reducing the general sales tax from 16pc to 8pc and of the service tax from 10pc to 5pc for hotels and restaurants. The Ministry of Labor announced a plan to re-instate a one-year military service to help contain youth unemployment in the aftermath of the pandemic. On December 3, Prime Minister Khasawneh announced expansion of the cash transfer program to cover 100,000 new families and daily workers; funding to protect nearly 180,000 jobs in the hard-hit sectors, and additional support for the tourism sector.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) reduced most policy rates by 50 basis points on March 3rd, and further by 100 basis points on March 16. In addition, the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) announced a a package of measures aimed at containing the impact of the Coronavirus on the economy. The measures included: (i) allowing banks to postpone loan repayments clients in the impacted sectors ; (ii) injecting additional liquidity of JD 550 million (USD 776 million) by reducing the compulsory reserve ratio on deposits from 7 percent to 5 percent and JD 500 million (USD705 million) by redeeming its CDs held by banks. (iii) expanded the sectoral coverage and reduced interest rates on its refinancing program from 1.75% to 1% in Amman and from 1% to 0.5% in other governorates, while increasing loan tenors and volume limits; (iv) reduced the cost and expanded the coverage of guarantees provided by the Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation on SME loans, including a JD 150 million (USD 211 million) credit facilities made available for the  tourist sector. Trading on Amman Stock exchange was suspended from March 16, 2020 to May 10, 2020.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    KBack to Top KazakhstanBackground. Kazakhstan reported 214,089 COVID-19 cases and 2,772 deaths as of March 2, 2021. The epidemiological situation stabilized in the past month and currently almost all regions are outside the high-risk zone (\u201cred zone\u201d). The authorities continue to  re-open the economy and have loosened restrictions for regions that stay outside the red zone for seven consecutive days since March 1.While control measures such as testing requirements for travelers restrictions on foreign visas remain in place, the authorities are increasing the number of international flights with a few countries, with further normalization of international flight schedule expected in May. A mobile app was launched recently to track people\u2019s level of immunity.Vaccination. Kazakhstan launched local production of the Russia-developed vaccine (Sputnik V) in December 2020 and started voluntary vaccination of the local population on February 1. The authorities plan to vaccinate six million people (about one third of the population) free of charge by end-2021. The first stage vaccination is expected to cover groups with high risk exposure, including doctors, teachers, and law enforcement workers. In addition, a locally developed vaccine (QazCovid-in) and the vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech are expected to be available later in the year. Mass vaccination is expected to start after priority groups complete vaccination, likely in May. The authorities are also conducting an awareness campaign about vaccination, including recent statements by the President to counter mis-information about the vaccines.Economic outcome and policies. Real GDP growth in 2020 was -2.6 percent. The economic contraction is mainly due to weak activity in the service sector and the oil production cut required under the OPEC+ agreement, while the sizable government support package (9 percent of GDP announced in March 2020) has helped mitigate the economic fallout. Policy actions have included regulated prices for socially-important goods, cash transfers to vulnerable households, and targeted assistance to hard-hit sectors and small and medium-sized enterprises. The authorities\u2019 development strategy includes plans to improve public administration through civil service reform, enhance competitiveness in priority sectors such as manufacturing, pharmaceutical, and agriculture, and social policies to support the welfare of the population.Key Policy Responses as of March 2, 2021Fiscal\t    The anti-crisis package announced in March 2020 includes cash payments to the unemployed and self-employed, an increase in pension and social benefits, additional health spending, and support for employment and businesses. Subsidized lending of KZT 1 trillion (1\u00bd percent of GDP) is being provided under the State Program \u201cEconomy of Simple Things,\u201d along with actions to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) finance working capital (KZT 800 billion). KZT 1.8 trillion is allocated to support employment under an \u201cEmployment Roadmap\u201d program, including some large-scale projects to modernize the transportation infrastructure. Selected enterprises and individual entrepreneurs are also eligible for new tax incentives. Further measures recently announced to restore economic growth include: a subsidized mortgage program for households with a segment targeting youth specifically, tax incentives to agriculture and hard-hit sectors (civil aviation, tourism), credit support to SMEs and manufacturing enterprises (the latter via a newly created industry development fund), and infrastructure development. Following the reintroduction of the quarantine in early July, the authorities provided additional cash transfers to individuals who lost their jobs due to the quarantine, lowered subsidized interest rates for SME loans (to 6 percent), and extended tax concessions for vulnerable individuals and businesses. Some supportive measures (e.g. \u201cEmployment Roadmap\u201d and working capital support to SMEs) are expected to continue in 2021. The Ministry of Health recently announced plans to increase salaries for doctors over 2021-23; the estimated overall fiscal cost amounts to about 0.7 percent of 2021 GDP.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The National Bank (NBK) raised its policy rate from 9.25 percent to 12 percent on March 10, 2020, after pressures on the tenge (KZT) intensified with the drop of oil prices. It later cut the base rate and kept it at 9 percent to support activity. To support banks and the economy, the authorities have, since mid-March 2020 , (i) lowered risk weights (for SME from 75% to 50%, for FX loans from 200% to 100%, and for syndicated loans from 100% to 50%); (ii) expanded the list of eligible collaterals; (iii) lowered capital conservation buffer (by one percentage point); (iv) reduced the liquidity coverage ratio requirement (from 80% to 60%), and (v) lowered limits on foreign currency positions. To support the population and SMEs, the authorities have encouraged banks and other lenders to grant loan repayment deferrals to eligible borrowers, and to freeze their loan classifications at the pre-COVID-19 status. Most of these measures are expected to be temporary, with some (e.g., capital conservation buffer) extending to mid-2021. Cash withdrawals limits have also been temporarily imposed on legal entities starting early June. The financial supervisor revoked the license of a medium-sized bank which failed to meet the minimum capital requirement.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The NBK allowed the tenge to depreciate by over 15 percent to almost 450 KZT/$ in March 2020, intervening to mitigate excessive volatility. It also introduced temporary administrative measures (halving the limit of daily FX purchase unrelated to payment obligations, monthly limits on cash withdrawals by firms). The tenge partially recovered in April, and overall, it depreciated by 10 percent in 2020, due to persisting uncertainty associated with the pandemic and oil price outlook. The NBK largely refrained from FX interventions since April, except in late September and late October when the tenge came under pressure due to oil price drops. International reserves have increased, driven by the rising gold price.The tenge has been stable with a slight appreciation in 2021, supported by higher oil prices.    Back to Top KenyaBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 14, 2020. The government adopted a number of containment measures, including social distancing and heightened restrictions in most non-essential social spaces to gatherings; encouragement of teleworking where possible; establishment of isolation facilities; declaration of night curfew and limitations on public transportation passenger capacity. Some of the containment measures have since been relaxed. Domestic flights commenced on July 15th, 2020, while international flights commenced on August 1st, 2020. All international arrivals have to undertake specifically a SarsCoV2 RT PCR Swab test, failure to which they will be quarantined for two weeks. Test result notwithstanding, passengers from selected counties are required to undergo a fourteen-day quarantine.  A resurgence of infections in a second wave led to reversal of some of the relaxed measures.  Physical participation in places of worship with an age limit of 65 years to take a maximum of 90 minutes down from two hours.  Attendance to weddings limited 50 people down from 200 people. While funeral attendance limit remains 200 people, those allowed at the grave side are only 15. Schools re-opening was in phases and were fully reopened on January 4, 2021. An initial Covid-19 vaccine deployment plan put out by the ministry of health targets 30 percent population coverage by mid-2023, with two thirds of the vaccines expected to be provided by GAVI/COVAX and the remainder procured by government. The first phase of deployment, which aims to cover 3 percent of the population by end-June 2021, would focus on frontline health workers. The first batch of the vaccine covering 0.5 percent of the population arrived in the country in early March 2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government, as part of the FY2019/20 budget (ending June 30, 2020), initially earmarked Ksh40 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) for Covid-related expenditure, including health sector (enhanced surveillance, laboratory services, isolation units, equipment, supplies, and communication); social protection (cash transfers and food relief); and funds for expediting payments of existing obligations to maintain cash flow for businesses during the crisis. The FY2020/21 budget includes a Ksh56.6 million (0.5 percent of GDP) economic stimulus package that includes a new youth employment scheme, provision of credit guarantees, fast-tracking payment of VAT refunds and other government obligations, increased funding for cash transfers, and several other initiatives. A package of tax measures has been adopted, including full income tax relief for persons earning below the equivalent of $225 per month, reduction of the top pay-as you earn rate from 30 to 25 percent, reduction of the base corporate income tax rate from 30 to 25 percent, reduction of the turnover tax rate on small businesses from 3 to 1 percent, and a reduction of the standard VAT rate from 16 to 14 percent. Some of the tax measures, including the reduction of top PAYE rate, corporate income tax rate and VAT were reversed effective January 1, 2021.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 24, the central bank (1) lowered its policy rate by 100 bps to 7.25 percent; (2) lowered banks\u2019 cash reserve ratio by 100 bps to 4.25 percent; (3) increased the maximum tenor of repurchase agreements from 28 to 91 days; and (4) announced flexibility to banks regarding loan classification and provisioning for loans that were performing on March 2, 2020, but were restructured due to the pandemic. The central bank has also encouraged banks to extend flexibility to borrowers\u2019 loan terms based on pandemic-related circumstances and encouraged the waiving or reducing of charges on mobile money transactions to disincentivize the use of cash. On April 15, the central bank suspended the listing of negative credit information for borrowers whose loans became non-performing after April 1 for six months. A new minimum threshold of $10 was set for negative credit information submitted to credit reference bureaus. On April 29, the central bank lowered its policy rate by 25 bps to 7.0 percent. Some of the measures including waiving or reducing of charges on mobile money transactions and suspension of listing of negative credit information for borrowers were reversed on January 1, 2021.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top KiribatiBackground. Kiribati does not have any confirmed cases as of February 4, 2021. Travel restrictions have been in place since January and borders have been closed on March 21, except for delivery of essential goods (quarantine requirements apply at all ports). A press release to prevent speculations and panic was released on March 17 and government task forces have been formed to address commodity and cargo buffers; communication and awareness; isolation centers and containment efforts; and border control. A state of public emergency has been declared and schools suspended on March 28. Since then schools have reopened.Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A stimulus package was approved in June 2020. The package amounts to AUD 15.5 million, equivalent to 7.5 percent of GDP. It consists of unemployment support (AUD 2.6 million), private business stimulus (AUD 4.5 million plus AUD 3.5 million cargo buffer), and SOE stimulus (AUD 5.2 million). This excludes the first response package of AUD 11.5 million that has been largely donor-funded    \t    The specific measures include: unemployment benefit via partial income substitution, employer cost sharing for off-shore observers, sea farers, and fruit packers, reduction in social security contributions for both employers and employees, and loan support through government-owned financial intermediaries.

Back to Top KoreaKorea first reported confirmed COVID-19 cases in January 2020, with the average daily number of new cases peaking at over 500 in March. The authorities rapidly implemented a comprehensive strategy to combat the virus based on widespread testing, aggressive contact tracing, and prompt isolation and treatment of cases.

With the advent of the holiday season, and despite the fact that the lockdown did not lead to any improvement or flattening in the numbers of infections or mortalities, the authorities decided to open up the country gradually\u2014this includes included opening restaurants at fifty percent capacity and opening schools in hybrid mode. Pubs and nightclubs were subsequently open at 50 percent capacity and curfew hours decreased. The only visible benefit of the lockdown period was a little less pressure on the health system and an increase in beds devoted to COVID cases in both public and private hospitals and across regular and ICU units. On January 7, 2021 the authorities imposed the fifth and longest general lockdown\u2014the lockdown lasting until February 1, 2021 later extended till February 8, reinstates reinstated the odd/even car plate circulation rule, closes closed all educational establishments, enforces enforced a curfew from 6 pm to 5 am, and operates operated the airport at 20 percent capacity. The lockdown, expected to be gradually being lifted now, managed to stabilize the infection cases in the past few days weeks despite the rise in numbers of deaths and an elevated test positivity rate; rates are now increasing back again.

Lesotho reported its first COVID-19 case on May 14, 2020 and cases have been rising since then (source: https://COVID 19.who.int/region/afro/country/ls).  Lesotho created an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate the response to COVID 19 and adopted a range of containment measures, including social distancing, travel restrictions, declaration of a national state of emergency, closure of  borders to all but essential goods, closure of schools, extension of initial 21-day lockdown of the country for two weeks (until May 5) and suspension of some shops (e.g. gyms, hair/beauty parlors, arcades, liquor stores, etc.). The Ministry of Health has developed a Preparedness and Response Plan. The government has developed the National COVID-19 Response Integrated Plan 2020 in collaboration with development partners.The government committed in its Letter of Intent requesting the emergency financing from the IMF to implement specific measures on transparency and accountability of COVID-related spending. Reopening of the economy. The lockdown of the country was relaxed since May 5. Private businesses (non-essential) gradually reopened but some (e.g., alcohol) followed WHO\u2019s recommendations. Public servants already went back to work but practice social distancing. The lockdown was lifted on May 19, albeit with compulsory use of masks in public spaces and restrictions in high risk sectors such as tourism, sit-in restaurants, entertainment and assembly of more than 50 people. Schools have reopened gradually under the guidance of ministry of education. However, since December 2020, COVID-19 infections and death tolls have increased sharply, the alert level has been raised twice from \u201cBlue Level\u201d to \u201cPurple Level\u201d to \u201cOrange Level\u201d within one week (12/29/2020-1/4/2021). The alert level was further raised to the highest \u201cRed Level,\u201d triggering a second full national lockdown since January 14, initially for 2 weeks, but subsequently extended until February 3. The alert level was lowered back to the \u201cOrange Level\u201d on Feb 4, with most of the restrictions remaining in place on various political, religious, and social gatherings, as well as businesses and recreational activities.  All schools were closed, and a curfew was put in place. Borders, including airports, were closed, except for the movement of essential goods and services.  Following a decrease in positivity rates, the alert level was lowered on March 1 from \u201cOrange Level\u201d to \u201cPurple Level.\u201d Schools have reopened with COVID protocols. International travel has also resumed, and businesses have been granted longer hours of operation. The sale of alcohol is still restricted, and a curfew remains in place.Key Policy Responses as of March 3, 2021Fiscal\t    Mainly two packages: (i) A M700 million (about 2 percent of GDP) fund was set aside for the National COVID-19 Response Integrated Plan 2020, more than half of which is being used for health care personnel and purchase of critical goods and services, with the remainder covering logistics, security, and border management. (ii) Economic mitigation measures are also being implemented including around 1.2 billion for emergency assistance and expanding social protection: Existing cash transfers, such as the Child Grant Program has been topped-up. Public assistance is expanded for 3 months, to add vulnerable groups such as children, elderly disabled, and those working in the informal sector. The authorities are providing a subsidy to 45 thousand industrial workers, and grants and stipends to tertiary students studying domestically or abroad. M100 million in subsidies to support food production. Regarding supporting businesses, the authorities also intend to clear arrears to MSMEs and are expanding credit guarantee facilities by M450 million. They are also offering grants and rent subsidies to MSMEs and rent holidays to firms renting from the Lesotho National Development Corporation and local/municipal governments. The Lesotho Revenue Agency defers CIT for the first two quarters for all businesses and provides tax deferrals for the Pay as You Earn (PAYE), VAT, and Simplified Business Taxes for non-essential service providers.    The authorities recently pledged M 240million for vaccine procurement\u2014in addition to those to be received via the COVAX facility\u2014with the aim of vaccinating three-quarters of the population by end-2021.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 23, 2020, following an extraordinary meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) announced (i) an increase of the NIR target floor from US$630 million to US$660 million, and (ii) a reduction of the CBL policy rate by 100 basis points from 6.25 to 5.25 percent.

On April 14, following another extraordinary meeting of the MPC of the CBL announced a reduction of the CBL policy rate from 5.25 to 4.25 percent. On May 22, the CBL further cut its policy rate to 3.75 percent and reduced the NIR floor from US$660 million to US$530 million. On July 28, the CBL cut its policy rate by another 25 bp to 3.50 percent and raised NIR floor from US$530 million to US$550 million. The MPC further raised the NIR floor to US$635 million on November 24 and further to US$670 million on January 26 to safeguard the peg between the Loti and the South  African Rand.    Additional financial sector measures were also adopted : (i) Banks were directed to suspend loan repayments for three months, and insurance companies to suspend premium  payments. At the end of June, the bank-related measures were extended to September; (ii) The implementation of Basel II.5 was postponed to enhancing banks\u2019 capacity to lend; (iii) Banks were instructed not to pay dividends to shore up capital and liquidity; and (iv) the CBL used moral suasion to encourage banks to reduce fees on digital platforms.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures. The local currency is pegged to South Africa's Rand, which depreciated substantially during the first few months since the COVID-19 outbreak but gradually bounced back later on.    Back to Top LiberiaLiberia continues to experience rapid growth in the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, but from a small base. The cases are concentrated in Montserrado county (which includes Monrovia) but incidences are now reported in all other counties as well. The first case was detected on March 16, 2020.On March 21, 2020 the Liberian authorities issued a declaration designed to enforce severe social distancing, including: closure of all schools, night clubs, cinemas, beaches, spas, mosques and churches; banning of all street selling and gatherings of more than 10 people; limits on admittance to banks and restaurants to five customers kept six feet apart; Social distancing for health facilities and pharmacies (which remained open); mandatory washing with soap and clean water at all public and private establishments; and a hotline was established to report those exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms.On midnight April 10, Government announced and began enforcing a State of Emergency, which was subsequently approved by the Legislature as required in the Constitution. This was extended in early July, but with a downward adjustment in the curfew. Also mandated were the strict enforcement of wearing face masks in public, the observance of reasonable social distancing, and other approved health protocols, along with the re-opening of the international airport. The State of Emergency at mid-night on July 21, officially expired with no renewal. The immediate withdrawal of the military from various places of assignments across the country to the barracks was ordered by the President. The troops had been deployed across the country to assist with the rigid enforcement of the execution of the State of Emergency. With the expiration of the State of Emergency, Residents have been admonished to strictly adhere to the National Public Health Law and amended anti-COVID-19 protocols. The measures includes the continued closure of all night clubs and bars, Compulsory testing of outbound and inbound passengers using the international airport, the adaptation of a no face mask no service at all public places, and the increase in the admittance to banks service areas from five to ten with the observation of a three feet social distance. Meanwhile, public sector workers considered non-essential placed on administrative pay leave as a result of the outbreak, are yet to be recall to work. Line ministries and agencies are currently operation on their approved essential staff.In accordance with pronouncements from the Ministry of Education, in-person classes for students from 6 \u2013 11 grades have resumed at on schools. 12 graders who returned to classes in early August are currenting sitting the regional West African high School Exams. Students below the 6th grade are required to complete sets of take-home exams in fulfillment of their academic curriculum for the school year readjusted to come to an end by mid-November. In light of the recent trends and the preventative measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, the Ministry of Education had announced full reopening of schools for in-person learning for all grades starting on January 4, 2021.The International airport on July 28, resumed international flights with the expiration of the State of Emergency. Anti COVID-19 protocols and procedures have been put in place by the management of the airport in consultation with health authorities, including presenting the certificate of a negative test or undergoing a rapid test on arrival.Prior to departure, a traveler is required to undergo a test arranged by the Ministry of Health and present a negative test result to be admitted to the flight.The Legislature has approved the request by the Executive to allocate US$25 million\u2014to be supplemented by US$5 million of donor funds\u2014for a World Food Programme-implemented food distribution to the most vulnerable citizens, and this program is now being implemented.The World Bank approved about US$17 million of off-budget project funding for the health sector, of which US$7.50 million was new investment financed by the COVID-19 Fast Track Facility (March 23); and $9.5 million was temporarily diverted from existing projects (March 30). On July 28, 2020 the Board of Directors of the African Development Bank approved US$14 million direct budget support for Liberia as part of a multi-country COVID-19 response to help bolster the fight against the pandemic. The funding is expected to be tailored largely towards financing vulnerable female-headed household and school-going children. Other targeted beneficiaries include the business community and small and medium-size enterprises. Other donors are also contributing, but funding shortfalls remain.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Aside from some measures to speed up and facilitate the importation process\u2014including by removal of the pre-shipment inspection requirement and some protective surcharges, the inclusion of some COVID-19-related expenditure in the recast budget for the last fiscal year and to develop a preparedness plan\u2014no other special fiscal measures have yet been adopted.    The authorities are hoping to finalize a COVID-19 preparedness plan in conjunction with the donor community, and the draft is still evolving. The World Bank has to date disbursed over half of its available funding for actions under the plan.         Areas of concentration under the plan include support to health care    workers, purchase and rehabilitation of health care equipment, procurement    of drugs and other medical supplies, deployment of surge staff to contact    tracing activities, border areas, rapid response teams, training of    responders, planning, communications and information sharing, staffing and    equipping of laboratories, and logistical and supply support.        Monetary and macro-financial\t     The central bank reduced the policy rate by 500 bp to 25 percent partly to support increased financial intermediation. To mitigate the shortage of Liberian dollar banknotes, the CBL is expediting the procurement of additional banknotes to help meet the Liberian dollar demand in the economy. In response to the difficulties being felt by the private sector, the CBL is also allowing banks to practice limited forbearance on asset classification, provisioning, and lending policies in hard-hit sectors of the economy, while remaining vigilant for signs of banking sector stress.        On the payments side, to better facilitate the use of electronic    payments, the CBL has suspended fees and charges for most electronic    transfers and point-of-sale outlets used by merchants and mobile money    operators; and increased allowable daily limits. The bank has also    increased the allowable daily and aggregate limits for mobile money    transactions for a period of three months.        Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures so far, but the authorities are committed to allowing the exchange rate to adjust in line with market forces.    Back to Top LibyaLibya reported its first COVID-19 positive case in late-March 2020, when an infected man returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia via Tunisia.Infections and deaths from COVID-19 have increased exponentially since end-May 2020. As of March 3, 2021, the Tripoli-based National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) reported that Libya had registered more than 135,000 positive COVID 19 cases. This number has more than doubled since the beginning of November 2020. New infections have picked up noticeably in what appears to be a pronounced second-wave upswing that started late December 2020, and the daily average has remained at about 550-600 cases ever since. The NCDC also reported that over 2200 patients have died from COVID 19 related complications as of the first week of March 2021, up from just 3 deaths at end-May 2020, and double the number in mid-November 2020. Currently, the COVID-related deaths rate stands at about 12 deaths per day, up from just around 11 death per day in January 2021. Notwithstanding the steep rise in positively identified Coronavirus cases and deaths in recent weeks, the true spread of the disease in Libya is likely to be significantly higher because of restricted access to testing across the country, as well as limitations in data compilation. The NCDC continues to implement strict measures to contain the spread of the Coronavirus into and within Libya, but the fighting and migrating militias and civilians pose a challenge. The country\u2019s borders have been closed, large public gatherings banned, and travel restrictions instituted, including between cities. In December 2020, it was reported that Libya signed a contract with the World health Organization for the purchase of 2.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine at a cost of about to US$9.4 million. Additional purchase have since been contracted. In late-February 2021, the Head of the Scientific Advisory Committee for Combating Coronavirus, Khalifa Al-Bakoush, explained that\u2014notwithstanding initial delays\u2014he expected up to 12 million doses of vaccines to be delivered to Libya by the end of March 2021.So far, the continued civil war\u2014notwithstanding the formal ceasefire posture (see below)\u2014has had a severe social and economic impact than COVID-19. Libya's economy is contracting sharply because of the steep drop in oil prices and the collapse of oil production of more than 90\u00a0percent due to the conflict. In early December, the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) reported that during the ten months of 2020, the government lost US$11 billion in oil exports proceeds due to the stoppage of oil production and exports, as well as disruptions in payment systems. Water supply to Tripoli and surrounding areas that was shut off in early April as a result of the fighting has since been partially restored. The combination of civil war and an accelerating pandemic has proven to be devastating.On August 6, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on three Libyans and a Malta-based company, accusing them of acting as a network to smuggle drugs and Libyan fuel into Malta and thereby contributing to instability in Libya. On October 23, a ceasefire agreement was signed in Geneva between representatives of the GNA and the Libyan National Army (LNA) under the auspices of the United Nations. Thus far, the ceasefire agreement appears to be holding, although there is the real risk that it may be undermined by a number of militias and forces that were excluded from the negotiations. Some oil production and exports have resumed, but it is too early to tell how large and how sustainable these will be, nor how readily available the oil export proceeds will be. Meanwhile, social conditions in Tripoli and other major cities have continued to deteriorate considerably, with frequent and prolonged disruptions in the supply of water, electricity, and fuel. Widespread demonstrations of frustrated civilians in Tripoli and other cities have reportedly been met by harsh force, arrests and even kidnappings.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021\t    Fiscal. In the spring of 2020, the Government of National Accord (GNA) announced a package of initially LD 500 million (about 1 percent of GDP) in emergency COVID-19 related spending. In early January 2021, the CBL stated that during 2020, the actual total amount of funds expended to combat the Coronavirus pandemic had reached about LD 1.3 billion. Certain medical equipment and personal protective gear are already in short supply as a result of the civil war which has impacted imports and impeded the free flow of goods within Libya\u2019s borders. In an effort to protect declining reserves, in mid-April the GNA announced a 20 percent pay cut for civil servants.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    No measures.

On November 13, the government introduced capital grants to partly cover fixed costs and extended flat-rate financial aid for most affected sectors (tourism, events, culture and entertainment) through March 2021. Businesses eligible for both schemes should choose the one most suitable for their needs. Several existing aid schemes (available to all sectors) have been extended through Q2 2021, including partial unemployment benefits, credit guarantees and capital advances.    On November 20, the government announced new measures to support businesses, including: (i) lump sum grants for most affected sectors to partially compensate the increase in minimum wages scheduled for early 2021; and (ii) a capital injection to the public credit insurer (\u20ac20 million), the Office du Ducroire, to increase its capacity to provide guarantees to exporters.    On December 21, the government extended\u00a0the\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0sectors eligible for capital grants that partly cover fixed costs to retail and personal care sectors.

The Luxembourg authorities have intensified off-site oversight of key risks in the banking sector and stepped up surveillance of investment funds, including new requirements for weekly updates on financial data, notifications on significant events and large redemptions, and fund managers\u2019 governance arrangements. They introduced a draft law which, among others, grants the supervisory bodies powers to extend, for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis, reporting deadlines for entities under their remit. In line with the ECB\u2019s recommendation on dividend distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic, banks were advised to refrain from distributing accumulated profits should this constrains their capacity to meet their clients\u2019 credit and liquidity needs. They also issued guidance on COVID19-related financial Q&As clarifying, among others, reporting requirements for investment funds, and the prudential treatment of COVID-19 industry-wide private moratoria as well supervisory flexibility to avoid IFSR9-related procyclical effects for banks. Also, Luxembourg banks committed to offer a 6-month moratorium on loan repayment for SMEs, self-employed and liberal professionals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    MBack to Top MadagascarMadagascar\u2019s macroeconomic outlook has been affected by weaker external demand, the increased spread of the pandemic, and significant losses of revenue. Since the first reported cases on March 20, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases stands at 19,831 (297 deaths, 19,296 recovered) as of March 4, 2021.The authorities continue to implement mitigation measures to accommodate the impact of the pandemic to ensure the health of the population and preserve macroeconomic stability. The national state of emergency first declared on March 23, has been extended several times. Following the activation of their national contingency plan, the authorities are taking measures to increase health spending, help the most vulnerable, support the private sector, and preserve the stability of the financial sector. In support of these measures, a multisectoral and interdisciplinary coordination unit COVID-19 Operational Command Center (CCO) was established at central, regional and local levels.Reopening of the economy. Despite lifting the state of emergency on October 18, 2020, mask wearing remains mandatory (failure to wear one may result in 24-hour arrest or mandatory public works) and public events remain restricted to no more than 200 attendees. Domestic flights require 48-hour testing prior to boarding for all passengers. As of October 1, 2020, international flights to Nosy Be resumed with limited number of passengers, implementation of CDC guidelines and restrictions imposed on countries with high COVID-19 incidence of new cases while international flights to mainland Madagascar remain completely suspended.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Key measures include: (i) targeted investments to strengthen the health system following the activation of the national contingency plan in coordination with the WHO to protect against the pandemic; (ii) expansion of social assistance to the most vulnerable, including cash-transfers and in-kind necessities to the poorest and those unemployed; and (iii) supporting private sector through tax relief, suspension of government fees and waived social contributions. As of end of July, medicine and medical equipment were exempted from paying import duties.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The central bank provided monetary policy support and acted to safeguard financial stability. The central bank is providing liquidity to the commercial banks, reaching MGA 609 billion (about 1.2 percent of GDP) at end December2020 and relaxed some mandatory deposit limits to encourage banks to defer delayed payments on existing loans and increase lending to businesses.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    \u2022\tThe authorities are maintaining the flexible exchange rate regime. Based on the latest available data, the central bank has made interventions in response to market tensions on the foreign exchange market and large fluctuations in the EUR-USD exchange rate, and in 2020 the exchange rate depreciated respectively by about 5 percent vis-\u00e0-vis US$ and 16 percent vis-\u00e0-vis EUR\u20ac.    Back to Top MalawiThe first three cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on April 2nd, 2020. A moderate increase in cases followed through end-May, when the number of cases accelerated and reached a peak in early-July. Malawi has faced a severe second round of COVID infections exceeding the first wave. The number of positive cases of COVID-19 quadrupled from 6,028 to 25,895 between December 2020 and February 2021, though daily positive cases have started to decline since mid-January. The authorities continue to expand local COVID-19 testing capabilities\u2014with assistance from development partners (DFID, UNICEF, and the Global Fund). In addition, Malawi has been approved for participation in the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility. The vaccines are expected in the second quarter of 2021 and will cover 20 percent of the population (3.8 million people), starting with high risk groups. In addition, 100,000 doses covering 0.5 percent of the population have been secured through the African Union.To curb the spread of the pandemic, on April 4, the government instituted a partial lockdown of the country, with essential services continuing to function and critical businesses working in shifts. Initially, all international flights to Malawi were suspended except those carrying essential health & other supplies and returning Malawian citizens or residents; however, since September 1, some flights have resumed. A two-week mandatory self-quarantine for people arriving from areas highly affected by coronavirus disease remains in effect. These measures combined with spillovers from the global slowdown, border closures, and economic disruption in neighboring countries have slowed domestic economic activity. As a result, growth for 2020 is expected to decline to 0.6 percent and to 2.2 percent in 2021 (0.4 and 0.3 percentage points below projections in IMF Country Report 20/168.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government\u2019s response plan includes US$20 million (0.25 percent of GDP) in spending on health care and targeted social assistance programs; this includes hiring 2000 additional health care workers. In addition, tax waivers are being granted on imports of essential goods to manage and contain the pandemic. An Emergency Cash Transfer Program of about $50 million (0.5 percent of GDP), mostly financed by development partners, is being implemented during May-November.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Reserve Bank of Malawi reduced the policy rate by 150 basis points to 12 percent. The domestic currency Liquidity Reserve Requirement (LRR) has been reduced by 125 basis points to 3.75 percent (aligned with the foreign currency LRR) and the Lombard Rate has been reduced to 12.2 percentage points, 0.2 percentage points above the policy rate. An Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) framework has been introduced to support banks in the event of worsening liquidity conditions and to provide support to banks on a case-by-case basis. However, financial sector buffers, including banks\u2019 capital and liquidity buffers, are expected to counter risks to the banking system. To support small and medium enterprises (SMEs), commercial banks and micro-finance institutions will be, on a case-by-case basis, restructuring SME loans and providing a moratorium on their debt service until end-June 2021. Fees on mobile money transactions have been temporarily waived to encourage cashless transactions.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures have been taken.    Back to Top MalaysiaBackground. Malaysia has been severely hit by the spread of COVID-19. The first COVID case appeared in Malaysia in early February 2020 but a local outbreak only emerged in March, prompting the introduction of a nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO) which helped significantly reduce the spread of the virus. The authorities started easing restrictions by allowing most businesses to reopen under a Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) from May 4. A Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) took effect on June 10, lifting most restrictions on domestic activities and movement. A new wave of infections in Malaysia, initially associated with an outbreak following elections in the state of Sabah in September, prompted the reinstatement of the CMCO on various states until January 14, 2021. Since then, the worsening of the pandemic has prompted the re-imposition of the stringent Movement Control Order (named MCO 2.0) on all states except Serawak until February 18, which was extended until March 4 to Kuala Lumpur and three other states: stay-at-home orders were reintroduced, interstate traveling and social gatherings banned, and only five essential economic sectors allowed to operate: manufacturing, construction, services, trade and distribution, and plantations. From March 5, the CMCO will be put in place for some states (Kuala Lumpur, Negeri Sembilan, Kedha, Peraak, Kelantan, Sarawak), while the remaining states are placed under the RMCO. Most business activities are allowed to operate under both CMCO and RMCO, and inter-state travel has reopened. International borders remain closed and overseas travel restricted until at least March 31, 2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A fiscal stimulus package of RM 6 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) was approved on February 27, 2020, including increased health spending; temporary tax and social security relief; cash transfers to affected sectors; and rural infrastructure spending. Additional measures\u2014electricity discounts and temporary pay leave\u2014for RM 0.62 billion (less than 0.1 percent of GDP) were announced on March 16, 2020. Some investment spending planned for 2020 is being frontloaded.     A second stimulus package of RM 25 bn (1.7 percent of GDP) was released on March 27, 2020, including additional health spending; cash transfers to low income households; wage subsidies to help employers retain workers; and infrastructure spending in East Malaysia. The government also setup a RM 50 bn fund for working capital loan guarantees for all COVID-19 affected businesses. Furthermore, employees will be allowed special withdrawals from their Employment Provident Fund (EPF) account for a 12-month period and businesses will be allowed to reschedule their EPF payments. On April 6, 2020, the authorities announced a third stimulus package of RM 10 bn (0.7 percent of GDP), including grants for micro SMEs, scaled-up wage subsidies, and a 25 percent discount on foreign workers\u2019 fees. On June 5, 2020, the authorities announced a fourth stimulus package of RM 21 bn (1.4 percent of GDP), which includes an extension of the wage subsidies scheme, hiring and training subsidies, support for business digitalization, and additional tax relief.     On September 23, 2020, the authorities announced a fifth stimulus package of RM 10 billion (0.7 percent of GDP), which includes a further extension of the wage subsidies scheme and microgrants for entrepreneurs, and a new round of cash transfer to lower income households.     On October 26, 2020, the Temporary Measures for Government Financing (COVID-19) Act 2020 was enacted. It temporarily increased the government debt ceiling by 5 percentage points to 60 percent of GDP.     On November 6, the authorities released the 2021 budget, which included RM 17 billion spending on COVID-related measures that was carried over from the packages announced earlier in 2020. These measures will be financed from the funds borrowed under the Temporary Measures for Government Financing (COVID-19) Bill 2020. The total amount of fiscal injection envisaged in five stimulus plans over 2020-2021 (RM 55 billion) remains unchanged. Of that, around RM38 billion have been spent in 2020 and the remainder, RM17billion, has been allocated to 2021.     On January 18, 2021, the authorities announced a new package, totaling RM15 billion. Key initiatives include accelerated social security payments under the existing programs, accelerated withdrawals from the EPF, extended tax relief on communication equipment and locally produced cars, expansion of the wage subsidy program, and additional grants for microenterprises. It also includes relaxation of the unemployment benefits eligibility criteria and extension of terms.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    (i) In response to the crisis, (BNM) lowered the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) in 3 consecutive MPC meetings on March 3, May 5, and July 7. Including the January rate change, the OPR has been cut in 2020 by a cumulative 125 bps to-date to 1.75 percent. The policy response was initially geared to address market disruptions and financial market volatility in March, and most recently was responding more to weak global economic conditions and subdued inflationary pressures.    (ii) BNM lowered the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) Ratio by 100 basis points to 2 percent effective March 20. On May 5, the BNM announced that banking institutions can use MGS and MGII to fully meet the SRR compliance until May 2021.

Maldives\u2019 economy is very dependent on tourism, with tourism receipts representing about 60 percent of GDP. The government declared a Public Health Emergency on March 12, 2020 that was extended to April 4 2021 on March 4th. Local community transmission was detected in Mid-April last year. The greater Mal\u00e9 region was placed on full lockdown from April 15 through May 28, with all people leaving their homes needing the approval of the Maldives Police Service. Several containment measures were adopted during the outbreak, but many of them are being gradually lifted currently.Reopening of the economy.The country has implemented different lockdown ease phases since July 1, 2020. International flights as well as tourism island resorts reopened on July 15, 2020. Tourists with reservations do not need to quarantine but they are required to have a negative COVID-19 test conducted within 96 hours prior to their arrival in the Maldives. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) shortened the non-tourist standard quarantine period to 10 from 14 days, effective from December 4 onwards. Maldivians and work visa holders arriving from abroad to Mal\u00e9 will not be required to remain in quarantine after presenting a negative PCR test result as of December 20. As a result of a new wave of COVID-19 cases, individuals travelling from Mal\u00e9 to other islands for essential and urgent purposes will need to obtain a negative PCR test 72-hours prior to departure as of February 3. The HPA announced on February 2 the tightening of curfew hours and vehicle movement restrictions, as well as the shutdown of all universities, colleges, preschools, and daycare centers in the Greater Male' area. These measures were extended on March 4th 2021.Key Policy Responses as of  March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    To minimize the economic impact of the COVID\u201319 virus, the authorities announced on March 20, 2020 an Economic Recovery Plan of 2.5 Billion rufiyaa (3.4 percent of GDP).

US$250 million of the swap support remain outstanding as of March 4th 2021.    Back to Top MaliBackground. The outbreak reached Mali relatively late, with first confirmed cases on March 24. The number of total cases continues to rise. The spread of the pandemic has accelerated since October, with the start of the second wave, from around 15 new cases a day to over 100 cases at end-December 2020 (calculated as a 7-day moving average due to high variability of the daily data), which is higher than during the previous peak of 45 cases in mid-June. Since January 2021 the number of new cases has been declining.Since mid-March 2020, the government has introduced preventive containment measures. These included the suspension of commercial flights (except cargo flights), the closure of land borders, a curfew from 9:00pm to 5:00am, the suspension of all public gatherings, the prohibition of social, sports, cultural and political gatherings of more than 50 people. In addition, the government has set up a crisis response unit, a hotline for signaling any suspicious case, and is stepping up sensitization campaigns, strengthening testing capacities, expanding quarantine and hospitalization facilities, and improving medical care capacities. Working hours in the public administration were reorganized to end earlier (at 2:30pm), to protect civil servants. Retail markets remained open from 6:00am to 4:00pm, to prevent disruptions in the supply of population with basics goods. 10 million masks have been distributed to the population. On May 20th 400 prisoners were released as a preventive step against the spread of COVID-19.Reopening of the economy and additional containment measures. As of May 9, 2020, the night curfew was lifted and it has become mandatory to wear masks in public. Schools reopened on June 2  for final year students. The schools for other students reopened on September 1st. On July 24, the Prime Minister signed a decree putting an end to the pandemic-related containment restrictions. Air and land border reopened on July 25 and July 31, respectively. Normal working hours resumed in public administration starting from August 1st. Policies during the second wave of the pandemic.On December 1, the authorities issued a statement announcing reinforcement of measures, including stricter application of preventive measures (e.g. mandatory wearing of masks, physical distancing, promotion of teleworking, etc.); strengthened monitoring of the pandemic, and enhanced awareness campaigns. On December 18, the authorities re-introduced measures on prohibiting cultural and touristic activities, and public gatherings and events (conferences, workshops, etc.). Universities and other educational institutions were closed during December 22, 2020 - January 25, 2021. On January 25, the measures on prohibiting public gathering were lifted and educational institutions re-opened. On  January 20, the authorities submitted a national strategy for introducing the COVID-19 vaccine. The goal is to vaccinate 20 percent of the population under the COVAX initiative. This will include population over 60 years old, medical workers and population with underlying health conditions. The vaccination campaign is to start in April 2021.National vaccination strategy.In January 2021, the authorities prepared a national strategy for introducing the COVID-19 vaccine. The goal is to vaccinate 20 percent of the population under the COVAX initiative that would require around 8.2 million doses of vaccine to cover the population over 60 years old, medical workers and population with underlying health conditions. The vaccination campaign is to start in April 2021, with the first batch of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine to arrive to Bamako on March 5, 2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government has updated its medical response plan to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and strengthen its medical care capacity, in collaboration with the World Health Organization, now costed at about 0.6 percent of GDP (including bonuses to health workers), and the World Bank in terms of medical equipment (respirators, quarantine facilities, etc.). The government\u2019s social measures to support the most vulnerable households included the setup of a special fund to provide targeted income support and a mass distribution of grain and food for livestock to the poorest households, the supply of electricity and water free of charge to the consumers in the social tranche for the months of April and May 2020, a 3-month exemption from VAT on electricity and water tariffs, and a 3-month exemption from customs duties on the import of basic food (rice and milk). A package of economic measures was also launched to ease liquidity constraints on ailing firms, including an SME-support guarantee fund, clearing the budget spending float, granting tax deferral and relief to ease liquidity constraints on the hardest-hit companies, especially in the hospitality sector (hotels, restaurants, transportation). On April 27, Heads of States of the West-Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) declared a temporary suspension of the WAEMU growth and stability Pact setting six convergence criteria, including the 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit rule. This temporary suspension will allow member-countries to raise their overall fiscal deficit temporarily and use the additional external support provided by donors in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The Heads of States' Declaration sets a clear expectation that fiscal consolidation will resume once the crisis is over.    Preliminary estimates suggest that around 95 percent of the planned COVID-19-related spending has been implemented and committed in 2020.  The government has fully executed the support to electricity and water SOEs and the food distribution plans, and around 76 percent of COVID prevention and medical support spending. 100 percent of the household income support has been committed but most transfers are only expected to be made in 2021 as potential beneficiaries are being identified. The slow implementation, in part, was also due to the post-coup sanctions that have cut the de facto authorities\u2019 access to government\u2019s Treasury Single Account at the BCEAO, hence no payments/expenditures could be made out of those accounts until the sanctions were lifted on October 5 after the nomination of a transitional government. With the onset of the second wave, the transitional authorities re-introduced VAT exemption on utility bills for December 2020 and January 2021. The additional measures are estimated at around 0.03 percent of GDP. To provide further support to the economy and to strengthen medical capacity, new policy measures at around 0.8 percent of GDP have been budgeted for 2021.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks\u2019 demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity. In April 2020, the BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25 basis points lower than before the crisis. In June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO also: (i) an extended the collateral framework to access central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private companies; (ii) set up a framework inviting banks and microfinance institutions to accommodate demands from solvent customers with COVID-19-related repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period up to end-2020 debt service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims as non performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of 3-month \"COVID-19 T-Bills\" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The amount of such special T-bills initially issued by Mali amounted to CFAF 88 bn (0.9 percent of GDP), with some rollover possibility through similar bonds benefitting from a refinancing rate equivalent to the prevailing monetary policy rate but to be all paid back by end-2020. The BCEAO has launched in February 2021 a special 6-month refinancing window at the floor of the interest rate corridor to help WAEMU governments meet COVID recovery funding needs. Through this special window banks shall be able to refinance all bonds with maturity of 3 years or more governments currently plan to issue on the regional financial market in 2021. The amount of bonds eligible to the new refinancing window for country Mali is equivalent to 5.2 percent of projected 2021 GDP. The new refinancing window is expected to remain in place for the term of the eligible bonds issued in 2021. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basel II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead of 2022 initially planned. In addition, in June 2020, the West African Development Bank (BOAD) created a CFAF 100 billion window for extending 5 to 7 year refinancing of banks\u2019 credit to SMEs in the eight WAEMU member countries. In December 2020, the BCEAO encouraged WAEMU banks to refrain from distributing dividends with a view to strengthening their capital buffers in anticipation of the impact of the COVID crisis on asset quality.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top MaltaBackground. The government responded swiftly to mobilize the healthcare system and implement containment measures, including travel restrictions, social distancing, closures of schools, childcare centers, bars, restaurants, sport centers, non-essential shops and services, as well as the cancellation of all mass gatherings. Malta reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 7, 2020. The number of active and new cases decreased from the first peak in April. However, it started to rise again from end-July and has remained above the previous peak.Reopening of the economy. Containment measures were gradually lifted with the reopening of certain non-essential shops started on May 4, 2020. More activities and businesses have been allowed to open since May 22, including restaurants, hair salons, hotels, funerals, individual sports, outdoor pools and gatherings of up to 6 people. Most remaining measures have been lifted on June 5.

On April 5th, President L\u00f3pez Obrador outlined his Government\u2019s policy priorities to combat the economic effects provoked by the spread of the disease, including increased health expenditure.Mexico\u2019s highly open economy was affected by a reduction in export demand on top of the impact of lockdown measures. It was also hit by the decline in oil prices and global market volatility. The local government bond market has seen cumulative non-resident outflows of around US$13.4 billion (1.3 percent of 2020 GDP), the 10-year dollar credit spread widened from 132 bps to 423 bps at peak on April 28th but has since declined to 150 bps for the sovereign and from 377 bps to 487 bps for Pemex after peaking at 1188 bps, while the peso has depreciated by 10 percent relative to the US$ (as of March 4 2021; compared to February 20th, 2020), down from a peak of 26 percent.Reopening of the economy: On May 14, the government announced plans to begin the normalization of economic activities, including a green-yellow-orange-red color system for states to represent the extent of activities allowed (e.g. states with most active cases are red and would remain in a forced quarantine), the resumption of school and labor activities in municipalities free of infection, and the addition of construction, mining, and transport equipment manufacturing as essential activities. Restrictions rose in December and January but have been declining as the holiday COVID wave declines. For the weeks of March 1-14, no states are in the red category, 10 states are in the orange category including most of the largest states, 20 are in the yellow category, and 2 are in the green category.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021:Fiscal\t    The Government implemented a set of measures aimed to: 1) ensure that the Ministry of Health has sufficient financial resources and does not face red-tape in procuring medical equipment and materials; 2) support households and firms; 3) boost credit, strengthen liquidity and guarantee the proper functioning of financial markets; 4) accelerate the tender processes for public expenditure to ensure full budget execution.

The list of countries with red zone classification was updated on March 1 and incoming passengers will need to observe 14-day quarantine. On December 7, the Republic of Moldova with support from WHO and UNICEF presented its request to the COVAX Platform to ensure the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine. The Extraordinary Public Health Commission approved the National Vaccination Plan on January 13,2021; On February 27, 2021, a consignment of 21,600 doses of COVID-19 vaccines was delivered to Moldova from Romania to support the country's response to the pandemic. Key Policy Responses as of March 5, 2021Fiscal\t    A comprehensive fiscal package has been adopted as per two 2020 State Budget Amendments, following several targeted fiscal measures to support businesses and vulnerable households, such as expanding unemployment benefits and strengthening existing targeted social assistance, tax relief for sectors affected by state-imposed restrictions, delaying tax payment deadlines to mid-2020, suspending tax audits and other controls, and increasing state budget allocations to the budget emergency and health funds and to a mortgage guarantee program. Discussions on the 2021 Budget are underway and the draft envisages more support to the health sector.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The National Bank of Moldova decreased the base rate applied to the main short-term monetary policy operations to 2.65 percent, decreased the required reserve ratio in local currency to the level of 32.0 percent, while the required reserves ratio in freely convertible currencies increased to the level of 30.0 percent. These measures were taken with a view to support the economy, ease liquidity conditions, and enhance financial system resilience. Financial sector policy has thus far focused on providing credit institutions with flexibility to manage near-term payment obligations of individuals facing financial difficulties without recourse to adjustment of prudential provisions, including in cases of loan rescheduling.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The National Bank of Moldova announced that it stands ready to intervene in the foreign exchange market to counter disorderly market pressures and excessive exchange rate volatility.    Back to Top MongoliaBackground. When COVID-19 hit Mongolia in early 2020, the government immediately declared the state of high alert and took prompt actions to contain its spread through social distancing and closure of the border with China. Limited COVID-19 cases have been sporadically reported from individuals repatriated abroad. Domestic transmissions of the virus were reported in early November for the first time. Since then, the government has reinforced stringent measures, including renewed nationwide lockdowns. Daily new cases remain low (around 0.1 per 100K people). The country aims at getting 60 percent of population vaccinated by the end of 2021. As of March 4, about 11,000 individuals were vaccinated.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    On February 19, 2020, MNT17 billion (0.04 percent of GDP) of additional health spending Was approved and allocated to epidemic prevention and control, acquisition of medical supply and medical staff overtime salaries. This measure is financed by a Government Reserve Fund withdrawal.    \t    On March 27, a comprehensive set of fiscal measures for consideration was proposed by the cabinet to protect vulnerable household and businesses and to support the economy. These include: (i) tax exemptions on several imported food and medical items; (ii) increase of child allowance and unemployment benefits; (iii) exemptions on CIT, PIT, and social security contributions until the end of September; and (iv) an increase in credit guarantees to SMEs and soft loans from the development bank to cashmere producers. On April 13, Parliament approved tax exemption measures as proposed by the cabinet.    \t    On May 6, a second package of fiscal measures (amounting to roughly 2 percent of GDP) was announced to protect the vulnerable groups. These include: (i) a further increase in child money allowance; (ii) a scale-up of food stamp allowance; and (iii) an increase in social welfare pensions for the elderly, disabled, dwarfs, orphans, and single parents with more than 4 children. The government has indicated they expect to fully offset these measures with expenditure cuts.    \t    On August 5, the government announced the extension or modification of COVID-19 fiscal measures. Extending measures through the end of the year include: (i) child money allowance; (ii) CIT exemption; (iii) exemption of rent income tax; and (iv) exemption of customs duty and VAT on certain imported goods. Modification of measures includes: (i) increased food stamp allowance; (ii) increased social welfare pensions; and (iii) reduced social security contribution. A supplementary budget to contain these measures (amounting to about 7\u00bd percent of GDP in total including the previous measures) was approved by Parliament on August 28.    \t    On November 18, the government announced further extension of selected COVID-19 fiscal measures through end-June 2021, in response to potential adverse effects of the country\u2019s lockdown associated with domestic transmissions, These include: (i) exemption of rent income tax; and (ii) exemption of customs duty and VAT on certain imported goods.    \t    On December 2, the government announced COVID-19 measures, which include (i) MNT3 billion financial support to selected provinces affected by domestic transmissions; (ii) temporary exemption of tax penalties and charges on late payment; and (iii) coal briquette price subsidy to ger districts in Ulaanbaatar City.    \t    On December 13, the government announced COVID-19 measures which will be financed by selected state-owned enterprises. The measures include (i) waiving utility (electricity, heating, water, and waste disposal) payments to business entities and households; and (ii) reducing the price of coal briquettes by 75 percent.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 11, the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) (i) reduced the policy rate by 100 bps to 10 percent; (ii) reduced the MNT reserve requirement of banks by 200 basis points to 8.5 percent; and (iii) narrowed the policy rate corridor to \u00b11 percent. The lower reserve requirement released MNT 324 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) of additional liquidity in the banking system. On March 18, the BOM and the Financial Regulatory Commission implemented temporary financial forbearance measures on prudential requirements, loan classifications, and restructuring standards.    \t    On April 13, the BOM: (i) cut the policy rate by 100 bps to 9 percent and (ii) allowed existing consumption loan borrowers to defer their principal and interest payments by up to 12 months.        \t    The Anti-Pandemic Law approved by Parliament on April 30 compels the BOM to implement nonconventional measures, including a SOE-issued bond purchase to compensate banks\u2019 profit loss related to pension-backed loan cancellation, short-term concessional financing to gold miners, and temporary resumption of the subsidized mortgage program which ended at end-2019. At end-December 2020, such BOM\u2019s nonconventional quasi-fiscal operations amounted to MNT825 billion (2 percent of GDP).    \t    On August 7, the BOM extended temporary financial forbearance measures, which had been supposed to expire at end-July, through the end of the year.     \t    On September 14, the BOM cut the policy rate by 100 bps to 8 percent.    \t    On November 23, the BOM cut the policy rate by 200 bps to 6 percent and lowered MNT reserve requirement by 250 bps to 6 percent, and further extended financial forbearance measures through end-June 2021.    \t    In January 2021, the Anti-Pandemic Law, which had been supposed to expire at end-2020, was extended until end-June 2021. As a result, the BOM\u2019s quasi-fiscal operations, notably subsidized mortgage program and concessional financing to gold miners, have been extended as well.    \t    On February 10, 2021, the Prime Minister announced a three-year stimulus package, so-called comprehensive economic recovery plan for 2021-23, which is expected to be largely financed by the BOM.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    In line with the closure of border to China, most mineral exports to China, accounting for about 90 percent of total exports, have been suspended since February 10, though coal exports started to gradually resume on March 15,2020.    Back to Top MontenegroBackground:The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 17, 2020. On May 25, the Prime Minister announced that Montenegro was the first coronavirus-free country in Europe. In mid-June, the virus returned and the government declared an epidemic in the entire country on July 22.  On July 15, the EU removed Montenegro from its safe list of countries, and non-essential travel by Montenegrin citizens to the EU member states is not allowed.  Unified epidemiological measures have been reintroduced throughout the country in late November. Current measures in force include a nationwide curfew from 10pm to 5am, restricted hours of retail and hospitality facilities, a ban on mass gatherings and gatherings in residential buildings, and a prohibition on visits to patients undergoing hospital treatment and people accommodated in social or childcare institutions. Additional measures have been introduced in several municipalities.Reopening of the economy: Following the initial phases of the virus, a phased reopening of the economy began on May 4, 2020, and borders were reopened selectively. A decision was taken on June 30 to open borders to residents of all EU member states without additional conditions, with the \u201cgreen list\u201d was further updated on August 3 to include Russia and Azerbaijan.  From Aug 15, the land borders with Serbia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina were reopened.  On January 12, 2021, the requirement for a negative PCR test was removed for all citizens and foreigners, though reintroduced on January 26 for those entering Montenegro from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (those without are required to quarantine for 14 days).Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The Montenegrin government announced a fourth economic package on January 28, 2021 of EUR 163 million, which is expected to cover 100,000 citizens. Measures include (i) wage subsidies (with an expanded list of eligible sectors); (ii) one-off support to the vulnerable population; (iii) tax deferrals; (iv) support for new employment; (v) one-off support for firms to implement e-fiscalization; (vi) domestic travel vouchers for health and education workers; and additional measures for the tourism, catering, and agriculture and fisheries sectors. The measures are aimed at maintaining employment levels, improving liquidity, increasing the number of tourists, the stability of agriculture, as well as supporting the vulnerable population.    This follows three packages that were adopted in 2020:    The third package (adopted by the Government on July 23) comprised of short- and long-term measures worth EUR 1.22 billion over four years (EUR 281.2 million in 2020); however, implementation has been reportedly low. Short-term measures in this package include (i) support to the tourism sector (such as interest subsidies on loans and the reduction of VAT from 21 percent to 7 percent in the hospitality industry), (ii) interest subsidies for the agriculture sector; (iii) programs for improving competitiveness; (iv) wage subsidies; and (v) one-off support to veterans and pensioners.    The second package of economic measures was approved on April 24 and included (i) wage subsidies for employees in sectors that are closed because of the pandemic, employees who are unable to work due to childcare for children aged under 11, or people who have to be self-isolated and quarantined; (ii) wage subsidies of newly employed workers in SMEs for six months if these workers are registered as unemployed; (iii) state bodies and state-owned companies will impose a six-month moratorium on the enforcement of claims for companies that are not operating due to the pandemic; (iv) energy firms will exempt the fixed portion of electricity bills for businesses that have stopped operating due to the pandemic-related lockdown; (v) the state utility EPCG will double its electricity subsidies for vulnerable households; (vi) assistance to the agriculture and fisheries sector, including one-off assistance to fishermen and payments for the contributions of insured agricultural workers; and (vii) one-time assistance of EUR 50 to all persons recorded as unemployed in the Employment Agency of Montenegro and who did not receive any compensation.    Previously announced measures include: (i) the removal of the excise on medical alcohol sold in pharmacies; (ii) the delay of tax payments and social security contributions; (iii) the creation of a new Investment Development Fund (IRF) credit line of EUR 120 million to improve the liquidity of entrepreneurs; (iv) the deferral of lease payments for state-owned real estate; (v) advance payments to contractors for capital projects; (vi) one-off financial assistance to low-income pensioners and social welfare beneficiaries in the amount of EUR 50; (vii) and an increase in the March 2020 wages of healthcare workers by up to 15 percent.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank announced a sixth package of support measures on March 1, 2021. This package focuses on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and citizens. It expands the list of eligible sectors for loan beneficiaries entitled to a moratorium, approval and restructuring of loans with preferential regulatory treatment. Loan beneficiaries whose earnings have reduced by more than 10 percent due to the pandemic may be extended a repayment period by a maximum of five years. Banks can also agree on a longer-term when restructuring and classifying loans to natural persons, including those when the loan is not secured by collateral. The extension period may be up to five years providing the maturity does not exceed 10 years. The fifth package of Central Bank support measures was announced on  October 22, 2020, aimed at helping the most affected citizens. The Central Bank introduced a six-month moratorium on the repayment of loans for citizens who have lost their jobs after March 31 due to the COVID-19 crisis and have not delayed the repayment of their loans by more than 90 days before end-2019, and whose loans have not been classified as non-performing by end-2019. Other measures include a loan restructuring for citizens whose wages have fallen by at least 10 percent due to the pandemic, and a change in the amount of demand deposits included in the calculation of due liabilities (20 percent instead of 30 percent).    This follows the announcement of July 30 that banks are obliged to grant a moratorium to borrowers from two priority sectors: tourism, as well as agriculture, forestry, and fishing. The moratorium can be used in the period of September 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021, and is available to borrowers in these sectors who are not past due in loan repayments for more than 90 days and whose loans were not classified as non-performing assets as of December 31, 2019. Banks are also allowed to treat approved or restructured loans in these sectors as loans from category \u201cA\u201d during the duration specified above.    Earlier, on May 20, the Central Bank announced that banks can approve a new moratorium for borrowers facing difficulties due to the pandemic. Banks may also, under clearly specified conditions, approve the restructuring of loans, including unsecured cash loans. A previously announced moratorium on loan repayments for a period of up to 90 days (announced on March 17) was available to all borrowers.     The central bank has also announced measures to temporarily prohibit banks from paying dividends to shareholders, except in the form of equity, and to allow banks to increase exposures to a person or group of related parties beyond the prescribed exposure limits (25 percent of the bank\u2019s own funds), with prior central bank approval.     Other measures include the decision to halve the fee that banks are required to pay for withdrawing reserve requirement liquidity (announced on May 7) and the reduction of the reserve requirement rate by 2 percentage points (announced May 12).     The Deposit Protection Fund has also increased its credit line with the EBRD to EUR 50 million (from EUR 30 million).     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.

Morocco reported its first confirmed cases of COVID-19 on March 2, 2020. The government created an emergency committee chaired by the Minister of Finance in charge of monitoring the situation. The authorities declared a state of health emergency until August 10, 2020, initially, adopted containment measures, including quarantine, suspended all international passenger flights, forbid all public gatherings, and closed mosques, schools, universities, restaurants, cafes, and hammams. The authorities also decided to regulate prices and control the distribution channels of facemasks and hydro alcoholic gels.Reopening of the economy. The authorities announced partial reopening measures starting June 11, 2020. Most businesses are authorized to resume, including dine-in at caf\u00e9 and restaurants, theaters and hammams. The authorities eased restrictions in most rural areas and small towns, resuming operations of public transport and removing restrictions to movement and travel, including for domestic flights. International borders were reopened on July 14, 2020 for Moroccan nationals leaving abroad and foreigners established in Morocco. However, the increase in the number of cases in late July required to tighten restrictions in a number of urban areas that remain under a partial lockdown and now experience new restrictions to movements. Additional containment measures\u2014including a national night curfew\u2014were reinstated on December 23, 2020, initially for 3 weeks and later extended till mid-March 2021. Large gatherings continue to be banned and wedding parties are not allowed in Morocco. The government also extended the state of health emergency until April 10, 2021.COVID-19 Vaccine distribution plans. Morocco started a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign on January 28, 2021. The campaign aims at covering 80 percent of Moroccan population over 18 years old (about 25 million people).  The campaign is relying on Morocco's network of primary health care institutions and mobile clinics. Priority is given to citizens in the frontline such as health workers, authority agents, security forces, teachers, elders and people with underlying health conditions. As of March 3, 2021, about 3.7 million persons have already received the first doses of the vaccine. The second dose vaccination, which started on February 19, 2021, has already covered 360,000 persons.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities have created a special fund dedicated to the management of the pandemic, of about 3 percent of GDP financed by the government and by voluntary contributions from public and private entities which will be tax deductible. This fund covers the costs of upgrading medical facilities and support businesses and households impacted by the pandemic. Businesses with less than 500 employees made temporarily idle and experiencing a reduction in turnover of more than 50 percent were authorized to defer social contribution payments until June 30. Their employees who become temporarily unemployed and are registered with the pension fund received 2,000 dirhams a month and were allowed put off debt payments until June 30. In April, 2020 almost 1 million workers from 134,000 companies were eligible to these transfers. Companies and households can also defer income tax payment until September 30, 2020. In addition, the government has decided to accelerate payment to its suppliers to support businesses. The government has extended social transfers to employees temporarily unemployed and further deferred social contribution payments for some sectors (including tourism) until end-March 2021.    The government also took measures to support households working in the informal sector. Households\u2019 benefiting from the non-contributory health insurance (RAMED) received a monthly mobile payment of DRH 800-1200 (USD 80-120) from April, depending on households\u2019 composition. Other households which do not benefit from RAMED can claim cash support by registering online. In April, 85 percent of eligible households in the informal sectoral were covered. The government postponed the deadline for personal income tax filing from end-April to end-June 2020 and provided a tax exemption for additional compensation paid by firms to employees in the formal sector up to a limit of 50 percent of the average monthly net salary. A decree-law adopted on April 6, 2020 authorizes the government to increase external borrowing beyond the ceiling approved in the 2020 Budget Act.    On August 6,2020 the authorities announced a plan to sustain the economic recovery and employment levels. The plan envisages the mobilization of DRH 120 billion, mainly in the form of credit guarantees to firms and funding for a newly -created \u201cFund for Strategic Investment\u201d, which will finance investment projects (including PPPs) and sustain the capital of firms that needs equity injections to develop their business.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The central bank reduced the policy rate by 75 bps to 1.5 percent since March 2020. To support companies, loan payments are suspended for small and medium-sized businesses and self-employed people until June 30. To reduce volatility, the Capital Market Authority decided to revise downwards the maximum variation thresholds applicable to financial instruments listed in Casablanca Stock Exchange.    Given growing demand for liquidity support in the banking system (both in DRH and in EUR/USD), Bank al-Maghrib decided on a three-pronged approach to increase liquidity provision to the banking sector: (i) expand the range of collateral accepted for repos and credit guarantees to include public and private debt instruments (including mortgages), (ii) increase and lengthen central bank refinancing operations to support banking credit to (V)SMEs, and (iii) provide FX swaps to domestic banks. In addition, Bank al-Maghrib decided to bring reserve requirements to zero (from 2 percent) to increase liquidity provision, and to ease refinancing of banks\u2019 contribution to microcredit institutions and credit unions.    On March 29, 2020 the central bank decided the following prudential and regulatory measures to support the banking sector: (i) Banks are authorized to go below the 100 percent liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) until end-June 2019; (ii) Provisioning requirements are suspended for loans\u2019 benefiting from a temporary payment moratorium until end-June 2019; (iii) The capital conservation buffer (CCB) is reduced by 50 bps for one year. In addition, the central bank has call on banks to suspend dividend payments for FY2019. In February 2021, the central bank extended the reduction in the capital conservation buffer until June 2022.    On April 24, 2020 the Moroccan insurance supervisor relaxed some provisioning requirements to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the insurance sector.    In addition, Morocco has established a funding for lending facility (Damane Oxygene) which provides loans to (V)SMEs at subsidized interest rates with a guarantee of 95 percent from the Central Guarantee Fund. On May 15, this program was extended to end-2020, and collateral requirements were removed to improve access for (V)SMEs.Some 50,000 companies have benefitted from this facility, for a total outstanding amount of 1.6 percent of GDP.    In addition, the government will provide interest-free loan of up to dirham 15,000 to self-employed, with a repayment period of three years and a grace period of one year. The government also cancelled capitalized interests on mortgages (up to DRH 3000 per month) and consumer loans (up to DRH 1500 per month) accrued from March to June 2020 for all households experiencing income losses.    On May 21, 2020 the government announced a post crisis facility (Damane Relance) to support businesses that will provide financing to cover working capital needs at subsidized interest rate (with a 4 percent maximum interest rate, equivalent to the current policy rate + 200 basis points). A sovereign guarantee of 95 percent will be provided to SMEs, for an equivalent of up to ten percent of annual turnover. Larger firms will benefit from a sovereign guarantee of 80 to 90 percent of the outstanding loan, which will be capped at one month of turnover for most sectors. Firms will have 7 years to repay with a 2-year grace period. In addition, the government will guarantee state-owned enterprises\u2019 loan that will be provided by banks exclusively to repay their suppliers. At end-October, banks provided loans worth about 2.5 percent of GDP to about 25,000 firms under this facility. On October 5, the government launched a new facility to provide financing to real estate firms (Damane Relance Promotion Immobili\u00e8re). On January 6, 2021 the government extended the Damane Relance facility until end-March 2021.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    As part of a gradual and orderly transition to a more flexible exchange rate regime, the authorities broadened the dirham\u2019s fluctuation band to +/- 5 percent (from +/- 2.5 percent) on March 6, 2020.     On April 7, 2020 the Moroccan authorities purchased all available resources (about US$ 3 billion or 240 percent of quota and about 3 percent of GDP) under the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) arrangement. This purchase will help the authorities limit the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and allow Morocco to maintain an adequate level of official reserves to mitigate pressures on the balance of payments. In January, 2021 the Moroccan made an early repayment of about SDR651 million or USD936 million and about 0.8 percent of GDP.    Back to Top MozambiqueBackground. Mozambique reported its first COVID-19 case on March 22, 2020. Following the peak in September 2020, the daily Covid-19 cases deaths spiked again and reached the highest peak in February 2021. As of March 1, 59.607 (1.881 cases per million inhabitants), of which 70 percent recovered and, 653 deaths were confirmed (about 21 deaths per million inhabitants). The government plans to vaccinate 6.4 million people (20 percent of population) by December 2022.Early on, the government took several actions to contain an outbreak of COVID-19 in the country, stating that \u201cprevention remains the best strategy.\u201d These actions included (i) the shutdown of schools form pre-school up to university, (ii) the ban of all gatherings \u2013 including religious services - of more than 50 persons, (iii) the ban and cancellation of all entry visas, (iv) a 14-day quarantine for all travelers entering Mozambique and (v) the creation of a technical and scientific committee to advise the government. The government has made it mandatory to wear face masks in public places. On March 30, President Nyusi declared a state of emergency for the month of April, extended three times (until July 30). On August 5, the President declared a second state of emergency (after 3 consecutive months of State of Emergency allowed by the Constitution) to further halt the spread of the COVID-19. The measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus now include: (i) imposing limitations on movements within the country and border entries; (ii) ban on all types of public or private events; (iii) closure or reduction of non-essential shops; (iv) monitoring prices of essential goods for preventing price gouging; (v) redirecting the industrial sector toward the production of goods necessary for the prevention and mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic; (vi) introducing employee rotation in the workspace; and (vii) ensuring the adoption of preventative actions in all institutions, public or private. Reopening of the economy. The government announced the reopening of schools for 12th grade (pre-university) and teacher training colleges. The new state of emergency envisages gradual easing of restrictions in three phases starting on August 18 with low risk activities including reopening of universities and other senior level colleges and religious gathering with no more than 50 people. In October, the government introduced additional requirements for firms to ensure readiness to manage COVID cases. Mid-December, the government further eased restrictions, allowing bars to reopen, and increasing the upper limit for private gatherings. However, due to the steady increase of cases, the government tightened the Covid-19 measures, on February 04, including a ban of private social events, conferences and religious services, closure of schools, and a curfew of Maputo City and Province, where about 70% of active cases originate.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Early on, the government has asked Mozambique\u2019s development partners for US$ 700 million to help deal with the economic impact of the pandemic. This fiscal package would finance (i) temporary and well-targeted tax exemptions to support families and the health sector (VAT and import tariff exemptions on food, medicine and medical equipment), and (ii) higher spending to respond to the health crisis and humanitarian needs, including higher health related spending on goods and services, and higher cash transfers and subsidies to the poorest households as well as micro-businesses and SMEs. In May, the government extended the VAT exemption on sugar, vegetable oil and soap until the end of the year. Some emergency spending was delayed by the government due to particular care to following appropriate budgetary procedure and putting in place a revised budget, which has been approved by the general assembly in early November.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    To ease liquidity conditions, on March 16, the central bank reduced reserve requirements by 150 basis points for both foreign currency and domestic currency deposits (to 11.5 percent and 34.5 percent respectively). On March 22, it announced measures to support financial markets and encourage prudent loan restructuring by: (i) introducing a foreign currency credit line for institutions participating in the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market, in the amount of US$ 500 million, for a period of nine months; and (ii) waiving the constitution of additional provisions by credit institutions and financial companies in cases of renegotiations of the terms and conditions of the loans, before their maturity, for clients affected by the pandemic, until December 31. On March 30, the central bank announced measures to ease payment system transactions and liquidity conditions by: (i) lowering fees and charges for digital transactions through commercial banks, mobile banking and e-currency, for a period of three months, and (ii) waiving specific provision on foreign currency loans, until December 31. The central bank reduced the policy rate by 150 bps to 11.25 percent on April 16. On April 29, the central bank introduced the requirement for exporters to exchange 30 percent of FX proceeds into domestic currency. In 2020, the central bank reduced the policy rate by 250 bps to 10.25 and lifted the twice a week access restriction on the standing lending facility introduced in October 2016. However, with exception of FX conversion requirement, the measures were waived and the central increased its policy rate by 300 basis points in January 2021 to 13.25 percent.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The metical has been allowed to adjust flexibly and has depreciated by about 20 percent against the US dollar since early March 2020. No major capital flow movements have taken place, while international reserves have been increasing over the past months.     Back to Top MyanmarMyanmar has 141,984 confirmed COVID-19 cases(3,199 deaths and   131,539 discharged) as of  March 4, 2021. Local transmissions were rapidly increased in Rakhine State and Yangon Region during September 2020-January 2021. Semi lockdown with stay-at-home instruction was issued for entire Rakhine State starting August 27, 2020 (and now lifted on March 1, 2021) and for all townships except the isolated Cocogyun Township (located on a far island) in Yangon Region starting September 21, 2020. Factories, especially in the garment sector, instructed to close temporarily until October 21 was relaxed back to October 12, 2020 once they met Grade-A in preparation for virus prevention measures. Work from home policies are in place for all other organizations in the Yangon Region. The economy has been deeply affected by the outbreak, with sharp declines in tourist arrivals, supply chain disruptions for the garment sector, and losses for SMEs, which have resulted in large layoffs and factory closures. In response, the government has announced measures to limit the spread of the virus including travel restrictions(including quarantine requirements, suspension of visa issuances and international flights), closure of several land borders, and bans on mass public gatherings. A National Central Committee on Prevention, Control and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus has been established to coordinate the authorities\u2019 response. A second committee, the Control and Emergency Response Committee on COVID-19, was setup on March 30, 2020 to help with stricter administrative measures to control the spread of the virus including quarantining migrant workers coming from neighboring countries. Myanmar government has developed the COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan (CERP) consisting of seven goals, 10 strategies, 36 action plans and 76 actions that cover a range of emergency fiscal and monetary measures. The CERP seeks to mitigate the inevitable economic impact posed by COVID-19 while establishing a foundation to facilitate Myanmar\u2019s rapid economic recovery. In addition, the government is drafting the Myanmar Economic Resilience and Reform Plan (MERRP) to extend the efforts to economic recovery and relief. All instructions (excluding some relaxations) relating COVID-19 prevention and control have been extended to March 31, 2021. Restrictions on visa issuances and international passenger flights have also been extended to March 31, 2021. Domestic flights resumed on December 16, 2020.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Revenue measures.

A temporary revision to the formula for calculating the liquidity ratio, increasing the weight of government treasury bonds with a remaining maturity of more than one year from 50 percent to 90 percent, has also been extended till March 31, 2021. On April 23, CBM announced the extension of the deadline for compliance with four prudential regulations (enacted in July 2017) by three years from end-August 2020 to end-August 2023 to enable banks to support the economy cope with the impact of COVID-19.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The kyat has been allowed to adjust flexibly, with limited rules-based intervention to manage excessive exchange rate volatility.     NBack to Top NamibiaBackground. Namibia reported its first case of COVID19 on March 14, 2020. Cases have increased rapidly recently and have caused one of the main ports to be temporarily closed (due to a lockdown in the region). The total number of cases remains low. The government declared a national state of emergency and adopted containment measures, including social distancing, work from home initiatives (including suspension of the parliament for 21 days), lockdowns in some regions, and closures of all points of entry and comprehensive restrictions on cross-border travel. The domestic travel lockdown was relaxed on May 4th (so people can travel inside the country with some constrains on number of vehicle occupants), points of entry remain closed, except for the transportation of goods. The authorities further eased restrictions on travel by removing the obligation to quarantine for tourists with negative PCR test result. The government has paid N$29,272,320 (US$1,626,240) to acquire vaccine doses enough to vaccine 20 percent of the population through the COVAX Facility; and signed a Financial Commitment Agreement for the remaining US$9,096,780. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    On April 1 the government launched the Economic Stimulus and Relief Package to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 (8 billion Namibian Dollars, or 4.25 percent of GDP), including i) expenditure measures of 2.6 bn for health, wage subsidies for affected sectors, and income grants; and ii) guarantees of up to 2.3 bn to support low interest loans for small and agricultural businesses, and individuals. On June 15, the government announced it will extend the deadline of submitting Individual Income Tax returns from June 30 to September 30 (not the payment of taxes due, which is still June 30). In August the Bank of Namibia announced it will participate in the operationalization of the loan guarantee program, providing 50 million Namibian dollars in capital targeted to SME credit.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The central bank reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent on August 19, 2020 (250 bps total since the state of emergency was declared). On March 26, the central bank announced changes in the financial sector and its regulatory setting, including i) allowing banks to grant loan payment moratorium (payment holidays) ranging from 6 to 24 months, ii) regulatory and policy relief changes, such as relaxing the determination on liquidity risk management, reducing the capital conservation buffer rate to 0 percent for at least 24 months to support banking institutions to supply credit, and postponing the effective date of implementation of the 25 percent single borrower limit and concentration risk limit.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top NauruAs of March 4, 2021, Nauru has no confirmed cases of COVID-19.  It remains one of only 12countries in the world with no confirmed cases, as per the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Tracker. The main impact of the pandemic thus far has been due to travel restrictions and quarantine. Supply chain dislocations have also had an impact as a lower frequency of cargo ships have affected the timely supply of construction and consumption goods. That said, incoming data on fishing license revenues and recent developments suggest that the overall real impact of the pandemic has been relatively mild.The government has imposed a number of containment measures including a near-total ban on entry by air into Nauru which was effective March 16th, 2020. Cargo flights are operating at normal frequency at this time, but subject to strict handling on arrival, including on contact with crew. Screening and quarantine measures have also been in effect since March 16th, 2020 and apply to all passengers on arrival, including a mandatory 14-day stay in approved transition accommodation and further measures for symptomatic cases. On April 9, the Government of Nauru extended the emergency measures to be in force until mid-May. Social distancing measures have been encouraged including limiting or cancelling public gatherings and recommending working arrangements from home where possible.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    While mitigation measures have not been needed, containment efforts have been sizeable and expenditures on keeping the national airline and other SOEs afloat have been significant at about 8 percent of 2019 GDP. Initial estimates from the health and immigration department suggest an estimated AUD 3.5 million for health expenditures and isolation costs per 500 individuals (approximately 4 percent of the population), AUD  5.1 million on liquidity injections to Nauru Airlines, an estimated AUD 0.5 million in budget support to SOEs in managing inventory from limited freight and cargo services. The authorities have reprioritized expenditures and drawn down on cash buffers and general reserves to support the fiscal measures, including necessary medical expenditures. Apart from containment and mitigation, the government has also used its cash buffers for the repatriation of Nauruans abroad. As of March 4, 2021, the authorities have implemented a testing regime for COVID-19 and reduced the mandated time in quarantine, alleviating some of the budgetary implications of containment.  The ADB has approved a US$5 million policy-based grant to support public investment management, fiscal sustainability in Nauru ; and to help the Government of Nauru improve the management of public expenditure and national infrastructure, as well as the governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).    Monetary and macro-financial\t    No measures.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top NepalBackground. Nepal\u2019s first confirmed COVID-19 case was on January 23, 2020, and the country continues to see a gradual increase in the number of confirmed cases. At end-March, the authorities imposed a nationwide lockdown, a ban on domestic and international flights, and a closure of land border crossings. The government lifted the national lockdown on July 22, 2020 but has since had to reimpose some restrictions because of rapidly rising Covid-19 cases. International flights resumed on September 2, 2020 and domestic flights and long-haul public transport services resumed on September 17. On November 13, the government further relaxed restrictions by opening tourist sites. Effective from December 23, 2020 until further notice, the Government of Nepal has restricted entry of passengers originating from or transiting through the United Kingdom due to concerns about the new strain of the corona virus. The restrictions on land border crossings, implemented at the onset of the pandemic, are gradually being eased. On January 27, 2021, the Government of Nepal launched the first phase of the COVID-19 vaccination drive starting with the health and other frontline workers in all seven provinces.Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Measures announced March 30, 2020. Health spending will be increased, including by providing additional insurance coverage to all medical personnel fighting the coronavirus, importing additional medical supplies (with duty on said items eliminated), and setting up quarantine centers and temporary hospitals. Social assistance will be strengthened by providing those most vulnerable with daily food rations, subsidizing utility bills for low-usage customers, extending tax-filing deadlines, and taking measures to partially compensate those in the formal sector for lost wages in the event of job loss.    Measure announced April 26, 2020. Informal sector workers who have lost their jobs due to the ongoing crisis will be given the opportunity to participate in public-works projects for a subsistence wage or receive 25 percent of local daily wage should they choose not to participate.    Measures announced May 28, 2020. In the budget speech for fiscal year 2020/21, Finance Minister Khatiwada announced additional measures in the areas of healthcare (the establishment of additional hospital facilities), business-support (a lending program for cottage, small and medium-sized enterprises and those in the tourism sector), and job-creation (labor-intensive in the construction sector, and training for work in manufacturing and services sectors). In addition, the existing child grant (social support program) will be expanded by an additional 11 districts to cover 25 districts total.      Monetary and macro-financial\t    Measures announced on March 29, 2020. To provide liquidity to the financial system, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) lowered its cash reserve ratio from 4 to 3 percent and reduced the interest rate on the standing liquidity facility rate from 6 to 5 percent. The NRB is no longer requiring banks to build up the 2 percent countercyclical capital buffer that was due in July 2020. The NRB temporarily relaxed reporting norms and announced that bank and financial institutions will not be charged or penalized for their non-compliance with regulatory and supervisory requirements in April. The size of the Refinance Fund has been increased to provide subsidized funding for banks willing to lend at a concessional rate to priority sectors including small and mid-size enterprises affected by the pandemic.     Measures announced on April 29, 2020. The NRB announced that banks will defer loan repayments due in April and May until mid-July. The loan deferral was further extended to January 2021 or later depending on how severely the borrower was affected. For working capital loans, banks will extend the repayment schedule of the amount due during the lockdown up to 60 days. Businesses in affected sectors, if they can show the needs, can qualify for additional working capital loans of up to 10 percent of the approved amount of their existing working capital loans, to be repaid within a year at most. The NRB directed banks to apply lower interest rates (up to 2 percentage points) when calculating the interest due for the period of mid-April to mid-July, applicable to borrowers from affected sectors.    Measures announced on July 17, 2020. The NRB lowered the policy rate from 3.5 percent to 3 percent and announced that additional liquidity support will be made available through longer-term repo facility as necessary. The limit on the loan to value ratio for personal residential home loans was raised to 60 percent and margin natured loans to 70 percent from 65 percent. The limit on banks\u2019 total loans was raised to 85 percent of the sum of core credit and deposits from 80 percent. The NRB requires banks to extend at least 40 percent of their loans to micro, small and mid-size enterprises and borrowers in the agriculture, energy and tourism sectors by mid-July 2024.     Measures announced on December 3, 2020. The NRB announced the collateral auction process will be deferred for some time for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic who have outstanding interest payment of less than six months. The NRB also announced that provisions will be made to allow repayment of foreign currency loans in local currency.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    On April 1, 2020, the authorities imposed a temporary ban on luxury goods imports, such as gold over 10 kg and vehicles worth over US$50 thousand and will temporarily provide a minimum currency exchange facility to qualifying students abroad (less than US$500 per student).    Back to Top The NetherlandsIn response to a first wave of COVID-19 infections in late February 2020, the authorities adopted a series of sanitary measures, including a partial lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. Following a progressive easing of these measures from May 11, and the resurgence in the number of infections, several containment measures with gradual restrictions were announced successively on August 6, August 18, September 25, October 2, October 14, and November 4. A second and more severe wave of infections started late in the summer 2020, prompting the authorities to impose the strictest lockdown since the beginning of the pandemic. All non-essential businesses, schools (with few exceptions), daycares, and many public spaces such as parks and zoos were ordered to close. It is required to work from home unless not possible, avoid public transportations, limit gatherings to one guest from a different household (three during Christmas celebrations), maintain social distancing, and strongly advised not to travel abroad. These restrictions initially in place from December 15 to February 9, were subsequently extended through March 15.  A curfew from 9 pm to 4:30 am was also introduced (from January 23 to March 15). In addition, a negative PCR test is required for travelers to the Netherlands from high-risk countries. The vaccination plan started on January 6, and has targeted healthcare professionals, the elderly, and people with preexisting health conditions, successively. From March 3, containment measures are being relaxed very gradually. For example, secondary schools are allowed to reopen (following the reopening of primary schools earlier), as well as some contact professions such as hairdressers, but under strict conditions. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A series of fiscal measures have been introduced since the start of the pandemic to contain the economic impact of the outbreak. The two first support packages (announced in March and May, respectively) include spending measures estimated at about 31.6 billion euros (4 percent of GDP) in 2020, and covering  (i) compensation of up to 90 percent of labor costs for companies expecting a reduction in revenues of 20 percent or more; (ii) compensation for affected sectors (hospitality, travel, agriculture, culture, and others); (iii) support for entrepreneurs and the self-employed, start-ups and small innovation companies; (iv) scaling up of the short-time working scheme (unemployment benefit compensation available to companies needing to reduce their staff by at least 20 percent), (v) allowances for SMEs to help them finance their fixed costs. In addition, companies can defer tax payments without penalties, and calculate provisional taxes on the basis of expected reduced activity levels. In 2020, revenue shortfalls from deferral of tax payments and other forgone revenue measures are estimated at 17.2 billion euros (or 2.2 percent of GDP). Also, public guarantee schemes (with a ceiling increased by 65 billion euros, or 8.1 percent of GDP), especially for SME loans but also covering large firms, are expanded to help the most vulnerable companies to manage their liquidity problems. A guarantee scheme for supplier credit has also been established. On August 28, the government announced the third support package which primarily aims at expanding and adjusting measures already in place on the expenditure side through June 2021. This new package with an initial envelope of 12.5 billion additional expenditure (of which 1.5 billion of public investment) was further expanded by 3.7 billion on December 9 and 7.6 billion on January 6(totaling about 3 percent of GDP). The authorities also aim at supporting labor mobility toward expanding sectors. Platforms to facilitate job transition are being developed, and public financing is being allocated for training, re-skilling and career counseling. Tax incentives are also introduced to support private investment. The total cost of these programs will depend on demand.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The ECB decided to provide monetary policy support through (i) additional asset purchases of \u20ac120 billion until end-2020 under the existing program (APP), and (ii) providing temporarily additional auctions of the full-allotment, fixed rate temporary liquidity facility at the deposit facility rate and more favorable terms on existing targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) starting between June 2020 and June 2021. Further measures included an additional \u20ac750 billion asset purchase program of private and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, PEPP) until end-2020, an expanded range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase program (CSPP), and relaxation of collateral standards for Eurosystem refinancing operations (MROs, LTROs, TLTROs).    The ECB Banking Supervision allowed significant institutions to operate temporarily below the Pillar 2 Guidance, the capital conservation buffer, and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). In addition, new rules on the composition of capital to meet Pillar 2 Requirement (P2R) were front-loaded to release additional capital. The ECB considers that the appropriate release of the countercyclical buffer by the national macroprudential authorities will enhance its capital relief measures. The ECB Banking Supervision further decided to exercise \u2013 on a temporary basis \u2013 flexibility in the classification requirements and expectations on loss provisioning for non-performing loans (NPLs) that are covered by public guarantees and COVID-19 related public moratoria; it also recommended that banks avoid pro-cyclical assumptions for the determination of loss provisions and opt for the IFRS9 transitional rules. More recently, ECB Banking Supervision asked banks to not pay dividends for the financial years 2019 and 2020 or buy back shares during COVID-19 pandemic, from which the conserved capital should be used to support households, small businesses and corporate borrowers and/or to absorb losses on existing exposures to such borrowers.    In addition, the Dutch central bank has\u00a0reduced systemic buffer requirements for the three largest banks to support bank lending. The central bank is also\u00a0taking measures to provide temporary regulatory relief to less significant banking institutions.Banks under direct supervision of DNB are also allowed to exclude specific central bank exposures when calculating their leverage ratios. Furthermore, the planned introduction of a floor for mortgage loan risk weighting is postponed. In turn, the largest Dutch banks have agreed to\u00a0grant SMEs a six-month postponement of their loan repayments. To protect homeowners, the government and relevant stakeholders agreed that there will be no mortgage foreclosures until July 1st 2020. From July 1st, homeowners facing financial difficulties are encouraged to contact their lender to renegotiate more flexible terms for the period covering the ongoing economic crisis. On October 6, the authorities adopted a law to facilitate debt restructuring for companies facing financial difficulties. The law is intended to prevent bankruptcies.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top New ZealandBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in New Zealand was reported on February 28, 2020. On March 25, 2020, New Zealand moved to Alert Level 4 restrictions after domestic transmission of the virus was found. The authorities declared a state of emergency and implemented strong containment measures, including the closure of all non-essential businesses, cancellation of all events and gatherings, and closure of schools. This followed the closure of all borders to non-residents on March 19, 2020, with returning residents required to enter into two weeks of supervised quarantine since April 10, 2020. After a gradual reopening through Alert Levels 3 (April 28, 2020) and 2 (May 13, 2020), New Zealand moved to Alert Level 1 on June 8, 2020, lifting restrictions on personal movements, gathering, workplaces, and services. The border closure and quarantine requirement remain in place.Following the emergence of new COVID-19 cases, Auckland returned to Alert Level 3 on February 28, 2021, with the rest of New Zealand being at Alert Level 2 for 7 days until March 6, 2021. This follows another lockdown at Alert Level 3 in Auckland, which started on  August 12, 2020, with restrictions being lifted gradually to Alert Level 1 on October 7, 2020.After contracting by 11 percent q/q in Q2, 2020 (production side), New Zealand\u2019s economy recovered quickly, with growth of 14 percent q/q in Q3, 2020, surpassing its pre-COVID level.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government has announced fiscal measures amounting to a total of NZ$62.1 billion (19.2 percent of GDP) through FY2024-25. The total amount includes the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, of which NZ$10.3 billion have been set aside as contingency for a possible resurgence. Announced fiscal measures include: (i) healthcare-related spending, the cost of managed isolation, and the purchasing of vaccines (NZ$3.9 billion or 1.2 percent of GDP); (ii) a permanent increase in social spending to protect vulnerable people (total NZ$2.4 billion or 0.7 percent of GDP); (iii) a wage subsidy to support employers severely affected by the impact of COVID-19 (NZ$14.8 billion or 4.6 percent of GDP); (iv) income relief payments to support people who lost their jobs (NZ$0.6 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP); (v) a permanent change in business taxes to help cashflow (NZ$2.8 billion or 0.9 percent of GDP); (vi) infrastructure investment (NZ$3.8 billion or 1.2 percent of GDP); (vii) transport projects (NZ$0.6 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP); (viii) a temporary tax loss carry-back scheme (NZ$3.1 billion or 1.0 percent of GDP); (ix) support for the aviation sector (NZ$0.6 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP); (x) a tourism recovery package (NZ$0.4 billion or 0.1 percent of GDP); (xi) a government housing program (NZ$0.7 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP); (xii) school infrastructure upgrades (NZ$0.2 billion or 0.1 percent of GDP); and (xiii) government R&D (NZ$0.2 billion or 0.1 percent of GDP) ; and (xiv) training and Flexi-wage subsidies (NZ$0.6 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP). The government has also announced contingent measures for a possible resurgence, including the Resurgence Support Payment and Wage Subsidy Scheme. The government has approved a NZ$0.9 billion debt funding agreement (convertible to equity) with Air New Zealand to ensure continued freight operations, domestic flights and limited international flights. The New Zealand government has introduced NZ$0.2 billion short-term R&D Loan Scheme to support private sector R&D investment. The New Zealand government also will provide loans of up to NZ$100,000 to small businesses that employ 50 or less employees until the end of 2023. In addition, on March 28, 2020, the government announced temporary removal of tariffs on all medical and hygiene imports needed for the COVID-19 response.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    In its February 2021 Board meeting, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept the official cash rate (OCR) at 0.25 percent and maintained unchanged the Large Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) of up to NZ$100 billion and the Funding for Lending Program (FLP).    The OCR was reduced by 75 basis points on March 17, 2020. The FLP started in December 2020, providing banks up to NZ$28 billion of three-year funding priced at 0.25 percent to enable them to lower borrowing costs for firms and households. In August 2020, the RBNZ had expanded the LSAP program to purchase government bonds and Local Government Funding Agency (LGFA) bonds in the secondary market from up to NZ$60 billion for 12 months to a maximum of NZ$100 billion by June 2022.    Since March 2020, the RBNZ has been providing liquidity in the FX swap market and re-established a temporary US dollar swap line (US$30 billion) with the U.S. Federal Reserve. The RBNZ established a new Term Auction Facility (TAF), which allows banks access to collateralized loans of up to 12 months, and announced a corporate facility in which the RBNZ will offer up to NZ$500 million per week in open market operations with banks against corporate paper and asset-backed securities for 3 months. The RBNZ also introduced a Term Lending Facility (TLF), a longer-term funding scheme for banks at 0.25 percent for up to 3 years duration initially for six months from May 26, 2020. In August 2020, the lending term of the TLF was extended to 5 years and the facility was extended to February 1, 2021. Subsequently, the TLF was further extended to July 28, 2021. Access to the TLF is linked to each banks\u2019 lending under a NZ$6.25 billion Business Finance Guarantee Scheme (BFGS), in which the government covers 80 percent of the credit risk and will require approved eligible collateral. The BFGS was expanded in August 2020, increasing the maximum loan amount from NZ$0.5 million to NZ$5 million, lengthening the maximum term from three to five years, and allowing more loan access by medium-sized firms. Its availability period has been extended to June 30, 2021. The RBNZ has reduced the banks\u2019 core funding ratio requirement to 50 percent from 75 percent to help banks make credit available.    To further support the stability of the financial system, the start date for a regulatory change requiring higher capital for banks was initially postponed for 12 months to July 2021, and subsequently for a further 12 months to July 2022. Other regulatory initiatives in the pipeline were also put on hold for at least six months. The RNBZ has also agreed with the banks that during this period there will be no dividend payments on ordinary shares and redemption of non-CET1 capital instruments. The RBNZ removed temporarily the mortgage loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions effective May 1, 2020. The RBNZ is re-imposing these restrictions from March 2021 at pre-pandemic levels, with a further tightening of investors\u2019 LVR restrictions from May 2021.    The New Zealand government, the RBNZ, and the New Zealand Bankers Association have also announced a number of financial measures to support SMEs and homeowners. These include six-month principal and interest repayment deferrals to mortgage holders and SMEs affected by COVID-19 and the BFGS.    Other related measures taken by the government included a six-month freeze on residential rent increases until September 25, 2020, and restrictions against tenancy terminations during March-June 2020. The government has extended the Business Debt Hibernation scheme, which allows businesses to place their existing debts on hold by 10 months, to October 31, 2021.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The exchange rate has been allowed to adjust flexibly.    Back to Top NicaraguaBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 19, 2020. In response to the COVID-19, the government announced the implementation of several measures, including the creation of an inter-institutional commission, the declaration of a state of national alert, and the implementation of Epidemiological Surveillance Protocols at the national level. The Ministry of Health (MINSA) monitors and provides weekly reports on the status of the outbreaks in the country. A total of 19 hospitals have been officially designated nationwide for the care of COVID-19 cases upon detection. Doctors and relevant health personnel from MINSA have received training on the prevention, detection, containment and treatment of COVID-19 and have exchanged experiences on these topics with international experts. Education on the prevention of the COVID-19 is also taking place at the national level and a National Information Center has been set up with free direct telephone lines for emergency calls and to answer queries related to the virus, including preventive information.The central and local governments launched a cleaning and disinfection program of public schools, public transportation units, taxis, markets and other public spaces at a national level. In addition, MINSA is promoting a campaign to take preventive measures including proper hand washing, adequate use of masks and the care of vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and with chronic diseases.On July 13, 2020 the MINSA issued revised guidelines to strengthen epidemiological controls at all entry points into the country, including: (i) travelers must have a negative PCR test result for COVID-19 taken in a period not exceeding 72 hours before arriving to the country; (ii) non-national travelers who have fever or respiratory symptoms may not enter the country; (iii) Nicaraguan nationals who have fever or respiratory symptoms may enter the country, but they have to observe house quarantine; and (iv) all travelers who present a negative PCR test upon arrival and have no respiratory symptoms will be allowed without restrictions but will be follow up by telephone by health personnel for a period of fourteen days.On the same date, the Nicaraguan Institute of Civil Aeronautics (INAC) informed that Nicaragua is ready to resume commercial air operations if airlines comply with MINSA revised guidelines. Air operators must present their COVID-19 plans to INAC before resuming commercial operations. On September 19 Nicaragua resumed international commercial flights.Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2020Fiscal\t    The government has continued to prioritize programs to strengthen the social safety net, including the provision of food packages among vulnerable families. Sixty thousand food packages were distributed in April 2020.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    Since March 2020, the Central Bank of Nicaragua (CBN) reduced its repo reference rate by 300 bps. On March 24, 2020, the CBN updated its Business Continuity Plan COVID-19 (activated on March 11, 2020) to guarantee the continuity of financial, treasury, accounting and administrative operations.    On May 26, 2020, the National Microfinance Commission, introduced a temporary reform (from July 1, 2020 until June 30, 2021) to the \u201cNorm on Credit Risk Management for Microfinance Institutions\u201d in order to reduce the specific provisioning requirements for the portfolios of personal loans held by these institutions.    On June 15, 2020, the BCN temporarily reduced reserve requirements in domestic currency from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. During this period, banks can reduce the ratio of required reserves in domestic currency to as low as 4.5 percent (from 15 percent), if they extend credits to the private sector.    On June 19, 2020, the Superintendence of Banks and Other Financial Institutions (SIBOIF) issued a temporary financial regulation, allowing banks and other financial institutions to negotiate, at the request of their clients, an increase in the maturity of their loans and/or a moratorium on monthly payments of up to 6 months on credits granted before March 31, 2020, subject to certain safeguards. Borrowers could request to benefit from this measure until December 31, 2020.    On the same date, the SIBOIF issued another temporary financial regulation reducing the minimum monthly payment for credit cards from 3 to 2 percent of the total debt, including interests. This measure will be in force until March 31, 2021.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top NigerBackground. Niger registered its first confirmed COVID-19 case on March 19, 2020. On March 27, 2020, the President declared a national emergency and imposed a night curfew in the capital in addition to shortened work hours and earlier measures that include the closure of Niger\u2019s borders and a ban on large gatherings. On November 13, 2020, in response to cases rising again, the authorities announced visitors would have to surrender their passports that would be returned only after a negative test following a one-week period of strictly monitored self-isolation. Reopening of the economy and additional containment measures. The night curfew and restriction on religious gatherings were lifted on May 13. The quarantine of Niamey and the ban on inter-city travel were lifted on May 14. The moratorium on seminars and conferences; restricted work hours and limits on non-essential government business were lifted on May 25. The authorities lifted the air border closure as of August 1 with land borders remaining closed. A negative test result is required before arrival. Price controls for essential goods for 3 months. Niger secured US$114.5 million in emergency financing from the IMF on April 14, 2020 and relief from its debt service to the IMF on April 13, 2020. Due to the persistence and the eminently pathogenic and contagious nature of Covid-19, the Government has decided on January 5, 2021 to extend the state of emergency for a further period of three months from January 08, 2021. The Council of Ministers has decided to renew the measure to close bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues which expires on January 6, 2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    An updated crisis response plan has been presented to donors with an estimated cost of 18.4 percent of GDP, divided into an immediate health response and broader economic and social mitigation. Key elements are already being implemented, such as food distribution, two months of free utilities to the vulnerable households and temporary tax relief for hard-hit sectors. Finance Ministry also announced credit support to the private sector in the form of loan guarantees. The revised cost includes large-scale support for agricultural production, revenue shortfalls, and the building of liquidity buffers. On May 8, the cabinet approved a supplementary budget with 1.3 percent of GDP in resources re-allocated to additional spending toward health, security and social assistance.     On April 27, Heads of states of the West-Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) declared a temporary suspension of the WAEMU Growth and Stability Pact setting six convergence criteria, including the 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit rule, to help member-countries cope with the fallout of COVID-19. This temporary suspension will allow member-countries to raise their overall fiscal deficit temporarily and use the additional external support provided by donors in response to COVID-19. The Heads of States\u2019 Declaration sets a clear expectation that fiscal consolidation will resume once the crisis is over.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks\u2019 demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity. In April 2020, the BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25 basis points lower than before the crisis. In June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance institutions to accommodate demands from solvent customers with Covid19-related repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period up to end-2020 debt service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims as non-performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of 3-month \"Covid-19 T-Bills\" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The total amount of such special T-Bills initially issued by Niger was equivalent to 2.7 percent of GDP, with some rollover possibility through similar bonds benefiting from a refinancing rate equivalent to the prevailing monetary policy rate but to be paid back by end-2020. The BCEAO has launched in February 2021 a special 6-month refinancing window at the floor of the interest rate corridor to help WAEMU governments meet Covid recovery funding needs. Through this special window banks shall be able to refinance all bonds with maturity of 3 years or more governments currently plan to issue on the regional financial market in 2021. The amount of bonds eligible to the new refinancing window for country [x] is equivalent to [xx] percent of projected 2021 GDP (See country specific data in Table 2). The new refinancing window is expected to remain in place for the term of the eligible bonds issued in 2021. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basle II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead of 2022 initially planned. In addition, in June 2020, the West African Development Bank (BOAD) decided to create a CFAF 100 billion window for extending 5 to 7-year refinancing of banks\u2019 credit to SMEs in the 8 WAEMU member countries.  In December 2020, the BCEAO instructed WAEMU banks to refrain from distributing dividends with a view to strengthening their capital buffers in anticipation of the impact of the COVID crisis on asset quality.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Other\t    Price controls for essential goods for 3 months. Niger secured US$114.5 million in emergency financing from the IMF on April 14, 2020 and relief from its debt service to the IMF on April 13, 2020.    Back to Top NigeriaBackground. Nigeria has been severely hit by the spread of COVID-19 and the associated sharp decline in oil prices. Government policy is responding to both these developments. A range of measures were implemented to contain the spread of the virus, including closure of international airports, public and private schools, universities, stores and markets, and suspension of public gatherings. Following a full lockdown that was placed on March 30, 2020, Nigeria\u2019s economy reopened gradually in three phases with incremental reductions of traveling and gathering restrictions. Phase 1 started on May 4, phase 2 on June 2, and phase 3 on September 4\u2014which is still being implemented. In December 2020, Nigeria had entered the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with daily new cases doubling the peak of the first wave at end-January. Restrictions on mass gathering were reinstated. Public servants were ordered to stay at home and await further directives. Schools, however, resumed on January 18 after being shut down again from mid-December. Since peaking at 1,600 levels toward end-January, the 7-day moving average of new cases rapidly fell. Nigeria plans to vaccine 40% of its population in 2021 and additional 30% in 2022. Nigeria has requested 41mn vaccines from African Union and expects another 16mn doses under WHO-backed COVAX program.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t     The Federal Government adopted a revised budget for 2020 in response to the COVID-19 shock. A N500 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) COVID-19 intervention fund is included in the revised budget to channel resources to additional health-related current and capital spending (tests, supplies and facilities) and public works programs to support the incomes of the vulnerable, including N7.5 billion to Nigeria\u2019s Center for Disease Control and grant of N10 billion to Lagos State. The coverage of the conditional cash transfer program has been broadened and an allocation of N150 billion to support state and local governments\u2019 spending needs has been made available through the budget. Import duty waivers for pharmaceutical firms were introduced. Regulated fuel prices have been reduced, and an automatic fuel price formula introduced to ensure fuel subsidies are eliminated. Electricity tariff was increased. The social register was increased by 1 million households to 3.6 million to help cushion the effect of the lockdown. A broader economic stimulus plan that includes the N500 billion COVID-19 intervention fund was introduced to support the real sector. The bulk of the plan\u2019s financing would come from CBN-supported credit facilities and from sovereign wealth and other savings funds.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    In response to the crisis, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) cut monetary policy rate by 100 basis points in May and another 100 basis points in September while expanding liquidity available for nonbank financial institutions, leading to significant lowering of market yield of government securities. It also introduced additional measures, including: (i) reducing interest rates on all applicable CBN interventions from 9 to 5 percent and introducing a one year moratorium on CBN intervention facilities; (ii) creating a N50 billion ($139 million)  targeted credit facility; and (iii) liquidity injection of 3.6 trillion (2.4 percent of GDP) into the banking system, including N100 billion to support the health sector, N2 trillion to the manufacturing sector, and N1.5 trillion to the real sector to impacted industries. Regulatory forbearance was also introduced to restructure loans in impacted sectors. The CBN is also coordinating a private sector special intervention initiative targeting N120 billion ($333 million) to fight COVID-19. As of September, the CBN has disbursed a total of N3.5 trillion in intervention funds since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, including N73.7 billion in targeted credit facilities to help households and small and medium enterprises exceeding their initial plans of N50 billion.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The official exchange rate was adjusted from N307/$ before COVID-19 to N361/$ at the beginning of the crisis and more recently to N380/$, with an ongoing unification of the various exchange rates under the investors and exporters (I&E) window, Bureau de Change, and retail and wholesale windows. The authorities committed to let the I&E rate move in line with market forces. A few pharmaceutical companies have been identified to ensure they can receive FX and naira funding. While I&E window turnover has been low since April, the CBN has resumed FX supply in some of the other windows.    Back to Top North MacedoniaThe first confirmed case in North Macedonia was reported on February 26. The number of new daily cases has increased in recent weeks but from a low level. After a strict lockdown in the spring, followed by a gradual reopening of the economy, social-distancing restrictions were tightened again to slow down contagion. Real GDP contracted by 4.5 percent in 2020, following a sharper than expected rebound in the second half of the year.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government has adopted fiscal measures to help address firms\u2019 liquidity problems, protect jobs and support the most vulnerable. The measures, most of which are temporary, include subsidies on private sector wages and social security contributions for firms that maintain employment, postponement of income tax payments, loans at favorable terms and loan guarantees, and sector-specific support. Also, vulnerable households have received financial support through existing social assistance schemes and cash vouchers. Students have received partial re-imbursement of university tuition fees and IT courses. Previously implemented price controls on basic food products, medicines, and disinfection products have been lifted, and the import duty on medical supplies has been reintroduced.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia (NBRNM) has cut its policy rate twice since the start of the crisis by a cumulative 50 basis points to 1.5 percent. The fees for withdrawing and returning cash to the National Bank\u2019s central vault have been abolished to minimize any risk of transmitting the virus infection by coins and bills. In addition, the NBRNM has reduced by 60 percent the amount of CB bills offered to banks, thus providing additional liquidity to the economy. On financial sector measures, the NBRNM has revised its credit risk regulation, to encourage banks to restructure loans temporarily (initially through September 2020, but later extended through March 2021), and temporarily relaxed the loan classification standards for NPLs. It has also reduced the base for the reserve requirement by the amount of new loans to firms in affected sectors and has extended the deadline for banks to submit their first Internal Liquidity Assessment Report in order to allow them to focus on providing credit while maintaining the quality of the loan portfolio. More recently, the NBRNM decided to temporarily restrict dividend payments by banks unless in the form of shares. The restriction is currently in force through the end of 2021 but will be reviewed no later than September 2021.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia intervenes regularly, given the de-facto exchange rate peg.     Back to Top Norway The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on February 26 ,2020. The virus continued to spread, with the number of new cases reaching its peak at the end of March. The government had implemented a range of measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus and to stabilize the economy. The former included travel restrictions, a quarantine-after-travel requirement, social distancing measures, and closures of schools, universities and businesses. The number of infections has fallen strongly since then, until the end of July 2020 when new cases started trending up again.   On May 7, 2020, the government announced its plan to reopen the economy, with a gradual timeline that remains dependent on keeping the spread of infection under control. In addition, non-essential travel to and from other Nordic and EEA countries have resumed subject to the quarantine requirements and conditional on the infection rate and the containment measures in place. Key Policy Responses as of March 5, 2021Fiscal\t            Key implemented and proposed fiscal measures       (discretionary measures close to NOK 131.3 billion, or 4.35 percent of 2020 mainland GDP per the authorities\u2019 estimates, excluding the government bond fund and any losses from government guarantees and loans above budgeted loss provisioning) include:       Expenditure measures: (i) household income protection scheme offering larger wage subsidies for temporary lay-offs, more generous unemployment benefits, and expanded sickness and child care; (ii) measures for business offering a scheme to compensate heavily affected but otherwise sustainable businesses for unavoidable fixed costs, the reinstatement of a government fund that buys bonds issued by Norwegian companies, grants for start-ups and subsidies of domestic air routes; (iii) strengthening of critical sectors such as healthcare; (iv) a subsidy for businesses to take back temporarily laid-off workers, (v) a green transition package, and finally (iv) expanded funding for education and training.Revenue measures: (i) lowering of reduced VAT rate from 12 to 6 percent; (ii) deferral of various tax payments and reduction of the employer tax for May and June 2020, change in CIT regulations so that lossmaking companies can re-allocate their losses towards previous years\u2019 taxed profits, and temporary amendments to the petroleum tax system to improve liquidity in the sector; suspension of aviation charges; temporary lowering of the employers\u2019 social insurance contributions.Guarantee and loan schemes for businesses which include loan guarantees for SMEs, and a scheme for re-insurance of private credit insurance providers.The 2021 budget proposes continuing but more targeted discretionary measures to support businesses and households consistent with the 2020 measures, at an envelop of 2.2 percent of mainland GDP.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    Key monetary measures include: (i) reduction of the policy rate by 1.5 percentage points to 0.0 percent; (ii) provision of additional liquidity to banks in form of loans of differing maturities; (iii) the establishment of a swap facility of USD 30 billion between Norges Bank and the US Federal Reserve (mutual currency arrangement); and (iv) the expansion of banks\u2019 ability to borrow in USD dollars against collateral.     Key implemented and proposed macro-financial policies include: (i) easing of countercyclical capital buffer by 1.5 percentage points; (ii) the possibility that banks can temporarily breach the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR); (iii) temporary easing of mortgage regulations, in particular increase in the percent of mortgages that can deviate from the regulations; and (iv) urging from the Ministry of Finance to banks and insurance companies to not distribute profits.      Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    Norges Bank announced that it was continuously considering whether there is a need to intervene in the market by purchasing Norwegian krone. It intervened once in March 2020, owing to extraordinary market turbulence spurred by COVID.    OBack to Top OmanBackground. Oman is being hit by two shocks\u2014the spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. Government policy is responding to both these developments. The number of registered COVID-19 cases stands at 142,169 as of March 1. The authorities have implemented a range of measures to try and limit the spread of the virus encompassing travel restrictions (including on international flights and internal public transportation and taxis), partial lockdowns, suspending prayers at mosques, closing all schools, universities, shopping malls and commercial establishments (except for groceries, pharmacies, food delivery, and gas stations), and limiting employee attendance at government workplaces and private businesses to minimum needed. On April 15, the government approved measures aiming to maintain the employment of Omani nationals and support private sector firms, including by encouraging them to advance paid annual leave and negotiate salary cuts. For Omani employees whose salaries are lowered, their bank loans will be rescheduled without interest or additional fees for three months, fuel subsidies provided, and electricity and water bills postponed until the end of June 2020. Incentives offered to affected private sector firms include postponement of electricity and water fees for three months.

On June 10 and June 23 the government further opened up commercial and industrial activities. On July 14, the government decided to facilitate Oman citizens\u2019 travel abroad, on condition that they abide by the precautionary procedures but also decided to extend the lockdown on Governorate of Dhofar and the Wilayat of Masirah. On July 25, Oman entered into a major nationwide lockdown aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19, which was lifted on August 7. Following the approval from the Supreme Committee tasked with tackling developments resulting from Covid-19, the government decided to resume public transport services in a phased manner starting from September 27. On October 11, the authorities imposed a complete lockdown on public movement and commercial outlets from 8 pm to 5 am every night until October 24. On January 18, 2021, Oman closed its land borders and the closure was later extended until further notice. On February 26, Oman's Supreme Committee extended indefinitely the closure of beaches, public parks and leisure spaces to curb the spread of the coronavirus.COVID-19 vaccine. Oman has reserved 1 million doses of the vaccine from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) which represents 20 per cent of the Sultanate\u2019s need. Sultanate has directly contracted with Pfizer and booked 370,000 vaccine doses. Oman is also in discussion of other vaccine providers to secure more vaccine, and 100,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca has been delivered to Oman in January. Oman plans to cover 40% of population in the 1st stage. The vaccination process has started in late December 2020. As of mid-Feb 2021, Oman has administered over 100,000 doses of COVID, covering slightly over 1 percent of the country\u2019s population.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government announced several measures to support the economy on March 19. These include the suspension of municipal taxes and some government fees (till end-August) and rent payments for companies in industrial zones (for the next three months), reduction of port and air freight charges, as well as postponement of loan servicing for borrowers of Oman Development Bank and SME support fund for six months.

Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    None.    PBack to Top PakistanBackground. COVID-19 was reported for the first time on February 26, 2020. Starting on March 23, both the federal and provincial governments implemented containment and mitigation measures, including selective quarantines, border closures, international and domestic travel restrictions, closure of educational institutions, banning of public events, social distancing, and varying levels of lockdown.  Despite these measures, the number of new daily cases increased rapidly hitting the peak of 6,000 in mid-June, before slowing down in July and stabilizing below 1,000 during the summer (reaching a low of 300 cases in early September). In November, a second wave of infections started to emerge, with positivity and death rates picking-up before moderating starting in mid-December (positivity rate dropped to around 3.5 percent in February 2021). As a result of the COVID-19 shock, the economic activity worsened notably, with growth preliminarily estimated at\u00a0\u20130.4 percent in FY 2020. A gradual recovery is expected in FY\u00a02021.Reopening of the economy and additional containment efforts. Since mid-April 2020, the federal government, in coordination with provinces, started to gradually ease lockdown arrangements. By the end of summer, further lockdown restrictions were lifted, as educational institutions, recreational places, restaurants, malls, and retail outlets were allowed to reopen. This trend was partially reversed in the last months of CY 2020 by strengthening the enforcement of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and mandating the use of face masks. To mitigate the second wave, smart lockdown measures were re-imposed in the fall (e.g. ban on public meetings and rallies, closure of educational institutions, cinemas, theaters and wedding halls), but restrictions have started to be lifted again starting mid-January. Starting February 2021, schools and all educational institutes resumed normal opening hours, except in a few major cities. In the last week of February, restrictions on the time and capacity limits of commercial and business activities were lifted.  Furthermore, permission has been granted to reopen wedding halls, cinemas and shrines in mid-March. Pakistan kickstarted the vaccination drive in early February after receiving the first batch of 0.5 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine donated by China; another 0.6 million doses of the vaccine are expected to be delivered by the end of the month.  The UN\u2019s COVAX Facility, aimed at covering priority groups\u2014around 20 percent of the population, has confirmed that Pakistan will receive 17.2 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the first half of 2021, including 6 to 7 million doses by March 2021. The government has also approved the Sputnik V vaccine and is in discussions with several of the vaccine manufacturers (e.g expression of interest placed with Pfizer in the second week of February). Commercial sales of vaccines have been also permitted by the government and the first batch of Sputnik V is expected to arrive in the first week of March 2021. The authorities are also working on mobilizing funds from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank for the direct purchase of additional vaccines in an amount of US$ 250 million. ADB is mobilizing US$199 million for the vaccination of 13.47 million people (priority population), with an additional finding of US$8 million for syringes, safety boxes, operational and supply chain management. In addition to the doses, cold chain support from ADB is also secured, while an application to Gavi has been submitted to cover the shortage of walk-in cold rooms and refrigerators.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A relief package worth PKR 1.2 trillion was announced by the federal government on March 24, which has been almost fully implemented. Key measures include: (i) elimination of import duties on emergency health equipment (recently extended until December 2020); (ii) cash transfers to 6.2 million daily wage workers (PKR 75 billion); (iii) cash transfers to more than 12 million low-income families (PKR 150 billion); (iv) accelerated tax refunds to exporters (PKR 100 billion); and (v) support to SMEs and the agriculture sector (PKR 100 billion) in the form of power bill deferment, bank lending, as well as subsidies and tax incentives. The economic package also earmarked resources for an accelerated procurement of wheat (PKR 280 billion), financial support to utility stores (PKR 50 billion), a reduction in regulated fuel prices (with a benefit for end consumers estimated at PKR 70 billion), support for health and food supplies (PKR 15 billion), electricity bill payments relief (PKR 110 billion), an emergency contingency fund (PKR 100 billion), and a transfer to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) for the purchase of COVID-19 related equipment (PKR 25 billion). The unexecuted part of the relief package is being carried forward to FY2021. In addition, the FY 2021 budget  includes further increases in health and social spending, tariff and custom duty reductions on food items, an allocation for \u2018COVID-19 Responsive and Other Natural Calamities Control Program' (PKR 70 billion), a housing package to subsidize mortgages (PKR 30 billion), as well as the provision of tax incentives to the construction sector (retail and cement companies)) which got extended in  the context of the second wave to the end of December 2021.    Provincial governments also implemented supportive fiscal measures from the onset of the shock, including cash grants to low-income households, tax relief, and additional health spending (including a salary increase for healthcare workers). The government of Punjab implemented a PKR 18 billion tax relief package and a PKR 10 billion cash grants program. The government of Sindh's measures included cash grant and ration distribution program of PKR 1.5 billion for low-income households. The FY2021 provincial budgets also provide tax relaxations and sizeable increases in expenditure allocations, especially on health services.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has responded to the crisis by cutting the policy rate by a cumulative 625 basis points to 7.0 percent since March 17. The SBP has expanded the scope of existing refinancing facilities and introduced three new ones to: (i) support hospitals and medical centers to purchase COVID-19-related equipment (43 hospitals, PKR 10.1 billion, to date); (ii) stimulate investment in new manufacturing plants and machinery, as well as modernization and expansion of existing projects (487 new projects, PKR 430 billion, to date); (iii) incentivize businesses to avoid laying off their workers during the pandemic (2,958 firms , PKR 238 billion, to date). These facilities have been extended beyond their original deadline of June 2020 to September or December 2020.    Moreover, the SBP introduced temporary regulatory measures to maintain banking system soundness and sustain economic activity. These include: (i) reducing the capital conservation buffer by 100 basis points to 1.5 percent; (ii) increasing the regulatory limit on extension of credit to SMEs by 44 percent to PRs 180 million ; (iii) relaxing the debt burden ratio for consumer loans from 50 percent to 60 percent; (iv) allowing banks to defer clients\u2019 payment of principal on loan obligations by one year (PKR 659 billion being deferred to date); (v) relaxing regulatory criteria for restructured loans for borrowers who require relief beyond the extension of principal repayment for one year; and (vi) suspending bank dividends for the first two quarters of 2020 to shore up capital. The SBP has also introduced mandatory targets for banks to ensure loans to construction activities account for at least 5 percent of the private sector portfolios by December 2021.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The SBP has introduced further regulatory measures to facilitate the import of COVID-19-related medical equipment and medicine. These include (i) lifting the limit on import advance payments and import on open account; and (ii) allowing banks to approve an Electronic Import Form (EIF) for the import of equipment donated by international donor agencies and foreign governments. SBP has also relaxed the condition of 100 percent cash margin requirement on import of certain raw materials to support the manufacturing and industrial sectors.    Back to Top PalauBackground.

On November 25, 2020, it announced that it had reached an agreement with Pfizer Panama and BIONTech SE to acquire 3 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. In January 2021, the government activated a platform  www.vacunas.panamasolidario.gob.pa for vaccination registration,  which is rolled out in several stages (currently in stage 2, starting to inoculate adults aged 60+ on March 4). To date, Panama received four shipments of Pfizer vaccines, for a total of 245,470 doses. In addition, Panama secured 184,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through the COVAX program run by the WHO.Key Policy Responses as of March 3, 2021FiscalAmid the pandemic-related increase in healthcare and social spending, and with SFRL limits temporarily relaxed, the NFPS deficit is estimated to have risen to 9 percent of GDP in 2020. The package of fiscal measures includes:\tExpenditure side: (i) higher spending on healthcare needs, including building a new hospital, purchases of medical supplies and equipment, test kits and educational materials, and training medical personnel. On July 14, 2020, the Cabinet approved US$133.7 million to purchase medical supplies; (ii) an augmentation in social spending, including payments to affected workers and small business owners through the \"Panama Solidarity Plan\" with in-kind transfers including basic food supplies, and several programs (such as Opportunity Banking, Guarantee Fund, and the Soft Loan program) jointly valued at US$235 million, aimed at supporting the micro, small and medium-sized companies in restarting operations and continuing to employ workers; (iii) a suspension of payments for public services (electricity, landline phones, mobile phone and internet) for March-June; (iv) an electricity subsidy (50 percent to customers who consume up to 300 kWh per month and 30 percent to those who consume between 301 kWh and 1,000 kWh per month); (v) an expansion of the Housing Solidarity Fund program managed by the Ministry of Housing and Land Management, which provides $10,000 towards a down payment to the families in need of homes valued up to US$70,000 (reinforced with US$80 million from the Panama Savings Fund). On August 23, 2020, the government began the transfer of US$50 to approximately 250,000 workers with suspended contracts, amounting to a total of US$12.5 million. Access to unemployment benefits was extended through January 2021. On February 1, 2021, beneficiaries of the Panama Solidarity Plan will receive $120 per month, an increase from $100 per month in July 2020.\tRevenue side: (i) tax relief through extended income-tax filing deadlines until December 31, 2020 (originally until July 17, 2020). In February, MEF presented before the National Assembly a new bill to extend the tax amnesty through July 31, 2021.(ii) some tax benefits and suspension of payments for public services (for 4 months, without interest) for taxpayers with income below US$2,000 per month, retirees, or those displaced from the labor market; and (iv) enabling 114 virtual procedures for taxpayers. In 2020, Panama initially mobilized: (i) US$515 million from the IMF under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI); (ii) US$300 million from the Inter-American Development Bank (US$150 to finance micro and small businesses, and another US$150 million to help agricultural producers); (iii) US$41 million in the Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option from the World Bank to expand the coronavirus care network; (iv) a US$1 million grant from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration to finance COVID-19 prevention activities; and (v) a US$400,000 grant from the Development Bank of Latin America to acquire ventilators. The President approved a law which allows the government to use liquid resources of the Panama Savings Fund (assets of US$1.3 billion). On July 9, 2020 the IDB approved another US$400 million loan to help finance efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, mitigate its impact on vulnerable households, and promote policies to mitigate short-term adverse effects on the economy. On August 4, 2020, the National Bank of Panama issued a US$1 billion 10-years bond at 2.5 percent in international markets. On September 23, 2020, the government raised another US$2.575 billion in global bonds, comprising a new bond (US$1.25 billion; maturing in 2032; yield of 2.252%), reopening of a bond maturing in 2060 (US$1 billion; yield of 3.28%), and reopening of a local note maturing in 2026 (US$0.325 billion; yield of 2.77%). The government also withdrew an additional US$20 million from the Panama Savings Fund (FAP), earmarked for future acquisition of a COVID-19 vaccine, bringing total withdrawals to US$105 million since the declaration of the state of emergency following the pandemic.  On November 14, 2020, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration approved US$250 million to support Panama\u2019s economic recovery as part of its Development Policy Operations Program. Separately, it approved US$150 million to strengthen pandemic prevention and containment efforts.On January 19, 2021, the IMF approved Panama\u2019s request for a two-year arrangement under the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) in the amount equivalent to US$2.7 billion (SDR 1.884 billion; 500 percent of quota). The PLL will serve as insurance against extreme external shocks stemming from the COVID-19 pandemicOn January 20, 2021, the government raised $2.45 billion with a reopening of the Global Bond 2032 ($1.25 billion, at a yield of 2.198%) and Global Bond 2060 ($1.2 billion, at a yield of 3.384%), as part of the part of MEF's financing for the FY2021 Budget. This global bond issuance was over-subscribed by 2.4 times. \u00a0Monetary and macro-financialThe Superintendency of Banks of Panama (SBP) allowed banks to use the accumulated dynamic provisioning (about US$1.3 billion or 2 percent of GDP) to absorb the impact of credit losses. It allowed banks to undertake voluntary loan restructuring with troubled borrowers (banks can adjust existing loan conditions, grant grace periods, reduce interest rates, and eliminate some fees) and requested banks not to charge interest on unpaid interest. To provide relief to borrowers affected by the pandemic, banks agreed to extend grace periods on loan payments until December 31, 2020 (from 90-120 days offered earlier). This agreement was later enshrined in Law 156 dated June 30, 2020, which established a formal moratorium on loans granted by banks, cooperatives and finance companies for all physical and legal persons economically affected by the national emergency due to the pandemic. Borrowers have to continue paying interest, but banks will not apply late fees, charge interest on unpaid interest, or record late payments in credit history. The measure applies to mortgages, personal, auto, credit card loans, and loans to SMEs, agriculture, commerce, and transport. The moratorium is not automatic: borrowers must provide documents on the impact of the pandemic on their employment or business activities. July 1, 2020 was the start of the second phase of the moratorium (which includes additional grace periods and loan renegotiations or consolidations), with applications availaible online. On August 6, 2020, The World Bank Group\u2019s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) issued a guarantee on loans received by Caja de Ahorros de Panam\u00e1 amounting to US$400 million to support affordable housing and loans to SMEs. The guarantee is for: (i) a US$250 million loan (maturity of 15 years) from Kairos Global Solutions S.A. (Kairos); and (ii) a US$150 million (maturity of 5 years) from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (BBVA). On August 7, 2020, the MEF and National Bank of Panama established two Trusts as part of the economic reactivation strategy.\tThe first Trust, named \"Global Credit Program for the Defense of the Productive Fabric and Employment\", aims to support the MSMEs in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. The initial funding amounts to US $ 150 million from the IDB and will be replenished in a second phase in 2021 by another US $ 150 million.\tThe second Trust, called \"Special Bank Stimulus Fund\", is intended to grant credit facilities to productive sectors to stimulate economic growth and meet temporary liquidity needs. The initial funding of US $ 500 million comes from the IMF\u2019s RFI, another US $ 500 million are financed by the National Bank of Panama (BNP).Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    Panama is a fully dollarized economy; BOP is expected to deteriorate as a result of the COVID-19 shock given a fall in tourism, transit through the Panama Canal and lower foreign direct investment. The Cabinet dropped import tariffs on corn used to feed animals (from 40 percent) until December 31, 2020.    Other\t    Some private parties offer economic relief to their clients affected by the outbreak (e.g., the Association of Property Owners of Panama approved a suspension of evictions of tenants affected by COVID-19, effective April 1, 2020), Minera Panama donated 20 ventilators and a gasometer for the Social Security Administration\u2019s Special Respiratory Care Unit, while insurance companies voluntarily assumed coverage for COVID-19.      Back to Top Papua New Guinea Background.Since early February 2020, the PNG government took stringent measures to mitigate a domestic outbreak of COVID-19. Initially, these included a ban on travelers from Asian countries, reduced international flights, mandatory health declaration forms for incoming travelers and enhanced screening at designated ports of entries. On March 24th the authorities announced a State of Emergency (SoE), restricting internal bus and air travel, closure of bars, and work-from-home requirements. Following the lapse of the SoE in June, however, there has been a renewed outbreak of COVID-19, mainly centered on the National Capital District (NCD), but with a growing number of cases in other regions.  The Government announced that domestic travel would only be allowed for essential services and a lockdown of 14 days was implemented in the NCD. On October 5, international travel restrictions were eased (allowing additional routes), but domestic requirements to enforce social distancing and hygiene were tightened. In recent months, local transmission of COVID has increased.  On June 9, the IMF Executive Board approved the disbursement of US $ 363.6 million in emergency financing under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) to help PNG address urgent balance of payments needs created by COVID-19.Press Release: covid-19-pandemicReopening of the economy.On April 2, 2020, the PNG parliament voted to shut down the country and extended the SoE, for a further two months, until June 16. However, businesses are required to implement \u2018new normal\u2019 work arrangements which includes physical distancing and use of face masks. PNG parliament also passed the Public Health Emergency Bill 2020 which seeks to provide a practical and effective legislative mechanism for the implementation of all necessary measures to detect, prevent the entry of, and eradication of pandemic, outbreak or serious public health threat.    Key Policy Responses as of March 5, 2021Fiscal\t    On April 2, 2020 the PNG government announceda K5.6 billion economic stimulus package, including a K600 million credit line to support businessesa nd individuals, in coordination with the banks and financial institutions, and K500 million insupport from superannuation savings to employees affected by the economic slowdown. Support for businesses includes K200 million in guarantees for loans to SMEs. Moreover, the government has allocated K645 million more to support health, security and economic sector.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) reduced the Kina Facility Rate (KFR) \u2013 the main policy rate - by 200 basis points to 3 percent from 5 percent and asked the commercial banks to reduce their respective Indicative Lending Rates. BPNG also reduced the Cash Reserve Requirement to 7 percent from 10 percent to provide additional liquidity to the commercial banks. In addition, BPNG purchased K750 million of government securities in the secondary market in a program to increase liquidity to the private sector. To encourage interbank activity, BPNG increased the margin on central bank borrowing by 25 basis point to 100 basis points of both sides of KFR. All financial institutions agreed to provide relief of 3 months on loan repayments and interest payments to customers who have lost their jobs, on a case-by-case basis. To cover for the 3-month loan repayment holiday for borrowers severely affected by the COVID crisis, BPNG suspended loan-loss provisioning for affected loans during this period. A total of K806 million is estimated to be paid out the members from their superannuation savings. The amendments to Superannuation Act allow its members to withdraw up to 20 percent of their contribution or a maximum of K10,000.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    BPNG is committed to providing US dollar liquidity to domestic FX interbank market. However, during the SoE it directed Authorized Foreign Exchange Dealers to give priority to retailers and wholesalers of medical drugs, medical and pharmaceutical companies, particularly the imports of products related to COVID-19. BPNG provided additional FX for these purposes.    Back to Top ParaguayBackground. The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Paraguay on March 7th, 2020. Starting March 12, the government implemented a series of measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including border closure and suspension of school, all activities that involve groups of people, as well as public and private events. The country implemented a total quarantine from March 20 to May 3, 2020. Most cases in the first  months of the pandemic were imported from Brazil, although community transmission started picking up significantly in August.  Since September 2020, the average number of new cases has stabilized at around 1,000 per day, with monthly fluctuations. The number of deaths is about 3,200 (450 per million), with 162,000 total confirmed cases as of March 4, 2021.Reopening of the economy. On June 15, 2020, Paraguay moved into the third stage of re-opening, under the country\u2019s phased plan labeled \u201cSmart Quarantine\u201d. It allows the rehabilitation of commercial stores and shopping centers, corporate offices, general construction works, and sports in gyms at fresh air. Stage three also allows the reopening of restaurants.  The main remaining restrictions are border closures, cancellation of large public events, face mask requirements, and limited seating and extended sanitary protocols for restaurants, gyms, religious services, and public offices. On July 20, the country moved to phase 4 of the reopening, which allows reopening of hotels under strict protocol, religious services with up to 50 persons and some further relaxation on public and private event protocols.  On October 3, the government officially lifted phase 4, though restrictions remain such as social distancing, mask-wearing in public spaces, sanitary protocols, limited night-time circulation, and others. On October 15, Paraguay opened three border posts with Brazil, for circulation of cars only, at limited timetables, and a week later the airports of Asunci\u00f3n and Ciudad del Este officially reopened, with a limited number of flights. Travellers from the U.K. were banned from entering the country on December 21, following the discovery of the new SARS-CoV-2 variety. Physical-presence school classes will partially resume in March 2021.Vaccines. Paraguay is planning to buy 4 million vaccine doses under the CoVax initiative, at a reported price tag of about US$50 million. The first 36,000 doses (Astra Zeneca) are being delivered in March, with about 300,000 more doses following until end-May. In February the country signed a contract with the Russian Investment Fund for the delivery of 1 million Sputnik V vaccines. 4,000 doses were delivered right away and have been administered to 2,000 frontline health personnel.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government has lowered VAT on medical supplies to 5 percent and eliminated import tariffs on them. On March 23, 2020, the government submitted to congress a package of emergency spending measures of around $945 million (2.5 percent of GDP). The package includes additional health-related spending of $500 million, $400 million measures to support the vulnerable population, and $45 million emergence funding for small enterprises. The government obtained authorization from Congress to borrow up to an additional U.S. $1.6 billion (4 percent of GDP) from IFIs and through bond issuances. On April 23, the government successfully issued U.S.$1,000 million in international sovereign bonds. The 10-year bond was seven times oversubscribed at an interest rate of 4.95 percent.For the remainder of 2020 and 2021, the government is proposing an Economic Recovery Plan totaling $2,300 million, focusing on investment, social spending, and financing for the private sector.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    Since early March, the central bank has lowered the policy rate by 325 basis points, to 0.75 percent. The interest rate for the central bank\u2019s overnight liquidity facility window has also been reduced, by 200 basis points, from 4.5 percent to 2.5 percent. The Central Bank has also reduced the minimum reserve requirements on domestic and foreign currency deposits, freeing up $959 million in the process for banks to make new loans. In addition, a National Emergency Special Credit Facility (FCE) was created to channel up to $760 million in liquidity support to SMEs. The government has also allowed banks to automatically refinance loans to private sector companies that are in repayment difficulties, and postponed collection of taxes and user fees for 2 months.    The Development Finance Agency (AFD) has started programs to help refinance home loans for a period of 60 months, and to help SMEs finance working capital needs. A US $  500 million MSME Guarantee Fund has been set up to support credit creation in the SME sector.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The central bank is continuing with its policy of letting the exchange rate absorb shocks, and have its value determined by market forces. FX interventions are only carried out to prevent disorderly market conditions. On April 21, 2020 the IMF Executive Board approved an emergency financing loan under the RFI in the amount of about $274 million.    Back to Top PeruBackground. . The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Peru on March 6th. The number of new COVID19 cases and deaths peaked first in mid-August, but a second wave of widespread infections is currently underway. The per capita fatality rate remains amongst the highest in the world. The fourth (and last) phase of economic reopening started on October 1st, which includes the resumption of international commercial flights to some destinations, and easing of capacity restrictions for retail stores and restaurants to 60 and 50 percent, respectively. Land borders reopened on November 1st.On January 31, 2021, 10 regions (including the capital Lima) went into a 4-week lockdown following a substantial increase in national daily Covid-19 cases that has strained health system capacity, and the announcement by the Ministry of Health that the more-virulent Covid-19 U.K. variant is circulating in the country. Large and medium-scale mining, hydrocarbons, construction and agriculture will continue to operate, while banks, markets, and pharmacies must limit their capacity at 40 percent. Delivery services from restaurants will be allowed. Domestic flights and land travel will be prohibited, and international flights from Brazil will be suspended. The measures follow others introduced on January 4, mandating a 14-day quarantine for international travelers and capacity reductions at shopping centers. Mobility restrictions were eased starting March. Curfews will remain in place on Sundays and evenings, and capacityyrestrictions will increase to 20 percent at retail venues, 30 percent at restaurants, and 40 percent at other service providers (supermarkets, banks, hairsalons, etc). Recreational venues (cinemas, gyms, theaters, worship venues, and casinos) will remain closed. Access to beaches will remain restricted.Key Policy Responses as of  March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government approved S/ 3 billion  (0.5 percent of GDP) to attend the health emergency and approximately S/ 7 billion  (1.1 percent of GDP) in direct transfers to support vulnerable households during the national lockdown period. An additional cash transfer to vulnerable households of approximately S/ 6.4 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) was announced in late July. The government also approved a three-month extension for the income tax declaration for SMEs and is granting flexibility to enterprises and households in the repayment of tax liabilities. These tax measures are estimated to provide a temporary relief in the order of 2.0 percent of GDP. The government has also approved the creation of an S/ 800 million  (or 0.1 percent of GDP) fund to help qualified SMEs to secure working capital and/or refinance debts and has announced an expansion of that program to around 0.5 percent of GDP. The government has announced a postponement of households\u2019 payments of electricity and water and a subsidy for electricity payments of S/ 800 million  (0.1 percent of GDP). On October 7, the government launched a program to issue guarantees partially backing loan restructurings for households and SMEs (Programa de Garant\u00edas Covid-19). The cost of the program is estimated at about S/ 7 billion  (1 percent of GDP). A new wage subsidy program was launched in late October, covering between 35 to 55 percent of the wage bill of those firms that reported a fall in sales of at least 30 percent during April/May, and who recall furloughed workers or create new jobs. The program is expected to benefit some 350,000 people.     \t    The government authorized withdrawals of up to S/2,000 from private pension fund accounts by members who had not contributed for six consecutive months or employees on furlough in April under emergency decrees. Congress-led legislation in May allowed access of up to 25 percent of the savings accounts, subject to a maximum of S/12,900. An additional withdrawal allowing those who have not contributed to the system in the past twelve months and others with health conditions to withdraw up to S/17,200 from their private pension accounts was approved in November. In December, Congress passed legislation authorizing exceptional payments by the public pension fund of up of S/4,300, and  authorizing additional one-off payments to current retirees, and allows those over 65 years of age that have not met the requisites for a pension to withdraw the full amount of their contribution. The law was deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Tribunal.        Policy announcements in the context of the second wave include additional cash-transfers to households in areas subject to the shelter-at-home restrictions of S/ 600  (0.4 percent of GDP), and two-month tax referrals benefiting companies and individuals. The government has also announced additional health spending in the amount of 0.5 percent of GDP, extended the Programa de Garant\u00edas Covid-19 facility until March 31, 2021, expanded two government-guaranteed lending programs (PAE MyPES and FAE Turismo), extended the grace and payment periods for certain loans under Reactiva Peru by one year, respectively, allocated resources to public works and food assistance, eased the budget execution conditions for local governments,and launched a program to bring free internet to local and rural areas and close digital infrastructure gaps (Todos Conectados).         Monetary and macro-financial\t    The central bank has cut the policy rate by 200 basis points, bringing it to \u00bc percent, and is monitoring inflation developments and its determinants in order to increase the monetary stimulus if necessary. In addition, the central bank has reduced reserve requirements, provided liquidity to the financial system through repo operations, and has approved a package of 60 billion soles (over 8.8 percent of GDP) in liquidity assistance (backed by government guarantees) to support lending and the payments chain, which expired on October 2020(Reactiva Peru). The superintendence of banks has issued a notification allowing financial institutions to modify the terms of their loans to households and enterprises affected by the Covid-19 outbreak without changing the classification of the loans. These operations have to satisfy well defined conditions, including a maximum modification period of six months.    On December 2020, the central bank announced it will offer long-term interest rate swaps and repos to enable banks to hedge the risk of rising rates on long-term loans such as mortgages and corporate loans. The swaps will see the central bank will pay a variable rate in exchange for a fixed rate, with maturities ranging from 3 to 7 years. The repos will have a maturity of 1-3 years. The bank also introduced a 1-2 month facility to repurchase commercial invoices from SMEs. The central bank also extended the temporary suspension for additional reserves on foreign currency loans until April 2021, and would increase liquidity by allowing banks to temporarily sell packages of high-quality loans in repo operations.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The central bank has been intervening since late February to mitigate disorderly conditions in the foreign exchange market, with most of the intervention taking place in March-April. International reserves remain significant, at over 35 percent of GDP.    Back to Top PhilippinesThe Philippines reported its first cases of confirmed COVID-19 on January 30, 2020. Metro Manila and other high-risk areas will remain under a \u201cgeneral community quarantine,\u201d until March 31, 2021 which allows businesses to reopen and mass transportation to resume in phases.  International travel restrictions largely remain in place, but domestic flights are allowed under limited capacity. Schools in the country have been reopened since October 5, 2020. Hotels in areas under general community quarantine and modified GCQ can now accept guests at full capacity to allow the tourism industry to recover. The Philippines started inoculation of eligible adults on March 1, 2021.Financial market volatility has subsided recently, with the peso/US$ exchange rate staying stable. Meanwhile, real GDP in 2020 contracted by 9.5 percent.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021The government launched a 4-pillar socioeconomic strategy against COVID-19, which includes support to vulnerable groups and individuals, expanded resources for frontline medical workers, as well as fiscal and monetary measures. Fiscal\t    The government launched a two fiscal stimulus packages in 2020 package totaling PHP 595.6  526 billion fiscal package (about 3.12.9 percent of 20192020 GDP) for vulnerable individuals and groups, which includes the following measures that had been implemented during the first half of 2020. In addition, the government allocated funds for credit guarantees and stand-by financing amounting to about 0.8 percent of 2020 GDP. \t\tThe first package, the \u201cBayanihan I\u201d Act, was signed into law in March and provided fiscal support of about 2.1 percent of 2020 GDP, including: (1) cash aid program of about PHP 211 billion (1.2 percent of 2020 GDP) for over 32 million low-income households; (2) social protection measures of about PHP 65 billion for vulnerable workers and micro-, small-, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) (about 0.36 percent of 2020 GDP); (3) COVID 19 related medical responses of about PHP 49 billion (around 0.3 percent of 2020 GDP); and (4) assistance to local governments of about PHP 37 billion (about 0.2 percent of 2020 GDP). In addition, a credit guarantee program for small businesses and support to the agriculture sector were allocated PHP 120 billion ( about 0.7 percent of 2020 GDP). Financial assistance to affected MSMEs and vulnerable households was also provided through specialized microfinancing loans and loan restructuring. \t\tThe second package, \u201cBayanihan II\u201d Act, which was signed into law in September, provided additional support (about 0.8 percent of 2020 GDP), with a focus on vulnerable households and hard-hit sectors, such as agriculture, transportation, and tourism, and also included capital injections into state-owned banks. Bayanihan II also included a stand-by fund (about 0.14 percent of 2020 GDP) for expanded Covid-19 testing and further capital injections if needed. As of end-December 2020, total disbursement under Bayanihan II amounted to 0.6 percent of GDP. The use of the unspent Bayanihan II funds has been extended to June 30, 2021.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has reduced its policy rate five times in 2020 by a cumulative 200 bps to 2.00 percent, with the latest cut of 25 bps to become effective on November 20. Earlier BSP had lowered the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks by 200 bps to 12 percent, effective from April 3. At the same time, to ensure the availability of sufficient short-term liquidity in the financial system, the BSP also made purchases of government securities in the secondary market.    Meanwhile, to support the government\u2019s programs to counter the impacts of COVID 19, the BSP purchased PHP 300 billion worth government securities (about 1.5 percent of 2019 GDP) through a repurchase agreement with the government, which was fully settled in September. A fresh provisional advance amounting to PHP 540 billion was also approved in October. In addition, the BSP also remitted PHP 20 billion as dividend to the government even though it is no longer required to make dividend payments to the government under the newly amended BSP charter.     The BSP has also announced a series of regulatory relief measures for the banking sector, including: (1) a temporary relaxation of requirements on compliance reporting, penalties on required reserves, and single borrower limits; (2) easier access to the BSP\u2019s rediscounting facility; (3) a temporary relaxation of provisioning requirements (subject to the BSP approval), and (4) a relaxation of prudential regulations regarding marking-to-market of debt securities. These relief measures are intended to encourage banks, in turn, to provide financial relief to their borrowers (e.g., temporary grace period for loan payments). To encourage extension of loans to enterprises, particularly, micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), the BSP allowed loans to MSMEs to be counted as part of banks\u2019 compliance with reserve requirements, temporarily reduced their credit risk weights to 50 percent, and assigned zero risk weight to loan exposures guaranteed by the Philippine Guarantee Corporation. Also, loans to certain large enterprises that were critically impacted by the pandemic (but not part of a conglomerate) will now be recognized as forms of alternative compliance with banks\u2019 reserve requirements. Finally, the BSP increased the limit on banks\u2019 real estate loan share from 20 percent of their total loan portfolio (net of interbank loans) to 25 percent.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The BSP has relaxed documentary and reporting rules for FX operations (March 27).    Structural Policy\t    Under Bayanihan II, private projects determined to be nationally significant with high economic returns or with high employment potential may have certain permits, licenses or other requirements waived, to avoid delays in their implementation. These regulatory relief measures are expected to fast-track high impact investments and create jobs.    Back to Top Poland, Republic ofBackground. Poland reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case on March 4, 2020. A second wave firmly established itself in October 2020, surpassing the first wave by a large margin. While new infections moderated visibly in late November/January, they started to grow strongly again in late February 2021. In March 2020, the government first introduced containment measures, including closures of schools, universities, restaurants, and all non-essential retail trade and service outlets, as well as bans on large gatherings, border controls, and travel restrictions. Following a quarter-on-quarter (q/q) contraction of 0.3 percent in Q1 2020, GDP contracted a further 9.0 percent q/q in Q2, led by declines in private consumption and fixed investment. Following an easing of restrictions, the economy expanded 7.9 percent (q/q) in Q3 driven primarily by private consumption, and output reached a level only 2 percent below the pre-crisis peak. In the context of the second wave, the economy contracted 0.7 percent (q/q) in Q4. Annual GDP declined 2.7 percent in 2020, indicating the first recession since 1991.Reopening of the economy and additional containment measures.On April 16, 2020, the government outlined a four-stage plan to reopen the economy. Starting on April 20, a larger number of people was allowed in shops and at religious gatherings, and public parks and forests were reopened. The second phase of the lockdown easing plan was launched on May 4 with the reopening of hotels and shopping malls (with limitations on the number of persons), the opening of daycares and pre-schools (as of May 6), as well as softening quarantine rules for cross-border workers and students. The third phase was launched on May 18, entailing the reopening of restaurants, hairdressers, and cosmetic salons, and permission for outdoor sports events with up to 50 persons with no audience. Grades 1-3 in primary schools opened on May 25 with strict sanitary rules, with a maximum number of children allowed in class. The fourth stage started on May 30, with the opening of cinemas, playgrounds, and gyms, all with stricter sanitary regimes than normal. Outdoor events are allowed with up to 150 people, with social distancing or face masks. Internal EU borders were opened on June 13, in line with EU recommendations.In response to the second wave of the pandemic, the authorities initially tightened restrictions on a regional basis, grouping counties into \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cred\u201d zones based on the local severity of the outbreak. By October 24, the entire country had been placed in a \u201cred\u201d zone. Following a further acceleration of cases, additional restrictions were announced on November 4 (in effect from November 6 to December 27). The restrictions included tighter limits in smaller retail stores. Hotels were opened only for business travel. Restaurants were open for takeout/delivery only, remote learning was implemented for children at all grades, social gatherings of over 5 people were banned, wedding receptions were not permitted, religious service attendance faced limits, and public transport was limited to 50 percent of seats. Water parks, swimming pools, and gyms were closed. Cultural services were closed, including cinemas and museums. Shopping malls were closed between November 6 to November 28, and reopened after, with a limit on capacity. The government restricted Christmas meetings to five persons and imposed mobility restrictions on New Year\u2019s Eve. The authorities subsequently announced a national quarantine from December 28 to January 18, including the shutdown of hotels, ski resorts, and shopping malls with limited exceptions. Persons entering Poland using public transport were put under 10-day quarantine. The dates coincided with the winter school break, which was shifted to early 2021 for all regions, implying a one-month shutdown of schools, starting from the Christmas break on December 23. On January 12, the government extended restrictions to January 31, with the exception that primary schools were re-opened for grades 1-3. On January 29 government announced the re-opening of shopping malls and cultural institutions in sanitary regime from February 1. Further restrictions were lifted on February 12, with opening of theatres, cinemas and operas up to 50 percent of audience. Hotels and accomodation facilities were opened, providing no more than 50 percent of guests and only room-service meals. The government also allowed opening of such sport facilities, as ski slopes, tennis courts, skating rinks, stadia, and swimming pools. In response to rising infections, these restrictions, as well as closing of shopping malls and moving schools back to remote mode, were re-introduced on Feruary 27 in the region with worst pandemic situation, Warminsko-Mazurskie voivod. Moreover, the government tightened requirements on face covers (no scarfs or plastic semi-helmets allowed) and imposed quarantine for all persons entering Poland from Czech and Slovak Republic, unless they have a negative test result no older than 48 hours or were vaccinated with two doses.The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program was launched on December 27 with medical staff being the top priority group. The National Vaccination Strategy aims for all 31 million adult Poles to be vaccinated by no later than early 2023, though if the five vaccines to be chosen are made more quickly this could be sped up to mid-2022. By March 2, total vaccinations reached 3.3 million, of which 1.2 million persons (3.9 percent of the adult population) had received two doses.

The PFSA has adopted a flexible approach for the approval process of long-term guarantee measures under Solvency II for the insurance sector. The PFSA has also recommended a reduction in the risk weight for properties of borrowers that are not used for rentals, which would reduce bank capital requirements. Additionally, the Polish Banking Association has recommended voluntary deferral of loan payments for affected borrowers for up to three months. Banks have also increased limits for contactless credit cards.

Back to Top PortugalBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 2, 2020. Following a decline of the outbreak  during the summer, further spikes in new cases and the test positivity rate have occurred lately. In mid-January 2021, the  outbreak  has intensified, with Portugal registering the highest  weekly averages of new cases and deaths per capita worldwide  (over 1200 new cases and close to 30 deaths per million people daily). The healthcare system has been under significant strain, with nearly all of ICU beds set aside for COVID19 patients occupied. In response to the escalation of the pandemic, a new nation-wide confinement with a horizon of at least one month started on  January 15  and was tightened further on January 21. The overall stringency of the lockdown is on par with measures adopted during March-April of last year, including travel restrictions and school closures. As a result, the new infections and hospitalizations have been decreasing.Cumulative COVID-19 vaccine doses administered reached 364,000 as of February 4, with about 2.8 percent of the population having received one doze and an additional 0.8 percent of the population two dozes.Economic developments.The economy has been significantly affected by the pandemic, with a GDP decline of 7.6 percent in 2020. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the government has responded with a range of measures to support the economy and jobs, and facilitate a progressive resumption of economic activity. However, the recent intensification of the pandemic has required renewed lockdowns  stranding the nascent recovery, especially in the services sector such as commerce and hospitality. In response, the government has extended a range of measures to support the economy and jobs.  Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Key fiscal measures in 2020 include: i) additional resources for virus-related health and education spending; ii) over \u20ac600 million per month (0.3 percent GDP) in financial support for those temporarily furloughed by their employer, as well as financial incentives to support progressive reopening and to normalize business activity (about \u20ac1.3 billion equivalent to {0.6] percent of GDP); iii) up to \u20ac13 billion (6.8 percent GDP) of state-guaranteed credit lines for medium, small and micro enterprises in affected sectors, operated mainly through the banking system; and iii) \u20ac7.9 billion (3.7 percent GDP) of tax and social security contribution deferrals for companies and employees. Additional financial support is also provided for: the self-employed affected by the virus; the unemployed; people forced to stay home to care for children, the national airline and; those sick or in isolation due to the virus. The national airline has also received 0.6 percent of GDP in government loans, but it is expected to need further significant support according to the company restructuring plan that the government has submitted to the EC. On November 5, the Council of Ministers approved additional measures to support the economy, such as  \u20ac0.8 bn  in grants to micro and small companies, and \u20ac0.8 bn in credit line guarantees, and expanded eligibility for affected companies to financial support for progressive recovery.        The 2021 state budget adopted on November 26 foresees further support to the national health system, employment and incomes of households and firms. Key measures include: (i) income support measures, such as temporary reduction of PIT withholdings (0.1 percent of GDP); (ii) expanded subsidy for employment and resumption of activity (0.5 percent of GDP) and extended support for workers' lost income and coverage for those without access to unemployment protection (0.2 percent of GDP); (iii) staff reinforcement in the civil service, particularly in health and education (0.1 percent of GDP) and an extraordinary risk subsidy in the amount of 20 percent of base salary for health professionals at the forefront of the response to COVID-19; and (iv) VAT tax rebate to stimulate consumption in the catering sectors, accommodation and culture by returning the VAT paid on consumption in these sectors (0.1 percent GDP). In addition, public investment is budgeted to grow at over 20 percent. The government has submitted the Recovery and Resilience Plan to the European Commission, but related measures and investment projects are not reflected here as the Plan is not yet finalized.    Further policy measures for the first half of 2021    adopted on December 10 and December 22, including towards carrying out the 2021 state budget, comprise: (i) employment support measures via an extension of the support for progressive resumption of economic activity for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (50% reduction in social contributions, with wages for hours not worked paid at 100%, up to the limit of three monthly minimum wages), and renewed incentives for the normalization of activity (up to 2 national minimum wages per worker) for micro-companies with a drop in turnover above 25 percent; (ii) enlarged and more flexible business support programs, such as an expansion of Apoiar.pt    program (non-repayable subsidies) to medium- and large-size enterprises and easing of the access qualifications; (iii) support for payment of non-housing rents (for businesses with a drop in turnover above 25 percent), via non-repayable subsidies up to a limit of 50% of the rent; tax deferrals, specifically monthly or quarterly VAT in the first half of 2021 for businesses with a drop in turnover above 25 percent; and (v) new and expanded credit lines, targeting SMEs (\u20ac750 mln), exporters and tourism sector (\u20ac1,050 mln, with loans up to \u20ac4,000 per worker, of which 20 percent can be converted into a non-refundable subsidy if jobs are maintained), large companies in affected sectors (750 mln), tourism sector, including microcredit to small companies (\u20ac400 mln); (vii) an amendment to the legal regime of residence permits for investment; and (vii) extension of tax benefits for investment and the entertainment and cultural sectors.         The reinstatement of nationwide lockdown on January-15 has been accompanied by additional economic support measures to cushion its impact. In particular, the government (i) reinstated a job-retention program (simplified layoff) (which had expired in September of 2020) for businesses that were required to close, and (ii) introduced support towards the progressive resumption of activity offered to firms with a reduction in turnover of at least 25%. Furthermore, changes were also made to the existing Apoiar.pt programs and the eligibility criteria, such as extending the turnover drop period, easing equity capital requirements, and introducing the possibility of submitting applications by companies with debts to the tax administration and social security. Lastly, the government is considering a recapitalization program for firms.    Monetary and Macro-Financial\t    For monetary policy at the currency union level, please see Euro Area section.

Qatar is being impacted by two shocks\u2014the spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in hydrocarbon prices. The authorities have put in place policies to dampen the negative impact of the shocks in the economy. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on February 29, 2020. Measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus included: travel restrictions (suspension of all international passenger flights, a 14-day quarantine for all returning Qatari citizens, and suspension of public transportation); suspension of public and private schools (replaced with distance learning) and home services; closure of non-essential businesses (excluding groceries stores and pharmacies); banning all public gatherings and dining in cafes and restaurants; and cancellation of routine medical and dental appointments. These measures were complemented by requiring teleworking for 80 percent of private sector employees and vulnerable groups (older than 55, pregnant women, and those with chronic illness), reduced working hours in the public sector, public health awareness campaigns, intensified food inspections to ensure health compliance, more testing for COVID-19 (including a drive through station), and enhanced cleaning in the Industrial Area. Home delivery medical services have been expanded. The private sector is providing meals and hygiene baskets to workers in quarantined areas. A 150-bed hospital for quarantined workers has been set up in the Industrial Area, where there has been a high concentration of COVID-19 cases. Starting May 17, all residents are required to wear a facemask in public places. Starting May 22, all residents are required to install the Ehteraz App on their mobile phones, which will help track COVID-19 transmission, prioritize testing, and provide COVID-related updates.Reopening of the Economy. The authorities have conducted widespread COVID-19 testing in the Industrial Area and are providing free healthcare to those affected. Following these measures, the authorities fully opened the Industrial Area on May 6 under strict and specific entry and exit regulations, only for employers and employees, and for goods and materials, which may only enter or exit with an application to relevant authorities. Entry and exit regulations are partly implemented with a mobile application. On June 8, the government announced a 4-phase plan to reopen the economy. On August 30, authorities announced new labor-market reforms that would dismantle the \u201ckafala\u201d employment system by allowing workers to take new jobs without their current employers\u2019 approval; imposing a permanent, universal minimum wage; and beefing up enforcement systems around labor protections. On September 1, the economy moved into phase 4 with full economic reopening with social distancing and medical precautions in place.

Qatar began COVID vaccination campaign at the end-December 2020. On February 18, the authorities announced a three-month exemption of fully vaccinated people from quarantine requirements, while these latter are extended through May 31 for non-vaccinated people.Key Policy Responses as of March 3, 2021Qatar\u2019s QR 75 billion (about 14 percent of GDP) package to reduce the effects of COVID-19 was announced on March 16. The program aims at shoring up small businesses and hard-hit sectors (hospitality, tourism, retail, commercial complexes, and logistics), including through six-month exemptions on utilities payments (water, electricity). Logistics areas and small and medium industries were exempt from rent payments for six months. On September 16, all these exemptions were extended to end-2020.  Fiscal\t    Food and medical goods were exempted from custom duties for three more months effective September 16. A waiver of rental and utilities fees was granted to households and businesses until February 2021. Migrant workers who are in quarantine or undergoing treatment will receive full salaries. The fiscal support package is expected to reach QR2.1billion (0.4 percent of GDP) in 2020. On June 1, the government entities were directed to reduce non-Qatari employees\u2019 wage bill by 30 percent.      Monetary\t    The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) lowered its policy rates twice in March in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve (to maintain the currency peg). The deposit rate was then reduced by 100 bps to 1 percent; the lending rate by 175 bps to 2.5 percent; and the repo rate by 100 bps to 1 percent. The QCB is also providing liquidity to banks operating in the country through a special repo window at zero interest rate (QR50 billion).    Macro-Financial\t    QCB introduced a zero-interest repo window of QR50 bill (9.3% of GDP) to provide liquidity to banks for postponing loan installments or granting new bank loans. The Qatar Development Bank (QDB) is postponing installments of all borrowers for six months and is administering the National Guarantee Program (NGP) by allocating QR5 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) in government guarantees for a period of 12 months to local banks for loans to private sector companies to help them pay wages and rental fees. QDB has announced that the NGP is extended until June 15, 2021. Qatar Islamic Bank is providing interest-free loans to private companies under this program.

In addition, the deadlines for filing taxes and audited financial statements have been extended until August 30, 2020. The government directed financing to increase investments in the stock market by QR 10 billion (1.8 percent of GDP).    Exchange rate and balance of payments\u00a0No measures.RBack to Top RomaniaBackground. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 26, 2020. The government has implemented a range of measures to delay the spread of coronavirus and to support people, jobs, and businesses. This includes declaring national emergency, increased testing, social distancing measures, including the closure of schools and entertainment as well as travel and domestic movement restrictions, and capping prices of fuel and utilities. The estimate of GDP in Q4 2020, rebounded more strongly than expected by 5.3 percent (quarter-on-quarter) compared to Q3 . This resulted in an overall economic contraction rate of only 3.9% for 2020. This reflected the easing of lockdown restrictions, including the rebound in EU trading partners, and growth also continued to be supported by COVID-19 support measures and the lagging effects of construction sector stimulus in 2019. Reopening of the economy. The gradual reopening started on May 15, 2020. In a first stage, hairdressers, libraries, dentist practices, small shops and museums were reopened, and people can leave their homes without a sworn statement regarding the purposes of traveling. The second round of relaxation measures was implemented on June 1, by lifting restrictions for travel outside cities, resuming international vehicle and train transportation, allowing outdoor sports competition (without public) and outdoor concerts under special conditions, opening terraces and beaches. Starting June 15, international travel to certain countries has been resumed without mandatory quarantine/self-isolation upon return, shopping malls (except food areas and cinemas), gyms and kindergartens have been opened.  After May 15, it is compulsory to wear masks in enclosed spaces in public, such as shops and in public transport. Schools remained closed for the remainder of the school year, except eight- and twelve-grade students who are facing graduation exams. Schools reopened on September 14, subject to certain conditions. Following the increase in the number of new cases, new prevention measures became effective August 1, including mandatory wearing of masks in certain open spaces and limited hours for outdoor restaurants and clubs. Further restrictions were introduced locally in early October: closing again the restaurants, bars, theaters and movie theaters in capital city Bucharest, and mandatory wearing of masks within 50 meters from schools.  With the number of infections on the rise, new restrictions have been imposed in areas exceeding 1.5 cases per 1000 population, including closing schools and mandatory masks in all public places (indoors and outdoors). Starting November 9, circulation during night hours is limited only for emergencies and with a sworn statement on the purposes of travelling. With the declining infection rate since the November 2020 peak, schools reopened on February 8, 2021. Indoors restaurants, bars, theaters and movie theaters have been mostly reopened within limited hours and only 30 percent capacity.The vaccination program was launched on December 27, with the healthcare workers as the first priority. The second stage of the program \u2013 the vulnerable groups \u2013 began mid-January 2021. It is expected that the vaccine will be made available to the general population early April 2021.  The national alert period which started May 15, 2020 has been extended to March 14, 2021. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021 Fiscal\t    Key tax and spending measures introduced amounted to more than 2 percent of GDP include (i) additional funds for the healthcare system, (ii) covering partially the wages of parents staying home for the period the schools are closed, and (iii) measures to support businesses including covering in part the wages of self-employed and workers in danger of being laid off, partially subsidizing the wages of those returning to work, deferral of utilities payments for SMEs, (iv) bonus for corporate income tax payments. In addition, the government has rescheduled the payment of certain taxes for companies in difficulty.  The government in 2020 has provided an envelope of around 3 percent of GDP for loan guarantees and subsidized interest for working capital and investment for SMEs and large companies. Other measures include faster reimbursement of VAT, suspending foreclosures on overdue debtors, suspending tax authorities\u2019 control, discounts for paying corporate income taxes, postponement of property tax by three months, exempting the hospitality industry from the specific tax for 90 days.\u00a0\u00a0See also: https://www.mfinante.gov.ro/pagina.html?categoriebunuri=covid19&pagina=acasa  (Romanian only). While not directly COVID-19 related, a portion of the new pension law increase was implemented in September, raising pension spending on average by 14 percent. The government included in the 2021 budget some support measures to be extended in 2021. It also further raised the cumulative envelope of government guarantees for loans to total around 4 percent of GDP.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    Key measures include: (i) reducing the monetary policy rate by 1.25 percentage point to 1.25\u00a0percent; (ii) narrowing the corridor defined by interest rates on standing facilities around the monetary policy rate to \u00b10.5 percentage points from \u00b11.0 percentage points; (iii) providing liquidity to credit institutions via repo transactions (repurchase transactions in government securities); (iv) purchasing government securities on the secondary market;\u00a0and (v) operational measures to ensure the smooth functioning of payment and settlement systems. The repo transactions stand at around RON  42 billion in 2020, while the total volume of government securities purchased on the secondary market amounted RON 5.3 billion. See also: https://bnro.ro/Regular-publications-2504.aspx In addition, the Government has issued legislation that banks will defer loan repayments for households and businesses affected by COVID-19 for up to nine months \u2013 applicable also in 2021. The European Central Bank has set up a euro repo line with Romania\u2019s central bank worth a maximum of \u20ac4.5 billion ($5.1 billion). It was initially agreed that the repo line would remain in place until end 2020, but was extended until March 2022.

Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    Foreign exchange intervention has been undertaken to smooth excessive volatility and stabilize the exchange rate in order to protect financial stability (see IMF Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, June 2021.    Back to Top Russian FederationBackground.The first cases were reported on January 31, 2020. The authorities started preemptive containment at end-December 2019. They progressively closed the border with China and Europe; mandated self-quarantine for people arriving from other countries and people at risk; closed schools, theaters, and sports facilities; and encouraged remote work. GDP contracted by 8.0 percent in Q2 of 2020. On March 30, the authorities announced an open-ended quarantine in Moscow requiring non-essential businesses to close and people to remain indoors. The central government asked regional authorities to implement containment policies commensurate with the extent of infection in their regions. The COVID-19 shock was compounded by a steep fall in oil prices and the associated instability in financial markets. The authorities have adopted an action plan to support households and businesses and stand ready to take further measures.Reopening of the economy. The federal government had announced a three-stage reopening plan giving regional governors\u2019 discretion on the pace. Criteria for lifting restrictions in specific regions included infection rates, the availability of hospital beds and testing capacity.The authorities are easing the limited restrictions they reinstated during the second wave. Schools and universities are back to off-line learning nation-wide. Theaters, concert venues and sports facilities are allowed 50 percent to 100 percent capacity; museums have reopened, and curfew for restaurants and bars has been lifted. Consumer spending increased 2.6 percent y/y in February \u2013 the highest rise since the outbreak. Notably, the most hard-hit industries, fitness and entertainment have seen the notable increases in spending.Industrial enterprises stayed open nationwide. Requirements for remote work have been lifted in most regions. Domestic flights have largely resumed but passenger traffic has halved. The authorities are reopening new travel destinations and resuming train connections, but spending on air travel fell 71.3 percent y/y, and local transport by 25 percent.  The cost of the government\u2019s National Economic Recovery Plan is Rub 6.4 trillion.Mass vaccination that started January 18 is still slow, with 4 million people (2.7 percent of the population) vaccinated as of February 26 \u2013 with large regional variation. The authorities have put in place measures to accelerate the pace. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Key measures include: (i) increased compensation for frontline medical staff as well as health and safety inspectors; (ii) individuals under quarantine to received sick leave benefits and leave pay to equal at least the minimum wage until the end of 2020; (iii) for those who lost a job after March 1, 2020, including for sole proprietors, the standard unemployment benefit to equal the minimum wage for five months; the minimum unemployment benefit to be tripled until end-August; and eligibility was extended by 3 months; the maximum unemployment benefit, which was increased in March 2020 to the minimum wage, will remain at the same level in 2021. (iv) all children up to 3 years of age to receive an additional lumpsum benefit for 3 months, starting in April; all children 3-15 years of age eligible for a one-time lumpsum benefit; all children under 16 years of age eligible for another one-time lumpsum benefit; all families with children to get an additional lumpsum benefit for each child for up to 6 months if a parent loses job (for up to 4 months for parents who lost their jobs before March 1); an additional lump-sum benefit for all kids under 8 years of age was announced at the end of December 2020; (v) interest rate subsidies for SMEs and systemically important enterprises; (vi) tax deferrals for most affected companies on most taxes; (vii) deferrals on social contributions for SMEs in affected sectors for 6 months (extended for three more months for selected affected sectors); (viii) social contributions by SMEs on wages in excess of the minimum wage permanently reduced; social contributions and CIT permanently reduced for IT firms; (ix) a tax holiday on all taxes (excluding VAT) and social contributions for Q2 for SMEs, sole proprietors, and NGOs providing social services; (x) registered self-employed will be refunded their taxes for 2019 and get a partial refund on their 2020 taxes; eligibility age to register as self-employed lowered from 18 to 16; (xi) sole proprietors got a partial refund on their social contributions; (xii) deferrals on rent payments to all levels of government until the end of the year plus zero rent to the federal government for three months for SMEs in affected sectors; (xiii) budget grants for SMEs in affected industries to cover salaries at the rate of one minimum salary per employee for two months plus subsidized and forgivable (under condition of preserved employment)loans for all enterprises in affected industries to pay minimum wages for 6 months; in 2021, enterprises in selected affected industries, like restaurants, hotels and entertainment, will get subsidized (but not forgivable) loans to pay minimum wages for 12 months, again under condition of preserved employment; (xiv) zero import duties for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and equipment; (xv) guaranteed loans to SMEs and affected industries; (xvi) subsidies to airlines, airports, automakers, and others; (xvii) state-owned bank, airlines and development institution re-capitalization and (xviii) expanded eligibility for subsidized mortgage lending. The total cost of the 2020 fiscal package is estimated at about 3\u00bd percent of GDP\u2014 4\u00bd percent if debt guarantees and capital injections are also included. In 2021, the anti-crisis fiscal package is expected to be much less at around 1\u00bd percent of GDP.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On July 24, 2020 the CBR cut the policy rate by 25 bps to 4.25 percent, rate cut in 2020 amounted to 200 b.p. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) started selling FX reserves from the National Welfare Fund on March 10, reflecting the fall in oil prices below the reference price under the fiscal rule and later for the purchase of Sberbank by the government. Also, CBR increased the limit on its FX swap operations and temporarily introduced a long-term refinancing instrument (one month and one-year Ruble repos). FX purchases by the fiscal rule resumed in mid-January 2021, as oil and gas revenue of the federal budget exceeded the baseline level in December 2020.    Most of the regulatory support measures were effective from March 1 to September 30, 2020, some were extended till end-2020 or mid-2021. Meanwhile, the Central bank encouraged banks to further support affected borrowers. The CBR has introduced temporary regulatory easing for banks intended to help corporate borrowers, and more favorable treatment for FX loans issued to certain sectors. Forbearance on provisioning for restructured corporate and SME loans was granted to all sectors. The deadline for full provisioning of restructured corporate loans was extended until April 1, 2021 (until July 1, 2021, for restructured SME loans). The CBR has introduced a RUB 500bn refinancing facility to support SME lending (including 150bn rubles to provide loans to SMEs to support and maintain employment). The interest rate on CBR refinancing loans aimed at supporting lending to SMEs was reduced to 2.25 percent. This anti-crisis mechanism expired on September 30, 2020.    Banks have been allowed to value securities at their March 1 prices until end-2020. FX operations could also be valued at the exchange rate of March 1 until September 30, 2020, except for those on open forex positions. The Deposit Insurance Fund contribution were reduced from 0.15 percent to 0.1 percent through end-2020. Also, the CBR approved measures to ease liquidity regulations for systemically important credit institutions. A set of measures was taken to protect retail borrowers suffering from the pandemic. Parliament approved a law that guarantees the possibility for affected citizens and SMEs to receive deferrals of loan payments for up to six months. The CBR recommended banks to pursue the same approach to retail loan restructuring as stipulated in the law (fast approval or rejection, restructuring from the application date, no penalties during the consideration period). CBR advised banks to continue restructuring loans to affected retail borrowers and SME until April 1, 2021. Full provisioning of restructured retail loans is postponed until July 1, 2021. Measures to support retail and mortgage lending include the cancelation of add-ons to risk weights for mortgage loans issued before April 1.     Other support measures to the financial sector included measures to ensure the availability of services of non-bank financial institutions and to promote remote customer services. Also, measures have been taken in the field of AML/CFT and currency control.    Further regulatory changes to support lending include new credit risk assessment methods and lower risk weights in mortgage lending that would free about Rub 300 bn (around 0.3 percent of GDP) of banking sector capital.  Lower risk weights will be applied to subordinated bonds (including perpetual bonds) of largest non-financial corporations \u2013 the risk coefficient is reduced to 100 percent from 150 percent. To stimulate conversion of problem loans to systemic enterprises into capital the risk coefficient on such equity will be lowered to 100 percent from 150 percent. Higher risk coefficients for bank holdings of NFC capital are postponed for one year. Lower risk coefficients at 70 percent for loans to medical and pharmaceutical companies were extended till end-2020. To promote high-tech exports, the risk coefficient on loans to non-commodity exporters guaranteed by EXCAR was reduced to 0 from 20 percent.    Additionally, the CBR reduced risk buffers for unsecured loans to be issued since September 1, 2020, and cancels risk buffers for consumer loans issued by August 31, 2019. The CBR lifted its cap on banks' fees for online retailers implemented during the lockdown.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures beyond FX sales mentioned above.    Back to Top RwandaBackground. The first confirmed case was reported on March 14, 2020. Rwanda is currently experiencing a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases. The government has implemented a range of containment measures in response to the pandemic including border closure, suspension of domestic travel, cancellation of public gatherings, institution of teleworking, closure of schools, places of worship and non-essential businesses, and mandatory wearing of face masks. Reopening of the economy.  A gradual easing of lockdown measures was introduced on May 4, with selected businesses allowed to resume operations while adhering to health guidelines. Domestic movement restrictions were partially relaxed but strict physical distancing measures mandated in public buses. Bars and schools remain closed. Steps to reopen the economy include the lifting of restrictions on interprovincial travel, with motorcycle taxis permitted to resume transportation of passengers except in a few areas under lockdown, the reopening of places of worship, and the resumption of selected outdoor sports activities and charter flights. Commercial flights resumed on August 1. Following a hike in infections in Kigali, two major markets were closed for 14 days, public transportation between the capital and other districts prohibited, the nighttime curfew temporarily lengthened, and public offices mandated to work at a further reduced capacity to reinforce social distancing. While a phase of accelerated reopening followed progress in containing the virus, including a gradual reopening of schools, the recent spike in infections has urged the government to reverse previously eased restrictions by tightening movement restrictions, banning social gatherings, limiting office operations and conference activity, and closing recreation facilities. A second wave of infections in January 2021 led to the imposition of a 3-week lockdown in Kigali. A gradual lifting of restrictions is currently underway, with businesses resuming operations and schools reopening, although movements between the capital and other provinces remain prohibited. The national vaccination campaign was launched on February 14 with a target of reaching 20 percent of the population by end-2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The pandemic is expected to cause a revenue shortfall of 2.2 percent of GDP. The government\u2019s Economic Recovery Plan in response to the pandemic is estimated at about 6.3 percent of GDP. Support to vulnerable households takes the form of a food distribution program (door-to-door provision of basic food stuffs every three days), cash transfers to casual workers, subsidized access to agricultural inputs, and measures to ensure poor households\u2019 access to basic health and education. The government also launched the Economic Recovery Fund to support affected businesses through subsidized loans from commercial banks and MFIs, and credit guarantees. It targets SMEs and hard-hit sectors such as the hospitality industry. Tax deferral and relief measures include the following: (i) suspension of down payments on outstanding tax for amicable settlement, (ii)softening of enforcement for tax arrears collection, (iii) extension of the  deadline for filing and paying CIT, (iv)  fast-tracking of VAT refunds to SMEs, (v) CIT and PIT payments based on current year transactions, (vi) PIT exemption for private school teachers and tourism and hotel employees earning less than RWF 150,000/month, and (vi) VAT exemption for locally produced masks. The 30-day maturity period for the public health insurance scheme premium was removed to expedite access to medical services and the salaries of top civil servants for the month of April was redirected to welfare programs.        Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 18, the central bank announced liquidity support measures: (i) an extended lending facility worth RWF 50 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) available to liquidity-constrained banks for the next six months. Under this facility, banks can borrow at the policy rate and benefit from longer maturity periods; (ii) Treasury bond purchases through the rediscount window for the next six months; and (iii) lowering of the reserve requirement ratio by 100 basis points, from 5 to 4 percent, effective from April 1. Loan repayment conditions were also eased for impacted borrowers, and charges on electronic money transactions waived for the next three months. On April 30, the central bank cut the policy rate by 50 basis points to 4.5 percent. Charges on electronic money transactions were reinstated on June 22. The central bank restricted dividend distribution by banks and insurers to preserve capital positions. It also issued guidelines to banks and microfinance institutions on the classification and provisioning of restructured loans. The extended lending facility and the T-bond rediscounting window were extended until further notice.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.

Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\u00a0\t    A SAR 70 billion ($18.7 billion or 2.8 percent of GDP) private sector support package was announced on March 20. The package includes the suspension of government tax payments, fees, and other dues to provide liquidity to the private sector and an increase in available financing through the National Development Fund. The government has made budgetary reallocations (SAR 47 billion) to increase the resources available to the Ministry of Health to fight the virus. On April 3, the government authorized the use of the unemployment insurance fund (SANED) to provide support for wage benefits, within certain limits, to private sector companies who retain their Saudi staff (SAR 9 billion, 0.4 percent of GDP) and eased restrictions on expatriate labor mobility and their contractual arrangements. On April 15, additional measures to mitigate the impact on the private sector were announced, including temporary electricity subsidies to commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors (SAR 0.9 billion). On May 10, the Ministry of Finance announced new fiscal measures to raise more non-oil revenues and rationalize spending. These measures consist of the removal of cost-of-living allowances for public sector workers effective June 1 and increasing the VAT from 5% to 15% effective July 1. At the end of May, the Saudi customs authority announced an increase of custom duties for a range of imported goods, which came into effect on June 20. On July 2, the authorities announced the extension of private sector (COVID related) support measures that would have expired end-June, including continuing the payment of wage benefits to Saudis working in the private sector through SANED, and further delaying the payment of some taxes and duties. On July 14, the Ministry of Finance launched a SAR 670 million program to help businesses defer loan payments due this year.

Monetary and macro-financial\u00a0\t    The Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) reduced its policy rates twice in March, lowering its reverse repo and repo rates by a combined 1.25 pp to 0.5 and 1 percent respectively. On March 14, SAMA announced a SAR 50 billion ($13.3 billion, 2 percent of GDP) package to support the private sector, particularly SMEs, by providing funding to banks to allow them to defer payments on existing loans and increase lending to businesses. The central bank will also cover fees for private sector stores and entities for point-of-sale and e-commerce transactions for 3 months. A total amount of SAR 100 billion had been used under these programs. SAMA has also instructed banks to delay payments of loans extended to all Saudi employees by 3 months without extra fees, to provide financing needed by customers who lose their jobs and to exempt customers from various banking fees.

Back to Top SenegalBackground. A first positive case was reported on March 2, following which the government declared a national state of emergency in early March and adopted strict containment measures, including suspension of international air travel, closure of borders, limits on inter-regional travel, bans on public gatherings, school closures, and a curfew. These measures succeeded in reducing the daily number of new positive cases to an average of under 20 in September-October after hovering around 100 from May to August. However, like in most other sub-Saharan African countries, a second wave of the pandemic is underway since November 2020, with growth in new daily cases up to about 1 percent (1,653 new cases over the last week) at end February 2021.Reopening of the economy. The containment measures and the sudden stop of travel and tourism contributed to a significant economic slowdown in the first half of 2020, exacerbated by declining export demand and lower remittances. The President lifted the state of emergency and curfew on June 30. International air travel has resumed, while some restrictions on travel from and to the EU countries which apply restrictions to Senegal.  The government adopted a revised 2020 budget to make space for an economic and social resilience program to respond to COVID-19 crisis; execution of the revised 2020 budget was marked by the robust implementation of measures covered by this program. Economic activity started to rebound in May 2020 and a V-shaped recovery appeared to take hold in Q3. However, in light of the second wave of COVID-19, the President announced  the deployment of new mechanisms for managing disasters and health crises, with the implementation by members of the Government, governors and prefects of appropriate security and health measures.. Given the concentration of new COVID-19 cases in the two largest cities (Dakar and Thies), curfews were declared for both cities and markets were closed.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    In 2020 the government implemented and economic and resilience package of up to 7 percent of GDP anchored in a revised budget. It consists of four main pillars: (i) improving the health system, (ii) strengthening social protection, (iii) stabilizing the economy and the financial system to support the private sector and employment, and (iv) securing supplies and distribution for key foodstuffs, medicine and energy products.  A precise assessment of the implementation of these measures will take place over the next few weeks.        Health system: The government has allocated FCFA 78,7 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) to improve testing, treatment, and prevention.        Social protection: One million households received food aid (FCFA 69 billion) and utility payments for (for water and electricity) for poorer customers were suspended for a 2-month period (FCFA 18,5 billion).            Stabilizing the economy: Hard-hit sectors such as tourism and transport received direct support of about FCFA 100 billion. The government has also set up a partial credit guarantee scheme for companies affected by the COVID-19 crisis for a total amount of CFAF 200 billion (CFAF 100 billion for credit to large companies with a 20 percent state guarantee and CFAF 100 billion for small enterprises with a state guarantee of 50 percent). However, the uptake has been low and the government has revised the design of this mechanism to make it more attractive in the context of the 2021-21 recovery plan. An expedited payment of unmet obligations aimed at strengthening firms balance sheets (FCFA 200 billion instead of the FCFA 121 billion foreseen in the initial budget). On the tax side, the deadline for paying suspended tax obligations was extended from 12 to 24 months to improve the liquidity of firms.      The policy focus is shifting to supporting the nascent recovery and the government has revised its flagship national development strategy \u201cPlan Senegal Emergent\u201d to reflect lessons from the pandemic. This has resulted in a new action plan (PAP2A) with a renewed emphasis on reaching self-sufficiency and reduce the reliance on imports for food (notably rice), pharmaceutical products, and health services; the plan also aims to support a return to strong and inclusive private sector-led growth, by accelerating structural transformation. \tThe government is  finalizing plans to address (i) the consequences of the second wave of pandemic, both in terms of vaccination and pandemic containment measures, as well as (ii) the economic impact of the crisis. At the moment there are no firm estimates of the additional fiscal costs. The the vaccination campaign started on February 23 with 200.000 vaccines bought from China with domestic resources. The government plans to vaccinate 20 percent of the population by end-2021 and 60 percent by the end of the first quarter of 2022.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity. In April 2020, the BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25 basis points lower than before the crisis. In June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance institutions to accommodate demands from solvent customers with Covid19-related repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period debt service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims as non-performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched a special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of 3-month \"Covid-19 T-Bills\" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The amount outstanding of such special T-Bills initially issued by Senegal was equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP, with some rollover possibility through similar bonds benefitting from a refinancing rate equivalent to the prevailing monetary policy rate but to be all paid back by end-2020. The BCEAO has launched in February 2021 a special 6-month refinancing window at the floor of the interest rate corridor to help WAEMU governments meet Covid recovery funding needs. Through this special window banks shall be able to refinance all bonds with maturity of 3 years or more governments currently plan to issue on the regional financial market in 2021. The amount of bonds eligible to the new refinancing window for Senegal is equivalent to 4 percent of projected 2021 GDP. The new refinancing window is expected to remain in place for the term of the eligible bonds issued in 2021. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basel II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead of 2022 as initially planned. In addition, in June 2020 the West African Development Bank (BOAD) created a CFAF 100 billion window to extend 5 to 7 year refinancing of banks\u2019 credit to SMEs in the 8 WAEMU member countries. In December 2020, the BCEAO instructed WAEMU banks to refrain from distributing dividends with a view to strengthening their capital buffers in anticipation of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on asset quality.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top SerbiaBackground. Serbia reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case on March 6, 2020.

A state guarantee scheme for bank loans to SMEs has been approved (RSD 240bn), as well new loans to SMEs from the Development Fund (RSD 24bn).    A second round of measures was adopted in late July, including wage subsidies for SME employees for another two months (RSD 36 billion), and deferment of labor taxes and social security contributions for all private companies for an additional month (RSD 30 billion).        In late August, the authorities announced one-off fiscal support to help hotels in cities, through a fixed subsidy per room and per bed, with a cost of about 0.02 percent of GDP.    In early November, the authorities announced that public-sector health workers will receive a one-off assistance of RSD 10,000 by the end of the year (estimated cost of about 0.02 percent of GDP).\tNew measures were announced in February 2021, including: (i) three months of wage subsidies (RSD 73bn); (ii) additional payments for employees in travel and hospitality; (iii) EUR 30 universal cash transfers to all adult citizens, in May and November (RSD 43bn); (iv) a pension bonus (RSD 8.5bn); and (v) support for the transport sector and for city hotels (RSD 3bn).

Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 12, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) cut the key policy rate from 2.25 percent to 1.75 percent and narrowed the interest rate corridor from   1.25 pp to   1 pp relative to the key policy rate. On April 9, the NBS cut the policy rate from 1.75 percent to 1.5 percent. On June 11, it cut the policy rate again to 1.25 percent. It has also provided liquidity (both in dinars and euros) to banks through additional EUR/RSD swap auctions and repo purchase auctions and outright purchases of dinar government securities, and reduced the FX swap interest rates (NBS deposit facility rate plus 10 bp for dinars and 0 percent for euros). Moreover, the NBS introduced a 3-months moratorium on all repayments under bank loans and financial leasing agreements. In May, local-currency denominated corporate bonds became eligible for open market operations (OMOs) and as collateral for banks to receive daily liquidity loans and short-term liquidity from the NBS. On June 11, the NBS relaxed the loan-to-value (LTV) cap for first-home buyers mortgage loans, increasing the limit from 80% to 90%.     In July, the NBS set up a repo line arrangement with the ECB to address possible euro liquidity needs of Serbian financial institutions. Under this repo line, the ECB provides euro liquidity (up to EUR 1 billion) to the NBS in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral. Moreover, a new 2-month moratorium was introduced, relieving debtors of repaying their liabilities during August and September.     In August, the NBS adopted a new set of temporary measures through 2021 intended to provide easier access to housing loans for individuals. These measures include the earlier approval of mortgages before construction is completed, the possibility of extending mortgage repayment periods, and a temporary relaxation of the approval procedure for short-term dinar loans up to a certain amount.    In November, the NBS announced additional FX-purchase swap auctions and securities purchase repo auctions on a weekly basis to provide liquidity to the system.    In December, the NBS adopted new measures to support debtors (corporates and households) affected by the pandemic. These measures envisage rescheduling and refinancing of bank loans and a six-month grace period with extension of repayment terms.\tIn February 2021, the NBS and the ECB agreed to extend the duration of the precautionary repo line with the ECB to address possible euro liquidity needs of Serbian financial institutions. The repo line, initially planned to last until end-June 2021, has been extended for nine months, until end-March 2022.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The NBS has intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market to maintain a relatively stable exchange rate during the crisis period.    Back to Top SeychellesBackground. Seychelles has avoided outbreak of COVID-19 inside the country, following the first cases recorded in early March. The government has adopted containment measures, including social distancing, travel bans on visitors from high-risk regions, screening at ports of entry, and school closures. Given that about 30 percent of the GDP directly or indirectly relates to tourism sector, the disruption to global tourism can have an adverse impact on the economy. Inflation has been contained so far as lower oil prices offset the impact of a depreciating rupee and supply side disruptions.Reopening of the economy.. Mandatory work-from-home was lifted on April 30. On May 18, all schools were reopened. On June 1, the country reopened its border to passenger flights, limited to chartered flights only from low-risk countries. Some commercial flights from low-risk and medium risk countries have been allowed to enter the country starting on August 1. After Seychelles started experiencing community transmission in December 2020, some restrictions on movement have been reimposed. As of January 4, Seychelles has entered its second \u201clockdown\u201d (albeit on a less severe scale than the first one the previous year). Masks were made mandatory, public gatherings are being drastically restricted, restaurants, movie theaters, churches, gyms, night clubs and many more of our favorite pastime activities have been forced into temporary closure. In late January, in a bid to curb community transmissions and the spread of COVID-19, the restrictions on movement were extended to February 15 and new stringent measures introduced, including overnight curfew. All who have tested positive are in isolation and contact-tracing and testing efforts continue. Additionally, given emergence of the new strain of the virus, with effect from December 31, South Africa has been removed from the list of countries from which visitors may travel to the country. In late January 2021, the border reopened to all vaccinated tourists upon presentation of a negative PCR test. Seychelles is the first African country to launch a vaccination campaign. The authorities have secured enough vaccines and embarked on a campaign to achieve herd immunity through vaccination by mid-March 2021, after which the border will be open to all tourists. The nation is now ranked among the highest in the world in terms of share of population vaccinated, with second dose of vaccine to start being administered on February 5. Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    In April 2020, the government has announced a measure - The Financial Assistance for Job Retention (FA4JR) program \u2013 to subsidize wages for companies facing distress caused by COVID-19. From July, Seychelles Employee Transition Scheme (SETS) was set up to facilitate the reskilling and placement in an economic activity of persons made redundant as a result of COVID-19. This program works alongside the wage subsidy to aid the transition to a post-COVID economy. Initially planned to last 3 months, wage subsidy has been fully extended to February 2021. In March 2021, it will be phased out by reducing the scope of beneficiaries and fully abolished as of April 2021. The fiscal cost is estimated up to about 5 percent of 2020 GDP. In early September, additional measures were introduced to support households and firms: Clients of the Home Finance Company (HFC) and the Property Management Corporation (PMC) will benefit from a 25 percent support on their loan repayments between Sep 1, 2020 and Dec 31, 2021; from Sep 10, Small Business Support Fund (SBSF) facility was launched, which will provide interest-free loans to small businesses.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) reduced the policy rate by 100 bps to 4 percent on March 23. On the same day, it announced that a credit facility of approximately SCR500 m would be set up to assist commercial banks with emergency relief measures to support businesses and individuals struggling with the financial impact of the pandemic. The CBS also announced that commercial banks, the Development Bank of Seychelles (DBS) and the Seychelles Credit Union have agreed to consider a moratorium of up to six months on the repayment of principal and interest on loans to assist businesses in impacted sectors. The moratorium for individuals is up to three months. In early September, the banking community has agreed to continue offering and prolonging the measures announced in March to assist their individual as well as business customers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.     The National Assembly has allowed the Central Bank to provide (i) a limited credit to government up to SCR 500 mill, preferably through purchase of securities, and subject to central bank Board approval; and (ii) extending the maturity of credit to commercial banks to 3 years. In May, a credit facility was established to assist commercial banks with emergency relief measures to support small- and medium-sized enterprises and another credit facility to support large enterprises was established. The two lines provide 70 percent and 50 percent support respectively. As of January 7, 11.89% of SCR500 mill allocated for MSMEs and 10.23% of SCR750 mill allocated for large enterprises has been used. On October 29, CBS extended the credit facilities until May 16, 2021 and June 20, 2021 respectively. The CBS will continue to monitor potential market stress and any emerging risks to the financial sector and the economy. The CBS cut the policy rate by 100 bps again to 3 percent, effective of July 1. In the Governor\u2019s own words, another financial instrument put in place to help the economy and business affected by the pandemic is treasury bills which    the economic agents can invest in and convert into liquidity at need.

Back to Top Sierra LeoneBackgroundSierra Leone\u2019s second wave of infections in early 2021\u2014which saw daily cases exceeding the previous peak in May-June 2020\u2014appears to be abating. Cumulative cases exceeded 3800 by late February. At the onset of the pandemic, the Government decisively implemented prevention measures, including a 12-month state of emergency. The Government temporarily re-introduced some restrictions in late January after a period of progressive easing since mid-2020. They continue to partner with the WHO to improve testing capacity, recently issuing a public notice on the availability of testing sites. The first vaccines (from SinoPharm in China) arrived in late February and totaled 200,000 doses\tBorder controls and closure. Mandatory quarantine on entering the country and closure of land borders. International passenger flights were suspended during March July 2020.\tSocial distancing. The first wave of restrictions in 2020 closed education institutions; discouraged large gatherings; restricted access to beaches and entertainment; limited passengers on public transport; and required use of face masks. The second wave of restrictions in January 2021 included limits on restaurants and religious services and banned audiences at sporting events.\tLockdown.The partial lockdown\u2014in place since April\u2014restricted non-essential inter-district travel, reduced public working hours; and imposed a national curfew (initially 9pm-7am, later 11pm-5am, lifted in October). Two full lockdowns in 2020 (April\u00a05-7 and May\u00a03-5) required all to stay home. Though inter-district travel restrictions were lifted in late June 2020, restrictions were reintroduced on travel between the Western Area (effectively the capital, Freetown) and other districts for a two-week period starting January 25. A curfew (10pm-5am) was reintroduced on January 21.Key Policy Responses as of Early March 4 2021Fiscal\t    The fiscal response focuses on containment, critical health needs, and the socio-economic impact of the crisis. The Health Response Plan was formulated in collaboration with development partners, including the World Bank via a $7.5 million health system support operation approved in early April. On April 22, the government introduced incentives for healthcare workers, including a risk allowance, as well as plans to recruit 4,000 additional health workers. The authorities\u2019 Quick Action Economic Response Program (QAERP) seeks to mitigate the broader socio economic impact by: ensuring a stable supply of essential commodities and food; providing support to small and medium enterprises; and scaling up social protection and public works. The IMF disbursed $143 million in emergency assistance in early June and the World Bank\u2019s budget support of $101.6 million was disbursed in mid-July.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    At an emergency Monetary Policy Committee meeting on March 18, the BSL decided to: (i) reduce the monetary policy rate (mostly signaling) from 16.5 percent to 15 percent, effective March 19; (ii) create a special credit facility (Le 500 billion) to support production, procurement and distribution of essential goods; and (iii) extend the reserve requirement maintenance period from 14 to 28 days to ease tight liquidity. At the December 17 MPC meeting, the BSL reduced the policy rate another percentage point to 14 percent. The other measures announced in March 2020 remain in effect.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    Following the March 18 MPC meeting, the central bank announced its intention to provide FX resources to ensure the importation of essential goods. The exchange rate has, so far, been allowed to adjust.    Back to Top SingaporeBackground. Singapore experienced a sharp increase in COVID-19 infections in April 2020 andsafe distancing measures were considerably intensified to break the trend of increasing local transmission. In view of a sustained decrease in community transmissions, the Government announced a three-phased approach to resume activities starting June 2.As community infection rates have remained low and generally stable,Phase Two commenced on June 19, and Phase Three, with further relaxation of social distancing measures, started on December 28, 2020.

In early March, the authorities established a COVID-19 response coordination committee led by the Prime Minister and, in coordination with the WHO and the UN, the Ministry of Health has taken measures to contain the spread of the outbreak and to strengthen health systems. These include restricting large meetings and gatherings; closing schools and universities; closing borders suspending international and domestic flights; and intensifying communication through various channels including radio, TV and social media. As of April 15, 2020 they imposed an evening curfew. As Somalia was ill-prepared to cope with any significant outbreak, Somalia\u2019s partners and the Ministry of Health have launched a Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP) to address the immediate humanitarian and socio-economic consequences. These efforts focused on averting large-scale community spread through risk communication; testing; contact tracing; distribution of PPE to health workers; undertaking measures to mitigate risks to Internally Displaced Populations, refugees, asylum seekers and host communities; and minimizing risks at detention facilities.Reopening of the economy. During the summer of 2020, the Somali authorities have implemented  a phased approach to reopening the economy. Domestic and international flights resumed on July 5 and August 3, respectively, and public schools reopened on August 15. In December 2020,  the Somalia authorities  applied for the  COVAX support , and a National Coordinating Committee (NCC) for the COVID-19 vaccine introduction was set up  in coordination with UNICEF and WHO. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI)  supports the procurement of vaccines for 20 percent of the population in the first phase and the World Bank will support the procurement for the remainder of the population in the subsequent phase.  Somalia is expected to receive 1.4 million doses of the vaccine under the COVAX facility this month. A second deadlier wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has started in February 2021. In February alone, 2473 new cases and 109 deaths were reported compared with 70 and zero, respectively in January. The positivity rate has increased to about 10 percent in February from less than one percent in January. Health experts  suspect that new Covid-19 variants, and recent large political and religious gathering could be the root causes of  new infections. In response, the authorities have reintroduced new (stringent) containment measures, including (but not limited to): (1) Reintroduction of work-from-home for government workers, with the exception of essential workers; (2) closure of schools and universities for two weeks (starting on February 23); (3) suspension of passport applications until further notice; (4) mandatory facemask in all public spaces; (5) suspension of public gathering and at least a 2-meter social distance to be observed by people attending permitted meetings; but this measure is drawing criticisms from the opposition citing the use of restrictions to stop planned protests; (6) travelers should show negative PCR test result (within 72 hours of travel) and should observe (8 to 14 days) quarantine upon arrival; and (7) weddings and special parties are suspended and sports arenas and gyms have been closed.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Effective April 15, 2020 the authorities introduced a three-month tax holiday on some specific basic commodities (including rice), reduced consumption tax on some additional basic goods by 50 percent and lifted restrictions on imports of rice from Vietnam.

Back to Top Sri LankaThe spread of COVID-19 was limited to 3380 cases by end-September, but a new local outbreak in October 2020 has caused significant further transmission with more than 80,000 additional cases, leading to containment measures in the affected areas. Vaccinations began in January 2021. Sri Lanka is expected to receive 4 million doses of the vaccine free of charge through the WHO Covax facility and a further 800,000 doses from India and China. Sri Lanka\u2019s airports reopened in January 2021, after being closed to international tourists from mid-March 2020. Amid net capital outflows of around 0.7 percent of GDP in 2020, the Sri Lankan currency depreciated by 2.6 percent against the US dollar in 2020. Sri Lanka\u2019s EMBIG spread has risen to above three times its mid-February 2020 level.  Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government has allocated up to 0.1 percent of GDP for containment measures, as well as US$5 million (0.01 percent of GDP) to the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund. Cash transfers totaling around 0.6 percent of GDP were made to vulnerable groups in 2020. The 2020 H1 payment deadlines for income tax, VAT and certain other taxes were extended until end-Dec. Income tax arrears of SMEs have been partially waived off, more relaxed payment terms have been approved and legal actions against non-payers have been frozen. The President has also established a Task Force on Economic Revival and Poverty Eradication and a special fund for containment, mitigation and social welfare spending, inviting local and foreign tax-free donations.

Commercial banks could not declare dividends, share buybacks, or increased payments to directors until end-2020. There has been a debt repayment moratorium, including a moratorium until April 2021 on bank loans for the tourism, garment, plantation and IT sectors, and SMEs, with CBSL providing refinancing and concessional lending facilities of 1 percent of GDP, partially supported by a CBSL guarantee. In addition, the construction sector is eligible to borrow from banks with government guarantees. There was a three-month moratorium on small-value personal banking and leasing loans. The interest rate on credit cards, overdrafts and pawning facilities will be capped.

Sudan received the first quantity 828,000 doses of the COVID 19 vaccine provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). The authorities plan to vaccinate citizens in all parts of the country free of charge. In the first stage 20 percent of the total number of the targeted people are expected to be vaccinated. In the second wave of COVID-19, the total daily infections are marginally declining as reported in the health ministry\u2019s epidemiological report. While rejecting re-imposition of a lockdown, the council of ministers approved a reduction in the working days of the staff. As a result, various ministries have reduced their workforce by 50 percent, while also allowing pregnant and breast feeding women and those over the age of fifty not to come to work; officials have also encouraged people to take precautionary measures including social distancing, wearing masks, and sterilizing surfaces. Various universities have suspended classes. While the mutated strain has not yet been detected in Sudan, medical officials fear an increase in COVID cases if the strain enters Sudan.While the economy appears to have bounced back following the COVID-19 lockdown, the second wave brings renewed uncertainty. The economic impact from COVID-19 and nearly 6- months of containment measures has increased unemployment and the price of basic foods, and caused exports to decline, exacerbating the macroeconomic challenges the country was already facing. Fiscal revenues reportedly declined by 46 percent. The negative supply shock combined with continued monetization of the fiscal deficit has led to massive depreciation and inflation (304 percent as of January 2020). The already weak health system in Sudan has also suffered from the deaths of medical professionals.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The Prime Minister has denied reports that the government plans to lift subsidies on medicines. He also stated that an agreement has been reached with the Central Bank of Sudan to provide $55 million in foreign currency to support both the local production and the imports of medicines. This announcement followed an announcement of a work stoppage by medics working in the isolation ward of a hospital in Khartoum, who demanded improvement of their working environment and complaining about the lack of medicines, including basic medicines for coronavirus patients    The revised 2020 budget was approved by the Sovereign Council on August 10, 2020; the budget reflects the commitments under their home-grown 12-month SMP (July1, 2020 \u2013 June 30, 2020).  The approved budget includes new policy measures to address the current dire economic situation and reduce the impact of COVID-19. Key policy measures include removal of subsidies on gasoline and diesel, and exchange rate reforms, as well as increased domestic revenue mobilization. Sudan has very low domestic revenue collection, which declined by 40 percent due to the pandemic.      While not directly related COVID-19, the international community also pledged support of US$ 1.8 billion for the authorities\u2019 broader macroeconomic reform agenda during a Partnership Conference held in Berlin, Germany on June 25, 2020. While most of the funds will go to humanitarian assistance and related projects, a sizable portion will support a 12-month Sudan Family Support program to provide direct cash transfer to 80 percent of the population. The disbursement of these funds has not taken place yet, as the donors are waiting for exchange rate reforms to be implemented.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The government has drafted regulations on forbearance of loan repayments for three months to ease the pressure on private sector.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No specific measures are taken to deal with COVID-19.     Back to Top SurinameBackground. The first confirmed case was reported on March 13, 2020.

In September, authorities approved additional support to municipalities to cover COVID-19-related costs (SEK 5.5. billion in 2020) and to sole traders (SEK 3.5 billion in 2020 and SEK 1.5 billion in 2021).    For 2021 and 2022, the Government proposed extensive fiscal stimulus measures and reforms worth SEK 105 billion and SEK 85 billion (2.1 and 1.7 percent of 2019 GDP, respectively).    On November 9, the Government proposed the extension of short-term lay-offs by seven months (until June 30, 2021), reorientation support and turnover-based support to sole traders by three months (until October 2020), and tax deferrals by one year (until March 2022).

Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top SwitzerlandBackground. Switzerland was one of the countries in Europe hit early and hard by COVID-19. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on February 24, 2020. On March 16 2020, the Federal Council (FC) declared a\u00a0national state of emergency , closing all shops, restaurants, bars and entertainment facilities and schools (with exceptions for food stores and pharmacies), prohibiting public gatherings of 5 people or more, and recommending that all citizens stay home. Some heavily-affected cantons imposed tighter restrictions on activities. The government also introduced controls at all borders, with entry restrictions in place for citizens of both Schengen and non-Schengen countries. The number of active and new cases decreased sharply from mid/late April, but rose again since mid-June with greater mobility and more testing (particularly in some cantons).Reopening the economy. From mid-April, 2020, the authorities followed a well-articulated 3-phase plan to gradually reopen the economy, making adjustments depending on developments. As noted in the \u201csecond wave\u201d section below, many eased restrictions were restored after mid-October. Previously, activities and businesses such as medical and dental practices and hair salons resumed operations from April 27. A further easing on May 11 reopened primary and secondary schools, shops and markets, travel agencies, museums and libraries, and restaurants, bars and pubs, and allowed activities such as exams at educational institutions and some sports. Religious services were allowed from May 28. On May 27, the FC decided to ease most of remaining restrictive measures from June 6, including permitting events with up to 300 people, and it announced that the national state of emergency would conclude on June 19. Events with more than 300 but less than 1,000 people were allowed from June 22, and events with with 1,000+ people resumed from October 1 (but were prohibited again shortly after due to the second wave). Border restrictions were also been gradually loosened from May 11, in consultation with neighboring countries. On June 15, COVID-19 related entry restrictions were lifted for all EU/EFTA states and the United Kingdom. On July 6, the restrictions on the admission of workers from some third countries (i.e. outside the EU and EFTA) were lifted. On July 1, following a similar decision by the EU, Switzerland decided to reopen the borders to 13 non-EU countries and 5 EU countries outside the Schengen area from July 20. The lists of countries with which Switzerland has open borders and of high-risk locations with mandatory quarantine for arrivals to Switzerland are periodically reviewed. In view of the increasing volume of people travelling and the rising number of new infections since mid-June, the FC decided on July 1 to make masks compulsory on all public transport from July 6 and on all flights taking off or landing in Switzerland from August 15. Some cantons reintroduced additional restrictions, such as limiting public events to 100 people. On September 18, Switzerland confirmed its participation in the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX) initiative, a procurement mechanism joined by countries around the world to ensure a fair distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally.Second wave.The number of new cases started to surge again in mid-September, 2020. By mid-October, the daily infections had reached a level well above Spring 2020 highs. On October 19, the FC re-introduced several containment measures , including mandatory mask requirement for all publicly accessible indoor spaces and public transport areas, restrictions on public gatherings, and reactivation of working-from-home recommendations. On October 28, the FC  further measures to counter the rapid spread of the coronavirus, including: (i) expanding mask requirement and introducing rapid COVID-19 tests; (ii) closing discos and dance halls, (iii) requiring bars and restaurants to close at 11 p.m.; (iv) prohibiting all public events with more than 50 people as well as sporting and cultural leisure activities with more than 15 people; and (v) requiring universities to switch to distance learning from November 2nd. The FC decided to use the army again to support the health system on November 4, and announced a second civil protection mandate on November 18. Also on November 18, the FC amended the ordinance on proximity tracing, to further facilitate Covid-19 contact tracing through the SwissCovid app. Some cantons once again imposed tighter restrictions. Notably, Geneva and Jura declared cantonal state of emergencies with additional measures coming into force on November 2, as intensive care hospital beds in these regions filled up with COVID-19 patients. As the number of new infection cases remained high, and hospitals were approaching their capacity, the FC announced tighter restrictions on December 11, including: (a) 7:00 pm and Sunday closure for places such as museums, libraries, shops, and markets, and 7:00 pm closure for restaurants and bars, with exceptions for cantons with an improved epidemiological situation; (b) a ban on public events, with exceptions for small religious services and funerals; (c) a recommendation of a two-household limit for private gatherings; and (d) a limit of 5 people for sports and culture group activities. On December 18, the FC tightened restrictions again on December 18, closing restaurants as well as cultural, leisure and sports facilities. On December 21, to contain the spread of the new variant of the virus from the UK and South Africa, the FC introduced entry ban and retroactive quarantine for people from the two countries. In January 2021, as the number of daily infections remained high, the FC had continuously adjusted the containment measures accordingly. On January 6, the FC decided to remove the exception rule for tightened restrictions previously allowed for cantons with improved Covid-19 situations. On January 13, the FC decided to extend the measures introduced in December 2020 by five weeks to the end of February, and announced that starting from January 18, remote work would be mandatory where possible, shops selling non-essential goods would be closed, and stricter rules would be applied to private events and gatherings. On January 27, the FC (i) imposed negative test requirements for travelers arriving from high risk states or areas, (ii) required contact details to be collected for all travelers entering Switzerland, (iii) decided to encourage people without symptoms to be tested by covering the costs, and (iv) adjusted the rules to allow a shorter quarantine period, conditional upon a negative test result at the end of the 7th day. Vaccination started in late December 2020, soon after the first vaccine was approved by Swissmedic. By the end of February, around 9.3 percent of the population have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccines.Second reopening of the economy. Tightened containment measures and progress on vaccination have led to a gradual decline in daily new cases, with the 7-day average dropping from some 1,500 at beginning of February to current 1,000 or so. The improved epidemic situation allowed the government to reopen the economy once again through cautious steps: On March 1, shops, museums, and library reading rooms were reopened, as well as outdoor areas of sports and leisure facilities, zoos and botanical gardens. Meetings with family and friends and sporting and cultural activities with up to 15 people were again permitted outdoors. Adolescents and young adults up to the age of 20 could take up most of the sporting and cultural activities again. The next opening step will likely take place on March 22, and the final decision will be made on March 19.Key Policy Responses as of March 3, 2021FISCAL (FEDERAL LEVEL)\t    During the first wave of the pandemic, the FC announced a series of federal-level support packages amounting to CHF73 billion (10.4 percent of 2019 GDP). March 13 package (CHF10 billion ) included up to CHF8 billion for partial unemployment compensation, CHF1 billion for financial aid to particularly-affected firms, CHF580 million for loan guarantees for SMEs, and the rest for loss compensation for cancelled events. A second package (March 20, CHF32 billion) included: (i) extension of short-time work allowances and simplification of the application process; (ii) a guarantee program up to CHF20 billion to support bridging loans to SMEs (details); (iii) temporary, interest-free deferral of social-security contribution payments for affected companies; (iv) extended payment periods for taxes and payables to federal suppliers without incurrence of interest on arrears; and (v) compensation for loss of earnings for self-employed people (SE) and for some employees affected by official measures to combat the coronavirus (e.g., parents who need to take care of children with closing of schools).On March 25, additional measures of around CHF600 million per month were introduced. An April 3 package doubled the size of the loan guarantee program to CHF40 billion. On April 8 and 16, the short-time work program was twice expanded to cover on-call workers and more SE, respectively. On April 22, the FC extended the loss compensation for SE to May 16, even if they had reopened their businesses on an earlier date; and expanded the loan guarantee program for startups. On April 29, the FC announced CHF1.9 billion credit support to airlines and aviation-related businesses. The take-up of bridge loans under the federal guarantee program, which expired on July 31 (the program for startups will expire at the end of August), and assistance to self-employed, which was originally scheduled to expire on September 16, had been lower than budgeted.    In the reopening phase, the focus of the government has shifted from providing an emergency lifeline to the economy to fine-tuning various support measures and ensuring policy continuity as the country transitions back to a more normalized situation, including, for instance, preparing  the COVID-19 Act. so that some ordinances issued during the national emergency do not automatically expire after six months. On July 1, the government announced that it would: (i) provide additional financing help to public transport and rail freight companies ; (ii) extend the revenue compensation for self-employed persons to mid-September; (iii) extend the maximum period of receiving short-time work compensation from 12 months to 18 months; (iv) scale back COVID-19 related financial support to international sports organizations ; and (v) legislate a new law to regulate the bridge loan guarantee program beyond the period of national emergency. On August 12, the government announced  a new set of fiscal measures , including CHF400 million financial support to air traffic control company legal standstill for travel agencies and the simplified regulation for unemployment insurance to the end of 2020.    As more restrictions on economic activities are put in place to contain the second wave of the pandemic, the government continues its efforts to support the economy, by extending and/or expanding measures already in place and with a focus on helping groups and sectors that are suffering prolonged negative impact from the crisis. On October 14, the FC announced an extension of the support to the cultural sector to the end of 2021. On November 4, the FC issued guidelines for government loans to support professional and semi-professional sport clubs. In addition, the FC also extended the short-time work scheme coverage for employees on demand and the compensation of income losses for SE, both to June 31, 2021. In a \u201cpackage\u201d announced on November 11, the FC increased credit for procurement of Covid-19 vaccine, renewed measures in the area of occupational benefits,  extended transitional supports to the media, and launched a stimulus program, \u201cInnovation SwitzerlandInnovation Switzerland\u201d, aimed at helping companies to maintain their innovative strength during the pandemic. On November 18, the FC announced proposals for additional Covid-19 support measures,  including joint hardship support programs with cantons, wider coverage of the short-time work scheme, and grants for professional and semi-professional sport clubs. On November 25, the FC announced the adoption of the COVID-19 Hardship Assistance Ordinance, a joint effort with cantonal governments to support viable firms that suffered severe losses from the Covid-19 pandemic. On December 11, the FC made a request to the Parliament for more flexibility regarding the eligibility to receive the hardship support, and proposed to expand the total size of this program from CHF1 billion to CHF2.5 billion. On December 18, the FC: (i) further adjusted the hardship ordinance, lowering the turnover threshold for support from CHF100,000 to CHF50,000, allowing qualifying companies to receive double subsidies, while imposing a tighter ban of dividends; (ii) reduced the income loss requirement for self-employed persons to receive compensations; (iii) increased the support for the cultural sector; and (iv) further loosened, or extended the already-loosened, regulations on the short-time work program. As tighter restrictive measures were imposed in January 2021, the FC also expanded the fiscal support to help cushion the negative impact on the economy. On January 13, the FC loosened the eligibility criteria and conditionalities for the hardship support program, and increased the limit of support that a firm could receive. On January 20, the FC once again adjusted rules of the short-time work scheme to extend and expand its coverage. On January 27, the FC announced additional federal fiscal support packages of up to CHF8.5 billion, which include: (i) financing of the short-time work program for 2021; (ii) doubling the size of the hardship support program to CHF5 billion; (iii) additional costs for Covid-19 tests, and (iv) an extension of the maximum unemployment benefit coverage by three months. On February 17, the FC announced to increase the size of the hardship support program from CHF5 billion to CHF10 billion, including CHF3 billion dedicated to help larger firms previously not covered by the program. In addition, the FC added CHF940 million to compensate income losses for self-employed people. The entire February-17 package, which also included some other measures such as additional Covid-19 tests and vaccination coverage, amounted to around CHF6 billion.    Monetary and macro-financial\t        To address liquidity bottlenecks, the FC on March 18 ordered a        debt enforcement standstill from March 19 to April 4. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) activated a U.S. dollar liquidity swap line with the U.S. Federal Reserve,     lowered the interest rate, offered a new 84-day maturity , and  increased the frequency of the 7-day maturity operations from weekly to    daily (reduced to 3 times per week since July 1 and to once a week from September 1). In addition, the        SNB announced on March 19 that starting April 1, the threshold factor for exempting sight    deposits from negative interest rates would be raised from 25 to 30. On March 25, the SNB introduced a new COVID-19 refinancing facility that would operate in    conjunction with the federal government\u2019s guarantees for corporate loans, allowing banks to obtain liquidity from the SNB. This facility was subsequently revised to allow use of loans guaranteed by cantons as a collateral. The SNB\u2019s request for deactivation of the countercyclical capital buffer was        approved by the FC on March 27. On July 1, the SNB adjusted the rate calculation for its liquidity-shortage financing facility , effectively lowering the borrowing cost from this facility. Through end-August, the SNB has maintained its policy rate at -0.75 percent. On the supervisory front, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) introduced a temporary exclusion of deposits held at central banks from the calculation of banks\u2019 leverage ratio (extended on May 19, 2020 to until January 1, 2021). FINMA emphasized that the capital released from this relaxation should be used to support liquidity provision and is not to be distributed as dividends or other similar distributions related to 2019.        Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The SNB has increased its interventions in the FX market to limit appreciation of the Swiss franc and bought an equivalent to CHF 101 billion in the first three quarters of 2020. Sight deposits held at the SNB have increased by around CHF115.4 billion (or 16.4 percent of 2020 GDP) since early February 2020, a proxy for the total amount of Swiss franc liquidity injected through FX interventions, repo operations, and the COVID-19 refinancing facility.    TBack to Top TajikistanBackground. Tajikistan reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case on May 1, 2020. The authorities have instituted a high-level task force and taken a range of measures to contain the spread of the virus, including border closures, travel restrictions, and suspending prayers at mosques. On June 5, Tajikistan President issued a decree on Countering the Socio-Economic Impact of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe human and economic impact in Tajikistan. Trade and transportation disruptions have led to a sharp drop in remittances and government revenues and created urgent balance of payments and fiscal financing needs. Reopening of the economy. On June 6, the government presented a reopening plan. Accordingly, bazaars, cafes, beauty and hairdressing salons, and barber shops along other businesses are expected to resume operations in Tajikistan starting on June 15. All businesses must adhere strict cautionary measures, including regular disinfection of premises and observance of social distancing. While restrictions on public transport will be removed and intercity travel remains open, international flights are not expected to resume until further notice. Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020Fiscal\t    The authorities are seeing a decline in revenues and higher spending. The authorities have requested disbursement under IMF Rapid Credit Facility instrument. On May 6, The IMF Executive Board approved a disbursement of US $ 189.5 million for budget support to help Tajikistan. Discussions with other development partners, including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank are ongoing on financial support to Tajikistan. The authorities are concerned about debt sustainability and are preparing consolidation measures that can be implemented over the medium term.    The Government is providing VAT exemptions on essential imports, lump-sum assistance equivalent to minimum wage to vulnerable households and other socially disadvantaged groups. Health workers are to receive supplemental pay, while tariff increases on electricity, water, and communal services have been postponed until end of 2020. Government is providing free medical care to citizens placed under medical care and COVID-19 patients, as well as sick leave and compensation benefits. Government is providing grain, seed and fuel to farms to boost food security, and time-bound tax holidays and relief to targeted industries and small businesses until September 1, 2020. Anti-COVID measures also include financial support to SMEs and subsidizing food for population. Recently, Tajikistan was granted a debt relief around USD50 million under G20 DSSI initiative. These funds were also included to anti-COVID envelop under supplementary budget currently being discussed in the Parliament.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The NBT has taken measures to ease monetary and liquidity conditions and adopted an Action Plan to address effects of pandemic on the banking sector. It allowed a one-off 5 percent exchange rate depreciation in March and greater exchange rate flexibility to align the official rate with the market rate is also envisaged. The policy rate was cut by 100 basis points in April and 100 basis points in August to 10.75 percent. On the face of mounting pressures, it lowered reserve requirements, relaxed enforcement of prudential requirements, and provided foreign exchange liquidity. It is also promoting the use of electronic payments to facilitate remote transactions.    Prices of staple goods have pushed headline inflation around outside of the NBT\u2019s target range in April \u2013 May, slowing to 7percent in August. The Presidential decree mandated the Government to administer prices of key consumer goods and medical supplies.     The NBT has relaxed enforcement of prudential requirements to ease banking pressures and maintain credit. In April, the NBT recommended the banks to review loan terms to support borrowers facing temporary difficulties. It also recommended banks to waive penalties for businesses and individuals that face hardships in repaying their loan obligations between May and October 2020. To accommodate these the NBT temporarily (until September) waived supervisory sanctions against those banks that are providing adequate loan loss provisions and as a result fail to meet capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio. Banks have already restructured over 46 thousand loans and these loans are being tracked separately. Despite a temporary waiver of penalties, credit institutions are required to ensure that established prudential requirements are met. The NBT has recommended that credit institutions not pay dividends or bonuses to shareholders, but keep these profits to boost capital. Credit institutions are exempt from paying fees for the settlement system and have been asked to avoid non-essential expenditures. To reduce the impetus for dollarization, the income tax rate for interest income on domestic currency deposits was lowered till end-December 2020 by 5 percent.     In April, required reserve ratios were lowered from 3 percent to 1 percent and from 9 percent to 5 percent for local currency and foreign exchange deposits, respectively. Government plans to disburse preferential loans to food and medical supply producing companies through the Fund for State Support to Entrepreneurship. Interest rate on bank deposits have been lowered from 12 to 6 percent from July 1 to December 31, 2020. The NBT recommended the banks to consider restructuring (i.e extending maturity) loans that face temporary hardship.    \u00a0    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The NBT allowed a one-off 5 percent depreciation of somoni to adjust the official exchange rate with cash market rate. Foreign exchange liquidity has been provided to banks.    Back to Top TanzaniaBackground. The first confirmed cases was reported on March 17, 2020.

Monetary and macro-financial\t        On May 12, the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) reduced the discount rate from 7 percent to 5 percent and reduced collateral haircuts requirements on government securities.            Effective June 8, the BoT Statutory Minimum Reserves requirement is reduced from 7 percent to 6 percent. In addition, the BoT will provide regulatory flexibility to banks and other financial institutions that will carry out loan restructuring operations on a case-by-case basis.            Lastly, the daily transactions limit for mobile money operators was raised from about US $ 1,300 to US $ 2,170 and the daily balance limit was raised from US $ 2,170 to US $ 4,340.

A state of emergency, instituted on March\u00a026, 2020 has been extended to end March 2021. International flights transporting Covid-19 passengers are banned from transiting through Thailand and the government has stepped up border surveillance to stem the import of COVID-19 cases from neighboring countries.  By mid-December 2020, Thailand had recorded just 4,246 infections in a population of almost 70 million. The caseload has however spiked since December and is now reported at 26,108 (on March 3) with 84 fatalities. For the last two weeks, daily new infections have been below 100.Reopening of the economy. Phase 6 of the reopening began on August 1, 2020 allowing entry to certain non-Thai visitors, including: medical tourists, filming crews, Thailand Elite card members, foreigners who have work permits, foreigners married to Thai nationals and foreigners studying at educational institutions. The mandatory 14-day quarantine does not apply to diplomats, but they must get tested at the airport. More than 100,000 migrant workers from nearby Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos have been allowed entry starting on August 1, 2020. In phase 5, schools and high-risk entertainment venues, such as pubs and massage parlors, reopened; and 40 long-distance and tourism trains resumed services. With the recent outbreak, 28 of the 77 provinces were declared high risk, with new curbs on dining hours and bans on alcohol sales in restaurants. Schools were also shut for a month. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha approved  loosening restrictions from the first week of February,2021 to allow businesses and schools to reopen. The special tourist visa (STV) for leisure travelers began on October 20, 2020 allowing tourists to stay in Thailand for up to 90 days, with two further extensions of 90 days each. On December 8, 2020, Thailand eased travel restrictions for citizens from 56 countries. Citizens from these countries could apply for a normal 30-day visa, which would be extended to 45 days, or apply for the Special Tourist Visa. All tourists should have a negative test result within 72 hours of their arrival, go through a second test once they land, and stay in a compulsory quarantine of 14 days on arrival. If any visitors test positive, they should be quarantined for 14 days in a state hospital. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Cabinet has approved a fiscal package with phases\u00a0I,\u00a0II, and\u00a0III amounting to at least 9.6\u00a0percent of GDP or THB\u00a01.5\u00a0trillion including: i)\u00a0health-related spending; ii)\u00a0assistance for workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs affected by Covid-19 (includes THB\u00a05,000 per month per person for three months to about 14\u00a0million non-farm workers outside the social security system and 10\u00a0million farmers); iii)\u00a0support for individuals and businesses through soft loans and tax relief; (iv)\u00a0lower water and electricity bills, and social security contributions; and (v) measures to support local tourism with THB 22 billion in subsidies for tourists and THB 100 bn in soft loans for SMEs in the sector. The Cabinet has extended several soft-loan schemes, including those targeted for micro firms engaged in tourism activities and supply chains, until June 30, 2021. While part of this would be financed within the original FY\u00a02020 budget or by reallocating funds from other financial assets to soft loans, 5.3 percent of GDP or THB\u00a01\u00a0trillion in additional borrowing has been authorized. From July 15 until end-October, 2020, there was also a tourism subsidy package, \u201cWe Travel Together,\u201d covering up to 40 percent of certain travel costs for up to 5 million domestic tourists who must register. 4.65 million registrations have been received so far and 1 percent of the trips have already taken place. In addition, on September 22, 2020 the government passed a new shopping subsidy package for welfare cardholders worth THB 51 billion, financed by the government\u2019s additional borrowing. The government complemented this on October 8, 2020 with income tax deductions (to rebate VAT) on products worth THB 30,000 per person running from October 23 to December 31, 2020, to help boost spending on goods and services. The Cabinet reinstated an early tax cut on jet fuel from THB 4.726 per liter to THB 0.20, which had lapsed at the end of September, 2020, until April 30, 2021.The FY 2021 Budget bill (THB 3.2 trillion) was approved effective October 1, 2020, the first day of the fiscal year. The government unveiled a series of measures in January 2021, including a $7 billion in cash    handouts, to counter the second wave of the outbreak. Under the plan, each beneficiary will receive THB 3,500 per month for two months starting as early as February.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The policy rate was reduced by 75 bps from 1.25 to 0.50 percent during 2020 and the contribution from financial institutions to the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) was reduced from 0.46 to 0.23 percent of the deposit base to provide space for future decreases in lending rates. Further measures were taken to support businesses.\t\t\tThe Bank of Thailand (BOT) is providing up to THB 500 billion to financial institutions to the end of 2021 for on-lending to SMEs, particularly in tourism and tourism-related sectors at 2 percent per year. The government covers the first 6 months of interest and guarantees these loans for 2 years, after which some loans could be guaranteed for up to another eight years for a 1.75 percent per year fee. Some businesses instead of using these soft loans have used existing credit programs for SMEs, which has maximized the use of funds previously set aside by the BOT.\tA loan payment holiday for businesses of 6 months for SMEs that expired October 22, 2020 (which also included a suspension of principal and reduction of interest on the debts to SFIs) during which time banks were encouraged to engage in debt restructuring so that payments resumed at the end of the holiday (see next point).\tThe BOT relaxed some regulations from January 1, 2020 (retroactively) to December 31, 2021 regarding classification of borrowers and levels of loan loss provision so that financial institutions could accelerate debt restructuring. Borrowers not yet classified as NPL or even those classified as NPL borrowers because of COVID-19 impacts can be immediately classified as normal if they could make repayments in accordance with a debt restructuring agreement, which would not considered be a Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR).\tIn mid-February, 2021, the Cabinet approved a THB 50 billion soft loan program (available until June 30, 2021 through SFIs) to provide low-interest rate loans for up to 3 years to informal workers and SMEs linked to the tourism sector.    Note that debt restructuring could include the extension of the loan repayment period, provision of additional working capital, interest rate reduction, and/or the extension of the loan\u2019s maturity with lower interest rates that match an expected declining post-pandemic income profile. This process could be supported after August 2020 through the DR BIZ program for COVID-19-affected businesses with multiple creditors. Households could also avail themselves of debt restructuring through a debt consolidation program without credit penalties or interest rate increases.  For household debt, the BOT also coordinated with nine associations (the Thai Bankers\u2019 Association, Association of International Banks, Government Financial Institutions Association, Thailand Leasing Association, Thai Hire-Purchase Association, Vehicle Title Loan Trade Association, Thai Motorcycle Hire-Purchase Association, Credit Card Club\u2014The Thai Bankers\u2019 Association and the Personal Loan Club) to: lower minimum credit card and revolving repayments from 10 percent to 5 percent in 2020 and 2021 and 8 percent in 2022; have a 3-month moratorium on personal loans (installment payments) and car loans; have moratoria for hire-purchase or leasing for motorcycles and automobiles for 3 months on principal and interest or 6 months on principal; have a 3-month moratorium on principal repayments for housing, SME, and micro-finance loans with consideration on a case-by-case basis for lower interest payments.  There were also measures needed to support stability in the financial sector, mostly during the global financial turbulence in March 2020.\t\tA Corporate Bond Stabilization Fund (BSF) was established for the BOT to provide bridge financing of up to THB 400 billion by December 31, 2021 to high-quality firms with bonds maturing during 2021, but at higher-than-market \u2018penalty\u2019 rates. It currently has no takers.\tA Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MFLF) was established to allow banks to maintain liquidity of mutual funds and meet demand for withdrawals from those mutual funds without needing to sell underlying assets at low prices during times of extreme market volatility by borrowing against collateral from the BOT at the policy rate less 50 basis points. The MFLF has served as a backstop that slowed mutual fund withdrawals. By late 2020, any drawings on the MFLF had been repaid.\tBOT purchased about THB 100 billion of government bonds in March 2020 to ensure the normal functioning of the government bond market and signaled a willingness to repeat this if necessary (but have not yet needed to do so). \tIn June 2020, the BOT restricted dividend payments by financial institutions to protect their capital but removed this on November 12, 2020 with the proviso that the distribution of dividends could exceed neither the previous year\u2019s payout ratio nor half of the current year\u2019s net profit.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The BOT has provided some liquidity in the FX market thereby avoiding disorderly market conditions while also allowing the exchange rate to adjust.    Vaccine Plans\t    In late February 2021, Thailand received the first delivery of 200,000 doses of the Sinovac and over 100,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. The government signed an agreement to acquire 61 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 2\u00a0million doses of the Sinovac vaccine by the end of 2021. This is enough to inoculate about 45 percent of population. Wide-spread vaccinations are expected to begin by the end of 2021H1. A local company, Siam Bioscience has received technology developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine locally on behalf of AstraZeneca, starting mid-2021. Siam Bioscience will have the capacity to produce 180 million to 200 million doses per year, enough to distribute throughout Southeast Asia.    Back to Top TIMOR-LESTEBackground.The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste extended the state of emergency until April 2, 2021. It covers the entire national territory and entails restrictions on the entry of people by land, sea or air to prevent the spread of the virus. Citizens should maintain social distance, wear a face mask in places of collective use, and sanitize their hands when entering public buildings. Domestic economic activity is not restricted. The government imposed a sanitary fence and banned travel in and out of the western area, in which the first cases of domestic community spread were reported in late February. There have been as of March 4 a total of 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19. It is one of the few countries to have a COVID-19 death toll of zero. The vaccination of the population will start in April 2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    On April 20, the government approved a stimulus package (US $ 150 million, about 10.5 percent of GDP) to manage economic and financial risks from the COVID-19 including: (i) cash transfers with a monthly basic income to over 214,000 households, worth US $ 100 per month per household, lasting for 3 months; wage subsidies (60 percent of the wage cost) for formal sector employees (for 30,000 workers); (ii) the purchase of three months emergency supply of rice; (iii) maintaining transportation channels for movement of essential goods and medical/emergency goods; (iv) waiving for three months (for low-income households) the payment of electricity (up to US $ 15 per month), water bills, property rental payments owned by the government and social security contributions;(v) provide stipends to over 4,200 Timorese students studying overseas; and (vi) deferral of tax payments for two months. On September 23, the government decided to distribute cash transfers for basic staple foods to eligible households, worth US $ 25 per month per household, lasting for 2 months (November and December).     Monetary and macro-financial\t    On April 29, 2020, the authorities decided to extend access to the Credit Guarantee System to micro-enterprises, increasing the type of economic activities eligible for the program. On May 11, the authorities introduced a moratorium on the fulfillment of capital and interest obligations arising from credit agreements, which delayed maturity by three months and reduced debtors\u2019 interest payment obligation to 40% of the original amount with the remaining 60% financed by the government.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top TogoBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 7, 2020. The number of COVID-19 cases was below the WAEMU average in 2020, helped by strict health and containment measures. However, after a few months of decreasing cases, the number of new cases has accelerated quickly since January and the number of active cases per inhabitant is now similar to other WAEMU countries. The health and containment measures, which are the most stringent in the region, include the following: (i) all travelers entering Lom\u00e9 airport are required to present a negative test result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than five days before boarding their flights and either install a contract tracing mobile application or remain in quarantine in a state-provided containment facility for at least 14 days; (ii) gatherings of more than 100 people are banned; and (iii) schools remain closed. Furthermore, all sport or cultural events remain adjourned. The state of health emergency declared by the National Assembly in April 2020 has been extended through March 15, 2021, but a further extension is under discussion.Reopening of the economy The curfew affecting Lom\u00e9 and its surroundings was lifted on June 9, 2020. The airport in Lom\u00e9 reopened for international air traffic in August and the closure of land borders and airspace for flights from high-infection countries has been lifted. Churches and mosques in all areas except the Greater Lom\u00e9 were authorized to reopen in late October. The nightly curfew in the northern and central regions was lifted in late February 2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    During the state of health emergency the Government remains authorized to rule by decrees\u00a0 to accelerate the decision-making process. Togo was one of the first African countries to respond to the crisis, developing and quickly implementing the most urgent components of a comprehensive, multi-year response plan that aims to protect lives, livelihoods, and future growth prospects. This comprehensive economic and social resilience plan seeks to upgrade the health system, contain the economic fallout of the crisis, and provide targeted support to vulnerable households and firms. It is comprised of measures targeting:    Health: The state of health emergency triggered the implementation of a set of containment and mitigation measures, including strengthening laboratory diagnostic capacity, equipping treatment centers, improving drug availability, and the launch of a vast program to rehabilitate hospitals and to provide health centers with standard infrastructure to screen and treat people with COVID-19. Additional health spending estimated at over 1 percent of GDP in 2020.    Social objectives:  A new mobile cash-transfer program, NOVISSI, aiming to support informal workers was launched in April 2020. Eligible applicants receive a state grant of at least 30 percent of the minimum wage, with payouts from CFAF 10,500 ($18) to CFAF 20,000 ($34). Based on program data, 65 percent of the beneficiaries are women. The Novissi program was revised in late June with eligibility limited to workers in specific districts recording a high contagion rate. In total, 1.4 million individuals have registered and close to 600,000 have received a NOVISSI payment. The Government did also subsidize water and electricity use for groups paying social tariffs for three\u00a0months. Additional spending on social objectives estimated at over \u00bd percent of GDP in 2020.    Economic recovery: Actions to support the private sector during the pandemic and in preparation of the future recovery comprise a series of tax policy and administrative measures, including: (i) all procedures for forced tax collections and ongoing tax prosecutions remain suspended during the state of emergency; (ii) the standard VAT rate of 18 percent has been reduced to 10 percent for firms in the hospitality and catering sectors; and (iii) submission deadlines for businesses that cannot submit their tax declarations on time have been rescheduled and small- and medium-sized enterprises are allowed to pay taxes in tranches and enjoy more flexibility regarding outstanding taxes due.    Financing for the response is severely constrained. Revenue collections are estimated to have been about CFAF 90 billion (2.1 percent of GDP) less than projected in the original budget for 2020. The decline is attributed to both slower economic growth and tax measures in response to the pandemic. The overall fiscal deficit is estimated at about 6 percent of GDP in 2020. To meet these needs, the Government established a national solidarity fund, to include contributions from the state budget, development partners, and voluntary donations from the private sector and the Togolese diaspora. As of December 15, 2020, the national solidarity fund had mobilized an amount of about 40 percent of GDP. The IMF provided significant financing, approving an ECF disbursement (with an augmented quota) of US$131 million (1.8 percent of GDP) in 2020. The World Bank provided budget support of US$70 million (1.0 percent of GDP) and project support for Covid-19 measures equivalent of about 0.5 percent of GDP. Other sources of donor financing include the West African Development Bank (BOAD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the African Development Bank (ADB).    Heads of states of the West-Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) have declared a temporary suspension of the WAEMU growth and stability pact (setting six convergence criteria, including the 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit limit) to help member-countries cope with the  fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, member countries are allowed to raise their overall fiscal deficit temporarily and use any additional external support provided by donors in response to the Covid-19 crisis. The declaration by the heads of states sets a clear expectation that fiscal consolidation will resume once the crisis is over.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks\u2019 demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on economic activity. In April 2020, the BCEAO adopted of a full allotment strategy at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum policy rate) thereby allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at rate about 25 basis points lower than before the crisis. In June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO also announced: (i) an extension of the collateral framework to access central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private companies; (ii) a framework inviting banks and microfinance institutions to accommodate demands from solvent customers with Covid19-related repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period up to end-2020 debt service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims as non performing; and (iii) measures to promote the use of electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of 3-month \"Covid-19 T-Bills\" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The amount of such special T-Bills initially issued by Togo was the equivalent of 3.2 percent of GDP, with some rollover possibility through similar bonds benefitting from a refinancing rate equivalent to the prevailing monetary policy rate but all to be paid back by end-2020. In February 2021, the BCEAO launched a special 6-month refinancing window at the floor of the interest rate corridor to help WAEMU governments meet COVID recovery funding needs. Through this special window banks shall be able to refinance all bonds with maturity of three years or more that governments currently plan to issue on the regional financial market in 2021. The amount of bonds eligible to the new refinancing window for Togo is equivalent to 10.8 percent of projected 2021 GDP. The new refinancing window is expected to remain in place for the term of the eligible bonds issued in 2021. In June 2020, the West African Development Bank (BOAD) decided to create a CFAF 100 billion window for extending 5 to 7 year refinancing of banks\u2019 credit to SMEs in the 8 WAEMU member countries. In addition, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basle II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead of 2022 as initially planned. In December 2020, the BCEAO encouraged WAEMU banks to refrain from distributing dividends with a view to strengthening their capital buffers in anticipation of the impact of the COVID crisis on asset quality.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.     Back to Top TongaBackground. To date, there have been no reported COVID-19 cases in Tonga. Nevertheless, the economy is being hit by slowdown in remitting countries, which are an important source of remittances and tourism for the economy, and the containment measures that have been imposed. The Government of Tonga introduced restrictive containment measures starting in January 2020. In March 2020, it declared a state of National Emergency and toughened measures for incoming travelers (including international cruise ships and yachts passengers) before prohibiting all passengers flights into the country. Other preventive measures include a national lockdown, a national curfew, the closure of non-essential businesses and public facilities, movement restrictions and the prohibition of public gatherings. Reopening the economy. The authorities started easing restrictions on April 12, 2020, by lifting the national lockdown, and domestic restrictions were further eased on June 11, for example by further reducing curfew hours and removing the prohibition on contact sports. The state of National Emergency has been extended until March 15 and the border closure until further notice.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Based on an initial assessment of the overall impact of COVID-19 on the economy, the Government of Tonga announced an Economic and Social Stimulus Package of 60 million Tongan pa\u2019anga (5.3 percent of GDP) for FY2020 on April 2, 2020. This package was intended to provide short-term assistance to all affected sectors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over a third of the funds were to be directed to the health sector, while the rest were to support the other sectors, including tourism, transport, agriculture, education and security. In addition, the Government of Tonga announced a 3-month moratorium on Government Development Loans & TC Gita Recovery Loan Fund, deferral of retirement contributions and hardship allowances for laid-off employees (up to 3 months), needs-based financial assistance, tax and duty relief during the pandemic, and assistance with the payment of utility bills by public enterprises. The FY2021 budget, approved by Parliament on June 22, envisages a deficit of 37.4 million Tongan pa\u2019anga (some 3\u00bd percent of GDP) for FY2021. Spending on health has been identified as one of the top priorities for the government, accounting for 21 percent of the total budget of 589.6 million Tongan pa\u2019anga.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    At end-January 2021, the NRBT reiterated that its supportive monetary and financial sector policy stance will continue unchanged, given the weak economy. On March 19, 2020, the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) Board approved the provision of liquidity support to the banking system. It also committed to easing exchange control requirements if needed. It placed monetary policy, which was accommodative given low inflation and slow economic recovery, on hold. The NRBT started meeting weekly with banks to ensure there is clear communication, enhanced preparedness and best practices. It is supporting banks in their effort to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 virus on the economy as well as provide essential financial services to households and businesses. Commercial banks are assisting their customers affected by the COVID-19 virus on a case by case basis and depending on individual customers\u2019 circumstances by: (i) reducing or suspending the principal loan repayments to interest only loan repayments; (ii) restructuring loans to businesses that have reduced business hours, in affected sectors such as tourism and related industries like transportation and to individuals who have been laid off; (iii) extending the terms of loans to reduce repayments; (iv) reducing loan interest rates on a case by case basis; and (v) providing access to short-term funding, if required. The NRBT is also building awareness and expectations through press releases.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The exchange rate remains pegged against a basket of currencies (within a \u00b15 percent monthly adjustment limit). No new exchange restrictions have been announced. International reserves have risen to 11.8 months of imports (705.3 million pa\u2019anga) by end-December 2020 - due to inflows of remittances and budget support and grants from international donors and import compression.    On January 25, 2021, the IMF Executive Board approved the disbursement of US$9.95 million emergency financing under the Rapid Credit Facility to Tonga to help meet its urgent balance of payments and fiscal needs arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Cyclone Harold.

Trinidad and Tobago was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and the sharp decline in oil prices. The first confirmed case was reported on March 12, 2020, and since August the contagion rate has increased substantially. The government had adopted containment measures, including border closures, travel restrictions, school and university closures, and limits on social gatherings. From November 15, citizens returning home are required to provide a negative COVID-19 test and enter a mandatory 7-day quarantine in a state or state-supervised facility, followed by 7 days home quarantine; on December 21 the mandatory quarantine for visitors from the United Kingdom was extended to 14 days, to prevent the spread of a new coronavirus variant. Non-nationals are still not permitted to enter Trinidad and Tobago with limited exceptions.Reopening the economy.  The government had put in place a reopening plan in phases starting May 10, 2020 and most economic activities had resumed by end-June. On October 11, the government announced a minor relaxation in some of the measures aimed at curbing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, but churches, restaurants and bars would remain closed. These measures were subsequently relaxed, with places of worship, gyms, casinos, and cinemas to reopen at 50 percent capacity. Public transport is operating at 50 percent capacity. All schools were virtually reopened on January 1, and some secondary schools have partially opened their doors to students since February 8. The country\u2019s borders will remain closed until further notice. Travel between Trinidad and Tobago is restricted to essential reasons with a reduced inter-island service. Trinidad and Tobago has been allocated an initial 100,800 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine from the COVAX facility, which will be delivered at end-March 2021. It also received 2,000 doses from Barbados, which was donated by India. 991 frontline workers have been vaccinated so far.Key Policy Responses as of March 3, 2021  Fiscal\t    The fiscal package of March 23, 2020 included (i) salary relief for up to 3 months to workers who are temporarily unemployed or have reduced income; (ii) VAT and income tax refunds to individuals and SMEs; (iii) liquidity support to individuals and small businesses via credit union loans at reduced interest rates and long repayment periods; (iv) grants to hoteliers to upgrade of their facilities; (v) food, rental and income support for low-income vulnerable groups; and (vi) import duty and VAT waivers on imports of certain medical and emergency supplies.         On March 26, 2020, the Prime Minister announced that the Ministry of Health would receive additional funding to deal with COVID-19, including spending on medical equipment and supplies, human resources, and infrastructure. On October 5, the Ministry of Finance announced an extension to December 2020 of salary relief and income support grants for workers in the creative and cultural industries.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 17, 2020, the central bank reduced the policy rate by 150 bps to 3.5 percent, and the reserve requirement on commercial bank deposits by 300 bps to 14 percent. As a result, commercial banks reduced the prime lending rate to an average of 7\u00bd percent, from 9\u00bc percent previously. Additionally, commercial banks agreed to provide a 1-month moratorium on mortgages and installment loan payments, without any penalty; and to waive penalty interest on overdraft facilities. Several banks offered automatic deferrals for a period of up to 6 months on loans or credit card payments due. Other government housing institutions provided similar relief to their customers with 2 to 6 months payment deferrals. Money lenders allowed deferred payments and reduced interest rates. Credit cards reduced interest rates and increased credit limits    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The government had established a special foreign exchange window, through the Exim Bank to ensure the uninterrupted supply of basic items such as food and pharmaceuticals.    Back to Top TunisiaBackground. Tunisia reported its first confirmed case on March 2, 2020. Thanks to proactive actions from the Tunisian authorities in taking the necessary sanitary steps, declaring a national state of emergency, and adopting confinement measures, the pandemic has remained contained, with a low number of daily contamination cases mostly coming from abroad. Tunisia began on June 4, 2020 a strategy of deconfinement and the reopening of borders was effective on June 27, 2020. The COVID-19 shock came at a time when Tunisia was already facing persistent macroeconomic imbalances.Reopening of the economy. On April 29, the national security council announced several measures to ease economic restrictions by adopting a three-phased plan depending on the activity sector. The first phase started on May 4 and concerned the most affected sectors\u2013individuals and craftsmen, manufacturers especially export firms, with the obligation of adopting sanitary measures. The second phase began on May 24 and concerned supermarkets, caf\u00e9s, and other individuals for which the social distancing would be hard to establish. The third phase of full deconfinement started on June 4. During the transition period, only 50 percent of the public sector got back to business. On June 27 Tunisia started easing international travel restrictions and opening frontiers progressively, classifying countries in three lists according to the pandemic risk and applying different measures for each list.On August 21st, the government has decided to make mandatory the wearing of masks in administrations and most public and commercial places following the reopening of the borders which led to a further increase in the number of new cases in Tunisia.Tunisia is facing a second wave of the COVID-19 propagation, with an exponential increase of new cases, as well as deaths. Accordingly, the new government announced a series of measures, including (1) prohibition of gathering of groups in public/private places (e.g., sports, culture); (2) mandatory mask wearing in public (e.g., transport, workplace); (3) cohort work arrangement and reduced hours for government personnel; (4) targeted confinement or curfew; and (5) increasing the number of treatment beds to 1,200 by end-October.Covid-19 Vaccine distribution plans. On January 21st, 2021, the Ministry of Health announced a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign. The vaccination would be free for all the population; it aims at covering 50 percent of Tunisians over 18 years old (about 6 million people) and will cost about USD 111 million in 2021 and 2022. A first wave of about 500,000 vaccines was expected to be delivered in mid-February, to cover the first group of the most vulnerable and exposed people, but not yet, as of March 4th. The Tunisian authorities have also secured the purchase of more than 10 million doses, expected to be delivered in April-May. The vaccination campaign is expected to be managed quickly, with more than 120,000 vaccination per day and 200 dedicated teams all over the country.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    A TND 2.6 billion emergency plan (2.3 percent of GDP) was announced on March 21st , 2020. A part of it was direct fiscal measures included in the 2020 budget and then extended in 2021 budget. Revenue measures include solidarity contributions to finance the Covid-related response and measures to provide financial resources to affected sectors. The authorities introduced a Covid-19 dedicated fund (\u201cFund 1818\u201d) financed by voluntary contributions, withheld one day of salary from all economic agents, increased the tax rate on the interest from bank deposits, and introduced an exceptional 2 percent profit tax surcharge on financial companies for 2020\u201321.

Corona virus positivity rates have increased since the easing of most of the lockdown measures. Community infections are on the rise, but the death rate has remained low. The increasing number of cases have somewhat strained hospital capacity though the authorities have identified additional space for patient management.The authorities have recruited additional staff/ volunteers to assist with the management of the pandemic. Funding for scaling up of testing continues to be mobilized. Reopening of the economy. Uganda has gradually relaxed one of the most stringent lockdowns in the region that started in late May by: (i) allowing the movement of private cars, albeit with a limit in place on number of passengers; (ii) reopening sequentially merchandise shops; (iii) relaunching public transport with strict regulation on passenger capacity and obligation to wear masks; and (iv) shortening the curfew to 9.00 PM\u20135.30 AM.

Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    In FY19/20, two supplementary budgets increased the spending envelope for critical sectors and vulnerable groups by about US$270 million (0.7 percent of GDP), of which around US$76 million (0.2 percent of GDP) is estimated to have been executed. In addition, Covid-19-related spending was further increased by US$30 million (0.1 percent of GDP) through budget reallocation, while tax measures in response to COVID-19 contributed to the revenue shortfall by close to US$70 million (0.2 percent of GDP). In FY20/21, through the budget and two supplementary budgets, US$600 million (1.5 percent of GDP) were allocated for additional Covid-19 related outlays, partly driven by the delayed execution of some measures originally planned for FY19/20. Moreover, further support is planned for vaccines both in the remainder of FY20/21 (around US$139 million or 0.4 percent of GDP) and in FY21/22 (around US$132 million or 0.3 percent of GDP). Among others, the fiscal support has included the following measures:     i. Additional funding to the health sector, including for medical equipment, masks, test kits, and vaccines;    ii.Support to households, including food to the vulnerable and funding for agriculture inputs and entities that support the sector;     iii.Employment support, such as through the EMYOOGA initiative;iv.Support to firms, including in the form of waived interest on tax arrears, deferred payments of Pay-As-You-Earn and corporate income tax and the expedited repayment of VAT refunds;v.The expansion of labor-intensive public works programs;vi.Acceleration of the development of industrial parks;vii.Clearance of arrears;viii.Import substitution and export promotion by providing funding to Uganda's Development Bank and recapitalizing the Uganda Development Cooperation.

On May 6, 2020, Uganda secured US$491.5 million in emergency financing from the IMF under the Rapid Credit Facility, of which 30 percent was provided as budget support considering the impact of COVID-19. On June 29, the World Bank approved a US$300 million budget support under the Uganda COVID-19 Economic Crisis and Recovery Development Policy Financing supporting reforms to provide immediate relief to individuals and businesses most affected by the pandemic. Also, part of the costs of vaccination is expected to be financed by COVAX. Finally, spending reallocations also contributed to the financing of Covid-19-related spending.Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Bank of Uganda (BoU) maintained its policy rate at 7 percent in February 2021, following two consecutive 100 basis points reduction in April and June, 2020. The BoU remains committed to providing liquidity support to for a period of up to one year to supervised financial institutions in need and putting in place a mechanism to minimize the likelihood of insolvency due to lack of credit. The BoU waived limitations on restructuring of credit facilities at financial institutions that may be at risk of going into distress and has also worked with mobile money providers and commercial banks to ensure they reduce charges on mobile money transactions and other digital payment charges. All Supervised Financial Institutions (SFIs) were directed to defer dividend payments and bonuses for at least 90 days effective March 2020 to ensure capital adequacy. Other measures include purchases of Treasury Bonds held by microfinance deposit taking institutions and credit institutions to ease liquidity pressures and exceptional permission to SFIs to restructure loans as needed on a case by case basis. These measures, which remained in place until March 2021, have been extended for another 6 months starting on April 1, 2021.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    Bank of Uganda has announced that it stands ready to intervene in the foreign exchange market to smooth out excess exchange rate volatility and has done so in late March when the exchange rate overshot temporarily.     Uganda secured US $ 491.5 million in emergency financing from the IMF on May 6, 2020 under the Rapid Credit Facility, of which 70 percent was devoted to boosting international reserves and thus preserving macroeconomic stability (see Fiscal section). On June 29, the World Bank approved a US $ 300 million budget support operation (see Fiscal section).    Back to Top UkraineBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 3, 2020. As the number of the new cases has been rising in June, international travel to most destinations for Ukrainian citizens has been banned. Starting in mid-March 2020, daycare, schools and universities were closed, and domestic and international travel restrictions were imposed. Subsequently, restrictions were expanded to cover virtually all establishments which had physical interactions with clients. Citizens were required to carry identification papers and wear facial masks when outside. All people coming from abroad should go through a mandatory observation for 14 days, which was later changed into a self-isolation requirement to be terminated ahead of schedule if the result of the test is negative. People over 60 were required to self-isolate. The government has banned export of certain medical essentials, such as facial masks, personal protective equipment and ethyl alcohol, as well as some essential food stuffs, but these bans are no longer in force.  Reopening the economy. The government has extended the quarantine until April 30, 2021. The authorities introduced a week-end quarantine, with a curfew on shops, sit-in restaurants and entertainment. The measure was in place from November 14 to November 30.While part of the restrictive measures has been softened starting May 11, the subsequent increase in the number of cases led authorities to impose a winter lockdown for the period between January 8-24 2021.Ukraine has opened up from the previous spring lockdown gradually. On May 11, 2020 beauty salons, most shops, museums, and outdoor terraces in restaurants were allowed to reopen, provided that certain sanitary norms were observed.

A ban on night clubs, entertainment centers, and most concerts was reintroduced on August 26. Schools and daycare are open but students ought to shift to distance learning if there are infections among students or teachers.From February 24, 2021 the government reintroduced adaptive quarantine with 4 zones, the zoning dependent on various factors such as infection rate and hospital bed occupancy. Regions with better epidemiological situations are eligible for more relaxations, such as domestic bus and railway transportation, opening of daycare, certain education facilities, hotels and fitness centers (all with prescribed sanitary norms) and longer working hours for catering services. Each region has been assigned a special commission, which can toughen the quarantine rules if the epidemiological situation worsens. The \"red\" level (implies the strictest restrictions) is established by the decision of the State Commission on Technogenic and Ecological Safety and Emergencies at the initiative of the Minister of Health within 48 hours from the moment of grounds for the introduction of this level of epidemiological danger. As of March 2 2021, these stricter rules are in place for six regions.In line with the December 17 Law enterprises, entrepreneurs, institutions, organizations are now liable for violations of sanitary legislation for admitting people without masks and respirators to public transport and premises during the quarantine period.Starting end-October, Cabinet has switched its meetings to an online format.Vaccine roll-out in Ukraine started on February 24, with Covishield vaccine. COVAX-supplied 117,000 doses would be used to immunize essential medical personnel. A second wave of COVAX shipment \u2013 from 2.2 to 3.7 million doses \u2013 would follow in the course of the second quarter of 2021. The Ministry of Healthcare is reportedly in talks with more potential suppliers.In total, about 14 million people should be vaccinated this year. Vaccination in Ukraine will take place in five stages. The first stage will vaccinate people at high risk of infection and development of COVID-19 and those who perform critical functions in the fight against coronavirus.https://covid19.com.ua/ Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Several measures have been introduced to support business.

Payments for the lease of state property have been either waived altogether in case of essential services for the time of quarantine, or have been halved or set at 25 percent, depending on the use of property.     Parliament has adopted legislation increasing the thresholds for the simplified taxation regime. A holiday was introduced for small and medium sized companies for the payment of social security contributions until May 31, 2020 (which does not impact the accrual of their pensionable service). Parliament has also approved atop-up of 300 percent of the salary for medical personnel working with COVID-19 patients. To support households, parliament has adopted legislation that allows households to deduct the expense of COVID-19 medicine from the calculation of personal income tax. The government has introduced a one-off pension increase to low-income pensioners of UAH1,000 in April and a regular monthly UAH500 pension top-up for retirees aged 80 years or more(incorporating seniors 75+ with a UAH 400 top up starting next July). The authorities' policies also include an earlier-than-planned indexation adjustment of pensions in 2020, as well as a moratorium on penalties and disconnection of consumers who are late on utility payments.    Medicines, medical devices and other equipment used to prevent or combat COVID-19 have been exempt from import duties and VAT. For the purpose of 2020 fiscal year only, the government has created a stand-alone budgetary program under the Finance Ministry to fight the pandemic. This program allowed for a greater flexibility in the reallocation of funds to quickly accommodate changing priorities. As of end-year, UAH 78.4 billion out of UAH 80.9 billion of appropriated funds were spent. The Accounting Chamber has been monitoring COVID-related health expenditures from all tiers of the government https://public.tableau.com/profile/ua.gov.covid19#!/vizhome/COVID-19UKRAINE/COVID_19. The Finance Ministry\u2019s infographics could be found at      https://www.mof.gov.ua/uk/data_and_analytics-433     In parallel, local budgets contributed UAH 10.6 billion in 2020 on the purchase of COVID-related equipment and services, and the National Health Service disbursed UAH 11.7 billion to finance top-ups to health care personnel treating patients with COVID. https://nszu.gov.ua/storage/files/4-qrt-2020-report.pdf?1611565456    Parliament has introduced a state insurance for medical professionals who become disabled as a result of COVID-19-related sickness. This insurance also covers the families of doctors and nurses who die as a result of COVID-19. Overall, more than 300 health care professionals have fallen victim of Covid-19 while some 26,000 have been infected.    The government has expanded the subsidized loans program\u2014the so-called 5-7-9 program\u2014and credit guarantee scheme (launched in February 2020). The maximum amount of a loan has been increased to the equivalent of about Euro400,000, the annual income limit to UAH100 million (US$3.7 million), and the eligibility criteria have been expanded to include COVID-19 crisis related production as well as production costs (e.g., wages and rent). The government has further expanded the program to make it more generous and accessible (for example if loans are used for refinancing outstanding credit to banks). As of the end of March 1, 2021, 9,490 loans were extended under the program worth UAH 22.6 billion. The program continues into 2021.    The authorities have softened access to a number of social support programs, such as household utilities subsidies and aid to families with children. The changes include (a) increasing norms (by 50 percent) for energy consumption used to determine the amount of subsidy; (b) stopping the disqualification from the household utilities subsidiesprogram of a person that breaches qualification criteria; (c) automatic re-enrollment into the program for the heating season 2020-2021; (d) extending existing social entitlements for the period of the quarantine without the need to reapply; and (e) making private entrepreneurs eligible for the state support for children younger than 10.     The floor for unemployment benefit has been increased from UAH 650 to UAH 1,000 for applicants whose employment history does not qualify them for a full benefit. For those with sufficient records of participation in labor market and contributions to pension system, this minimum amount is increased from UAH 1,630 to 1,800. The law governing unemployment benefits has been amended to introduce a new type of entitlement, so called furlough benefit related to a quarantine. The Cabinet of Ministers has been granted the right to determine its amount and set it at 2/3 of the basic wage, but not exceeding the minimum wage which is UAH 4,723. Employers are compensated for wages paid to partially furloughed employees, under the provision that pension contributions were paid in the six months prior to the quarantine. Overall, UAH 10.7  billion has been disbursed to fund unemployment and furlough benefits as of the end of 2020.      At the beginning of the quarantine in March 2020, the Cabinet of Ministers introduced price regulation for the period of the quarantine for 10 socially important food products, 20 categories of personal protective equipment and medicines and more than 10 types of antiseptics. Subsequently, there have been no reports of transgressions of this regulation.     In preparing for the January 2021 lockdown, the legislature supported a set of measures to prop up small businesses. If certain conditions are met (e.g a history of contribution to the pension system is in place), eligible entrepreneurs can count on UAH 8,000 in a one-off state aid and a single tax holidays through December 2020-May 2021. Employers affected by a lockdown can be reimbursed from the budget the amount equal to an average monthly payment of the social security which they have been making on behalf of their employees in the 10 months of 2020. Also, tax debts (up to UAH 3,030) are written off. Penalties charged on overdue taxes are forgiven if the principle is paid. Around 40 percent of expected applicants among self-employed entrepreneurs used their right to access the government\u2019s aid of UAH 8,000. Half a million small entrepreneurs reportedly received the payment, with the cost to the budget of around UAH 3.4 billion.            Monetary and macro-financial\t    In order to support the economy during the quarantine, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) eased monetary policy by cutting the key policy rate by 200bps down to 6 percent starting from June 12th, 2020. Since end-February 2020, the key policy rate has been cut by 500bps. Simultaneously the NBU narrowed the corridor on the overnight standing facilities from 2 percent to 1 percent.    The NBU has modified the operational design of monetary policy implementation to provide banks with more liquidity management flexibility: the frequency of liquidity tenders has been doubled (from bi-weekly to weekly), two-week certificates of deposit have become one-week certificates, and short-term refinancing loans (which previously had a maximum maturity of 14 days) are now issued for a period of up to three months.     The NBU has modified the calculation of reserve requirements (effective April 11) so as to free up some more domestic currency liquidity.     The introduction of additional capital buffers\u2014including the capital conservation buffer and the systemic buffer\u2014will be delayed. However, banks are suggested to refrain from distributing dividend until at least end of 2020 (initially October), ensuring that financial institutions have an additional margin of safety. The waiver (until June 2021) on breaches of regulatory requirements (on capital, liquidity, credit risk requirements and limitations on operations related to subordinated debt investor parties) caused by the COVID lockdown will not be applicable to those banks that will not follow such advice. The waiver does not exempt from sanctions foreseen in Law (problematic status and insolvency).Onsite inspections and stress testing of banks have been postponed. NBU has adopted a regulation that facilitates restructuring of loans to borrowers facing financial difficulties due to impact of the COVID-19. Penalties on clients not servicing loans during the period starting on March 1 and until 30 days after the quarantine finishes should not apply if there are reasonable grounds. Parliament adopted a law that prohibits the opening new bankruptcy cases against legal entities on creditors\u2019 claims that were opened after February 1 2020 90 days after the quarantine period ends. In credit risk classification, the loans that were serviced as of March 1, 2020 and restructured as of November 2020, will not be considered to have indications of default (temporarily restructuring is not treated as a trigger to recognize such loans as NPLs).    Starting July 25, loans, the terms of restructuring of which provide for payments with a periodicity lower than or in an amount less than the requirements of Credit Risk Regulation (No351), will not be excluded from the group credit risk assessment. For the continuity of credit support to the public sector, banks have the right not to take into account information on the implementation of the revenue side of the budget in 2020 when assessing credit risk on loans granted to public and local governments (debtors - budgetary institutions).    Given the increased consumer lending and the current experience with an increase in NPLs during the Corona-crisis, in September the NBU repeatedly pre-announced plans to increase risks weights on consumer lending from 100 percent up to 150 percent starting in the second half of 2021. At the same time, the NBU is planning to simplify the rules for assessing the credit risk on specialized lending, allowing the assessment of clients on a group basis.    Parliament has adopted legislation (effective starting late June) releasing borrowers from obligations to pay a penalty, fine, penalty for a delay in repaying the obligation under the contract to the lender (banks and NBFIs) in case the delay appeared during the quarantine period and/or 30 days after the date of its completion.    Parliament has approved\u2014and the has NBU operationalized\u2014a decision to maintain the current minimum statutory capital of banks, and the NBU will adopt regulation abolishing the requirements for minimum statutory capital to increase from UAH 200 million up to UAH 300 million by end-2020 with further increase up to UAH 500 million by July 2024.    The law on simplified procedures for banks\u2019 restructuring and recapitalization was extended for 4 more years (until Aug 1, 2024).    In order to alleviate compliance burdens on banks during the COVID-crisis, the NBU has extended by six months the deadlines for banks to submit their problem asset resolution plans (for assets that were performing as of March 1, 2020), with full implementation of the problem assets resolution postponed until November 30, 2020. The NBU has also extended the deadline for banks to submit their risk tolerance declarations by four months, as well as the business recovery plans for non-systemic banks by two and a half months (by December 20, 2020, later extended until March 1, 2021). Business recovery plans can be based on one (the most severe) stress-test only. Systemic banks were allowed to postpone the submission of their business recovery plans by two months (to December 1, 2020). Business recovery plans do not need to include a list of critical functions, the termination of which may threaten financial stability or may significantly negatively affect the economy. The NBU eliminated the tariffs for banks using its electronic payments system (SEP) and provided banks with guidance to ensure and promote their remote/cashless services. The NBU cancelled the fee for SEP\u2019s services related to payments of state aid to businesses and individuals linked to the quarantine (lockdown).      The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has approved a set of anti-crisis measures to support banks and the economy, when tougher restrictive measures are introduced, including a stricter quarantine regime (from January 8 to 24 2021).     1.Banks are recommended to restructure loans of borrowers facing financial difficulties from restrictive measures and who are unable to repay their loans. Banks are permitted to apply some default triggers to loans that will be restructured:        \t        until April 30 2021 (inclusively) for retail borrowers        \t        until May 31 2021 (inclusively) for corporate borrowers.                Restructuring should mitigate the impact of the crisis on the financial standing of borrowers. It should also prevent risks of banks\u2019 capital loss. Restructuring should neither impair conditions for borrowers nor increase the effective interest rate. Banks should not charge a commission for restructuring.        Restructuring is recommended to be done remotely. To become eligible for restructuring corporate borrowers should confirm the reduction of income or cessation of operation. For medium and big businesses, banks should apply an individual restructuring approach considering financial statements and business recovery prospects. For individuals, banks should apply portfolio-based assessment (save for mortgages and car loans).        Also banks will be permitted:    \t        not to downgrade the class of borrowers considering information from the Credit register until April 29 2021;        \t        not to revaluate or check the condition of pledge until March 30 2021; and        \t        to omit during assessment of budget-funded entities the performance indicators of budgets 2020 and 2021 until January 4 2023.            2.Restructuring debts of green energy producers. Banks are permitted not to apply some default triggers, if restructurings take place until April 30 2021 (before February 28).    3. Managing problem assets. Banks are authorized to define and set for the troubled assets management strategy a target level of NPLs for 2021 considering expected economic implications of the quarantine and restrictions in the short run.    4. Drawing up and submitting business recovery plans. Banks are permitted:    \t        stress testing using only one stress-testing scenario foreseeing a prolonged negative economic effect of the pandemic;         \t        submit a business recovery plan in test mode before March 1 2021; and        \t        not to include into business recovery plans a list of critical functions.            \u00a0    5. Approving candidates for bank top management positions. The NBU will continue distant testing procedure of top managers and candidates for top management positions with an interview with candidates by means of videoconference.    6. Submitting documents to the NBU. Banks and nonbank financial institutions are permitted to submit documents by e-mail with affixed qualified electronic signature.    Respective measures were approved by the NBU Board Resolution No. 160 dated December 21 2020 that takes effect on December 22 2020.The Resolution shall supplement measures previously introduced by the NBU to support the banking system for the restriction period associated with the spread of COVID-19.     \t        Imposing corrective measures. Until June 2021, no penalties on banks and banking groups will be imposed for their failure to comply with indicators for capital, liquidity, credit risk, and so on.         \t        Such decision will only cover violations as a result of adverse effects of quarantine, provided that a bank or banking group complies with capital adequacy and liquidity ratios under Articles 75 and 76 of the Law On Banks and Banking.  The decision shall not apply to banks that distributed profits for 2019 by paying out dividends.         \t        Capital buffers. In March 2020, the introduction was postponed due to the developing coronavirus crisis. Gradually the NBU will settle on the realization schedule for these buffers and release a prior notice on the website.        \t        Inspections. Conducting all types of onsite inspections will be suspended untill the last day of the month, when the quarantine is lifted.         \t        LCR. The NBU has postponed for two year the introduction of provision on considering in the structure of high-quality liquid assets in foreign currency not more then 80 percent of correspondent account balances in foreign banks with the rating beyond the investment grade.        \t        Managing noncore assets. Banks were given more time to clean-up their balance sheet from assets not used for banking. These are mainly residential and commercial real estate that banks recognize on the balance sheet for foreclosing collateral.            \u00a0    The NBU has postponed the deadlines for banks to publish their financial statements: annual 2019 audited statements can be published 5 business days after the general shareholders meeting and 2020Q1 interim financial statements can be published by June 30 (both postponed from April 30); and 2020Q1 consolidated financial statements can be published by July 30 (postponed from May 30).    In support of the banking sector, the NBU took the decision not to apply to banks and banking groups until June 2021 sanctions for violation of capital adequacy requirements, liquidity requirements, credit risk, as well as restrictions on transactions between the bank and investors related to the subordinated debt. Such a decision will be valid only if the violations arose due to the negative impact of the quarantine and restrictive measures on the bank or banking group, and provided that banks or banking groups do not violate capital adequacy ratios and liquidity ratios under Articles 75 and 76 of the Law \"On banks and banking activities \". The decision does not apply to banks, which, despite the recommendations of the National Bank, distributed profits for 2019 through dividends.    The NBU recommended to the Financial Services Regulator to transfer the regulation of insurance companies to the NBU starting July 1st. It also recommended to introduce measures to enable the remote and smooth work of the insurance companies that exempt insurance companies from the sanctions and fines in certain cases and prolong the deadline for submission of the 2019 financial statements.\u00a0    In order to further support bank liquidity and lending, on April 23rd, the NBU announced the following measures: in late April the NBU extended the term of the refinancing loans that are granted through weekly tenders, from 30 to 90 days, and expanded its list of eligible collateral that banks can use to obtain financing using standard liquidity support instruments , incorporating municipal bonds and government-guaranteed corporate bonds into the pool of eligible collateral; the NBU also introduced an interest rate swap tool that banks can rely on to minimize interest rate risk, which is expected to become available in the second quarter; and auctions under long-term refinancing instrument (up to 5 years), the first auction took place on May 8.    The NBU approved the General Terms and Conditions for Interest Rate Swap Operations, as well as the underlying methodology for the fair value calculation and other elements necessary to operationalize the instrument. The instrument will be introduced in order to revive long-term bank lending. The first price auction took place on July 2, 2020.    In September, the NBU expanded the list of collateral eligible for ELA facility to also include property rights on credit agreements with legal entities denominated in FX, as well as property rights on credit agreements with legal entities of a lower class of borrowers (fifth class).    Following the April expansion of the list of eligible collateral for refinancing loans and repo transactions, in September the NBU clarified the methodology for evaluating municipal bonds. In addition, the NBU revised the haircuts for domestic government bonds pledged as collateral under refinancing loans, direct repo, IRS and transactions on cash storage agreements.    In order to foster banks' support to municipalities, development of infrastructure and the securities market, the NBU revised/relaxed certain requirements on the assessment of the financial stance of the municipal borrowers in the calculations of the credit risk. The class of a borrower/municipality that issued securities is allowed to be identified based on the credit rating. In the case of an absence of such a rating for UAH-denominated bonds, it is allowed to assign a rating one class lower than of Ukraine's international credit rating. The lower bound of LGD for both Government and municipal securities is lowered down to 0.6. For the sake of calculating credit risk, haircuts on municipal bonds have been lowered. The allowed absence of an insurance agreement on the collateral when banks apply eligibility criteria to the collateral was extended into 2021.         Given the negative effect of the pandemic on the real estate market, the NBU extended the period for cleaning up banks' balance sheets from the non-profile banking assets, mainly residential and commercial real estate foreclosed as the collateral on loans. Balance value of the assets acquired (1) before end-2021 should not be excluded from the capital during 3 years in case of all non-profile assets; (2) after (starting) Dec. 31, 2021 \u2013 during 2 years in case of residential real estate and 1 year for other non-profile assets.        Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The NBU and EBRD have agreed to set up and partially activated a US $ 500 million FX swap facility to support the real economy and strengthen Ukraine\u2019s macrofinancial stability.     Back to Top United Arab EmiratesBackground.. The UAE economy is being affected by the spread of COVID-19 as well as the sharp decline in oil prices in 2020. As of March 4, 2021, the number of COVID-19 cases stood at 402,205 with 1,286 deaths. At the onset of the pandemic, the authorities have enacted several measures to limit the spread of the virus, including closure of schools, nurseries, shopping malls, parks, dine-in restaurants, and various tourist attractions. As part of their National Epidemic Control Plan, they have also imposed wide-ranging travel restrictions (including grounding of flights and halting visa issuance), suspended prayers at mosques and other large gatherings, and enacted teleworking arrangements in government offices. Alongside, the authorities have increased testing and scaled up disinfection efforts, established a dedicated task force to ensure uninterrupted supply of consumer goods and prevent manipulative pricing practices, and launched remote learning initiative to ensure continuity of education. Reopening of the economy. . Starting April 24, 2020, the authorities have begun gradual reopening of shopping centers and other businesses, subject to social distancing requirements, and began facilitating a voluntary repatriation of expatriate workers. Several airlines have resumed a limited number of regular passenger flights. Most government employees have returned to work as of mid-June 2020. Dubai reopened to international tourists on July 7, 2020. Starting July 29, 2020, restaurants, coffee shops, cafes and other licensed food outlets in Abu Dhabi started to operate at 80 percent capacity. Schools re-opened in September. On September 23rd, 2020, Abu Dhabi government reopened recreational and entertainment areas inside and outside malls. At the end of September, 2020, UAE authorities resumed issuing visas to foreign visitors. In October, 2020, UAE has started issuing employment visas for vital government and semi-government sectors, as well as entry permits for domestic workers. UAE also reopened some cultural landmarks to visitors. On December 9, 2020, Abu Dhabi authorities announced that they will resume all economic, touristic, cultural, and entertainment activities in two weeks. As COVID19 cases surged in January 2021, the government tightened safety measures and regular COVID19 testing for government workers; introduced a mandatory PCR test requirement for international arrivals, cut malls and venues capacity, and restricted activities that \u2018lead to large gatherings\u201d until April, 2021. As of March 4th, 2021, 6,204,004 doses of COVID19 vaccines have been administered.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities have so far announced about AED 32 billion ($ 8.7 billion or 2.8 percent of GDP) in various fiscal measures. These include: (i.) AED 16 billion ($4.4 billion) approved by the federal government to support the private sector by reducing various government fees, labor and other charges, refunding 50% of bank and financial guarantees to some establishments, and accelerating existing infrastructure projects; (ii.) AED 1.5 billion ($0.4 billion) in measures by the government of Dubai to reduce government fees, provide additional water and electricity subsidies, and simplify business procedures; and (iii.) AED 9 billion ($2.5 billion) announced by the government of Abu Dhabi as part of the ongoing \u201cGhadan-21\u201d fiscal stimulus program. The new initiatives provide for water and electricity subsidies as well as credit guarantees and liquidity support to small- and medium-sized enterprises. They also include deferral of payment of outstanding installments and interests on loans and credit cards for a period of 3 months, suspension of all rental property eviction cases and deferral of the collection of rent payments and service fees for tenants. In addition, the government of Abu Dhabi has announced a reduction or suspension of various government fees and penalties, as well as a rebate on commercial lease payments in the tourism and hospitality sectors. On July 11, 2020 Dubai has announced a new package worth AED 1.5 billion ($0.4 billion), which includes cancelling certain fines imposed by the government and the customs department, tax reimbursements to hotels and restaurants, and providing various banking facilities to individuals and corporates. End October, 2020, Dubai announced additional AED 500 million ($136.14 million) stimulus package to support the local economy, taking Dubai\u2019s total stimulus measures in 2020 to AED 6.8 billion. On January 6th, 2021, Dubai announced additional stimulus for January-June 2021 in an amount of  AED 315 million. Other Emirates employed similar measures to support trade and businesses and provide advantages to sectors that suffered the most from the current pandemic. Sharjah\u2019s value of the two packages of incentives amounts to AED 993 million ($0.27 billion).    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its policy interest rate twice by a combined 125 basis points in 2020. Furthermore, CBUAE has announced an AED 256 billion ($70 billion or 20% of GDP) package of measures comprising: i) halving of banks\u2019 required reserve requirements from 14% to 7%; ii) zero-interest rate collateralized loans to banks (AED 50 billion); iii) allowing the use of banks\u2019 excess capital buffers (AED 50 billion); iv) 15-25 percent reduction in provisioning for SME loans; v) increase of loan-to-value ratio for first-time home buyers by 5 percentage points; vi) limiting bank fees for SMEs; vii) waiver of all payment service fees charged by CBUAE for six months; viii) raising the limit on banks' exposure to the real estate sector from 20% to 30% of risk-weighted assets, subject to adequate provisioning; ix) allowing banks to defer loan repayments till end-2020. On November 16, 2020, the Central Bank announced the extension of the initial package of measures to June 2021. On August 8, CBUAE announced further measures to facilitate banks\u2019 lending to the economy: relaxation of the Net Stable Funding Ratio and the Advances to Stable Resources Ratio effective through end-2021.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top United KingdomBackground. The first confirmed case was reported on January 31, 2020. Cases initially peaked in April/May, but after weeks of decline, a second wave has taken hold with the number of cases significantly above those seen during the initial peak. Deaths associated with COVID-19 have remained below the peak but have been on the rise.  In response to the outbreak, on March 23 the government implemented a range of measures including travel restrictions, social distancing measures, closures of entertainment, hospitality, non-essential shops and indoor premises, and increased testing. In the first quarter of 2020 the economy contracted by 2.5 percent relative to the previous quarter, with a 6.9 percent month-on-month contraction in March. The economy contracted by 19.8 percent q-o-q in the second quarter, reflecting a sharp contraction in April. GDP grew by 15 \u00bd percent in the third quarter but remained some 10 percent below the pre-pandemic level. Recent indicators suggest a renewed slowdown between October and November (when a second national lockdown was introduced), with December reporting better data than initially expected. Finally, the UK\u2019s economy contracted by 10 percent in 2020, and is projected to rebound by 4.5 percent in 2021, about 1 percentage point less than in previous staff projections on account of the third national lockdown announced on January 5th. Frictions in implementing the post-Brexit trade regime will also weigh on activity in the short run. Even after social distancing winds down, a period of corporate balance sheet repair is expected to depress investment while labor reallocation takes place gradually. The pre-crisis level of output would be recovered in 2023 but output would remain about 5 percent below the pre-2020 trend in 2025. Reopening of the economy. On May 10, the government set out a roadmap to ease the lockdown in England (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have separate rules). Reopening too place in three steps starting on May 13 and continuing through July, with educational facilities reopening in September. The relapse of infections led initially to localized restrictions based on a 3-tier system of intensity, but eventually a second country-wide lockdown was put in place on November 5 (similar restrictions were established in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Educational facilities, construction and manufacturing remained open. Starting December 2, the government introduced a revised three-tier system of restrictions in England to run until spring, with most of the country classified under the stricter tiers 2 and 3. The tier level of each area will be reviewed every 14 days. Under the new setting, shops and gyms can reopen, with tougher restrictions on hospitality venues. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland maintain separate rules. As of December 16, most parts of England are in tier 3.New restrictions:  On January 4th 2021, amidst rising contagions and the rapid spread of a new string of the virus and dire warnings that the National Health Service is being pushed to breaking point, PM Boris Johnson imposed a third coronavirus lockdown across England, moving it up to tier 4, shutting schools and ordering the public to stay at home. The full emergency lockdown, initially expected to end on February 15, will now last until at least March 8. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales also went into lockdown. According to the new guidelines, everyone must stay at home unless they are medics or other key workers who cannot work from home. People can only leave home to buy essential supplies or take exercise, ideally only once a day. All primary and secondary schools and colleges will close and move to online teaching. All restaurants, bars and non-essential shops will stay closed, except where they sell takeaway food. Sales of takeaway alcohol are banned. Only essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacies, and nurseries will remain open.Key Policy Responses as of February 4th, 2021Fiscal\t    Tax and spending measures to support households and families during the health emergency include: (i) additional funding for the NHS, public services and charities (\u00a348.5 billion); (ii) measures to support businesses (\u00a329 billion), including property tax holidays, direct grants for small firms and firms in the most-affected sectors, and compensation for sick pay leave; and (iii) strengthening the social safety net to support vulnerable people (by \u00a38 billion) by increasing payments under the Universal Credit scheme as well as expanding other benefits.\u00a0The government has launched three separate loans schemes to facilitate business\u2019 access to credit. Together with the British Business Bank the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme to support SMEs and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loans Scheme to support bigger firms, which carry an 80 percent guarantee for loans up to \u00a35 million for the former and up to \u00a3300 million for the latter. In addition, the government has put in place the Bounce Bank loan scheme for SMEs with 100 percent guarantee for loan amounts up to \u00a350,000. It has also deferred VAT payments for the second quarter of 2020 until the end of the financial year and income tax payments of the self-employed by six months. The government will pay 80 percent of the earnings of self-employed workers (Self Employment Income Support Scheme, SEISS) and furloughed (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, CJRS) employees (to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per employee per month) initially for the period March-May. For furloughed employees, the scheme has been extended until end-October. Starting in July employers will be allowed to furlough employees for part of the daily working hours. Government coverage falls to 70 percent of wages in September (up to \u00a32,187) and 60 percent in October (up to \u00a31,875) with employers required to contribute the difference to 80 percent of wages (up to \u00a32,500). The scheme for the self-employed has been extended for three more months but at a reduced level of 70 percent of earnings. Trade credit insurance for business-to-business transactions will receive up to \u00a310 billion of government guarantees through the Trade Credit Reinsurance scheme, with the scheme available for nine months. The government has put in place a \u00a31bn package to support firms driving innovation and development through grants and loans. To support the international response, the government has made available \u00a3150 million to the\u00a0IMF\u2019s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust  and provided a new \u00a32.2 billion loan to the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) to help low income countries respond to COVID-19. See also:\u00a0https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses .     In July, the government adopted a package of measures to protect and create jobs and support the economic recovery. These include: providing firms \u00a31,000 per furloughed employee retained until end-January; paying the minimum wage for 25 hours per week for six months for young workers at risk of long-term unemployment; increased resources to enhance skills and facilitate reinsertion in the job market; temporary reductions of the VAT rate for hospitality, accommodation and attractions and the real estate transactions tax; increased public spending on infrastructure (including on green projects such as retrofitting houses to improve energy efficiency); and a program to subsidize dining out during the month of August. Low-income people who need to self-isolate and are unable to work, as well as members of their household, will receive \u00a3130 and \u00a3182, respectively. Businesses required to shut down due to localized lockdowns will receive up to \u00a31,500 every three weeks.    A package of measures announced on September 24 entailed the following: (i) a 6-month Job Support Scheme whereby employers will pay the wages of staff for the hours they work while for the hours not worked the government and the employer will each pay one third of their equivalent salary, up to \u00a3697.92 per month each. Employees must be working at least 33% of their usual hours; (ii) Extending the Self Employment Income Support Scheme for those continuing to actively trade but face reduced demand due to coronavirus, with the initial lump sum covering 20 percent of three months\u2019 worth of profits for the period from November to the end of January next year up to a total of \u00a31,875 (an additional second grant, will be available for the period from February 2021 to the end of April); (iii) extending the temporary 15% VAT cut (from 20 to 5%) for the tourism and hospitality sectors to the end of March next year; (iv) allowing to pay VAT payments deferred until end-March to be paid in 11 installments and self-assessed income tax due in July 2020 and January 2021 to be paid in 12 installments, (v) extending the maturity of loans under the CBILS and BBLs to up to 10 years; (vi) extending the application period for loans under the CBILS, CLBILS, and BBLS until end-November. In addition, the government launched a new program (JETS) to help the job search of people receiving unemployment benefits for at least 13 weeks.    Some of the measures announced in the September package were subsequently modified to be consistent with the tighter containment measures. For businesses that stay open, the JSS was modified, with minimum worked hours reduced to 20 percent, the government paying 62 percent for non-worked hours and employers paying 5 percent of non-worked hours. For businesses required to close due to the restrictions the government will pay two thirds of the employees\u2019 salaries (or 67%) up to a maximum of \u00a32,100 a month and the employers will cover social contributions. The scheme will run for 6 months starting on 1 November. The value of the grant for self-employed was increased from 20 to 40 percent of profits, up to \u00a33,750. The grant for businesses required to close was increased to up to \u00a33,000 per month for businesses in England, while additional funds were allocated to the devolved administrations. Businesses in the hospitality, accommodation and leisure sectors in high alert areas will receive grants of up to \u00a32,100.     In view of the second lockdown, the government launched a new package of measures in November, including the following: postponing the JSS, canceling the Job Retention Bonus, extending the CJRS until end-March with the replacement ratio back at 80 percent, increasing the grant of the SEISS also to 80 percent of earnings, and prolonging the deadline to apply for government guaranteed loans until end-January. On December 17, the government announced that it would extend the furlough scheme and the business support program one more month, until April 2021.    On November 25, the government published the 2020 Spending Review setting expenditure limits for FY2021-22, while the OBR presented its revised fiscal outlook. For FY2020-21, COVID-19 support measures are estimated at \u00a3280 billion. For FY2021-22, the government allocated \u00a355 billion for this purpose. Among other uses, these funds will be allocated to Covid testing, PPE and vaccines, as well as the new 3-year Restart scheme to help the long term unemployed find work.    On January 5th 2021,a day after the government imposed its toughest Covid-19 restrictions since last spring (expected now to last until at least March 8) Chancellor Sunak announced a \u00a34.6bn fresh financial support package for struggling UK companies. This would be divided in two parts: \u00a34bn of one-off \u201ctop-up grants\u201d for an estimated 600,000 retail, hospitality and leisure companies, which can each claim up to \u00a39,000; There will also be a new \u00a3594m discretionary fund made available for councils to support other businesses that are not eligible for those grants but are affected by the restrictions. No further measures are expected until the annual budget is announced on March 3.    Monetary and macro-financial\t        Key measures include: (i) reducing Bank Rate by 65 basis points to 0.1 percent; (ii) expanding the central bank\u2019s holding of UK government bonds and non-financial corporate bonds by \u00a3450 billion (in three tranches announced in March, June and November); (iii) introducing a new Term Funding Scheme to reinforce the transmission of the rate cut, with additional incentives for lending to the real economy, and especially SMEs; (iv) HM Treasury and the BoE have agreed to extend temporarily the use of the government\u2019s overdraft account at the BoE to provide a short-term source of additional liquidity to the government if needed ;(v) launching the joint HM Treasury\u2014Bank of England Covid Corporate Financing Facility which, together with the Coronavirus Business Interruption Schemes, makes \u00a3330bn of loans and guarantees available to businesses (15 percent of GDP); (vi) activating a Contingent Term Repo Facility to complement the Bank\u2019s existing sterling liquidity facilities; (vii) together with central banks from Canada, Japan, Euro Area, U.S., and Switzerland, further enhancing the provision of liquidity via the standing US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements; and (viii) reducing the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate to 0 percent from a pre-existing path toward 2 percent by December 2020, with guidance that it will remain at 0 for at least 12 months. In December 2020, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) updated its guidance on the path for the CCyB rate, expecting this rate to remain at 0 percent until at least 2021 Q4. Due to the usual 12-month implementation lag, any subsequent increase of the rate is not expected to take effect until 2022 Q4 at the earliest. See also: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/coronavirus. On February 3rd 2021, the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee kept policies and guidance unchanged, but it also finalized a technical review of the potential impact of a negative policy rate, concluding that this could be of use with further preparations.            The Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) set out supervisory expectation in March 2020 that large banks should suspend dividends and buybacks until end-2020, cancel outstanding 2019 dividends and pay no cash bonuses to senior staff. In December 2020, the PRA however announced its intention to return toward the standard framework for bank distributions, reflecting some reduction in the uncertainty related to Covid at this time, and the ability of banks to withstand significant losses, according to results of the two stress tests carried by the Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC) and the FPC. The PRA indicated all Pillar 2A requirements will be set as a nominal amount, instead of a percentage of total Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) and to mitigate the possibility of procyclical market risk capital requirements, the PRA will temporarily allow firms to offset the increase in risk-weighted assets due to the automatic application of a higher VaR multiplier through a commensurate reduction in risks-not-in-VAR (RNIV) capital requirements (see https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/coronavirus/information-for-firms). The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced a package of targeted temporary measures to support customers affected by coronavirus, including by setting the expectation for firms to offer a payment freeze on loans and credit cards for up to three months. In November, the mortgage moratorium was extended until end-April and the FCA also extended for 6 months the period to request a payment deferral for consumer credit.

Following a widening outbreak in March and April, the number of new cases declined after a range of containment measures were put in place. Infections rose again in early summer as economic activity and travelling resumed, but gradually declined over the summer following stricter prevention measures. However, new cases picked up again in September and continued on an upward trend as of mid-December. Following a deep contraction in the second quarter that reflected the impact of the containment measures, the U.S. economy rebounded strongly by an annualized rate of 33.1 percent. The unemployment rate stayed at 6.7 percent in November.Reopening of the economy.The containment measures in place vary by state and geographical area. As of mid-December, many states had imposed new restrictions on business and activities. Some states closed indoor dining and entertainment venues and banned indoor gatherings in the whole state or in some regions (e.g. Washington, California, Michigan). Schools have reopened in most states with varying approaches (in-person instruction, virtual or hybrid).Key Policy Responses as of January 7, 2021Fiscal\t    On December 28 President Trump signed a US $ 877bn (about 4\u00bd percent of GDP) coronavirus relief and government funding bill which includes enhanced unemployment benefits of US $ 300 weekly federal enhancement in benefits through March 14, direct stimulus payments of $600 to individuals, another round of PPP loans, resources for vaccines, testing and tracing, and funding for K-12 education.    \t    On August 8, President Trump issued executive orders mostly to address the expirations of certain Coronavirus reliefs provided by previous legislations. These included i) using $44 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund to provide extra unemployment benefits ; ii) continuing student loan payment relief ; iii) deferring collections of employee social security payroll taxes ; and iv) identifying options to help renters and homeowners avoid evictions and foreclosures.    \t    US $ 483 billion Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. The legislation includes (i) US $ 321 billion for additional forgivable Small Business Administration loans and guarantees to help small businesses that retain workers; (ii) US $ 62 billion for the Small Business Administration to provide grants and loans to assist small businesses; (iii) US $ 75 billion for hospitals; and (iv) US $ 25 billion for expanding virus testing.    \t    An estimated US $ 2.3 trillion (around 11% of GDP) Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economy Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d). The Act includes (i) US $ 293 billion to provide one-time tax rebates to individuals; (ii) US $ 268 billion to expand unemployment benefits; (iii) US $ 25 billion to provide a food safety net for the most vulnerable; (iv) US $ 510 billion to prevent corporate bankruptcy by providing loans, guarantees, and backstopping Federal Reserve 13(3) program; (v) US $ 349 billion in forgivable Small Business Administration loans and guarantees to help small businesses that retain workers; (vi) US $ 100 billion for hospitals, (vii) US $ 150 billion in transfers to state and local governments and (viii) US $ 49.9 billion for international assistance (including SDR28 billion for the IMF\u2019s New Arrangement to Borrow).    \t    US $ 8.3 billion Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act and US $ 192 billion t.. They together provide around 1% of GDP for: (i) Virus testing; transfers to states for Medicaid funding; development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; support for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responses. (ii) 2 weeks paid sick leave; up to 3 months emergency leave for those infected (at 2/3 pay); food assistance; transfers to states to fund expanded unemployment insurance. (iii) Expansion of Small Business Administration loan subsidies. And (iv) US $ 1.25 billion in international assistance. In addition, federal student loan obligations have been suspended for 60 days.     Monetary and macro-financial\t        Federal funds rate were lowered by 150bp in March to 0-0.25bp. Purchase of    Treasury and agency securities in the amount as needed. Expanded overnight    and term repos. Lowered cost of discount window lending. Reduced existing    cost of swap lines with major central banks and extended the maturity of FX    operations; broadened U.S. dollar swap lines to more central banks; offered    temporary repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities.    \t    Federal Reserve also introduced facilities to support the flow of credit,    in some cases backed by the Treasury using funds appropriated under the    CARES Act. The facilities are: (i) Commercial Paper Funding Facility to facilitate the issuance of    commercial paper by companies and municipal issuers; (ii) Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide financing to the Fed\u2019s    24 primary dealers collateralized by a wide range of investment grade    securities; (iii) Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility    (MMLF) to provide loans to depository institutions to purchase assets from    prime money market funds (covering highly rated asset backed commercial    paper and municipal debt); (iv) Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility to purchase new bonds and    loans from companies; (v) Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to provide liquidity    for outstanding corporate bonds; (vi) Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to enable the issuance    of asset-backed securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit-card    loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, and certain    other assets; (vii) Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF) to provide    liquidity to financial institutions that originate loans under the Small    Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which provides    a direct incentive to small businesses to keep their workers on the    payroll; (viii) Main Street Lending Program to purchase new or    expanded loans to small and mid-sized businesses; and (ix) Municipal Liquidity Facility to purchases short term notes    directly from state and eligible local governments.    \t    Supervisory action. Federal banking supervisors encouraged depository    institutions to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend, to work    constructively with borrowers affected by COVID-19, and indicated COVID-19    related loan modifications would not be classified as troubled debt    restructurings. Holdings of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at the    Federal Reserve Banks could be temporarily excluded from the calculation of    the supplementary leverage ratio for holding companies. Other actions    include offering regulatory reporting relief and adjusting supervisory    approach to temporarily reduce scope and frequency of examinations and give    additional time to resolve non-critical, existing supervisory findings.    \t    Regulatory action. Lower the community bank leverage ratio to 8 percent.    Provide extension transition for the Current Expected Credit Loss    accounting standard. PPP covered loans will receive a zero percent risk    weight, and assets acquired and subsequently pledged as collateral to the    MMLF and PPPLF facilities will not lead to additional regulatory capital    requirements. Allow early adoption of \"the standardized approach for    measuring counterparty credit risk\". And there will be a gradual phase-in    of restrictions on distributions when a firm's capital buffer declines.    \t    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have announced assistance to borrowers,    including providing mortgage forbearance for 12 months and waiving related    late fees, suspending reporting to credit bureaus of delinquency related to    the forbearance, suspending foreclosure sales and evictions of borrowers    for 60 days, and offering loan modification options.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top UruguayBackground. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported on March 13. The government introduced a series of public health measures, such as school closures, cancellation of public events, and active discouragement of large gatherings. Starting April 22, customers must wear face masks while shopping in supermarkets; this rule is currently being expanded to other establishments. International travel has been severely restricted. After months of relative stability, the number of new infections has increased sharply in November. In early and in mid-December, and again in January, the authorities introduced a series of additional public health measures to limit the spread of the virus. The number of new infections began to decline starting in mid-January, and some of the public health measures have been relaxed.  Reopening of the economy. The Office of Planning and Budget\u2014which reports to the President\u2014is developing a roadmap for re-opening the economy in consultation with experts and private sector representatives. Some containment measures have already been relaxed: construction activity was allowed to restart in mid-April, government offices re-opened in early May, and shopping centers reopened on June 9, all with appropriate sanitary precautions. Bars and restaurants are reopening, and the soccer matches began in August, without the spectators.  As of June 29, almost all schools (including in the capital Montevideo) have been re-opened. Starting August 3, school hours were extended to be closer to normal hours. Borders, however, will remain largely closed for the foreseeable future.      Key Policy Responses as of February 4, 2021Fiscal\t    Additional resources to address the public health emergency have been mobilized, including by resorting to contingent credit lines from other international financial institutions. The overall above-the-budget-line fiscal cost is estimated at $800 million (1.6 percent of GDP). The measures include (i) relaxation of rules for claiming the unemployment insurance (0.8 percent of GDP); (ii) expanded assistance to the most vulnerable groups (cash and direct provision of food, 0.2 percent of GDP); (iii) expanded sick leave benefits, including for older workers, so they do not have to leave home (0.1 percent of GDP). Furthermore, some tax and pension obligations are being postponed or reduced and utility payments are being cancelled or reduced for some companies. Starting in June, the government subsidized employment by paying companies 5,000 pesos per month (about 1/3 of the current minimum wage) for three months for each new hire. As a solidarity measure, the salaries of better-paid public officials are being reduced by up to 20 percent, with the savings directed to the newly-established Coronavirus Fund. Other sources for the Coronavirus Fund include the additional Social Security Assistance Tax, the 2019 profits of Banco Rep\u00fablica and the National Development Corporation, and donations. Currently, this fund finances the cash subsidies and food assistance for the most vulnerable, together with the cash subsidies for the employees in the construction industry affected by the pandemic-related work stoppages.        Monetary and macro-financial\t    The central bank has been focused on maintaining the appropriate level of liquidity in the system. It has temporarily reduced the reserve requirements that apply to the nominal peso and the inflation-adjusted peso deposits in the commercial banks. This measure has injected about US $ 150 million of additional liquidity into the financial system.     The central bank has temporarily relaxed the regulations in the securities and payments markets and extended the deadlines for data submission.    Loan payments for households and businesses that occur between March 1 and August 31, 2020 are to be deferred for up to 180 days.     The fund that guarantees loans for SMEs has been expanded from US $ 50 million to US $ 500 million (utilizing financing from international organizations). That is expected to allow to guarantee the SME loans up to US $ 2.5 billion. In addition, the rate of commission charged by the fund will be reduced substantially. Moreover, two more guarantee lines are being established, one for larger enterprises and another for enterprises in the sectors (such as tourism) that are directly affected by border closures.    BROU (the country\u2019s largest commercial bank, which is government-owned) will extend soft loans to enterprises. The financing available currently is US $ 50 million, which may be augmented\u2014also with financing from international organizations\u2014to US $ 120 million. In addition, direct credit program for micro and small enterprises will extend working capital loans of up to 18 months to the affected businesses at subsidized rates. Loan repayments for these enterprises are being suspended for at least 30 days.\u00a0    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    The exchange rate has been allowed to adjust, with the central bank intervening to limit undue volatility in the market.     Back to Top UzbekistanBackground. Uzbekistan reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 16, 2020. The authorities implemented extensive measures to prevent the spread of the virus including: restricting travel (including international flights, domestic public transportation, and movement by car), closing borders (except for trade), closing schools, universities, and all stores except grocery stores and pharmacies, and cancelling public events and religious gatherings. Government employees were asked to telework or to stay home. In the first wave, reported COVID cases peaked in April, 2020 at about 750 per week (out of a population of 34 million).Second wave and reopening of the economy. In May some restrictions on individual and business activities were lifted. However, in July the number of new cases accelerated, particularly in the capital region (Tashkent).  In early August, the number of reported new cases reached a second peak of about 6,000 cases per week. The government reimposed quarantine restrictions (including on travel between regions, public events, and large non-food markets, stores, and restaurants). As cases subsided, the government lifted these restrictions and allowed schools and workplaces to reopen. International arrivals were allowed starting in October 2020, but passengers are required to quarantine for 14 days. Wearing masks remains mandatory. As of February 2021, new COVID cases averaged about 300 per week.Economic impact. As elsewhere, the global pandemic significantly impacted Uzbekistan\u2019s economy. Uzbekistan faced weaker trading partner demand (particularly for natural gas) and lower domestic demand due to quarantine restrictions and uncertainty leading to lower private consumption and investment. These effects were partly offset by an increase in gold prices (Uzbekistan\u2019s largest export). In 2020, Uzbekistan\u2019s real GDP growth was 1.6 percent, compared with 5.8 percent in 2019. As the COVID crisis spread to global markets, Uzbekistan\u2019s exchange rate depreciated 5\u00bd percent in April 2020, but has remained relatively stable since then.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    To deal with the crisis, Uzbekistan\u2019s government created an Anti-Crisis Fund of US$ 1 billion (about 2 percent of GDP) to fund support to the economy and help those most affected by the crisis. In addition to the Anti-Crisis Fund, the government temporary reduced some taxes and the Fund for Reconstruction and Development increased lending. Specific crisis response measures have included: (i) expanded funding for healthcare, including for medicines, the costs of quarantines, and salary supplements for healthcare works; (ii) an increase in the number of families with children and low-income families receiving social benefits; (iii) assistance to affected businesses via interest subsidies; and (iv) additional public works for infrastructure and to support employment. The authorities also temporary reduced social contributions for individual entrepreneurs, postponed the payment of property and land taxes, extended a moratorium on tax audits, and delayed tax declarations for 2019 income taxes. The central government also asked local governments to reduce taxes by 30 percent and provide a grace period on paying property tax.    In early 2021, after disbursing the funds through the budget, the government closed the Anti-Crisis Fund. The government\u2019s 2021 budget includes higher expenditures on healthcare and social assistance as well as policy lending to support the economy, primarily through the Fund for Reconstruction and Development.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The central bank suggested banks defer loan repayments of firms in sectors affected by COVID-19. Subsequently, state-owned banks extended deadlines for loan repayments for affected sectors, including for the national air carrier. The central bank reduced its policy rate by 200 basis points in 2020. The policy rate was reduced from 16 to 15 percent on April 15, and from 15 to 14 percent on September 8. While the central bank has not changed requirements for regulatory capital or liquidity, it delayed phasing in tighter liquidity regulations and restricted banks\u2019 dividend distributions. In October 2020, the authorities recommended that banks consider further deferral of loan repayments on a case by case basis.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    VBack to Top VanuatuBackground. There is 1 confirmed case but no deaths from COVID-19 as of March 4, 2021. Currently, there are no active COVID-19 cases in Vanuatu. On November 10, 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected during quarantine. Risk assessment and contact tracing has been conducted by the Ministry of Health with all test results for any potential contacts confirmed to be negative. It has been concluded that this case poses no additional risk to the Vanuatu community.  The government\u2019s response is being coordinated by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), the National Disaster Committee, and the COVID-19 advisory committee of 14 Directors from various government ministries. A national State of Emergency (SOE) was declared on March 26, 2020 for a two-week period. The SOE was extended for a 30-day period on April 11, 2020 as a prevention and containment measure for COVID-19 and in response to Tropical Cyclone (TC) Harold which impacted Vanuatu on April 6-7, 2020. After further renewals, it is now due to expire on July 31, 2021. Government imposed COVID-19 measures include: closing international ports of entry; suspension of domestic flights and ferries; suspension of seasonal worker programs until September 2020 (with optional repatriation of workers already abroad); closing of schools until May 2020; curfews for businesses and transport (excludes essential medical and communication services); restriction of gatherings of more than 5 people (temporarily lifted on April 5 to allow for group sheltering caused by TC Harold and its aftermath) and social distancing. On December 1, 2020, the government lifted restrictions on schools, work, public or private gatherings in Vanuatu. Tourism, which contributes 24.6 percent of Vanuatu\u2019s GDP, has effectively ceased.Reopening of the economy. . Domestic flights and ferries resumed on April 11, 2020. From May 12, 2020, international flights and vessels carrying international relief supplies or cargo can enter, provided they comply with Vanuatu\u2019s COVID-19 prevention and containment measures. All public schools reopened on May 18, 2020. Phase 1 of government repatriations of Vanuatu citizens and residents from abroad began on June 3, 2020. Repatriation and return of vessels registered locally or internationally as Vanuatu vessels outside Vanuatu waters were suspended from July 11 till July 31, 2020. Phase 2 of government repatriations resumed in August and ended December 7, 2020. On September 2020, the government confirmed that targeted testing in quarantine for COVID-19 was being conducted as an additional precaution for those entering Vanuatu from areas classified as high risk. After confirming its first COVID-19 border case in November 2020, people returning on repatriation flights from medium and high risk COVID-19 countries must have a negative COVID-19 test 72 hours before boarding. Phase 3 of government repatriations commenced on January 14, 2021 with strict mandatory quarantine measures applied for 14 days and tests conducted prior to health clearance.On September 3, 2020, Vanuatu began a trial Seasonal Workers Program (SWP) with Australia, called the Mango Pilot project. To date the project has provided employment for more than 300 ni-Vanuatu (as mango pickers) in Northern Territory. Due to potential demand for more seasonal workers in Australia, the government approved in October 2020 for Vanuatu\u2019s broader participation in the SWP and the Pacific Labour Scheme (PLS). Participation in the Recognised Seasonal Employers (RSE) scheme of New Zealand is expected to restart in February 2021. The Tamtam travel bubble that government had initially announced on July 2020 is expected to begin with New Caledonia in April 2021.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government, using its existing budget envelope and with help from Australia, China, New Zealand, UNICEF, WHO, other NGOs/CSOs and some local businesses, is: expanding health facilities, restocking personal protective equipment and supplies, and further training healthcare workers, especially in Port Vila; and spending on community education and awareness. With the assistance of Australia, France and New Zealand, COVID-19 tests are analyzed in the French special collectivity of New Caledonia as needed. The government provided flights and covered arrival and short-term quarantine costs in Port Vila for repatriated ni-Vanuatu. The Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF) provided Hardship Loans, an interest-free withdrawal from a member\u2019s account for 6 months of up to 100,000 vatu, after which the member either choses a repayment plan with interest or permanently withdraws the funds with a penalty. When the loan facility closed on May 1, 2020, the VNPF had paid out about 1.5 billion vatu (US$12.5 million). On April 8, 2020, a fiscal package worth over 4 billion vatu (over 4 percent of GDP) was announced. It includes: deferred and cancelled taxes, license fees and charges for businesses in 2020 (796 million vatu); backdating to start of 2020 some reductions resulting from forthcoming business license reforms; the Employment Stabilization Payment (ESP) (reimbursing employers 30,000 vatu per employee per month for four months, plus an additional 12 percent to the employer, for a total of 2.5 billion vatu); SMEs (turnover of less than 200 million vatu) will also receive the value of their business license fees (roughly 400 million vatu); Commodity Support Grant will be provided to producers of copra, kava, cocoa and coffee (300 million vatu); Shipping Support Grant to facilitate farmers\u2019 access to major market centres such as Port Vila and Luganville (100 million vatu); secondary school tuition fees are suspended for 2020 (42,000 vatu per student for a total of 510 million vatu, paid directly to schools). The package is financed by the government\u2019s cash reserves, reprioritization of expenditures, some debt, and development partner assistance. The government closed the reception for new ESP applications on September 15, 2020, and for new SME Grant applications on November 30, 2020.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    On March 27, 2020, the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) cut its policy rate from 2.9 percent to 2.25 percent. The RBV also undertook other measures at its March 27 and 30 meetings, that along with its policy rate cut, were consistent with its twin policy objectives to maintain inflation within a target range of 0-4 percent and official foreign exchange reserves above a minimum threshold of 4 months of import cover. Other RBV measures include: a reduction of commercial banks\u2019 Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) from 12.0 per cent to 10.0 per cent; and the reactivation of the Bank\u2019s Imports Substitution and Export Finance Facility (ISEFF) and the Disaster Reconstruction Credit Facility (DRCF).     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No specific measures have been undertaken at this time.    Back to Top VietnamBackground. Since the beginning of the outbreak, Vietnam has had nearly  2500 cases.  Strict measures have been introduced to swiftly contain outbreaks, the latest one in Hai Duong and Quang Ninh province, but lifted once the outbreaks were contained. Mobile apps are available (installed by around 60 percent of population) to provide alerts on positive cases and potential exposures in big cities.  Bluezone app, a newly developed app on contact tracing has been downloaded by nearly 30 million people (30 percent of population) . 2020 GDP growth hit the lowest level in last two decades at 2.9 percent, mainly reflecting substantial slowdown in manufacturing, and a contraction in the service sector, in particular transport, tourism and hospitality industries. Vietnam plans to buy 150 million vaccine doses from UK, US, COVAX, and Russia to vaccinate 75 million people in 2021. The first COVAX vaccine doses (117,000) have arrived Vietnam last week a.Reopening of the economy.Vietnam has experienced so far 3 COVID-19 waves. Swift and strict containment measures have been successful, allowing for a normalization of most economic activities, although international tourist travel continues to be banned. The first wave in early 2020 was met with a nationwide lockdown, which was lifted on April 23 and social distancing rules were eased. The second wave, which was mostly localized to Da Nang and Hoi An, led to the temporary and localized re-introduction of strict social isolation measures on July 28 in these areas and few other local provinces later on. A third wave, mostly in Hai Duong, Quang Ninh, and Gia lai provinces started on January 28, and the authorities reintroduced containment measures. Schools and universities in more than 30 provinces were closed earlier than plan for long Tet holidays or moved to online learning. Festivals and sport events in effected provinces were cancelled. Given that Vietnam has contained well again the third domestic outbreak waves, most containment measures have been lifted. Schools have reopened on March 2, except in Hai Duong province. Many non-essential services have resumed as well.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government introduced a fiscal support package with expected value of VND 291.7 trillion (3.6 percent of GDP) to support the economy in 2020.  Measures include deferring payment of VAT and CIT tax obligations and land rental fees by 5 months, deferring PIT payment to year-end  (the estimated amount of payments deferred is VND 180 trillion, or 2.4 percent of GDP). More than 37 percent (VND 66.2 trillion) of total tax and land rental deferral package was  disbursed as of December 31, 2020.    Other measures executed include: cutting registration tax by 50 percent and deferring excise tax on domestically produced cars; lowering land rental by 15 percent, deducting 30 percent of current environmental protection tax on jet-fuel from  August to December, 2020; cutting or exempting various fees and charges, cutting CIT rate for small and micro firms by 30 percent, and raising PIT deduction ahead of the plan. Moreover, the government also implemented following measures: tax exemptions for medical equipment; lower business registration fee, effectively from February 25, 2020 (one-year exemption of business registration tax for newly established household business; first 3-year exemption of business registration tax for SMEs); streamlined tax and custom audit and inspection at firms; and allowing firms and workers to defer (up to 3 months) contributions to the pension fund and survivorship fund without interest penalty (total delayed contribution is estimated at VND 9.5 trillion or 0.1 percent of GDP). The government also approved a cash transfer package worth VND 36 trillion (0.5 percent of GDP) for affected workers and households with monthly cash transfers provided for no more than 3 months, from April to June, 2020. More than 13 percent of the population is estimated to benefit from this program. The Ministry of Finance estimated that approximately VND 12.8 trillion (nearly 36 percent of total package value) was disbursed as of December 31, 2020 to the beneficiaries under this Resolution. Coverage of cash transfer program was expanded to also cover the teachers of private schools.    The government targeted 100 percent disbursement of public investment capital in 2020 with total value of VND 686 trillion or nearly 9 percent of GDP (of which VND 225 trillion is carried over from previous 2019). Disbursement of public investment was estimated to  reach 83 percent of the budget plan (as of December 31, 2020), the highest disbursement rate  over the last five years.    The MOF recently proposed the Government  to continue adopting  tax deferral  and land rental payment for businesses and household in 2021 with total value of VND 115 trillion, given Covid-19 has continued to weigh on business and production, in particular on the tourism and transport sectors. In which, VAT for firms is proposed to defer 5 months with total value of VND 68.8 trillion; CIT deferral would be allowed for 3 months in Q1-2 with total value of VND 40.5 trillion; deferral of PIT and VAT for households, and land rental payment are expected to reach VND 1.3 and 4.4 trillion, respectively.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    Effective October 1, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) cut its benchmark policy rates by 50 bps, the third time in the year, after the first two cuts by 100-150 bps in March 17 and in May 13. The short-term deposit rates cap was also cut further by 0.25 bps, while the short- term lending rate cap for priority sectors is trimmed further by 50 bps.    The SBV has also issued guidelines to commercial banks to reschedule loans, reduce/exempt interest, and provide loan forbearance. As of  mid-December , banks have registered a credit package totaling VND 300 trillion (about 3.8 percent of GDP) at lower interest rates, and supported more than   1.25 million customers( with outstanding loans of nearly  VND 2,450 trillion), by rescheduling repayment, exempting, and reducing interest on existing debts, and extending new loans. Recently the SBV also asked Credit Institutions to not only channel credit to 5 priority economic sectors, but also to accelerate consumer loans to meet legitimate demand of individuals and households. The SBV has delayed the phased reduction of the ratio of short-term funding to finance long term loans for one year, to help credit institutions reduce their cost of funding and maintain medium and long term loan outstanding. Financial institutions have been exempting and reducing payments fees until June 30, 2021. Several securities service fees cut and exemption have been extended through June 30, 2021.    Affected firms are eligible to concessional loans from Vietnam Social Policy Bank (VSPB) with no interest during May 2020 -January 2021 for making salary payment to their workers who temporarily stopped working. The total loan value is planned at VND 16.2 trillion (around 0.2 percent of GDP). Given the low disbursement of this lending program, conditions for concessional loans have been relaxed in late October , since then to December  30,  207 firms  (with total workers of 8,529 people) have signed contract and received disbursement of more than VND 31.6 billion (equivalent to 0.2 percent of the package)    Effective March 31, SBV instructed Credit Institutions (CIs) to actively reduce bonus and salary, cut other operating costs, adjust business plans in a timely manner (including not paying dividend in cash), and use the saved resources to reduce interest. The SBV stated that it is ready to inject liquidity, including through refinancing windows, for VSPB and other CIs to implement the government\u2019s programs and help CIs address NPLs. The SBV has issued a circular on refinancing the VSPB up to VND 16 trillion at zero percent interest rate.     Exchange rate and cfm\t    With depreciation pressures rising, the SBV announced on Mar. 23 that it would intervene in the currency market as needed to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility.    WBack to Top West Bank and GazaBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 5, 2020 (WHO).

The government decided to maintain the ban on events, including weddings and condolence gatherings, and the closure of events halls. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The PA is planning to spend NIS 410 million (0.7 percent of GDP) to cover short-term (1-3 months) critical gaps related to COVID-19. Among other things, the PA is recruiting 51 doctors, medical specialists and general practitioners and plans to purchase of testing toolkits, quarantine facilities, respirators, masks, medicines, and disinfectants. In addition, it plans to allocate additional resources to support poor families and those in need. The authorities plan to spend NIS 20 million (0.1 percent of GDP) to support workers and for unemployment benefits. On the tax side, the PA is cancelling penalties for late submission of tax returns, extending the tax filing deadline to June, and the period of quittance issued by the value added tax from March 1 to April 15, 2020.    On May 5, PM Shtayyeh said that following an earlier understanding with a Palestinian labor union, private sector employees have been paid half of their salaries by their employers. The government also distributed some 98,000 food baskets and paid financial assistance to about 125,000 households.    The government started on May 17 the disbursement of aid to 40,202 laborers affected by the Corona pandemic. Laborers in eligible sectors (e.g., construction, tourism, services, transport) would receive text messages to go to the bank and receive NIS 700. The process would take place over five days.    Total COVID-related spending in 2020 is currently estimated at NIS 659 million (1.1 percent of GDP), of which NIS 499 million (0.8 percent of GDP) for health, NIS 107 million (0.2 percent of GDP) for social protection, and NIS 53 million (0.1 percent of GDP) for workers who lost their income.     Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Palestine Monetary Authority has postponed monthly/periodic loan repayments to all borrowers for the next four months, and for the tourism and hotel sectors for the next six months. It has also prohibited the collection of fees, commissions or additional interest on deferred payments. These measures are subject to extension.    On July 21, the PMA issued new instructions to banks to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19. The new instructions apply to borrowers which banks consider to have been directly affected by the crisis. The new instructions give borrowers the possibility to postpone the payment of their obligations with multiple options (e.g., overdraft, restructuring, rescheduling, a temporary Tawarruq ceiling for Islamic banks). The PMA also lowered the liquidity requirement by 1 percent which frees up about USD 100 million of liquidity that banks could pump to the market.     On July 22, the PMA issued an instruction lowering the bank charge for a declined or \u201cbounced\u201d cheque, since COVID-19 left many businesses with insufficient funds to meet their obligations.    The PMA launched an SME fund to provide soft loans to SMEs impacted by the crisis. Loans are to be disbursed under the 3% interest rate and a repayment period of 36 months. The size of the SME fund will be USD 300 million of which USD 210 comes from banks\u2019 reserves at the PMA.    On 25 August, the PMA announced that $32m in credit facilities had been extended to SMEs affected by the COVID-19 pandemic through the \u2018Estidama\u2019 (sustainability) program.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    YBack to Top YemenBackground. Yemeni authorities reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on April 10, 2020 in areas under its control. Officially reported numbers of cases and death remain relatively low, hindered by limited testing capacities, although the UN has expressed concerns about large undetected spread of the disease in Yemen.  Years of violent conflict have severely damaged the country\u2019s health and general infrastructure,  leaving the health care system poorly equipped to address the spread of COVID-19 and treat infections. with. The UN estimates that only half of the health centers in Yemen are fully functional and reports suggest that ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and protective equipment remain in short supply. Problems are exacerbated by a lack of funding to pay salaries for medical personnel. . Beyond the challenges posed by COVID-19, the country faces a humanitarian crisis with more than one third of the population threatened by acute food insecurity and 50 000 people already living in famine like conditions. The UN response to the COVID-19 crisis is hampered by the conflict and hostilities between the internationally recognized government (IRG) in the South and Ansar Allah (Houthis) in the North have intensified since January with the attack on Aden airport and the Houthi offensive on Marib.Reopening of the economy. In the IRG controlled areas, initial containment measures which lasted for about three months included the closure of schools, universities, and government facilities. . In effect, there have been very few restrictions on mobility since, potentially contributing to the rapid spread of the virus although this is hard to assess due to a lack of testing capacity.  In the Houthi controlled areas, no restrictions were imposed at all.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The government created a commission to deal with COVID-19 issues at the start of the crisis and allocated some additional resources to respond to the crisis in the magnitude of . However, the response is severely constrained by a lack of budgetary space, weak institutional capacity, and limited external assistance.    Nonetheless, the authorities spent about 0.9 percent of GDP on additional COVID and priority expenditures. Moreover, the authorities established emergency facilities, procured test kits and additional ventilators, increased ICU capacity, deployed a public campaign on personal hygiene, and enlisted healthcare workers. The authorities also allocated emergency funds to support local quarantine centers with medical equipment, including by reallocating non-priority outlays. Going forward, priority expenditures, including on health and education, and modest COVID-related support are expected to be maintained. The government is engaging with donors and development partners on its vaccination strategy, with COVAX expected to cover about 23 percent of the population.    The authorities established a high-level interministerial committee to oversee COVID-related spending, prioritize expenditures, and monitor implementation. The authorities are also receiving Fund technical assistance on budget execution and cash management to enhance transparency and help improve accountability in fiscal operations.    UN humanitarian assistance programs in the country remain dramatically underfunded. The most recent UN donor conference on March 1, 2021, was only able to mobilize USD 1.7 billion of the USD 3.85 billion that are needed to finance a bare minimum of essential goods in 2021. According to the World Food Program, USD 1.9 billion will be needed alone to provide the minimum amount of food assistance needed to prevent famine.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    No measures.     Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    ZBack to Top ZambiaBackground. Zambia recorded its first COVID-19 cases on March 18 and the number of daily new cases has been on a downward trajectory since early August. The second wave that has started in mid-December peaked in February and the number of cases has been falling since. Early actions to contain the spread of the virus included: (i) closure of schools and universities; (ii) suspension of non-essential foreign travel; (iii) mandatory quarantine for all foreign travelers; (iv) closure of bars, cinemas, and casinos; (v) delivery and take-out regime for restaurants; (vi) restriction on public gatherings to at most 50 people; (vii) restriction on sports activities; (viii) a temporary lockdown on the towns of Kafue and Nakonde; and (ix) a partial closure of the border with Tanzania. In addition, the Zambian economy will be adversely impacted by the sharp depreciation of the local currency, increases in yields on public debt, and economic disruptions due to lockdowns in trading partners.Reopening of the economy.Since April 24, the government has been slowly lifting lockdowns, border closures, and restrictions, subject to social distancing, including on churches, some non-contact sports, and barber shops and salons. On May 8, cinemas, gyms, casinos, tourist spots, and restaurants were allowed to open as long as they adhere to strict social distancing and sanitary guidelines. Bars and nightclubs were allowed to reopen on September 12.  Primary and secondary school examination classes reopened on June 1. On September 14 all schools, colleges, and universities were reopened. A reopening of international airports was announced on June 25. Lusaka city council suspended all special gatherings and ordered bars and restaurants to work on takeout basis for two weeks on January 6 to curb the second wave of the pandemic. Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2020Fiscal\t    Import duties on mineral concentrate and export duties on precious metals were suspended to support the mining sector (the first measure was extended permanently with the 2021 Budget). The government has waived tax penalties and fees on outstanding tax liabilities resulting from CoVID-19. It has suspended customs duties and VAT on some medical supplies and medical related commodities. It has alsoremoved provisions related to claiming VAT on imported spare parts, lubricants, and stationery, in order to ease pressure on companies. The government has also issued an 8billionkwacha bond (2.4 percent of GDP) to finance CoVID-19 related expenses, including health spending, arrears clearance, and grain purchases, as well as a recapitalization ofa non-bank financial institution (NATSAVE). The 2021 Budget envisions zeroratingunder the VAT for equipment used for full body sanitization for a period of one year, as well as tax breaks for tourism: a permanently lower CIT rate and suspended import duties and fees.    Monetary and macro-financial\t    The Bank of Zambia\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee lowered the policy rate by 225 bps to 9.25 percent on May 19and by 125 bps on August 19 to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic. The BoZ plans to provide 10 billion kwacha (3.1 percent of GDP) of medium-term liquidity support to eligible financial services providers. It alsoscaled up open-market operations to provide short-term liquidity support to commercial banks and embarked on abond purchase program worth 8 billion kwacha to provide liquidity to the financial sector. In addition, BoZ implemented several measures to stimulate the use of e-money and reduce the use of cash, revised the rules governing the operations of the interbank foreign exchange market to support its smooth functioning by strengthening market discipline and providing a mechanism to address heightened volatility, revised loan classification and provisioning rules, and extended the transitional arrangement to IFRS9.The BoZ has allowed financial service providers to renegotiate the terms of credit facilities with borrowers affected by the pandemic. Non-bank financial institutions were allowed to use capital instruments that do not qualify as common equity Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital for the purposes of computing regulatory capital.    Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    No measures.    Back to Top ZimbabweBackground. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Zimbabwe was facing a severe drought and macroeconomic policy missteps with significant adverse implications for economic stability and growth and the humanitarian situation. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to significantly affect by the economy, especially tourism, non-food manufacturing, mining, financial services and transport.  Staff projects a small growth recovery in 2021 despite the lockdown from the second COVID-19 wave. Growth would be driven mainly by strong agricultural output and higher gold deliveries.. As of March 3, 2021, there were 36,179 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 33,392 recoveries and 1, 478 deaths.A COVID-19 National Preparedness and Response Plan was launched on March 19, 2020 with President Mnangagwa declaring the pandemic a State of National Disaster. The authorities launched on April 2, 2020, a US$2.2 billion domestic and international humanitarian appeal covering the period April 2020 to April 2021. As of September 2020, humanitarian support disbursements stood at US$448.4 million. Key donors include the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Sweden, The Global Fund, the African Development Bank, and the World Bank.WFP projects that 6.8 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2021 in Zimbabwe, reflecting not only the COVID-19 pandemic by also the macro-economic challenges. In late December 2020, the WFP made an urgent appeal for US$204 million to support over 4 million of the most food insecure people over the next six months. The funding would allow WFP to provide the minimum amount of emergency food assistance to the most vulnerable 3.5 million rural and 0.5 million urban residents, complementing the response of Zimbabwe\u2019s government and other partners.Additional containment measures and impact on populationThe second COVID wave has abated and lockdown has been mostly lifted. The borders with South Africa have been re-opened. Schools and colleges will open on March 15, 2021. Gatherings are allowed at 50 people maximum and funerals at 30 people maximum attendance. Supermarkets and other outlets supplying essential goods and services to customers are allowed to  open till late and a curfew is effective between 10 pm and 5am.Key Policy Responses as of March 4, 2021Fiscal\t    The authorities have announced plans for rolling out a COVID-19 vaccination program and have reported setting aside US$100 million, expected to cover about 60 percent of the population. This expenditure was not included in the 2021 National Budget. As of February 3, the COVAX facility regional supply forecasts 1,152,000 vaccines for Zimbabwe. The vaccine rollout program started in late February with 200,000 vaccines donated by China (Sinopharma). A further shipment of 600,000 vaccines is expected in March from China. Discussions are ongoing to procure vaccines from India, Russia, EU, America, COVAX and African Union.    Last year, the authorities\u2019 Stimulus Package for COVID-19 aimed at: (i) providing liquidity support to agriculture, mining, tourism, SMEs, and arts; (ii) expanding social safety nets and food grants; (iii) setting up a health sector support fund; and (iv) scaling up investments in social and economic infrastructure in Cyclone Idai affected communities. They also supported the food security related program which included wheat farming and maize procurement, and the Pfumvudza Program which support vulnerable households with farming inputs. To cushion the vulnerable members of society, the government provided COVID-19 cash transfers.    The freeze on government hiring was lifted for the health sector, targeting over 4,713 additional medical personnel (about 20 percent increase); companies have been allowed to extend the payment of corporate taxes (waiving interest and penalties); and duties and taxes on various goods and services related to COVID-19 were suspended, including on testing, protection, sterilization, and other medical consumables and procurement regulations have been relaxed to facilitate speedy procurement of essential goods and services.    Zimbabwe is experiencing hyperinflation, with inflation at 322 percent y-on-y in February 2021. In order to cushion the loss of purchasing power from hyperinflation and the COVID-19 pandemic, the authorities started paying US$75 to civil servants, US$30 to pensioners to cushion, and awarded a 50 percent salary increment which was followed by a 40 percent increment in October 2020.        Monetary and macro-financial\t    In March 2020, the authorities returned to the multicurrency system allowing both Zimbabwean dollar and US dollar to be legal tender.    In 2020, the RBZ introduced a ZWL$5 billion medium-term bank accommodation lending facility at 10 percent per annum and increased the private sector lending facility from ZW$1 billion to ZW$2.5 billion. Beneficiaries have included the mining, tourism, manufacturing, construction sectors. Funds were also set aside for supporting empowerment programs for SMEs, artists and sports, through the Empowerment Bank, Zimbabwe Women Microfinance Bank, People\u2019s Own Savings Bank and Small and Medium Enterprises Development Company.    In its February 2021 Monetary Policy Statement, the central bank adjusted some of the policies that it was implementing to cushion firms from the COVID-19 effects. The statutory reserve ratio on demand and/or call was pegged back to 5 percent after having been lowered from 5 to 4.5 percent in March 2020, and further lowered from 4.5 percent to 2.5 percent in June 2020. The RBZ policy rate was increased to 40 percent after being lowered from 35 percent to 15 percent per annum in March 2020 and  35 percent in July 1, 2020. This they said was to stem speculative borrowing.        Exchange rate and balance of payments\t    In March 2020, the RBZ moved from a fixed to a managed float exchange rate regime. The RBZ also revised the FX allocation priority list to improve allocation efficiency in light of the prioritize COVID-19 pandemic. Faced with acute foreign currency shortages, in June 2020, the RBZ introduced a foreign currency auction system and reinstated the 30-day limit of liquidating surplus foreign exchange receipts from exports which was further revised to a 60-day limit for FX liquidation.                                                                                                                                                       \tAbout\tResearch\tCountries\tCapacity Development\tNews\tEvents\tVideos\tData\tPublications\tSocial Media Hub\tAnnual Report\tCopyright and Usage\tPrivacy Policy\tContact Us\tCareers\tGlossary\tScam Alert\t\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\t\u4e2d\u6587\tFran\u00e7ais\t\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\t\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\tEspa\u00f1ol\u00a9 2021 International Monetary Fund.
