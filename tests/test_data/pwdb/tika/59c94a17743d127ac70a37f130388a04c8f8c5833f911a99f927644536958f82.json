What guidance is available for businesses on insurance?                                    \tThe CBI has produced an SME insurance guide with the Association of British Insurers and the British Insurance Brokers\u2019 Association.\tInsurance policies differ significantly, so businesses are encouraged to check the terms and conditions of their policy documentation, including the schedule of insurance and contact their providers \u2013 either their broker or the insurance firm.\tStandard commercial insurance policies \u2013 which is what most businesses purchase - are unlikely to cover pandemics or specified notifiable diseases such as COVID-19 and SARS. However, those businesses which have an insurance policy that covers government ordered closure and pandemics or government ordered closure and unspecified notifiable diseases may be able to make a claim, subject to the terms and conditions of their policy and schedule.\tThe Association of British Insurers is now running a\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0information hub\u00a0which is updated daily for advice, guidance and commons questions relating to travel, business, trade credit insurance and much more.\u00a0\tThe British Insurance Brokers\u2019 Association are publishing daily updates on coronavirus and the insurance industry on its website to help businesses with common questions and updates.\tBusinesses can also check the government website for guidance on business insurance.                                                                                            \u00a0                                                            Employment                                                    How should businesses support flexible working for employees who can work from home?                                    \tThe government has asked all employees to work from home unless it is impossible for them to do so.\u00a0Businesses should\u00a0therefore\u00a0support flexible working as much as\u00a0reasonably possible when working remotely.\tEmployers should encourage managers and employees with caring responsibilities to speak about any additional flexibility they may need during the day. This could be allowing employees to work reduced hours or flex their hours to work around their caring arrangements.\tEmployers should be sympathetic to any distractions that may arise at home, such as children or pets moving around or making noise.\tEmployees\u2019 performance and productivity should be reasonably appraised while working at home, and businesses should consider relaxing performance management where appropriate.\tRead the CBI\u2019s latest article on the role businesses play in supporting employees to look after their loved ones as the pandemic rolls on.\tThe CBI has published a factsheet on employee engagement for virtual teams \u2013 from onboarding to performance reviews and collaboration.                                                        How should businesses support flexible working for employees who cannot work from home?                                    \tEmployers should adapt their practices to observe a distance of at least 1-2\u00a0metres\u00a0between individuals wherever possible.\u00a0\tEmployers should consider staggering shifts and processes to\u00a0enable staff to continue operating\u00a0both effectively and at a safe distance\u00a0wherever possible.\tAs well as\u00a0ensuring\u00a0the health and safety of staff, these practices can increase\u00a0opportunities for more flexible working. Depending on the nature of the business, employers are considering the following practices:\tTime-banking to allow workers to \u2018accrue hours\u2019 to take as time off at a later date, outside of their usual shift pattern\tIntroducing condensed shift patterns whereby employees are able to work their total contracted hours over fewer working days\tLeveraging\u00a0annualised\u00a0hours contracts, by allowing workers to reduce the number of hours they\u2019re working during the pandemic but still work the same number of total hours over the year\tSplitting teams so that operations run below full capacity at any given time\tEnabling\u00a0individuals to take annual leave during this period.                                                        How can businesses help employees manage their holiday entitlement?                                    \tThe government has announced amendments to the Working Time Regulations (WTR) that will allow all workers to carry over up to four weeks\u2019 paid holiday over a two-year period.\tThis will be possible in cases where it has not been reasonably practicable for a worker to take some or all of this leave as a result of the effects of coronavirus (including on the worker, the employer or on the wider economy or society).\tThese amendments do not impact on the 1.6 weeks of Additional Leave that the WTR provides or on any other leave that a worker may be contractually entitled to. Both can be carried over,\u00a0subject to agreement between the employer and the individual.\tEmployers retain the ability under the WTR to require their employees to take or not take leave at specific times, although\u00a0the government is yet\u00a0to\u00a0clarify\u00a0whether this\u00a0will be the case for workers\u00a0furloughed\u00a0via the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.\tEmployers should always consider the employee relations of\u00a0changes to holiday entitlements, and discuss\u00a0any planned changes as a result of the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0with staff\u00a0as soon as possible.\tTo enable these changes, the government will relax employers\u2019 obligation to ensure that their workers take their statutory entitlement in any one year.\tIt remains\u00a0good practice for employers to still encourage workers and employees to take their paid holiday, as time off from work is important to people\u2019s wellbeing, especially in these challenging times.\tFurther information can be found on the gov.uk information page.

Also check if you need to\u00a0self-isolate.\tUnder the\u00a0Test to Release for International Travel scheme\u00a0people returning to England who need to self-isolate will be able to take a COVID test with a private test provider to see if they can end their self-isolation early. From mid-January 2021, all international arrivals to England, including UK nationals, will be required to present a negative COVID-19 test taken up to 72 hours prior to departure. Passengers will be subject to an immediate fine of \u00a3500 if they fail to comply with the new regulations on pre-departure testing. All passengers arriving from countries not on the government\u2019s travel corridor list will still be required to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of test result. Passengers will also still be required to fill in a passenger locator form and be subject to national lockdown restrictions.\tSee further government advice on foreign travel.\tThere is also guidance on travel corridors. Rules regarding travel corridors and inward travel applies to England only.                                                        How are other companies managing employees who are stuck abroad or quarantined abroad?                                    \tIt is important that firms encourage employees quarantined abroad to follow health advice\u00a0from national authorities.\tSome firms with employees stuck abroad\u00a0have been reaching out proactively to\u00a0those members of staff to ensure they understand policies\u00a0with regard to\u00a0annual leave and sick leave, and are supporting them\u00a0to work from abroad if at all possible.\tSome firms\u00a0with employees quarantined abroad are highlighting access to mental health and wellbeing support.                                                                                            \u00a0                                                            Cleaning and health in the workplace                                                    What guidance is available for businesses and workplaces where employees are unable to work from home?                                    \tThe\u00a0advice\u00a0on social distancing measures applies to everyone and should be followed wherever possible. Workplaces need to avoid crowding and\u00a0minimise\u00a0opportunities for the virus to spread by maintaining a distance of at least 2\u00a0metres\u00a0(3 steps) between individuals wherever possible. This advice applies both to inside the workplace, and to where staff may need to interact with customers.\tStaff should be reminded to wash their hands regularly using soap and water for 20 seconds and particularly after blowing their nose, sneezing or coughing. Where facilities to wash hands are not available, hand\u00a0sanitiser\u00a0should be used. Workers should cover any coughs or sneezes with a tissue, then dispose of the tissue in a bin and immediately wash their hands.\tThe government have produced\u00a0this\u00a0tailored advice\u00a0for different scenarios as an example of how social distancing and other measures might be implemented by employers in England to help protect their workforce and customers from coronavirus while still continuing to trade.                                                        What should a company do if an employee or visitor becomes unwell while at work?                                    \tIf anyone becomes unwell with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature in the business or workplace they should be advised to follow the\u00a0stay at home guidance\u00a0for households with possible coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. If these symptoms develop whilst at work they should be sent home, they should return home quickly and directly. \tIf they have to use public transport, they should try to keep away from other people and catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue.\u00a0\tIf you, or an employee, need clinical advice, they should go to\u00a0NHS 111 online, or call 111 if they don\u2019t have internet access.\tIf the member of staff lives in a household where someone else is unwell with symptoms of coronavirus then they must stay at home in line with the stay-at-home guidance.\u00a0                                                        If an employee within the workplace tests positive for the virus, should anything specific be used for cleaning purposes?                                    \tThe government has\u00a0issued\u00a0this\u00a0advice\u00a0for cleaning in non-healthcare settings\u00a0after\u00a0someone with suspected coronavirus has left.\tTo clean the workspace where someone with confirmed coronavirus has visited\u00a0\u2013 all surfaces and objects visibly contaminated and all potentially contaminated high-contact areas\u00a0should be cleaned.\u00a0Pay\u00a0particular attention\u00a0to frequently touched areas and surfaces, such as bathrooms, grab-rails in corridors and stairwells and door handles.\u00a0The virus is easily broken down with proper application of standard cleaning products: disposable cloths and household detergents\u00a0should be used to\u00a0clean these areas, and disposed of in doubled-up plastic bags under the guidance of the PHE Health Protection Team.\tIf an area has been heavily contaminated, such as with visible bodily fluids, from a person with coronavirus, consider using protection for the eyes, mouth and nose, as well as wearing gloves and an apron.\tCurrent PHE\u00a0guidance\u00a0is that public areas where a symptomatic individual has passed through and spent minimal time in (such as corridors) but which are not visibly contaminated with body fluids\u00a0can be cleaned thoroughly as normal.\tIf an area can be kept closed and secure for 72 hours, wait until this time has passed for cleaning as the amount of virus living on surfaces will have reduced significantly by 72 hours.                                                                                            \u00a0                                                            Supply chain                                                    How are other companies managing disruption to their supply chains as a result of coronavirus?                                    \tA number of\u00a0manufacturing and logistics firms\u00a0in specific sectors\u00a0are facing difficulties with\u00a0delays in deliveries from Asia, as a result of the effect of quarantines in China\u00a0\tSome firms are utilising their\u00a0no deal Brexit stockpiles, having utilised their stockpiles for Chinese New Year\u00a0\u00a0\tSome firms are reviewing the smaller businesses in their supply\u00a0chains to understand their exposure to China and other disrupted markets\u00a0\tSome firms have been able to source replacement components from elsewhere, but have had to consider\u00a0cashflow, timing and margins of projects\u00a0\tWhere impacts on\u00a0supply chains\u00a0are\u00a0being experienced, companies are encouraged to communicate\u00a0the details to the CBI at\u00a0coronavirussupport@cbi.org.uk.\u00a0                                                                                            \u00a0                                                                    Decisions about actions to take will be different for every company, and this\u00a0guidance cannot substitute legal advice or that of the government.
