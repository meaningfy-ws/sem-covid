Both measures were agreed at Government today.                The EWSS is a key component of the Government\u2019s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis and by maintaining the current rates the Government is ensuring that the EWSS remains a strong incentive for employers and workers to maintain their relationship through the current challenging period.                Speaking following today\u2019s Government meeting, Minister Donohoe said:                            \u201cThe Government have agreed that additional public health restrictions will be in place for the coming weeks \u2013 but it is important that employers have the option of retaining their staff so that they may respond and recover quickly when these temporary restrictions are lifted.                                    That is why the EWSS has been central to the Government\u2019s response with nearly \u20ac4.5 billion worth of payments having been made via wage subsidies to sustain businesses and help people to manage financially in the midst of these very challenging times.                                    These measures have been put in place to help otherwise viable businesses who continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and I would encourage all eligible firms to apply for the schemes.\u201d                        ENDS                Notes to Editors                The rates of subsidy that will continue to apply until 31 March 2021 are set out as follows:                            \tGross Weekly pay\tRate of Subsidy to employer\tLess than \u20ac151.50\tNil\t\u20ac151.50 \u2013 \u20ac202.99\t\u20ac203\t\u20ac203 - \u20ac299.99\t\u20ac250\t\u20ac300 - \u20ac399.99\t\u20ac300\t\u20ac400 - \u20ac1,462\t\u20ac350\tOver \u20ac1,462\tNil\t\u00a0                        The estimated cost of the above is an additional \u20ac38 million per week, or an additional \u20ac323 million in total by the end of March 2021.

On Tuesday the exchequer figures showed that the pandemic had punched a \u20ac21 billion hole in the public finances. Remarkably (given that the jobless rate is running at 20.4 per cent) income tax receipts were down only 1 per cent.                                                         Fortunately, we are able to borrow at negative rates from bond investors \u2013 the National Treasury Management Agency raised \u20ac5.5 billion this week \u2013 to help keep the show on the road, but the tab will have to be picked up by future generations.

This was replaced by the employment wage subsidy scheme, with \u20ac1.4 billion paid to 39,800 employers in respect of 443,100 employees.                                                        The Covid restrictions support scheme, introduced in the budget to support businesses significantly affected by the lockdown restrictions, has seen \u20ac146 million paid out to 16,600 companies.                                                        And 70,000 businesses availed of the debt warehousing scheme, which allows Revenue to park VAT and payroll tax debt arising from the Covid restrictions. Some \u20ac1.9 billion of tax debt was warehoused last year, a cost that will have to be met by those businesses down the road.                                                         Perhaps more importantly, given that we are a small open economy heavily reliant on exports, was the warning that global investment flows are likely to be significantly curtailed in 2021 because of the ongoing impact of the pandemic and having to fight for \u201ca much smaller pool\u201d of activity. IDA chief executive Martin Shanahan outlined how the full impact of this was still to play out.                                                                                                                                                 Thankfully, there is light at the end of the tunnel with the rollout of vaccines globally. Yet, in economic terms, it\u2019s hard not to feel that this period is merely the calm before the storm and that once the various government supports begin to be removed, many businesses simply won\u2019t be able to survive.                                                                                                                                           \tNews DigestsStay on top of the latest newsSIGN UP HERE                                           \t\t\t                                                                                                                                                                         \tTopics:\t                Cantillon            \t                Coronavirus            \t                Brexit            \t                Martin Shanahan            \t                IDA Ireland            \t                National Treasury Management Agency                                                                            Read More                \t                    Immunity from Covid-19 lasts up to six months after infection \u2013 Hiqa                                    \t                    Cold and flu remedy sales dip 55% on social distancing                                    \t                    HSE to contact high-risk patients about vaccine, says chief clinical officer                                    \t                    Vending machines help ease access to Covid-19 tests in Japan                                    \t                    \u2018My 14-year-old son seems obsessed with boxing, and I don\u2019t like the sport\u2019                                                                                            \t                    When \u2013 or will \u2013 life ever go back to normal?
