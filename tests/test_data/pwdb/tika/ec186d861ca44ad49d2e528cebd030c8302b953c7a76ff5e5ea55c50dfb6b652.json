In order to provide requesting Member States with financial assistance at favourable terms, the European Commission will raise funds on international capital markets on behalf of the EU. SURE loans will be backed by the EU budget and guarantees provided by Member States. Formally, the financial assistance will be granted by a decision adopted by the Council on a proposal from the Commission.", "content_of_measure_description": "SURE is a temporary scheme which can provide up to \u20ac100 billion of loans under favourable terms to all Member States. The instrument enables Member States to request EU financial support to help finance the sudden and severe increases of national public expenditure, as from 1 February 2020, related to national short-time work schemes and similar measures, including for self-employed persons, or to some health-related measures, in particular at the workplace in response to the crisis.\r\rSURE will become available after all Member States have provided their guarantees. Each Member State's contribution to the overall amount of the guarantee corresponds to its relative share in the total gross national income (GNI) of the European Union, based on the 2020 EU budget. The instrument will then be operational until 31 December 2022. On the proposal from the Commission, the Council may decide to extend the period of availability of the instrument, each time for a further six-month period, if the severe economic disturbances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak persist.", "use_of_measure_description": "On August 24, the first SURE loans were proposed by the Commission for the following countries:\r\r* Italy - \u20ac27.4 billion;\r* Spain - \u20ac21.3 billion, \r* Poland - \u20ac11.2 billion; \r* Belgium - \u20ac7.8 billion;\r* Portugal - \u20ac5.9 billion; \r* Romania - \u20ac4 billion; \r* Greece - \u20ac2.7 billion; \r* Czechia - \u20ac2 billion; \r* Slovenia - \u20ac1.1 billion.\r* Croatia - \u20ac1 billion;\r* Lithuania- \u20ac602 million; \r* Slovakia - \u20ac631 million;\r* Bulgaria - \u20ac511 million:\r* Cyprus - \u20ac479 million; \r* Malta - \u20ac244 million:\r* Latvia - \u20ac192 million; \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "Social partners were not directly involved in the work on this initiative.

The global outbreak of that disease is evolving rapidly and has been declared a pandemic by the WHO. From the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Union up until 30 March 2020, 334\u00a0396 cases and 22\u00a0209 deaths were reported in the Member States.                           \t                     (4)                  \t                     Member States have implemented extraordinary measures to contain the COVID\u201019 outbreak and its impact. The probability of further transmission of COVID\u201019 in the Union is considered high. In addition to public health impacts with substantial fatal outcomes, the COVID\u201019 outbreak has had a massive and disruptive impact on the economic systems of the Member States, caused societal disruptions and increased public expenditure in a growing number of Member States.                           \t                     (5)                  \t                     That exceptional situation, which is beyond the control of the Member States and which has immobilised a substantial part of their labour force, has led to a sudden and severe increase in public expenditure by the Member States on short-time work schemes for employees and similar measures, in particular for the self-employed, as well as expenditure on some health-related measures, in particular in the workplace. In order to maintain the strong focus of the instrument provided for in this Regulation and thereby its effectiveness, health-related measures for the purpose of that instrument may consist of those aiming at reducing occupational hazards and ensuring the protection of workers and the self\u2010employed in the workplace, and, where appropriate, some other health\u2010related measures. It is necessary to facilitate efforts by the Member States to address the sudden and severe increase in public expenditure until the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on their labour force are under control.                           \t                     (6)                  \t                     The creation of a European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) (the \u2018Instrument\u2019) following the COVID-19 outbreak should enable the Union to respond to the crisis in the labour market in a coordinated, rapid and effective manner and in a spirit of solidarity among Member States, thereby alleviating the impact on employment for individuals and the most affected economic sectors and mitigating the direct effects of this exceptional situation on public expenditure by the Member States.                           \t                     (7)                  \t                     Article 220(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(1) states that financial assistance by the Union to Member States can take the form of a loan. Such loans should be granted to Member States where the COVID-19 outbreak has led to a sudden and severe increase, as from 1 February 2020, in actual and possibly also planned public expenditure due to national measures. That date ensures equal treatment for all Member States and allows for coverage of their actual and possibly also planned increases in spending relating to the effects on the labour markets of the Member States, irrespective of when the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in each specific Member State. The national measures, which are understood to be in line with the relevant fundamental rights principles, should be directly related to the creation or extension of short-time work schemes and to similar measures, including measures for self-employed persons, or to some health-related measures. Short-time work schemes are public programmes that in certain circumstances allow businesses experiencing economic difficulties to temporarily reduce the hours worked by their employees, who are provided with public income support for the hours not worked.                     Similar schemes exist for income replacement for the self-employed. The Member State requesting financial assistance should provide evidence of a sudden and severe increase in actual and possibly also planned public expenditure for short-time work schemes or similar measures. If financial assistance is granted for health-related measures, the Member State requesting financial assistance should also provide evidence of actual or planned expenditure related to the relevant health-related measures.                           \t                     (8)                  \t                     In order to provide the affected Member States with sufficient financial means under favourable terms to enable them to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their labour market, the Union\u2019s borrowing and lending operations under the Instrument should be sufficiently large. The financial assistance granted by the Union in the form of loans should therefore be financed by recourse to international capital markets.                           \t                     (9)                  \t                     The COVID-19 outbreak has had a massive and disruptive impact on the economic system of each Member State. It therefore calls for collective contributions by Member States in the form of guarantees supporting the loans from the Union budget. Such guarantees are necessary to enable the Union to grant loans of a sufficient order of magnitude to Member States in order to support labour market policies which are under the greatest strain. To ensure that the contingent liability arising from such loans is compatible with the applicable multiannual financial framework (\u2018MFF\u2019) and own\u2010resources ceilings, the guarantees provided by the Member States should be irrevocable, unconditional and on demand, while additional safeguards should enhance the robustness of the system. In line with the complementary role of such guarantees, and without prejudice to their irrevocable, unconditional and on-demand nature, the Commission is expected, before calling on the guarantees provided by Member States, to draw on the margin available under the own\u2010resources ceiling for payment appropriations to the extent that it is deemed sustainable by the Commission, having regard, inter alia, to the total contingent liabilities of the Union, including under the balance of payments facility established by Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002\u00a0(2). In the relevant call on guarantees, the Commission should inform the Member States about the extent to which the available margin has been drawn. The need for guarantees provided by Member States may be reviewed if an agreement on a revised own-resources ceiling is reached.                           \t                     (10)                  \t                     The additional safeguards to enhance the robustness of the system should consist of conservative financial management, a maximum annual exposure and sufficient diversification of the loan portfolio.                           \t                     (11)                  \t                     The loans granted under the Instrument should constitute financial assistance within the meaning of Article 220 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. In accordance with point (g) of Article 282(3) of that Regulation, Article 220 of that Regulation will apply to the loans granted under the Instrument only as from the date of application of the post\u20102020 MFF. However, it is appropriate that the requirements set out in Article 220(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 apply to the borrowing and lending operations under the Instrument as of the entry into force of this Regulation.                           \t                     (12)                  \t                     In order to make the contingent liability arising from loans granted under the Instrument compatible with the applicable MFF and own-resources ceilings, it is necessary to lay down prudential rules, including on the possibility of rolling over the borrowings contracted on behalf of the Union.                           \t                     (13)                  \t                     Given their particular financial implications, decisions to grant financial assistance pursuant to this Regulation require the exercise of implementing powers, which should be conferred on the Council. When deciding upon the amount of a loan, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, should consider the existing and expected needs of the requesting Member State, as well as requests for financial assistance pursuant to this Regulation already submitted or planned to be submitted by other Member States, having regard to the principles of equal treatment, solidarity, proportionality and transparency, and in a manner that fully respects the competence of the Member States.                           \t                     (14)                  \t                     Article 143(1) of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community\u00a0(3) (the \u2018Withdrawal Agreement\u2019) limits the liability of the United Kingdom for its share of the contingent financial liabilities of the Union to those contingent financial liabilities of the Union arising from financial operations taken by the Union before the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement. Any contingent financial liability of the Union arising from financial assistance under this Regulation would be subsequent to the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement. Therefore, the United Kingdom should not participate in the financial assistance under this Regulation.                           \t                     (15)                  \t                     As the Instrument is of a temporary nature in order to address the COVID\u201019 outbreak, the Commission should assess every six months whether the exceptional circumstances causing the severe economic disturbances in Member States still exist and report to the Council. Consistently with the legal basis for the adoption of this Regulation, no financial assistance should be made available under this Regulation once the COVID\u201019 emergency has passed. To that end, it is appropriate to limit the availability of the Instrument in time. The Council should be empowered, on a proposal from the Commission, to extend the period of availability of the Instrument where the exceptional occurrences that justify the application of this Regulation continue to exist.                           \t                     (16)                  \t                     The European Central Bank delivered its opinion on 8 May 2020.                           \t                     (17)                  \t                     Given the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the need for an urgent response to the consequences of that outbreak, this Regulation should enter into force on the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,                           HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:                     Article 1            Subject matter and scope                           1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to address the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and respond to its socio\u2010economic consequences, this Regulation establishes the European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) (the \u2018Instrument\u2019).                                       2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down the conditions and procedures enabling the Union to provide financial assistance to a Member State which is experiencing, or is seriously threatened with, a severe economic disturbance caused by the COVID-19 outbreak for the financing, primarily, of short-time work schemes or similar measures aimed at protecting employees and the self\u2010employed and thus reducing the incidence of unemployment and loss of income, as well as for the financing, as an ancillary, of some health-related measures, in particular in the workplace.

In particular, we will see high levels of business bankruptcies, reduced investment plans, high unemployment, weaker government finances, and increased protectionist pressures on both the internal market and external trade. Smart European leadership and efficient forms of solidarity will be needed to recover from this unprecedented crisis and strengthen European sovereignty in the post-COVID-19 world.Controlling the virus whilst preserving our economies and societies requires, in the first instance, a co-ordinated EU emergency response and an effective risk-based exit strategy.In addition, the EU and its member states must work with the social partners to immediately define a clear, ambitious, predictable and co-ordinated EU recovery plan in order to give businesses the confidence to keep going through this crisis, ensure that we rapidly address the damage to our economies, and start restoring businesses capacity for investment and employment.BusinessEurope\u2019s EU recovery plan sets out detailed proposals under 4 pillars which if implemented together can help create a regulatory and fiscal environment for businesses that enables them to invest, grow and create jobs:\tA rapid deployment of EU investment funds as part of an ambitious and co-ordinated EU fiscal stimulus, including immediate agreement on a new and revised multi-annual financial framework (MFF), and a specific European recovery fund to bring new money to the table without mutualising existing debt between Member States*.\tA revitalised and open single market and strengthened single currency, as part of a greater focus on supporting sustainable investment, growth and employment.\tThe EU as a leading advocate for rules-based, fair and free trade and investment and a strong supporter of multilateral solutions. \tStrengthened EU governance to ensure EU financial support increases implementation by member states of growth and employment-enhancing structural reforms and upward convergence.* This paragraph is

Ministers and the Council meeting next week to approve the European Commission\u2019s proposal for a \u20ac100 billion \u2018SURE\u2019 scheme to support short-term work and other measures to protect jobs and wages during the coronavirus crisis.The ETUC calls on Member States to swiftly put at the disposal of the European Commission the necessary guarantees to make the scheme operational as soon as possible!The ETUC welcomes the efforts put in place by the European Commission to launch \u2018SURE\u2019 and asks that clear guidelines are issued as soon as possible to recommend Member States to establish short-time work or similar schemes in every country, to ensure they cover all workers and companies, and that social partners are involved in their design and implementation.\u201cA scheme like SURE is urgently needed to prevent mass unemployment and a deep recession\u201d said Luca Visentini, ETUC General Secretary. \u201cTrade unions urge the Eurogroup and the Council to agree SURE and to make it operational immediately. More jobs are being lost every day and ambitious measures to prevent job losses and protect wages cannot wait.\u201d\u201cThe benefit of having the Commission raising money in the markets to finance it is that it will apply to all EU countries and does not come with counter-productive conditions of the kind that did so much damage to Greece and the other countries affected by the Troika after the last crisis.\u201cIt is very important that all Member States establish short-time work or similar schemes with support of SURE, and that they ensure such schemes cover all workers and companies, and that social partners are involved in their design and implementation.\u00a0\u201cPutting SURE in place should not mean that plans for a European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme are abandoned. A permanent scheme is still needed to protect the Euro area from future crises.\u201d                                                                        02.04.2020                        Press release              In              Economic  and Social Cohesion,           Economic and Social crisis,           Employment / Labour Market Policy                      \u00a0Print                                \t   Facebook share   \t   Twitter   \t   LinkedIn                                                                                                                                                                           Browse                          \t                News              \t                Documents              \t                Publications              \t                Campaigns              \t                About us              \t                Call for tender              \t                Communication Department              \t                Jobs              \t                Privacy                                                  About us                                      The ETUC is the voice of workers and represents 45 million members from 90\u00a0trade union organisations in 38\u00a0European countries, plus 10 European Trade Union Federations.

    The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) wrote a letter today to the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission to ask for urgent meetings with the aim to discuss how to reinforce the social partners\u2019 involvement in the design, governance and implementation of MFF and Recovery Plan, at both European and national levels.\u00a0 ETUC also insists on ensuring that respect of social dialogue, collective bargaining and workplace democracy are binding conditions for funding.While welcoming the recent adoption by the Council of the \u20ac750bn EU Recovery Plan to face COVID19 crisis and the \u20ac1,074bn Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027, some aspects of the agreement reached by the Council are either negative or need clarification. These include:\tInsistence of some member states to cut the proposed funds, particularly grants, and to introduce Council control over national recovery plans, thus potentially leading to harmful austerity and structural reforms;\tCuts to the proposed Just Transition Fund, health measures, funding for research and innovation, and measures for solvency and restructuring support, where the overall EU budget is not big enough to deliver ambitious green and digital transformation and adequate resources for cohesion, convergence and social priorities;\tAbsence of any reference to the social dimension, to the European Pillar of Social Rights, and to the need to protect and create massive employment opportunities; the employment crisis the EU is going to face in the autumn is the real emergency;\tNo guarantee of a proper involvement of social partners at EU, national and sectoral level in the governance of the Plan, in the design and implementation of the investment\u2019s priorities, and in the monitoring of the results.Regarding the content of the Recovery Plan, the ETUC asks both Presidents to consider the need to:\tUphold the rule-of-law in all EU member states, and that those who flout it do not have access to EU financial support;\tClarify the governance/emergency brake mechanisms to avoid national recovery plans being held up in Council as a means of delaying payments, and above all to avoid the future imposition of damaging fiscal conditions and austerity;\tReverse the cuts to the Just Transition Fund and make the 2050 and 2030 targets binding conditions for funding;\tRestore health-related funding;\tRestore the Solvency Support funding;\tReverse the cuts to InvestEU, Horizon Europe, ReactEU, and restore the external action related programmes (NDICI, Humanitarian Aid);\tPreserve social investment in the MFF, reinforcing the ESF+, restore the European social model and social protection systems, by fully implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights and the UN Agenda 2030.The ETUC urges all EU institutions and national governments to support the recovery plan and to make its implementation as the highest priority, by enforcing national and sectoral recovery plans in a timely manner.Finally, the European trade union movement is convinced that reforms of EU governance and decision-making, as well as further integration of the Eurozone cannot be delayed any further.The Conference on the Future of Europe is therefore even more crucial, and the ETUC invites the Presidents of the European Council and European Commission to ensure that social partners\u2019 participation is guaranteed, that veto-rights are avoided, and that a more social and fairer EU is built, including through a Social Progress Protocol to be included in the Treaties.\u00a0Letter to Charles Michel, President of the European CouncilLetter to Ursula von Der Leyen, President of the European Commission          \t  ETUC letter to President Michel on Recovery Plan  ETUC letter to President von der Leyen on Recovery Plan                                                                  05.08.2020                        Press release              In              Economic Governance / European Semester                      \u00a0Print                                \t   Facebook share   \t   Twitter   \t   LinkedIn                                                                                                                                                                           Browse                          \t                News              \t                Documents              \t                Publications              \t                Campaigns              \t                About us              \t                Call for tender              \t                Communication Department              \t                Jobs              \t                Privacy                                                  About us                                      The ETUC is the voice of workers and represents 45 million members from 90\u00a0trade union organisations in 38\u00a0European countries, plus 10 European Trade Union Federations.
