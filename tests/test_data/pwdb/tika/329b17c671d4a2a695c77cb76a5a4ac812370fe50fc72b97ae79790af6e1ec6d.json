These include individuals aged 24 or more who have been inactive or unemployed for more than six months, persons over 50 years who do not have a job, and any person who is a registered disabled person under national law and is not in full-time employment. The scheme had originally been in existence between 2015-2019. It was re-opened for a second call in 2020 with more advantageous terms, and some terms and conditions of this scheme needed to be revisited in view of COVID-19. ", "content_of_measure_description": "The measure aims to support access of individuals including: those who are aged 24 or over who have been unemployed or inactive for the previous 6 months; those unemployed for 12 months and during which they participated in traineeship with the applicant undertaking; those aged 24 and over who have not attained an upper secondary educational or vocational qualification (ISCED 3) and do not have a job; those older than 50 and do not have a job; or any person who is a registered disabled person under national law and is not in full-time employment, amongst others.\r\rThe Scheme is demand driven and grants are awarded on a first-come first-served basis, subject to the annual ceilings and total budget. The total available budget for the A2E is \u20ac12 million, with an indicative annual calendar year ceilings of around \u20ac2.4 million. \r\rSubsidies provided vary depending on the classification of the employee. Compared to the 2015-2019 scheme, the 2020 scheme provides greater grants for all categories of recruits. During the 2015-2019 call, employers were eligible to receive a subsidy of \u20ac85 per week per new recruit engaged, for a period of 26 weeks, 52 weeks or 104 weeks, depending on the target group. In the case of registered disabled persons, a subsidy of \u20ac125 per week for a maximum of 156 weeks was provided. In the case of the 2020 subsidy, the amounts provided are \u20ac105 and \u20ac155 per week, respectively. \r\rThe second offering of this scheme coincided with COVID-19, consequently Jobsplus clarified that only soft copy applications submitted via email would be accepted, that the scheme could not be used to re-hire those terminated due to redundancies, and that employers could not continue to claim for this subsidy if wages were no longer being incurred due to employees receiving another COVID-19 related benefit (for example the COVID-19 \u2013 Person with Disability Benefit or the COVID-19 wage subsidy, both offered by the Government of Malta to prevent redundancies). However, it was clarified that employers could apply to reduce the hours of work of employees within this scheme (generally from 40 hours to 20 hours per week). For this to occur however, employers are to provide a copy of their correspondence with the Director of Employment and Industrial Relations, following which, the A2E will assess the request on a case by case basis and will inform the employer accordingly.\r", "use_of_measure_description": "Between 2015 and 2019, 778 unique employers applied for the funding of 2,029 participants. 1,310 of these participants engaged with 573 unique employers, remained active in the scheme with a total of \u20ac7.9 million being committed. Jobsplus paid a total of \u20ac5.6 million to beneficiaries till the end of 2019. No statistics are available for the 2020 second call.
