Introduction 1.1 Scope of the Guidance Notes These Guidance Notes are intended to assist employers in applying for support under the Gozo Teleworking Scheme. Through this scheme, aid is to be granted to employers in the form of a financial grant spread over a 3-year period, paid proportionately on the number of days the employee is granted telework. The scheme also offers a financial grant related to the Technological and Capital Investment to equip the employee with the necessary tools to perform tasks. All applicants must abide by the Guidance Notes valid at the time of application, which may be periodically reviewed, updated and amended.   1.2 Objective of the Scheme The Gozo Teleworking Scheme will provide aid to employers, based and registered in Malta, to offer their Gozitan resident employees the facility to work from home should their job-related tasks be equally fulfilled. Providing employees with the opportunity to balance their work and life commitments, whilst still maintaining the same level of performance throughout the organisation, is given prominence by various organisations both on a national and international level. Offering this level of flexibility to a workforce implies managing at a distance, which subsequently necessitates a more robust and adaptable system of work measurement. However, it is widely understood that this flexibility allows the employee to be increasingly productive, incentives the employee to go the extra mile and substitute time lost in travel with actual work done.   1.3  Legal Basis for the Scheme The administrative basis for this scheme is Budget Measure 7.19, Incentives for the Creation of Jobs in Gozo, Budget Speech 2020.  1.4 Available Budget and Duration of the Scheme The scheme is demand driven. Aid will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to the annual ceiling and total budget. The Gozo Teleworking Scheme is one of five schemes that pertain to the fund titled Gozo Business Schemes which totals \u20ac1 million for the year 2020. Complete applications must be submitted by the 25th September 2020. Any exceptions made for application submitted afterwards will be at the discretion of the Ministry based on the entity of the investment. 1.5 Main Parties involved in the Implementation of the Gozo Teleworking Scheme A \u2013 Ministry for Gozo The overall responsibility for the monitoring, management and implementation of the Gozo Teleworking Scheme is with the Ministry for Gozo.

Financial Management, Eligible Amount and Payments  3.1 Payment Procedures and Reimbursement  As part of the payment and reimbursement procedures, the Tourism and Economic Development Directorate within the Ministry for Gozo will be responsible to ensure that the:  a. Claims for reimbursement made by the Employer are correct; and  b. Teleworking has been granted within the conditions stipulated in the submitted application  3.2 Eligible Costs The Gozo Teleworking Scheme consists of 2 components: a) A maximum grant of \u20ac10,000, in the form of a salary refund, shall be spread over a 3-year period a. Year 1 entitles 30% up to a maximum of \u20ac3,000 b. Year 2 entitles 30% up to a maximum of \u20ac3,000 c. Year 3 entitles 40% up to a maximum of \u20ac4,000   Gozo Teleworking Scheme \u2013 Ministry for Gozo The salary refund shall be based on the proportion of hours each Gozitan employee is granted by the Employer. The first payment shall take place once the employee has performed the first year of teleworking.  The Employer shall provide a plan on beginning of Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 to specify the number of days the employee will be granted. While the number of days does not necessarily need to be strictly adhered, due to unforeseen circumstances that may arise from time to time, it is imperative that the difference does not exceed 20 days per working year. Exceeding this threshold may result in the ineligibility of granting funds. Moreover, the grant will be reimbursed on the actual number of days granted and not the number of days stated in the plan.  In order to be eligible for the scheme, the minimum amount granted is an average of 2 days per week and a maximum of 4 days per week.   Finally, the agreement and conditions laid about for Teleworking between the Employer and the Employee must abide in its entirety to Subsidiary Legislation 452.104, Telework National Standard Order, Legal Notice 312 of 2008. b) The Employer shall be also eligible to a partial financial reimbursement related to the Technological and Capital investment made. This is a one-time payment, offered for each employee eligible to benefit from this scheme. This aid refers solely to a Note Book Computer or PC together with a Printer including scanning facilities. The eligible financial aid offered entails 75% reimbursement to the expenses cited, with a maximum of up to \u20ac850 reimbursement ceiling. This reimbursement is eligible upon purchase of the stated equipment.  3.3 Upon application, the Employer is committing to provide the employee an agreement of a minimum of one year teleworking up to a maximum of three years teleworking.  3.3.1 In the case where there is the uncompletion of Year 1, there will be no reimbursements made.  3.3.2 In the case where there is the completion of Year 1, however the end of Year 3 has not been reached, a valid reason for such termination of teleworking agreement has to be provided, which has to be signed by both parties \u2013 the employer and the employee. The Ministry will decide whether reimbursement to the Employer should be made and shall be made on a pro-rata basis where applicable.  3.3.3 The Employer and employee must clearly agree on the days and location of work away from office. Teleworking shall only be considered as teleworking when the employee is performing tasks as stated in his/her job description at home that are usually performed within the premises controlled by the employer.  3.3.4 If a teleworker has been granted telework before submission of application, the Employer is still eligible to submit application but shall not be eligible to the equipment component. To be eligible for equipment reimbursement, telework must be granted from 1st January 2020, thereon.  http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&itemid=11238http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&itemid=11238  Gozo Teleworking Scheme \u2013 Ministry for Gozo 3.3.5 In order to ensure that employee does not endure any form of marginalization, it is being recommended that the maximum amount of telework to be assigned is 80% (average) of working hours per week. On a 5-day working week with an 8-hour a day performance, this translates into a maximum of 4 days a week of tasks performed at home. However, should both the employer and employee agree on the assignment of more than 80%, the Ministry shall still deem the application as eligible.  3.3.6 The minimum amount of telework is 40%, which on a 5-day working week (average) with an 8-hour a day performance, the employee is assigned a minimum of 2 days of tasks to be performed at home.  3.3.7 Granting the 80% maximum threshold shall be eligible for the maximum grant available. However, the first salary reimbursement shall take place after one year of teleworking agreement elapses, following the vetting of documentation by the Ministry for Gozo.  3.3.8 The calculation that leads to the financial amount to be reimbursed is based on the total amount of hours the employee has performed at home. Therefore, to provide a simple example with whole figures to ensure clarity: \u2022 If a full-time employment generates a total of 1,000 hours per year, 800 hours (80% of total) becomes the 100% baseline. If an employee does not reach the 800 hours amount, the grant will be provided to the Employer proportionately. If for instance, the employee performs 500 hours from home during one whole year the Employer will be entitled to \u20ac1,875 from the \u20ac3,000 during Year 1, apart from the equipment grant cited in Section 3.2 (b). Should the employee be granted the full 800 hours, the Employer will receive the full \u20ac3,000 assigned to Year 1.   4. Information & Data Protection 4.1 Publicity  a.  In order to enhance transparency regarding the use of the Scheme\u2019s funds, general details of the operation such as the name of the Employers; the title of the operations and the amount of public funding allocation to each Undertaking may be published.  b.
