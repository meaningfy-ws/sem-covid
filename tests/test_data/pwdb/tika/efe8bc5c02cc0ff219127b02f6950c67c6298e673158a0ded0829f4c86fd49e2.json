As such measures required many self-employed individuals to close their businesses or restricted their ability to make a living, the scheme was introduced to bring support in line that available to employees under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.", "content_of_measure_description": "On 26 March 2020 the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme was announced to allow certain groups of self-employed individuals to claim a taxable cash grant worth 80% of average monthly trading profits over the last three years up to a maximum of \u20ac2,820 (GBP 2,500) for three months (could be extended). The grant will be subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions but does not need to be repaid. This is intended to match the protection provided to employed individuals, thus covering this group for the first time. The scheme is run directly through Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) which contacts eligible individuals from May 2020 onwards.\r\rOn 29 May the Government announced a second round of the SEISS, with those eligible able to claim a second grant, worth 70% of their average monthly trading profit, for a further three months, capped at \u00a36,570 in total. On 2 July a second Treasury Direction was published to this effect. Applications for the second grant were opened on 17 August, and were closed on 19 October.\r\rOn 24 September the Government announced an extension to the SEISS to be introduced in November, to cover the six months up to the end of April 2021. The SEISS Grant Extension would be made in two taxable grants \u2013 first to cover November to January, second to cover February to April.  \r\rInitially it was proposed that the first of these grants would cover 20% of average monthly trading profits, capped at \u00a31,875, but this figure has been revised three times.  On 22 October the Chancellor announced the first grant would cover 40% of average monthly trading profits, capped at \u00a33,750. On 2 November the Chancellor announced that the payment for the first month (November) of the first grant would be set at 80% \u2013 increasing the total level of this grant to 55% of trading profits, capped at \u00a35,160. Subsequently on 5 November the Chancellor announced that all three months of the first grant would be calculated on the basis of 80% of average trading profits, up to a maximum of \u00a37,500.[1]\r\rOn 24 November the Government published a further Treasury Direction underpinning the scheme. Applications for the third SEISS grant opened on 29 November and are to close on 29 January 2021.\r\rThere is to be a fourth round; details of this will be announced on 3 March 2021.", "use_of_measure_description": "Following the\u00a0criticism that businesses are likely to have to wait five weeks for first payments to be made (the delay is partly to accommodate firms having to file tax returns - required to be able to claim the benefit) and that\u00a0the wait may be difficult for businesses already struggling, the Government has released data as to the take-up and cost of the scheme up to the end of June 2020.\r\r3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. This means that they met the income and trading activity criteria for the scheme based on Self-Assessment returns from 2018-19 and earlier years. However, some of these businesses will not have continued trading since 2018-19 or will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus so will not be eligible.\r\r* On the 13 May, there had been 441,000 claims made, with a total value of GBP 1.3 billion. \r* By the 31 May, the total number of claims was 2.5 million, with a value of GBP 7.2 billion. \r* By the 30 June, the total number of SEISS claims was 2.6 million (75% of the potentially eligible population), with a value of GBP 7.7 billion.\u00a0The average value per claim was GBP 2,900.\r\rAround two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3m).\u00a0A lower proportion of potentially eligible females have claimed a SEISS grant (70%) compared to males (78%).\u00a0The average claim for females is also lower at GBP 2,300 compared to the average claim for males of GBP 3,200. By 30 June, HMRC had received 1,805,000 claims from men totaling GBP 5.7bn compared to 745,000 claims from women for GBP 1.7bn.\r\rAround 90% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 75%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.\u00a0 The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (60% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at GBP 3,300. The youngest age group have the second lowest take up rate (68%) and the lowest average claim value at GBP 2,100.\r\rThe sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 30 June, construction workers had made 867,000 claims for SEISS totaling GBP 3.1bn, an average of GBP3,500 per claimant.\u00a0 Self-employed individuals in the transportation and storage sector make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 221,000 claims totaling GBP 481m. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 193,000 claims totaling GBP 399m.\r\rThe two regions with the highest number of claims are London (484,000) and the South East (373,000), reflecting their relative sizes.\r\rOn the 18 September, a further update on take-up of the scheme was published. The data covers the period up to the 31 August. Around 5 million individuals reported self-employment income for the tax year 2018 to 2019, and had their data assessed for potential SEISS eligibility. In order to be assessed, a self-employed individual needed to have traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted a Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year. Via this process then, 3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. This means that they met the criteria for the scheme based on Self Assessment returns from the tax year 2018 to 2019 and earlier years. However, some of the potentially eligible businesses will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus or have ceased trading since the tax year 2018 to 2019 so will not have been eligible.\r\rThe updated data shows that:\r\r* by 31 August, 2.0 million (60%) of the potentially eligible population had claimed a second SEISS grant with the value of these claims totalling GBP 5.1 billion\r* the average value per claim was GBP 2,500\r* around two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3 million). A lower proportion of potentially eligible females have claimed a SEISS grant (54%) compared to males (62%)\r* the average claim for females is also lower at GBP 2,000 compared to the average claim for males of GBP 2,700\r* around 90% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 56%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread\r* the sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 31 August, construction workers had made 693,000 claims for SEISS totalling GBP 2.1bn\r* the two regions with the highest number of claims are London (390,000) and the South East (292,000), reflecting their relative sizes\r* of the 1.6 million that did not meet the SEISS criteria, 1.4 million (87%) had trading profits less than non-trading profits (eg. income from employment or investment income), 0.5 million (33%) had trading profits of GBP 0 or made a loss and 0.2 million (11%) had trading profits over GBP 50,000. (N.B.

If you were not eligible for the first and second grant based on the information in your Self Assessment tax returns, you will not be eligible for the third.HMRC expects you to make an honest assessment about whether you reasonably believe your business will have a significant reduction in profits.To make a claim for the third grant your business must have had a new or continuing impact from coronavirus between 1 November 2020 and 29 January 2021, which you reasonably believe will have a significant reduction in your profits.The third taxable grant is worth 80% of your average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a37,500 in total.The grant does not need to be repaid if you\u2019re eligible, but will be subject to Income Tax and self-employed National Insurance and must be reported on your 2020 to 2021 Self Assessment tax return.You must keep evidence to support your claim.Grants under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme are not counted as \u2018access to public funds\u2019, and you can claim the grant on all categories of work visa.You can follow these steps to help you understand what you can do now.\tFind out who can claim.\tCheck that your business has been impacted by coronavirus.\tFind out how HMRC works out your grant.\tMake your claim by 29 January 2021.\tFind out what happens after you\u2019ve claimed.Who can claimTo be eligible for the third grant you must be a self-employed individual or a member of a partnership. You cannot claim the grant if you trade through a limited company or a trust.If you claim Maternity Allowance this will not affect your eligibility for the grant.You must have traded in both tax years:\t2018 to 2019 and submitted your Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year\t2019 to 2020You must either:\tbe currently trading but are impacted by reduced demand due to coronavirus\thave been trading but are temporarily unable to do so due to coronavirusYou must also declare that:\tyou intend to continue to trade\tyou reasonably believe there will be a significant reduction in your trading profitsReasonable beliefIn order to claim, you must reasonably believe that you will suffer a significant reduction in trading profits due to reduced business activity, capacity, demand or inability to trade due to coronavirus during 1 November 2020 to 29 January 2021. You must keep evidence that shows how your business has been impacted by coronavirus resulting in less business activity than otherwise expected.Significant reductionBefore you make a claim, you must decide if the impact on your business will cause a significant reduction in your trading profits for the tax year you report them in.HMRC cannot make this decision for you because your individual and wider business circumstances will need to be considered when deciding whether the reduction is significant.You should wait until you have a reasonable belief that your trading profits are going to be significantly reduced, before you make your claim.You do not have to consider any other coronavirus scheme support payments you have already received when deciding whether you reasonably believe that you will suffer a significant reduction in trading profits due to reduced activity, capacity, demand or inability to trade due to coronavirus during 1 November 2020 to 29 January 2021.There are some examples that can help you decide.How HMRC works out your eligibility based on your tax returnsTo work out your eligibility we will first look at your 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return. Your trading profits must be no more than \u00a350,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income.If you\u2019re not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, we will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.How different circumstances affect the schemeThere are some circumstances that can affect your eligibility such as if:\tyour return is late, amended or under enquiry\tyou\u2019re a member of a partnership\tyou had a new child\tyou have loans covered by the loan charge\tyou claim averaging relief\tyou\u2019re a military reservist\tyou\u2019re non-resident or chose the remittance basis\tstate aidFind out more information on how your circumstances affect your eligibility.How to claimClaims for the third SEISS grant have now closed. The last date to make a claim for the third grant was 29 January 2021.You should contact HMRC if you receive any suspicious texts, calls or emails claiming to be from HMRC as this may be a scam.How we work out the amount of the third grantThis is an example of how we will work out how much grant you\u2019ll get if your average trading profits were \u00a342,000 over the last 3 tax years.If you\u2019re eligible, you\u2019ll receive a grant worth of 80% paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a37,500 in total.Example\tStart with your average trading profit (\u00a342,000).\tDivide by 12 = \u00a33,500.\tMultiply by 3 = \u00a310,500.\tWork out 80% of \u00a310,500 = \u00a38,400. You will only receive \u00a37,500 due to the cap.Further supportThere will be a fourth grant covering February 2021 to April 2021. Details about the fourth grant will be announced on 3 March 2021.Other help you can getGet other financial supportYou may be able to claim Universal Credit, but even if the claim is not approved it will affect any tax credits you claim, and may affect other benefits.

This covers 95% of people who receive the majority of their income from self-employment.This brings parity with the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, announced by the Chancellor last week, where the Government committed to pay up to \u00a32,500 each month in wages of employed workers who are furloughed during the outbreak.Cleaners, plumbers, electricians, musicians, hairdressers and many other self-employed people who are eligible for the new scheme will be able to apply directly to HMRC for the taxable grant, using a simple online form, with the cash being paid directly into people\u2019s bank account.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:  Self-employed people are a crucial part of the UK\u2019s workforce who\u2019ve understandably been looking for reassurance and support during this national emergency.  The package for the self-employed I\u2019ve outlined today is one of the most generous in the world that has been announced so far. It targets support to those who need help most, offering the self-employed the same level of support as those in work.  Together with support packages for businesses and for workers, I am confident we now have the measures in place to ensure we can get through this emergency together.The scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 in 2018-19 or an average trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.To qualify, more than half of their income in these periods must come from self-employment.To minimise fraud, only those who are already in self-employment and meet the above conditions will be eligible to apply. HMRC will identify eligible taxpayers and contact them directly with guidance on how to apply.The income support scheme, which is being designed by HMRC from scratch, will cover the three months to May. Grants will be paid in a single lump sum instalment covering all 3 months, and will start to be paid at the beginning of June.Individuals should not contact HMRC now. HMRC will use existing information to check potential eligibility and invite applications once the scheme is operational.Those who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are not covered by the scheme but will be covered for their salary by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme if they are operating PAYE schemes.The scheme has been designed after extensive engagement with stakeholders including the TUC, the Federation of Small Businesses and IPSE - The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed.Self-employed individuals are already benefitting from a series of measures announced by the Chancellor to boost household incomes and will be able to access these while the new scheme is being rolled out.These include a strengthening of the welfare safety-net with a \u00a37 billion boost to Universal Credit, income tax and VAT deferrals, \u00a31 billion more support for renters and access to three-month mortgage holidays.Notes\tfurther information and details of the scheme will be shared shortly by HMRC\tHMRC will use the average trading profits from tax returns in 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 to determine the size of the grant\tthis scheme also applies to members of partnerships\tbefore grant payments are made, the self-employed will still be able to access other available government support for those affected by coronavirus including more generous universal credit and business continuity loans where they have a business bank account                      Share this page    \t                                                                                                                              Share on                    Facebook        \t                                                                                                                              Share on                    Twitter                    Published 26 March 2020                          Related content              \tAccess coronavirus business innovation support package\tCoronavirus support from Business Representative Organisations and Trade Associations\tSelf-Employment Income Support Scheme fourth grant\tCoronavirus support for business from outside government        Brexit  \t                    Check          \t                    Change          \t                    Go            Check what you need to do                                Explore the topic  \tBusiness and industry                          Is this page useful?

                  Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said:\u201cMany self-employed people across the UK will be hugely relieved tonight. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cThese new measures will provide essential support to those facing significant uncertainty and loss of income.\u201cGiven the complexity of the task, it\u2019s understandable this will take time to deliver. Fast clarity on how and when money will reach their bank accounts will help individuals to plan.\u201cThe self-employed make an immense contribution to our society and across many industries. They will play a critical role in the UK\u2019s recovery once we overcome the worst of the virus.\u201d\u00a0On the new guidance for the Job Retention Scheme:\u201cThe Treasury has made rapid progress in a short time and businesses can now be clearer about how this scheme will work in practice.\u201cIt\u2019s now up to business and the Government to make sure these practical guidelines get to the firms that need it most.\u201d                                            Share this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \t                                                                                                                                    \t                                                                                                                                                                    \tThe CBI\tAbout the CBI\tCareers\tMedia Centre\tEvents Calendar\tCoronavirus Hub                \tProducts & Services\tMembership\tLeadership Development\tSponsorship\tEvents\tCBI Economics - Economic Surveys\tCBI Economics - Economic Analysis                \tLegal\tManaging COVID-19 Risk within the CBI\tPrivacy Policy\tModern Slavery Statement\tCBI Retirement Benefits Plan\tTerms and Conditions\tCookie Policy                \tHelp\tContact Us\tSite Map\tFAQs                            The CBI is the UK's premier business organisation, providing a voice for firms at a regional, national and international level to policymakers.

From 13 May eligible self-employed individuals could claim a grant worth 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a37,500 in total. The data used in this release cover claims to the SEISS scheme up to 31 May 2020. This data has been matched with other HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) data to present breakdowns of claims by: \uf0b7 Age and gender, \uf0b7 Sector of the economy, and \uf0b7 Geography. This is the first time this information has been released publicly and has been produced using data from both the SEISS and HMRC\u2019s Self-Assessment (SA) system. Main Findings \uf0b7 3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. This means that they met the income and trading activity criteria for the scheme based on Self-Assessment returns from 2018-19 and earlier years. However, some of these businesses will not have continued trading since 2018-19 or will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus so will not be eligible.  \uf0b7 By 31st May, 2.4 million of the potentially eligible population (70%) had claimed a SEISS grant with the value of these claims totalling \u00a37 billion. The average value per claim was \u00a32,900.  \uf0b7 Around two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3m)  \uf0b7 A slightly lower proportion of potentially eligible females have claimed a SEISS grant (66%) compared to males (72%). \uf0b7 The average claim for females is also lower at \u00a32,300 compared to the average claim for males of \u00a33,200.  \uf0b7 Take-up of the SEISS grant is lowest for those aged over 65 (55%) and those aged 16 to 24 (62%).    \uf0b7 The sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 31 May construction workers had made 800,000 claims for SEISS totalling \u00a32.9bn.  \uf0b7 The two regions with the highest number of claims are London (433,000) and the South East (352,000), reflecting their relative sizes, although London has the lowest take-up rate amongst the UK countries and regions.  1. SEISS claims by gender Between 13 and 31 May 2020 HMRC received 2,380,000 claims for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) from a total potentially eligible population of 3.4 million. These claims totalled \u00a36.974bn with an average award of \u00a32,900 per claimant.  Figure 1 shows the number of SEISS claims and the potentially eligible population by gender. Table 1 also shows claim values by gender.  Men make up two-thirds of the potentially eligible population. By 31 May HMRC had received 1,677,000 claims from men totalling \u00a35.358bn compared to 701,000 claims from women for \u00a31.609bn. Males have a higher take-up rate than females (72% compared to 66%) and their average grant value (\u00a33,200) is 39% higher than the average for females (\u00a32,300).

SEISS claims by age group Figure 2 shows the potentially eligible population and claims made by age group. Table 2 also shows claim values by age.  Over 90% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in these age-groups is at or above 70%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.  The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (55% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at \u00a33,300. The youngest age group have the second lowest take up rate (62%) and the lowest average claim value at \u00a32,100.

SEISS claims by industry sector (see Table 3 in the accompanying tables for further details)  Self-employed individuals are asked to provide a description of their business activity on their self-assessment returns. These activities have been mapped across to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007 to enable analysis to be carried out by industry sector. Where an individual has multiple sources of self-employed income the activity with the highest income has been used for the SEISS analysis.   Figures 3 and 4 show the potentially eligible population and number of claims made by industry sector.   The construction industry has the largest potentially eligible population with over 1 million self-employed individuals potentially eligible to apply. By 31 May construction workers had made 801,000 claims for SEISS totalling \u00a32.864bn; an average of \u00a33,600 per claimant.   Of other large sectors affected and making SEISS claims, transportation and storage has 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 206k claims totalling \u00a3451m. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 177k claims totalling \u00a3371m.

SEISS claims by geography  (see Tables 2, 4 and 5 in the accompanying tables for further details)  Using the claimant\u2019s Self-Assessment address, SEISS claims can be mapped to countries of the UK, English regions and lower geographies.   Figure 6 shows the potentially eligible population and number of claims made by country and region. London has the largest potentially eligible population and number of claims (433,000) but the lowest take up rate (67%). This compares to other regions where between 70% and 73% of the potentially eligible population are claiming.  Self-employed individuals in Scotland have made 146,000 claims totalling \u00a3425m; in Wales 102,000 claims for \u00a3273m have been made and in Northern Ireland 69,000 claims for \u00a3198m have been submitted.

Background to the SEISS The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) was announced on 26th March 2020 as part of the UK government\u2019s support package for businesses and self-employed people during the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020. The scheme was open to self-employed individuals and members of a partnership who met the following criteria: \uf0b7 Traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year \uf0b7 Traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 \uf0b7 Intended to continue to trade in the tax year 2020 to 2021 \uf0b7 Carried on a trade which had been adversely affected by coronavirus A business could be adversely affected by coronavirus if, for example: \uf0b7 They were unable to work because they:  o Were shielding  o Were self-isolating o Were on sick leave because of coronavirus o had caring responsibilities because of coronavirus  \uf0b7 They have had to scale down or temporarily stop trading because:  o Their supply chain has been interrupted o They have fewer or no customers or clients o Their staff are unable to come in to work The grant is not open to limited companies or those operating a trade through a trust. To work out eligibility, HMRC first look at the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return. Trading profits must be no more than \u00a350,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income. If an individual is not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, HMRC will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019. The scheme allows an eligible individual to claim a taxable grant worth 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a37,500 in total. This first SEISS grant has been announced to close for claims on 13th July 2020. On 29th May 2020 SEISS was extended to allow a second and final grant when the scheme reopens for applications in August. This will be a taxable grant worth 70 per cent of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a36,570 in total. The statistics presented in this release only covers claims from the initial SEISS scheme up to 31 May.  6. Glossary The SEISS potentially eligible population are those who HMRC identified as being potentially eligible for a SEISS grant based on the information held from their self assessment returns relating to the tax years; 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019. This is the group who have been invited to claim for a SEISS grant. This does not attempt to assess if a business was affected by coronavirus or whether they continued trading after 2018-19.  So it is the potentially eligible population based only on the information in the self assessment forms and not all will apply for the grant. The number of claims is defined as the total number of individuals who had submitted a claim for a SEISS grant by 3.00am on 1st June 2020 that had been either paid, sent for payment or had been received and were awaiting various checks. Only non-rejected claims are included with the majority of these having been paid or sent for payment. However, a small number of claims were still being processed and could be rejected. 7.

The claim information covers individuals who had submitted a claim for the SEISS grant by 03.00am on 1st June 2020 which had not rejected or failed certain compliance checks. Data sources used in this release  The data for this release come from HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC\u2019s) system for administering SEISS claims. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies.  Additional data from HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC\u2019s) self assessment system and other HMRC administrative systems has been matched with SEISS data to produce the data released here.   The age, gender and postcode of residential address was collected from the self assessment account for each individual. The industry information was collected from the self assessment return for the tax year ending 5th April 2019, and relates to the self-employment business description provided on that return. To produce the geographic breakdowns, the claimants\u2019 residential postcode has been matched to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data that links UK Post Codes to geographic areas. The geographic areas that have been presented in this release are Country and English Region, Local Authority and Parliamentary Constituency.  8. Strengths and limitations Experimental Statistics status This release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics. Differences compared with the HMRC SEISS Management Information Management information (MI) on the number and value of SEISS claims received has been published by HMRC at various dates since the scheme was launched on 13th May 2020.  The published MI report for 31st May 2020 showed 2.5m claims totalling \u00a37.2bn. The data in this statistical release, also dated as 31st May 2020, shows slightly different figures of 2.38m claims totalling \u00a36.97bn. The difference in these figures is mainly due to the management information including all claims received and their associated value even though some of these are eventually rejected after compliance checks. The statistics in this release exclude claims which have been rejected. There is also likely to be a smaller difference caused by the timing of claims flowing through the SEISS system. The MI measures claims at the \u201cfront end\u201d of the system and the statistical publication is based on data made available from the \u201cback end\u201d of the SEISS system once claims have been checked.    https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics"}, {"url": "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/891603/SEISS_Official_Statistics_June_2020.pdf", "title": "UK Government (2020) HMRC coronavirus (COVID-19) statistics.", "content_path": "res/96250cc33bde16ece354c1a5ece19d50799dfecc53644c8233aed4e7f2539101", "content": "Self-Employment Income Support Scheme statistics: June 2020       Statistical bulletin  Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) Official Statistics  Number and value of claims made to the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) administered by HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC) up to 31 May 2020.

From 13 May eligible self-employed individuals could claim a grant worth 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a37,500 in total. The data used in this release cover claims to the SEISS scheme up to 31 May 2020. This data has been matched with other HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) data to present breakdowns of claims by: \uf0b7 Age and gender, \uf0b7 Sector of the economy, and \uf0b7 Geography. This is the first time this information has been released publicly and has been produced using data from both the SEISS and HMRC\u2019s Self-Assessment (SA) system. Main Findings \uf0b7 3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. This means that they met the income and trading activity criteria for the scheme based on Self-Assessment returns from 2018-19 and earlier years. However, some of these businesses will not have continued trading since 2018-19 or will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus so will not be eligible.  \uf0b7 By 31st May, 2.4 million of the potentially eligible population (70%) had claimed a SEISS grant with the value of these claims totalling \u00a37 billion. The average value per claim was \u00a32,900.  \uf0b7 Around two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3m)  \uf0b7 A slightly lower proportion of potentially eligible females have claimed a SEISS grant (66%) compared to males (72%). \uf0b7 The average claim for females is also lower at \u00a32,300 compared to the average claim for males of \u00a33,200.  \uf0b7 Take-up of the SEISS grant is lowest for those aged over 65 (55%) and those aged 16 to 24 (62%).    \uf0b7 The sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 31 May construction workers had made 800,000 claims for SEISS totalling \u00a32.9bn.  \uf0b7 The two regions with the highest number of claims are London (433,000) and the South East (352,000), reflecting their relative sizes, although London has the lowest take-up rate amongst the UK countries and regions.  1. SEISS claims by gender Between 13 and 31 May 2020 HMRC received 2,380,000 claims for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) from a total potentially eligible population of 3.4 million. These claims totalled \u00a36.974bn with an average award of \u00a32,900 per claimant.  Figure 1 shows the number of SEISS claims and the potentially eligible population by gender. Table 1 also shows claim values by gender.  Men make up two-thirds of the potentially eligible population. By 31 May HMRC had received 1,677,000 claims from men totalling \u00a35.358bn compared to 701,000 claims from women for \u00a31.609bn. Males have a higher take-up rate than females (72% compared to 66%) and their average grant value (\u00a33,200) is 39% higher than the average for females (\u00a32,300).

SEISS claims by age group Figure 2 shows the potentially eligible population and claims made by age group. Table 2 also shows claim values by age.  Over 90% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in these age-groups is at or above 70%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.  The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (55% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at \u00a33,300. The youngest age group have the second lowest take up rate (62%) and the lowest average claim value at \u00a32,100.

SEISS claims by industry sector (see Table 3 in the accompanying tables for further details)  Self-employed individuals are asked to provide a description of their business activity on their self-assessment returns. These activities have been mapped across to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007 to enable analysis to be carried out by industry sector. Where an individual has multiple sources of self-employed income the activity with the highest income has been used for the SEISS analysis.   Figures 3 and 4 show the potentially eligible population and number of claims made by industry sector.   The construction industry has the largest potentially eligible population with over 1 million self-employed individuals potentially eligible to apply. By 31 May construction workers had made 801,000 claims for SEISS totalling \u00a32.864bn; an average of \u00a33,600 per claimant.   Of other large sectors affected and making SEISS claims, transportation and storage has 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 206k claims totalling \u00a3451m. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 177k claims totalling \u00a3371m.

SEISS claims by geography  (see Tables 2, 4 and 5 in the accompanying tables for further details)  Using the claimant\u2019s Self-Assessment address, SEISS claims can be mapped to countries of the UK, English regions and lower geographies.   Figure 6 shows the potentially eligible population and number of claims made by country and region. London has the largest potentially eligible population and number of claims (433,000) but the lowest take up rate (67%). This compares to other regions where between 70% and 73% of the potentially eligible population are claiming.  Self-employed individuals in Scotland have made 146,000 claims totalling \u00a3425m; in Wales 102,000 claims for \u00a3273m have been made and in Northern Ireland 69,000 claims for \u00a3198m have been submitted.

Background to the SEISS The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) was announced on 26th March 2020 as part of the UK government\u2019s support package for businesses and self-employed people during the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020. The scheme was open to self-employed individuals and members of a partnership who met the following criteria: \uf0b7 Traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year \uf0b7 Traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020 \uf0b7 Intended to continue to trade in the tax year 2020 to 2021 \uf0b7 Carried on a trade which had been adversely affected by coronavirus A business could be adversely affected by coronavirus if, for example: \uf0b7 They were unable to work because they:  o Were shielding  o Were self-isolating o Were on sick leave because of coronavirus o had caring responsibilities because of coronavirus  \uf0b7 They have had to scale down or temporarily stop trading because:  o Their supply chain has been interrupted o They have fewer or no customers or clients o Their staff are unable to come in to work The grant is not open to limited companies or those operating a trade through a trust. To work out eligibility, HMRC first look at the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return. Trading profits must be no more than \u00a350,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income. If an individual is not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, HMRC will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019. The scheme allows an eligible individual to claim a taxable grant worth 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a37,500 in total. This first SEISS grant has been announced to close for claims on 13th July 2020. On 29th May 2020 SEISS was extended to allow a second and final grant when the scheme reopens for applications in August. This will be a taxable grant worth 70 per cent of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a36,570 in total. The statistics presented in this release only covers claims from the initial SEISS scheme up to 31 May.  6. Glossary The SEISS potentially eligible population are those who HMRC identified as being potentially eligible for a SEISS grant based on the information held from their self assessment returns relating to the tax years; 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019. This is the group who have been invited to claim for a SEISS grant. This does not attempt to assess if a business was affected by coronavirus or whether they continued trading after 2018-19.  So it is the potentially eligible population based only on the information in the self assessment forms and not all will apply for the grant. The number of claims is defined as the total number of individuals who had submitted a claim for a SEISS grant by 3.00am on 1st June 2020 that had been either paid, sent for payment or had been received and were awaiting various checks. Only non-rejected claims are included with the majority of these having been paid or sent for payment. However, a small number of claims were still being processed and could be rejected. 7. Methodology and data sources Coverage This publication covers all self-employed individuals potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. The claim information covers individuals who had submitted a claim for the SEISS grant by 03.00am on 1st June 2020 which had not rejected or failed certain compliance checks. Data sources used in this release  The data for this release come from HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC\u2019s) system for administering SEISS claims. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies.  Additional data from HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC\u2019s) self assessment system and other HMRC administrative systems has been matched with SEISS data to produce the data released here.   The age, gender and postcode of residential address was collected from the self assessment account for each individual. The industry information was collected from the self assessment return for the tax year ending 5th April 2019, and relates to the self-employment business description provided on that return. To produce the geographic breakdowns, the claimants\u2019 residential postcode has been matched to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data that links UK Post Codes to geographic areas. The geographic areas that have been presented in this release are Country and English Region, Local Authority and Parliamentary Constituency.  8. Strengths and limitations Experimental Statistics status This release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics. Differences compared with the HMRC SEISS Management Information Management information (MI) on the number and value of SEISS claims received has been published by HMRC at various dates since the scheme was launched on 13th May 2020.  The published MI report for 31st May 2020 showed 2.5m claims totalling \u00a37.2bn. The data in this statistical release, also dated as 31st May 2020, shows slightly different figures of 2.38m claims totalling \u00a36.97bn. The difference in these figures is mainly due to the management information including all claims received and their associated value even though some of these are eventually rejected after compliance checks. The statistics in this release exclude claims which have been rejected. There is also likely to be a smaller difference caused by the timing of claims flowing through the SEISS system.

As a result, the data are subject to revision. These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events.The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics and regards them as consistent with the Code\u2019s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.Contact detailsFor queries or feedback on this publication, please email seiss.statistics.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk.For press queries, please contact:\tDan Allen, tel: 03000 585 024\tLisa Billard, tel: 07773 091 264Next releaseThe next release will be published on 22 October 2020. This date has been amended from 16 October as announced on GOV.UK.Main findingsThe main findings from these statistics are:\t    around 5 million individuals reported self-employment income for the tax year 2018 to 2019, and had their data assessed for potential SEISS eligibility. In order to be assessed, a self-employed individual needed to have traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted a Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year  \t    via this process, 3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. This means that they met the criteria for the scheme based on Self Assessment returns from the tax year 2018 to 19 and earlier years. However, some of the potentially eligible businesses will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus or have ceased trading since the tax year 2018 to 19 so will not have been eligible  \t    by 31 August 2.0 million (60%) of the potentially eligible population had claimed a second SEISS grant with the value of these claims totalling \u00a35.1 billion  \t    the average value per claim was \u00a32,500  \taround two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3 million)    \ta lower proportion of potentially eligible females have claimed a SEISS grant (54%) compared to males (62%)\tthe average claim for females is also lower at \u00a32,000 compared to the average claim for males of \u00a32,700  \t    around 90% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 56%.  No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread  \t    the sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 31 August, construction workers had made 693,000 claims for SEISS totalling \u00a32.1bn  \t    the 2 regions with the highest number of claims are London (390,000) and the South East (292,000), reflecting their relative sizes.  \tof the 1.6 million that did not meet the SEISS criteria, 1.4 million (87%) had trading profits less than non-trading profits (eg. income from employment or investment income), 0.5 million (33%) had trading profits of \u00a30 or made a loss and 0.2 million (11%) had trading profits over \u00a350,000. (N.B. Individuals may be counted more than once if they have trading profits which meet more than one of these criteria which explains why the figures sum to more than 1.6 million)About this releaseThe Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) provides support for self-employed individuals whose business has been adversely affected by Coronavirus (COVID-19). On the 17 August 2020 applications for the second grant of SEISS opened. This is a grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a36,570 in total.The data used in this release cover claims for the second grant in the SEISS up to 31 August 2020. This data has been matched with other HMRC data to present breakdowns of claims by:\tage and gender\tsector of the economy\tgeographyThe first grant, for which applications closed on 13 July 2020, was based on 80% of your trading profits and capped at \u00a37,500 in total. Official statistics on the first SEISS grant are presented in an earlier publication covering data up until 31 July 2020.https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/self-employment-income-support-scheme-statistics-august-2020Official statistics for the first grant are not repeated here.SEISS second grant claims and eligibilityAround 5 million individuals who reported income from self-employment were assessed for SEISS: 3.4 million of these were found to be potentially eligible and 1.6 million were found to be ineligible.Between 17 August and 31 August 2020, HMRC received 2.0 million claims for the SEISS from a total potentially eligible population of 3.4 million. These claims totalled \u00a35.1 billion with an average award of \u00a32,500 per claimant.Eligibility for SEISS required an individual to have levels of income which met specific tests on:\ttheir 2018 to 2019 tax year income, or\tthe combination of income for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019 where available.Figures below represent all criteria that apply to each individual from both sets of tests. Additionally, within each element individuals can be ineligible for multiple reasons and, as a result, there is a high level of overlap between the categories presented below.Of the 1.6 million individuals who were assessed to be ineligible:\t87% (1,436,000) had a trading profit that was less than their non-trading income;\t33% (544,000) had a trading profit \u00a30 or less;\t11% (186,000) had trading profit exceeding \u00a350,000 per year;\t3% (45,000) were ineligible for other reasons,SEISS second grant by genderFigure 1 shows the number of SEISS claims for the second grant and the potentially eligible population by gender. Table 1 also shows claim values by gender.Of 5.0 million individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility, men make up around two-thirds (65%), and also make up a slightly higher proportion (68%) of the potentially eligible population.By 31 August HMRC had received 1,437,000 claims from men totalling \u00a33.9 billion compared to 580,000 claims from women for \u00a31.2 billion. Males have a higher take-up rate than females (62% compared to 54%) and their average grant value (\u00a32,700) is 35% higher than the average for females (\u00a32,000).Figure 1: The SEISS potentially eligible population and second grant claims to 31 August 2020 by genderSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationTable 1 - SEISS potentially eligible population, number and value of second grant claims by 31 August 2020, by gender\tGender\tAssessed for potential eligibility\tTotal potentially eligible population\tTotal no. of claims made\tTotal value of claims made\tAverage value of claims\tMale\t3,288,000\t2,321,000\t1,437,000\t\u00a33,945m\t\u00a32,700\tFemale\t1,742,000\t1,065,000\t580,000\t\u00a31,159m\t\u00a32,000\tAll\t5,038,000\t3,390,000\t2,019,000\t\u00a35,109m\t\u00a32,500SEISS second grant by age groupFigure 2 and Table 2 show the assessed for potential eligibility population, the potentially eligible population and volumes of claims made for second grant by age group. Table 2 also shows claim values by age.Around 89% of individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility were between the ages of 25 and 64, with over 90% of claimants coming from this age group. Take-up of the grant in these age-groups is at or above 61%, with the exception that those between 55 to 64 have a take up rate of 56%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (43% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at \u00a32,800. The youngest age group have lowest average claim value at \u00a31,800.Figure 2: The total potentially eligible population and number of claims to 31 August 2020, by age groupSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes\tAge is calculated at the date the SEISS scheme opened on 17 August 2020.\tThere is missing age information for 32,000 in the potentially eligible population.Table 2 - SEISS potentially eligible population, number and value of claims by 31 August 2020, by age band\tAge band (as at 17 August 2020)\tAssessed for potential eligibility\tTotal potentially eligible population\tTotal no. of claims made\tTotal value of claims made\tAverage value of claims\t16-24\t150,000\t115,000\t66,000\t\u00a3121m\t\u00a31,800\t25-34\t842,000\t650,000\t414,000\t\u00a31,033m\t\u00a32,500\t35-44\t1,081,000\t799,000\t501,000\t\u00a31,276m\t\u00a32,500\t45-54\t1,184,000\t848,000\t517,000\t\u00a31,324m\t\u00a32,600\t55-64\t1,066,000\t712,000\t402,000\t\u00a31,028m\t\u00a32,600\t65+\t668,000\t233,000\t99,000\t\u00a3282m\t\u00a32,800\tMissing\t48,000\t32,000\t18,000\t\u00a346m\t\u00a32,500\tAll\t5,038,000\t3,390,000\t2,019,000\t\u00a35,109m\t\u00a32,500SEISS second grant by industry sector(see Table 3 in the accompanying tables for further details)Self-employed individuals are asked to provide a description of their business activity on their self-assessment returns. These activities have been mapped across to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007 to enable analysis to be carried out by industry sector. Where an individual has multiple sources of self-employed income the activity with the highest income has been used for the SEISS analysis.Figures 3 and 4 show the SEISS populations and number of claims for the second grant made by industry sector.The construction industry has the largest population of individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility with over 1.2 million and over 1 million of these were potentially eligible to apply. By 31 August construction workers had made 693,000 claims for SEISS totalling \u00a32.1 billion; an average of \u00a33,100 per claimant.Self-employed individuals in the transportation and storage sector make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 196,000 claims totalling \u00a3373 million. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 142,000 claims totalling \u00a3253 million.The highest rates of being assessed as potentially eligible for SEISS were from individuals working in the construction industry (86%) and the transportation and storage sector (82%).Lower rates of being assessed as potentially eligible for SEISS were found for individuals working in real estate activities (29%), financial and insurance activities (41%) and agriculture, forestry and fishing (45%).Figure 3: The SEISS population and number of second grant claims made to 31 August 2020, by sector (for the 6 largest SIC industries1 potentially eligible for the scheme)Source: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationFigure 4: The SEISS population and number of claims for the second grant made to 31 August 2020, by sector; (smaller sectors not shown in figure 3)Source: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes:\t473,000 cases in the potentially eligible population are included as \u201cUnknown and other\u201d and almost all of these (99%) could not be allocated to a SIC code.Figure 5 shows the average value of claims by sector which range from \u00a33,600 per claimant in the finance and insurance sector to \u00a31,800 per claimant in administrative and support services.Figure 5: Average value of claims to 31 August 2020, by primary industry of self-employment, ranked by average claimSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes\tThe allocation to industry represents an individual\u2019s highest earning self-employment.\t473,000 cases in the potentially eligible population are included as \u201cUnknown and other\u201d and almost all of these (99%) could not be allocated to a SIC code.SEISS second grant by geography(see Table 2 in the accompanying tables for further details)Using the claimant\u2019s Self Assessment address, SEISS claims can be mapped to countries of the UK, English regions and lower geographies.Figure 6 shows the SEISS population and number of claims made by country and region.London has the largest number of individuals that were assessed for potential eligibility (906,000), the largest potentially eligible population (644,000) and the largest number of claims (390,000) totalling \u00a31.0 billion.England had the highest proportion of assessed individuals that were found to be eligible (68%), followed by Wales (65%), Scotland (64%) and Northern Ireland (62%).Take up rate is very even across the UK with most nations and regions having a take up rate close to 60%. North West has the highest take up rate (62%) while the take up rate in the South West is the lowest (56%).Self-employed individuals in Scotland have made 126,000 claims totalling \u00a3318 million; in Wales 82,000 claims for \u00a3194 million have been made and in Northern Ireland 56,000 claims for \u00a3140 million have been submitted.Figure 6: The SEISS population and number of claims for the second grant made to 31 August by country and NUTS1 region, ranked by size of assessed for eligibility populationSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes:\tThe allocation to location represents the individual\u2019s address registered on their Self Assessment return.\t13,000 of the potentially eligible population could not be allocated to a NUTS1 region.Figure 7 shows the average value of second grant claims by country and region.The regions with the lowest average claim values are the North East and the North West (\u00a32,300).The East of England and South East (both \u00a32,700) have average claim values above the UK average of \u00a32,500.Figure 7: The average value of claims by NUTS1 region, ranked by valueSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes:\tThe allocation to location represents the individual\u2019s address registered on their Self Assessment return.\t13,000 of the potentially eligible population could not be allocated to a NUTS1 region.Sub-regional breakdownsTables 4 and 5 in the accompanying Excel table pack provide a breakdown of SEISS claimants by Parliamentary Constituency and local authority.The maps below illustrate how the take-up rate for the SEISS scheme has varied across the country.SEISS claims as a proportion of the potentially eligible population, by local authoritySource: Office for National Statistics (ONS) licensed under the Open Government Licence v.3.0.

Contains OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright and database right 2020SEISS second grant claims by industry sector and geography(see Table 6 in the accompanying tables for further details)The remaining sections of this bulletin consider the breakdown of the number of claims received in each country and region by different demographics (industry, gender and age).  Comparable information relating to the value of claims, the potentially eligible population and take-up rates can be found in tables 6 and 7 in the accompanying tables.Figure 8 shows the breakdown of claims in each region and country by industry sector.  Construction, transport and administrative services have the largest number of claims overall and are shown as separate categories on the chart. Agriculture, forestry and fishing is also large for some areas and is shown separately. Other smaller industries have been combined.The industry profile of SEISS claimants does not vary greatly between countries and regions. The main exceptions are seen in the construction industry and agriculture, forestry and fishing.Individuals working in the construction industry account for the highest proportion of claims in every country and region of the UK. London has the highest proportion, with 39% of claims being from those working in construction and Scotland has the lowest with 27%.Individuals working in agriculture, forestry and fishing account for 9% of all claims made by individuals in Northern Ireland, 5% in Wales, 3% in Scotland and only 1% in England.Figure 8: The proportion of claims received by 31 August 2020 in each country and region by primary industry of self-employmentNotes:\tThe allocation to industry represents an individual\u2019s highest earning self-employment.\t473,000 cases of the potentially eligible population are included as \u201cUnknown and other\u201d and almost all of these (99%) could not be allocated to a SIC code.SEISS second grant claims by gender and geography(see Table 7 in the accompanying tables for further details)The area with the highest proportion of males in the potentially eligible population is Northern Ireland (73%) and the lowest areas are Scotland and the South West (65% each). A similar pattern is seen in the number of claims received by 31 August with male claimants accounting for 66% of claims in Scotland and 75% of claims in Northern Ireland.Since the average claim amount is higher for males than females, men account for an even higher proportion of total claim values. In the West Midlands and London 80% of total claim values are from men. The lowest male share is in Scotland where 73% of the total amount claimed is claimed by men.Figure 9: The proportion of claims received by 31 August 2020 in each country and region by genderSEISS second grant claims by age and geography(see Table 7 in the accompanying tables for further details)The age distribution of the potentially eligible population and claims received by 31 August is reasonably consistent across all countries and regions with the exception of London.Between 40% (Wales) and 46% (East of England) of the potentially eligible population in each country and region is aged under 45 except in London where 57% are under 45.A similar distribution is observed from claims with the lowest proportion aged under 45 being in Scotland (42% of claimants and 40% of claim value) and the highest being in London (59% of claims and 58% of claim value).Figure 10: Age distribution of claims received by 31 August 2020 in each country and regionNotes:\tAge is calculated at the date the second grant opened on 17 August 2020.\tThe age for around 34,000 individuals in the potentially eligible population is not known which is around 1% of each country/region although slightly higher at 3% for individuals living in Northern Ireland.Background to the SEISSSEISS was announced on 26 March 2020 as part of the UK government\u2019s support package for businesses and self-employed people during the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020. The scheme was open to self-employed individuals and members of a partnership who met the following criteria:\ttraded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year\ttraded in the tax year 2019 to 2020\tintended to continue to trade in the tax year 2020 to 2021\tcarried on a trade which had been adversely affected by coronavirusA business could be adversely affected by coronavirus if, for example:\tthey were unable to work because they:    \twere shielding\twere self-isolating\twere on sick leave because of coronavirus\thad caring responsibilities because of coronavirus  \tthey have had to scale down or temporarily stop trading because:    \ttheir supply chain has been interrupted\tthey have fewer or no customers or clients\ttheir staff are unable to come in to work  The grant is not open to limited companies or those operating a trade through a trust.To work out eligibility, HMRC first look at the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return. Trading profits must be no more than \u00a350,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income. If an individual is not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, HMRC will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.The scheme allows an eligible individual to claim a taxable grant worth 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a37,500 in total. This first SEISS grant closed for claims on 13 July 2020.On the 17 August 2020 applications for the SEISS second opened. This will be a taxable grant worth 70 per cent of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a36,570 in total.The statistics presented in this release only covers claims for the second grant in the SEISS scheme up to 31 August 2020.GlossaryThe assessed for potential eligibility population are those self-employed individuals who HMRC identified as having traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year.The SEISS potentially eligible population are those who HMRC identified as being potentially eligible for a SEISS grant based on the information held from their Self Assessment returns relating to the tax years; 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019.This is the group who have been invited to claim for a SEISS grant. This does not attempt to assess if a business was affected by coronavirus or whether they continued trading after the tax year 2018 to 2019.  So it is the potentially eligible population based only on the information in the Self Assessment forms and not all will apply for the grant.The assessed to be ineligible population are those self-employed individuals who HMRC identified as having traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year, but were found not to be eligible after being assessed against the SEISS criteria.  Trading profits must be between \u00a30 and \u00a350,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income.For an individual to be found ineligible based on the income criteria they need to be found ineligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return and the combination of the relevant fields for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019. Individuals are also included in the ineligible figures in this publication if an individual\u2019s grant calculation resulted in an amount of \u00a30 or less and if they are recorded as having ceased trading on the Self Assessment systems.The number of claims is defined as the total number of individuals who had submitted a claim for a SEISS grant by 2.28am on 1 September 2020 that had been either paid, sent for payment or had been received and were awaiting various checks. Only non-rejected claims are included with the majority of these having been paid or sent for payment. However, a small number of claims were still being processed and could be rejected.The definitions above apply in the vast majority of cases but there are some other circumstances that are considered when including individuals for assessment and which also may affect potential eligibility to SEISS. However, some of these are only applicable from when the second and final SEISS grant opens to claims on 17 August and are therefore not included in the statistics in this publication. More details of this can be found here:https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-schemeMethodology and data sourcesCoverageThis publication covers all self-employed individuals assessed for potential eligibility for the first SEISS grant as at 31 July 2020. Generally, this includes individuals that HMRC identified as having traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year.Although this covers the vast majority of cases, there are some other circumstances that are considered when including individuals for assessment and which also may affect potential eligibility to SEISS. More details of this can be found here:https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-schemeSmall changes in the numbers of eligible and ineligible individuals between publications may be observed as HMRC continue to review and monitor HMRC data systems to identify all potentially eligible individuals and to ensure that only genuine HMRC customers are invited to claim.The claim information covers individuals who had submitted a claim for the SEISS grant by 2.28am on 1 September 2020 which had not rejected or failed certain compliance checks.Data sources used in this releaseThe data for this release come from HMRC\u2019s system for administering SEISS. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies.Additional data from HMRC\u2019s Self Assessment system and other HMRC administrative systems has been matched with SEISS data to produce the data released here.The age, gender and postcode of residential address has been collected from the Self Assessment account for each individual. The industry information has been collected from the Self Assessment return for the tax year 2018 to 2019, and relates to the self-employment business description provided on that return.To produce the geographic breakdowns, the claimants\u2019 residential postcode has been matched to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data that links UK post codes to geographic areas. The geographic areas that have been presented in this release are country and English region, local authority and Parliamentary constituency.The Self Assessment system is a live operational dataset and, as such, details such as residential address may be updated at any point.  The allocation of geography and industry in these statistics is based on the latest reported information.  As a result, it is possible for an individual claimant\u2019s characteristics to change between the first publication of these statistics on 11 June and subsequent publications.Ineligible population compared against SEISS eligibility criteriaAnalysis of the assessed ineligible population against the eligibility criteria is as a result of additional analysis of the SEISS data in order to provide a description of this group of individuals. An individual can be outside of the criteria for multiple reasons for both the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return and the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019. Additionally, it is possible for the same individual to be ineligible due to different criteria across these 2 stages.For the purposes of the figures presented here, ineligible individuals are recorded against all of the categories that apply to that individual. As a result, individuals can be ineligible in multiple ways and there is a high level of overlap between the categories presented.Strengths and limitationsExperimental Statistics statusThis release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.Differences compared with the HMRC SEISS Management InformationManagement information (MI) on the number and value of SEISS claims received has been published by HMRC at various dates since the scheme was launched on 13 May 2020.The published MI report for 17 August 2020 showed 296,850 claims totalling \u00a3768.9 million. This is the latest MI report following the scheme closing to claims for the first grant on 13 July.The data in this statistical release, dated 31 August 2020, shows different figures of 2.0m claims totalling \u00a35.1 billion.The difference in these figures is mainly due to the management information including all claims received and their associated value even though some of these are eventually rejected after compliance checks. The statistics in this release exclude claims which have been rejected.There is also likely to be a smaller difference caused by the timing of claims flowing through the SEISS system. The MI measures claims at the \u201cfront end\u201d of the system and the statistical publication is based on data made available from the \u201cback end\u201d of the SEISS system once claims have been checked.Differences compared to Survey of Personal IncomesIn the Survey of Personal Incomes individuals are considered as Self-Employed if HMRC received or expects to receive Self Assessment forms covering income from self-employment in their 2017 to 2018 Self Assessment tax return.The population assessed for SEISS eligibility includes only those individuals who submitted 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment returns by 23 April 2020 and included data on self-employment in that return.Differences compared to other sourcesOther organisations such as the ONS and Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have published information about SEISS either from surveys or estimates derived from previously published data.  We believe these HMRC statistics provide a more reliable picture as they are based on administrative data from the SEISS claim and Self-Assessment systems.

OverviewThis publication covers the number and value of claims made to the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) administered by HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC) up to 31 October 2020.The release is classified as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. As a result, the data are subject to revision. These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events.The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics and regards them as consistent with the Code\u2019s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.1.1 Contact detailsFor queries or feedback on this publication, please email seiss.statistics.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk.For press queries, please contact:\tDan Allen, tel: 03000 585 024\tLisa Billard, tel: 07773 091 2641.2 Next releaseThe next release will be published in January 2021.2. Main findingsThe main findings from these statistics are:\t    around 5 million individuals reported self-employment income for the tax year 2018 to 2019, and had their data assessed for potential SEISS eligibility. In order to be assessed, a self-employed individual needed to have traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted a Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year.  \t    via this process, 3.4 million self-employed individuals were identified as potentially eligible for the SEISS scheme. This means that they met the criteria for the scheme based on Self Assessment returns from the tax year 2018 to 19 and earlier years. However, some of the potentially eligible businesses will not have been adversely affected by Coronavirus or have ceased trading since the tax year 2018 to 19 so will not have been eligible.  \t    by 31 October 2.3 million (69%) of the potentially eligible population had claimed a second SEISS grant with the value of these claims totalling \u00a35.9 billion.  \t    compared with the end of September, an additional 89,000 people had claimed the grant by 31 October.  \t    the average value per SEISS 2 claim was \u00a32,500.  \taround two-thirds of the potentially eligible population are male (2.3 million).    \tthe average claim for females is also lower at \u00a32,000 compared to the average claim for males of \u00a32,700.  \t    around 91% of claimants are aged between 25 and 64 and take-up of the grant in those age groups is at or above 67%.  No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.  \t    the sector with the highest number of potentially eligible individuals and the highest proportion of claims is the construction industry. By 31 October, construction workers had made 800,000 claims for SEISS totalling \u00a32.4bn.  \t    the 2 regions with the highest number of claims are London (465,000) and the South East (338,000), reflecting their relative sizes.  \t    of the 1.6 million that did not meet the SEISS criteria, 1.4 million (87%) had trading profits less than non-trading profits (e.g. income from employment or investment income), 0.5 million (33%) had trading profits of \u00a30 or made a loss and 0.2 million (11%) had trading profits over \u00a350,000. (N.B. Individuals may be counted more than once if they have trading profits which meet more than one of these criteria which explains why the figures sum to more than 1.6 million).  \t    by 31 October, 2.7 million individuals had claimed for either the first or second SEISS grant. Of these 2.3 million individuals (86%) claimed both grants, 319,000 (12%) claimed only the first grant and 61,000 (2%) only claimed the second grant.  \tclaims for only the first grant totalled \u00a3951 million and claims for only the second grant totalled \u00a3129 million.3. About this releaseThe Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) provides support for self-employed individuals whose business has been adversely affected by Coronavirus (COVID-19).On 17 August 2020 applications for the second grant of SEISS opened. This is a grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a36,570 in total. The eligibility criteria for SEISS 2 is the same as for SEISS 1.The data used in this release cover claims for the second grant in the SEISS up to 31 October 2020. This data has been matched with other HMRC data to present breakdowns of claims by:\tage and gender\tsector of the economy\tgeographyThe first grant, for which applications closed on 13 July 2020, was based on 80% of your trading profits and capped at \u00a37,500 in total. Official statistics on the first SEISS grant are presented in an earlier publication covering data up until 31 July 2020.Official statistics for the first grant are not repeated here but Section 12 does provide a comparison of claimants of the first and second grants.4. SEISS second grant claims and eligibilityAround 5 million individuals who reported income from self-employment were assessed for SEISS: 3.4 million of these were found to be potentially eligible and 1.6 million were found to be ineligible.Between 17 August and 31 October 2020, HMRC received 2.3 million claims for the SEISS from a total potentially eligible population of 3.4 million. These claims totalled \u00a35.9 billion with an average award of \u00a32,500 per claimant.Eligibility for SEISS required an individual to have levels of income which met specific tests on:\ttheir 2018 to 2019 tax year income, or\tthe combination of income for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019 where available.Figures below represent all criteria that apply to each individual from both sets of tests. Additionally, within each element individuals can be ineligible for multiple reasons and, as a result, there is a high level of overlap between the categories presented below.Of the 1.6 million individuals who were assessed to be ineligible:\t87% (1,436,000) had a trading profit that was less than their non-trading income;\t33% (543,000) had a trading profit \u00a30 or less;\t11% (186,000) had trading profit exceeding \u00a350,000 per year;\t3% (45,000) were ineligible for other reasons,5. SEISS second grant by genderFigure 1 shows the number of SEISS claims for the second grant and the potentially eligible population by gender. Table 1 also shows claim values by gender.Of 5.0 million individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility, men make up around two-thirds (65%), and also make up a slightly higher proportion (68%) of the potentially eligible population.By 31 October HMRC had received 1,663,000 claims from men totalling \u00a34.6 billion compared to 684,000 claims from women for \u00a31.4 billion. Males have a higher take-up rate than females (72% compared to 64%) and their average grant value (\u00a32,700) is higher than the average for females (\u00a32,000).Figure 1: The SEISS potentially eligible population and second grant claims to 31 October 2020 by genderSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationTable 1 - SEISS potentially eligible population, number and value of second grant claims to 31 October 2020, by gender\tGender\tAssessed for potential eligibility\tTotal potentially eligible population\tTotal no. of claims made\tTotal value of claims made\tAverage value of claims\tMale\t3,288,000\t2,321,000\t1,663,000\t\u00a34,561m\t\u00a32,700\tFemale\t1,742,000\t1,065,000\t684,000\t\u00a31,360m\t\u00a32,000\tAll\t5,038,000\t3,390,000\t2,350,000\t\u00a35,927m\t\u00a32,5006. SEISS second grant by age groupFigure 2 and Table 2 show the assessed for potential eligibility population, the potentially eligible population and volumes of claims made for second grant by age group. Table 2 also shows claim values by age.Around 89% of individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility were between the ages of 25 and 64, with over 91% of claimants coming from this age group. Take-up of the grant in these age-groups is at or above 71%, with the exception that those between 55 to 64 have a take up rate of 67%. No one age group dominates and claims are evenly spread.The take up rate is noticeably lower for those who are aged 65 and over (52% have claimed), although they have the highest average claim value at \u00a32,900. The youngest age group have lowest average claim value at \u00a31,800.Figure 2: The total potentially eligible population and number of claims to 31 October 2020, by age groupSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes\tAge is calculated at the date the SEISS scheme opened on 13 May 2020.\tThere is missing age information for 32,000 in the potentially eligible population.Table 2 - SEISS potentially eligible population, number and value of claims by 31 October 2020, by age band\tAge band (as at 13 May 2020)\tAssessed for potential eligibility\tTotal potentially eligible population\tTotal no. of claims made\tTotal value of claims made\tAverage value of claims\t16-24\t164,000\t126,000\t81,000\t\u00a3150m\t\u00a31,800\t25-34\t857,000\t661,000\t476,000\t\u00a31,183m\t\u00a32,500\t35-44\t1,081,000\t798,000\t580,000\t\u00a31,465m\t\u00a32,500\t45-54\t1,189,000\t851,000\t608,000\t\u00a31,552m\t\u00a32,600\t55-64\t1,053,000\t702,000\t470,000\t\u00a31,196m\t\u00a32,500\t65+\t647,000\t220,000\t114,000\t\u00a3327m\t\u00a32,900\tMissing\t47,000\t32,000\t21,000\t\u00a354m\t\u00a32,500\tAll\t5,038,000\t3,390,000\t2,350,000\t\u00a35,927m\t\u00a32,5007. SEISS second grant by industry sector(see Table 3 in the accompanying tables for further details)Self-employed individuals are asked to provide a description of their business activity on their self-assessment returns. These activities have been mapped across to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007 to enable analysis to be carried out by industry sector. Where an individual has multiple sources of self-employed income the activity with the highest income has been used for the SEISS analysis.Figures 3 and 4 show the SEISS populations and number of claims for the second grant made by industry sector.The construction industry has the largest population of individuals who were assessed for potential eligibility with over 1.2 million and just under 1.1 million of these were potentially eligible to apply. By 31 October construction workers had made 800,000 claims for SEISS totalling \u00a32.4 billion; an average of \u00a33,100 per claimant.Self-employed individuals in the transportation and storage sector make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and made 217,000 claims totalling \u00a3410 million. Administrative and support services also make up 8% of the potentially eligible population and have made 171,000 claims totalling \u00a3304 million.The highest rates of being assessed as potentially eligible for SEISS were from individuals working in the construction industry (86%) and the transportation and storage sector (82%).Lower rates of being assessed as potentially eligible for SEISS were found for individuals working in real estate activities (29%), financial and insurance activities (41%) and agriculture, forestry and fishing (45%).Figure 3: The SEISS population and number of second grant claims made to 31 October 2020, by sector (for the 6 largest SIC industries potentially eligible for the scheme)Source: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationTable 3 - The SEISS population and number of second grant claims made to 31 October 2020, by sector (for the 6 largest SIC industries potentially eligible for the scheme)\tSector\tAssessed for potential eligibility\tTotal potentially eligible population\tTotal no. of claims made\tConstruction\t1,224,000\t1,056,000\t800,000\tAdministrative and support service activities\t384,000\t284,000\t171,000\tTransportation and storage\t323,000\t266,000\t217,000\tOther service activities\t284,000\t221,000\t173,000\tWholesale and retail trade; vehicle repair\t296,000\t190,000\t120,000\tProfessional, scientific and technical activities\t397,000\t181,000\t109,000Figure 4: The SEISS population and number of claims for the second grant made to 31 October 2020, by sector; (smaller sectors not shown in figure 3)Source: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes:\t473,000 cases in the potentially eligible population are included as \u2018Unknown and other\u2019 and almost all of these (99%) could not be allocated to a SIC code.Table 4 - The SEISS population and number of claims for the second grant made to 31 October 2020, by sector; (smaller sectors not shown in figure 3)\tSector\tAssessed for potential eligibility\tTotal potentially eligible population\tTotal no. of claims made\tHuman health and social work activities\t309,000\t158,000\t93,000\tEducation\t193,000\t114,000\t85,000\tAgriculture, forestry and fishing\t238,000\t108,000\t48,000\tArts, entertainment and recreation\t187,000\t99,000\t72,000\tAccommodation and food service activities\t130,000\t83,000\t54,000\tManufacturing\t120,000\t78,000\t53,000\tInformation and communication\t68,000\t37,000\t22,000\tFinancial and insurance activities\t46,000\t19,000\t12,000\tReal estate activities\t52,000\t15,000\t8,000\tPublic administration and defence\t10,000\t7,000\t5,000Figure 5 shows the average value of claims by sector which range from \u00a33,600 per claimant in the finance and insurance sector to \u00a31,800 per claimant in administrative and support services.Figure 5: Average value of claims to 31 October 2020, by primary industry of self-employment, ranked by average claimSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes\tThe allocation to industry represents an individual\u2019s highest earning self-employment.\t473,000 cases in the potentially eligible population are included as \u2018Unknown and other\u2019 and almost all of these (99%) could not be allocated to a SIC code.Table 5 - Average value of claims to 31 October 2020, by primary industry of self-employment, ranked by average claim\tSector\tAverage value of claims\tFinancial and insurance activities\t3,600\tConstruction\t3,100\tProfessional, scientific and technical activities\t3,000\tInformation and communication\t2,900\tReal estate activities\t2,900\tAgriculture, forestry and fishing\t2,800\tManufacturing\t2,600\tAll claims\t2,500\tHuman health and social work activities\t2,500\tWholesale and retail trade; vehicle repair\t2,500\tArts, entertainment and recreation\t2,400\tAccommodation and food service activities\t2,400\tPublic administration and defence\t2,300\tEducation\t2,100\tOther service activities\t2,000\tTransportation and storage\t1,900\tAdministrative and support service activities\t1,8008. SEISS second grant by geography(see Table 2 in the accompanying tables for further details)Using the claimant\u2019s Self Assessment address, SEISS claims can be mapped to countries of the UK, English regions and lower geographies.Figure 6 shows the SEISS population and number of claims made by country and region.London has the largest number of individuals that were assessed for potential eligibility (904,000), the largest potentially eligible population (642,000) and the largest number of claims (465,000) totalling \u00a31.181 billion.England had the highest proportion of assessed individuals that were found to be eligible (68%), followed by Wales (65%), Scotland (64%) and Northern Ireland (62%).Take up rate is very even across the UK with most nations and regions having a take up rate close to 69%. Northern Ireland has the highest take up rate (73%) while the take up rate in the South West is the lowest (66%).Self-employed individuals in Scotland have made 142,000 claims totalling \u00a3359 million; in Wales 97,000 claims for \u00a3228 million have been made and in Northern Ireland 70,000 claims for \u00a3175 million have been submitted.Figure 6: The SEISS population and number of claims for the second grant made to 31 October by country and NUTS1 region, ranked by size of assessed for eligibility populationSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes:\tThe allocation to location represents the individual\u2019s address registered on their Self Assessment return.\t13,000 of the potentially eligible population could not be allocated to a NUTS1 region.Table 6 - The SEISS population and number of claims for the second grant made to 31 October by country and NUTS1 region, ranked by size of assessed for eligibility population\tSector\tAssessed for potential eligibility\tTotal potentially eligible population\tTotal no. of claims made\tLondon\t904,000\t642,000\t465,000\tSouth East\t758,000\t501,000\t338,000\tEast of England\t514,000\t349,000\t238,000\tSouth West\t497,000\t318,000\t209,000\tNorth West\t454,000\t311,000\t221,000\tWest Midlands\t382,000\t261,000\t181,000\tYorkshire and the Humber\t350,000\t240,000\t169,000\tScotland\t326,000\t207,000\t142,000\tEast Midlands\t322,000\t218,000\t148,000\tWales\t216,000\t140,000\t97,000\tNorthern Ireland\t154,000\t96,000\t70,000\tNorth East\t139,000\t94,000\t65,000Figure 7 shows the average value of second grant claims by country and region.The regions with the lowest average claim values are the North East, the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber (\u00a32,300).The South East and East of England (both \u00a32,700) have average claim values above the UK average of \u00a32,500.Figure 7: The average value of claims by NUTS1 region, ranked by valueSource: HMRC SEISS linked to Self Assessment taxpayer informationNotes:\tThe allocation to location represents the individual\u2019s address registered on their Self Assessment return.\t13,000 of the potentially eligible population could not be allocated to a NUTS1 region.Table 7 - The average value of claims by NUTS1 region, ranked by value\tSector\tAverage value of claims\tSouth East\t2,700\tEast of England\t2,700\tSouth West\t2,600\tLondon\t2,500\tScotland\t2,500\tUK average\t2,500\tEast Midlands\t2,500\tNorthern Ireland\t2,500\tWest Midlands\t2,400\tWales\t2,400\tYorkshire and the Humber\t2,300\tNorth West\t2,300\tNorth East\t2,3008.1 Sub-regional breakdownsTables 4 and 5 in the accompanying Excel table pack provide a breakdown of SEISS claimants by Parliamentary Constituency and Local Authority.These tables also include a gender breakdown which show the number of male and female claimants and the amount they claim by each area.The maps below illustrate how the take-up rate for the SEISS scheme has varied across the country.SEISS claims as a proportion of the potentially eligible population, by Local AuthoritySource: Office for National Statistics (ONS) licensed under the Open Government Licence v.3.0.

SEISS second grant claims by industry sector and geography(see Table 6 in the accompanying tables for further details)Sections 9 to 11 consider the breakdown of the number of claims received in each country and region by different demographics (industry, gender and age).  Comparable information relating to the value of claims, the potentially eligible population and take-up rates can be found in tables 6 and 7 in the accompanying tables.Figure 8 shows the breakdown of claims in each region and country by industry sector.  Construction, transport and administrative services have the largest number of claims overall and are shown as separate categories on the chart. Agriculture, forestry and fishing is also large for some areas and is shown separately. Other smaller industries have been combined.The industry profile of SEISS claimants does not vary greatly between countries and regions. The main exceptions are seen in the construction industry and agriculture, forestry and fishing.Individuals working in the construction industry account for the highest proportion of claims in every country and region of the UK. London has the highest proportion, with 40% of claims being from those working in construction and Scotland has the lowest with 26%.Individuals working in agriculture, forestry and fishing account for 12% of all claims made by individuals in Northern Ireland, 7% in Wales, 4% in Scotland and only 1% in England.Figure 8: The proportion of claims received by 31 October 2020 in each country and region by primary industry of self-employmentNotes:\tThe allocation to industry represents an individual\u2019s highest earning self-employment.\t473,000 cases of the potentially eligible population are included as \u2018Unknown and other\u2019 and almost all of these (99%) could not be allocated to a SIC code.Table 8 - The proportion of claims received by 31 October 2020 in each country and region by primary industry of self-employment\tProportion of claims by region and sector\tConstruction\tAgriculture, forestry and fishing\tTransportation and storage\tAdministrative and support service activities\tOther and unknown\tLondon\t40%\t0%\t12%\t9%\t40%\tEast of England\t37%\t1%\t8%\t8%\t46%\tSouth East\t35%\t1%\t7%\t8%\t49%\tEast Midlands\t34%\t2%\t7%\t7%\t50%\tWest Midlands\t34%\t2%\t11%\t6%\t47%\tWales\t32%\t7%\t6%\t6%\t49%\tSouth West\t31%\t3%\t5%\t8%\t53%\tYorkshire and the Humber\t31%\t2%\t11%\t6%\t50%\tNorthern Ireland\t31%\t12%\t7%\t3%\t46%\tNorth West\t31%\t2%\t12%\t6%\t50%\tNorth East\t30%\t2%\t11%\t6%\t51%\tScotland\t26%\t4%\t10%\t6%\t53%10. SEISS second grant claims by gender and geography(see Table 7 in the accompanying tables for further details)The area with the highest proportion of males in the potentially eligible population is Northern Ireland (73%) and the lowest areas are Scotland and the South West (65% each). A similar pattern is seen in the number of claims received by 31 October with male claimants accounting for 75% of claims in Northern Ireland and 66% of claims in Scotland.Since the average claim amount is higher for males than females, men account for an even higher proportion of total claim values. In the West Midlands, Northern Ireland and London 79% of total claim values are from men. The lowest male share is in Scotland where 73% of the total amount claimed is claimed by men.Figure 9: The proportion of claims received by 31 October 2020 in each country and region by genderTable 9 - The proportion of claims received by 31 October 2020 in each country and region by gender\tProportion of claims by region and gender\tMale\tFemale\tNorthern Ireland\t75%\t25%\tWest Midlands\t74%\t26%\tLondon\t73%\t27%\tNorth West\t72%\t28%\tWales\t72%\t28%\tYorkshire and the Humber\t72%\t28%\tNorth East\t71%\t29%\tEast of England\t71%\t29%\tEast Midlands\t70%\t30%\tSouth East\t69%\t31%\tSouth West\t66%\t34%\tScotland\t66%\t34%11. SEISS second grant claims by age and geography(see Table 7 in the accompanying tables for further details)The age distribution of the potentially eligible population and claims received by 31 October is reasonably consistent across all countries and regions with the exception of London.Between 41% (Wales, Scotland and Northen Ireland) and 48% (England) of the potentially eligible population in each country and region is aged under 45 except in London where 58% are under 45.A similar distribution is observed from claims with the lowest proportion aged under 45 being in Scotland (42% of claimants and 40% of claim value) and the highest being in London (59% of claims and 58% of claim value).Figure 10: Age distribution of claims received by 31 October 2020 in each country and regionNotes:\tAge is calculated at the date the second grant opened on 13 May 2020.\tThe age for around 32,000 individuals in the potentially eligible population is not known which is around 1% of each country/region although slightly higher at 3% for individuals living in Northern Ireland.Table 10 - Age distribution of claims received by 31 October 2020 in each country and region\tProportion of claims by region and gender\t16-24\t25-34\t35-44\t45-54\t55-64\t65+\tMissing\tLondon\t4%\t26%\t29%\t23%\t14%\t3%\t1%\tEast of England\t4%\t20%\t24%\t25%\t20%\t5%\t1%\tSouth East\t4%\t20%\t24%\t26%\t21%\t5%\t1%\tNorth West\t3%\t20%\t24%\t26%\t21%\t5%\t1%\tWest Midlands\t4%\t19%\t24%\t27%\t20%\t5%\t1%\tEast Midlands\t4%\t19%\t23%\t27%\t21%\t5%\t1%\tYorkshire and the Humber\t3%\t19%\t24%\t28%\t21%\t4%\t1%\tNorth East\t3%\t18%\t23%\t28%\t23%\t5%\t1%\tSouth West\t3%\t18%\t23%\t27%\t23%\t6%\t1%\tNorthern Ireland\t2%\t17%\t24%\t26%\t21%\t7%\t3%\tWales\t3%\t18%\t22%\t27%\t23%\t7%\t1%\tScotland\t2%\t17%\t23%\t27%\t24%\t6%\t1%12. Comparing claimants of SEISS first and second grants(see Tables 8, 8a, 8b and 8c in the accompanying tables for further details)This section provides a comparison to show how many individuals have claimed both the first and second SEISS grants, only the first SEISS grant or only the second SEISS grant. It also provides a comparison of the age/gender, geography and industry sector of claimants of only the first SEISS grant compared to only the second SEISS grant.By 31 October 2020, 2.7 million individuals had claimed for either the first or second SEISS grant or both. Of these, 2.3 million individuals (86%) claimed both grants, 319,000 (12%) claimed only the first grant and 61,000 (2%) only claimed the second grant.Claims for the first grant totalled \u00a37.6 billion and claims for the second grant totalled \u00a35.9 billion, giving a combined total of \u00a313.5 billion for both grants.The average claim for the first SEISS grant for those claiming both grants (\u00a32,900) is slightly lower than for those only claiming the first grant (\u00a33,000). In contrast, the average claim for the second SEISS grant for those claiming both grants (\u00a32,500) is higher than for those only claiming the second grant (\u00a32,100).Table 11 - Number and value of claims for first and second SEISS grants to 31 October 2020\tSEISS grant\tNumber of individuals\tTotal value of claims for FIRST grant\tAverage value of claims for FIRST grant\tTotal value of claims for SECOND grant\tAverage value of claims for SECOND grant\tClaimed both grants\t2,288,000\t\u00a36,635m\t\u00a32,900\t\u00a35,799m\t\u00a32,500\tClaimed only first grant\t319,000\t\u00a3951m\t\u00a33,000\tN/A\tN/A\tClaimed only second grant\t61,000\tN/A\tN/A\t\u00a3129m\t\u00a32,100\tAll\t2,669,000\t\u00a37,586m\t\u00a32,900\t\u00a35,927m\t\u00a32,500Notes:\tAverage for all claimants of SEISS 1 excludes the 61,000 who have not claimed the first grant and the average for all claimants of SEISS 2 excludes the 319,000 who have not not claimed the second grant.The accompanying tables (8a-8c) provide further comparisons of the claimants of both schemes, only the first and only the second SEISS grants by age and gender, geography and industry sector.Key points from the tables:\t    there is a higher proportion of total claimants (8.3 percentage point difference) under 45 that claimed for both schemes than those that claimed just for SEISS 1. This suggests there is an older demographic only claiming SEISS 1.  \t    a higher proportion of females (3.9 percentage point difference) claimed just for SEISS 2 than claimed for both schemes.  \t    regional differences between the 3 populations are generally consistent apart from London. A greater proportion of total claimants (5.3 percentage point difference) claimed just for SEISS 2 than did for both schemes whereas a lower proportion of total claimants (4.5 percentage point difference) claimed just for SEISS 1 compared to both schemes.  \t    the proportion of total claimants in the transport and storage sector that claimed for both schemes is higher than those that claimed only SEISS 1 (5.5 percentage point difference) and only SEISS 2 (3.0 percentage point difference). This suggests that more claimants in this sector have claimed both grants relative to claimants in other sectors.  13. Background to the SEISSSEISS was announced on 26 March 2020 as part of the UK government\u2019s support package for businesses and self-employed people during the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020. The scheme was open to self-employed individuals and members of a partnership who met the following criteria:\ttraded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year\ttraded in the tax year 2019 to 2020\tintended to continue to trade in the tax year 2020 to 2021\tcarried on a trade which had been adversely affected by coronavirusA business could be adversely affected by coronavirus if, for example:\tthey were unable to work because they:    \twere shielding\twere self-isolating\twere on sick leave because of coronavirus\thad caring responsibilities because of coronavirus  \tthey have had to scale down or temporarily stop trading because:    \ttheir supply chain has been interrupted\tthey have fewer or no customers or clients\ttheir staff are unable to come in to work  The grant is not open to limited companies or those operating a trade through a trust.To work out eligibility, HMRC first look at the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return. Trading profits must be between \u00a30 and \u00a350,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income. If an individual is not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, HMRC will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.The scheme allows an eligible individual to claim a taxable grant worth 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a37,500 in total. The first SEISS grant closed for claims on 13 July 2020.On the 17 August 2020 applications for the SEISS second opened. This will be a taxable grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a36,570 in total.On 5 November 2020 details of a third SEISS grant were announced with the claim window opening on 30 November 2020. This will be a taxable grant worth 80% of an individual\u2019s average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months\u2019 worth of profits, and capped at \u00a37,500 in total.The statistics presented in this release mainly cover claims for the second grant in the SEISS scheme up to 31 October 2020. However, Tables 8 and 8a-8c provide a comparison of the individuals claiming each grant.14. GlossaryThe assessed for potential eligibility population are those self-employed individuals who HMRC identified as having traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year.The SEISS potentially eligible population are those who HMRC identified as being potentially eligible for a SEISS grant based on the information held from their Self Assessment returns relating to the tax years; 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019. This is the group who have been invited to claim for a SEISS grant.This does not attempt to assess if a business was affected by coronavirus or whether they continued trading after the tax year 2018 to 2019.  So it is the potentially eligible population based only on the information in the Self Assessment forms and not all will apply for the grant.The assessed to be ineligible population are those self-employed individuals who HMRC identified as having traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year, but were found not to be eligible after being assessed against the SEISS criteria.  Trading profits must be between \u00a30 and \u00a350,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income.For an individual to be found ineligible based on the income criteria they need to be found ineligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return and the combination of the relevant fields for consecutive tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.Individuals are also included in the ineligible figures in this publication if an individual\u2019s grant calculation resulted in an amount of \u00a30 or less and if they are recorded as having ceased trading on the Self Assessment systems.The number of claims is defined as the total number of individuals who had submitted a claim for a SEISS grant by 18.46pm on 31 October 2020 that had been either paid, sent for payment or had been received and were awaiting various checks. Only non-rejected claims are included with the majority of these having been paid or sent for payment. However, a small number of claims were still being processed and could be rejected.The definitions above apply in the vast majority of cases but there are some other circumstances that are considered when including individuals for assessment and which also may affect potential eligibility to SEISS. However, some of these are only applicable from when the second and final SEISS grant opens to claims on 17 August and are therefore not included in the statistics in this publication. You can read more about how different circumstances affect SEISS on GOV.UK.15. Methodology and data sources15.1 CoverageThis publication covers all self-employed individuals assessed for potential eligibility for the second SEISS grant as at 31 October 2020. Generally, this includes individuals that HMRC identified as having traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted their Self-Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year.Although this covers the vast majority of cases, there are some other circumstances that are considered when including individuals for assessment and which also may affect potential eligibility to SEISS. You can read more about how different circumstances affect SEISS on GOV.UK.Small changes in the numbers of eligible and ineligible individuals between publications may be observed as HMRC continue to review and monitor HMRC data systems to identify all potentially eligible individuals and to ensure that only genuine HMRC customers are invited to claim.The claim information covers individuals who had submitted a claim for the SEISS grant by 18.46pm on 31 October 2020 which had not rejected or failed certain compliance checks.15.2 Data sources used in this releaseThe data for this release come from HMRC\u2019s system for administering SEISS. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies.Additional data from HMRC\u2019s Self Assessment system and other HMRC administrative systems has been matched with SEISS data to produce the data released here.The age, gender and postcode of residential address has been collected from the Self Assessment account for each individual. The industry information has been collected from the Self Assessment return for the tax year 2018 to 2019, and relates to the self-employment business description provided on that return.To produce the geographic breakdowns, the claimants\u2019 residential postcode has been matched to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data that links UK post codes to geographic areas. The geographic areas that have been presented in this release are country and English region, Local Authority and Parliamentary constituency.The Self Assessment system is a live operational dataset and, as such, details such as residential address may be updated at any point.  The allocation of geography and industry in these statistics is based on the latest reported information.  As a result, it is possible for an individual claimant\u2019s characteristics to change between the first publication of these statistics on 11 June and subsequent publications.15.3 Ineligible population compared against SEISS eligibility criteriaAnalysis of the assessed ineligible population against the eligibility criteria is as a result of additional analysis of the SEISS data in order to provide a description of this group of individuals. An individual can be outside of the criteria for multiple reasons for both the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return and the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019. Additionally, it is possible for the same individual to be ineligible due to different criteria across these 2 stages. For the purposes of the figures presented here, ineligible individuals are recorded against all of the categories that apply to that individual. As a result, individuals can be ineligible in multiple ways and there is a high level of overlap between the categories presented.16. Strengths and limitations16.1 Experimental Statistics statusThis release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.16.2 Differences compared with the HMRC SEISS Management InformationManagement information (MI) on the number and value of SEISS claims received has been published by HMRC at various dates since the scheme was launched on 13th May 2020.The published MI report for 18 October 2020 showed 2.3 million claims for the second SEISS grant totalling \u00a35.9 billion. This is the latest MI report following the scheme closing to claims for the first grant on 13th July.A new MI report is being published on the same day as these statistics. This is likely to show a similar number and value of claims.A significant difference between the figures is that the MI includes all claims received and their associated value even though some of these are eventually rejected after compliance checks. The statistics in this release exclude claims which have been rejected.There is also likely to be a smaller difference caused by the timing of claims flowing through the SEISS system. The MI measures claims at the \u2018front end\u2019 of the system and the statistical publication is based on data made available from the \u201cback end\u201d of the SEISS system once claims have been checked.16.3 Differences compared to Survey of Personal IncomesIn the Survey of Personal Incomes individuals are considered as Self-Employed if HMRC received or expects to receive Self Assessment forms covering income from self-employment in their 2017 to 2018 Self Assessment tax return.The population assessed for SEISS eligibility includes only those individuals who submitted 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment returns by 23 April 2020 and included data on self-employment in that return.16.4 Differences compared to other sourcesOther organisations such as the ONS and Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have published information about SEISS either from surveys or estimates derived from previously published data.  We believe these HMRC statistics provide a more reliable picture as they are based on administrative data from the SEISS claim and Self-Assessment systems.

The Scheme has paid taxable grants worth 80% of someone\u2019s average monthly trading profit, for a three-month period, worth up to \u00a37,500 in total. On 30 April 2020 the Government published the Treasury Direction to HM Revenue & Customs, the statutory guidelines for HMRC to administer the SEISS. The Scheme was opened for applications on 13 May, and closed on 13 July.On 29 May 2020 the Government announced a second round of the SEISS, with those eligible able to claim a second grant, worth 70% of their average monthly trading profit, for a further three months, capped at \u00a36,570 in total. On 2 July a second Treasury Direction was published to this effect. Applications for the second grant were opened on 17 August, and were closed on 19 October.On 24 September 2020 the Government announced an extension to the SEISS to be introduced in November, to cover the six months up to the end of April 2021. The SEISS Grant Extension would be made in two taxable grants \u2013 first to cover November to January, second to cover February to April. \u00a0Initially it was proposed that the first of these grants would cover 20% of average monthly trading profits, capped at \u00a31,875, but this figure has been revised three times.\u00a0 On 22 October the Chancellor announced the first grant would cover 40% of average monthly trading profits, capped at \u00a33,750. On 2 November the Chancellor announced that the payment for the first month (November) of the first grant would be set at 80% \u2013 increasing the total level of this grant to 55% of trading profits, capped at \u00a35,160. Subsequently on 5 November the Chancellor announced that all three months of the first grant would be calculated on the basis of 80% of average trading profits, up to a maximum of \u00a37,500.[1] On 24 November the Government published a further Treasury Direction underpinning the scheme. Applications for the third SEISS grant opened on 29 November and closed on 29 January 2021.[2]On 3 March 2021 the Chancellor presented the 2021 Budget, and as part of this announced the SEISS would be extended until the end of September 2021. A fourth grant will be set at 80% of 3 months\u2019 average trading profits, paid out in a single instalment, capped at \u00a37,500.
