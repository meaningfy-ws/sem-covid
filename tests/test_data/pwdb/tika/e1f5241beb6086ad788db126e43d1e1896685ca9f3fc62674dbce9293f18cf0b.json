The act contains some remarkable provisions in thepublic interest to help fight the effects of the coronavirus.Let\u2019s take a look at at some key aspects of the Emergency Measures inthe Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 as the act impacts on employment law inIreland.The Temporary Wages Subsidy SchemePart 7 of the act provides for this scheme which has beenthe subject of two sets of guidelines from the Revenue Commissioners. Here isthe most recent guidelineson employer eligibility to the wages subsidy scheme.Key points regarding the guidelines are\tThe employer must self declare that he has beenseriously impacted and is a statement that as a result of the coronavirus hewill be unable to pay normal wages, wants to retain employees, and will suffera decline of at least 25% of turnover during the COVID-19 pandemic\tAn employer who has significant cash reserveswill be expected to pay a significant proportion of the employee\u2019s wages, evenif he has suffered a decline in business\tThe 25% turnover decrease calculation can becarried out on any basis that is reasonable\tThere is some supporting proofs required for Revenue\tThe names and addresses of employers availing ofthe subsidy will be published\tThere are 2 phases: phase 1 from 15thMarch 2020 to 20th April 2020 and phase 2 from April 20th,2020\tEmployees must have been on the payroll on 29thFebruary 2020There has been criticism of this scheme from various quartersand, no doubt, it is not perfect. But given the circumstances and the need forspeed it is inevitable that some infirmities or anomalies would arise. Nonetheless,with goodwill on all sides it is probably worth a fair chance to see the wagessubsidy scheme in action.Redundancy payments changesPart 8 of the act makes a change to the Redundancy PaymentsAct 1967 and provides clarity concerning layoffs and short time working duringthe COVID-19 crisis.This emergency legislation suspends the employee\u2019s right toa redundancy payment pursuant to section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act1967.Section 12 providesF31[12.\u2014(1) An employee shall not be entitled toredundancy payment by reason of having been laid off or kept on short-timeunless\u2014(a) he has been laid off or kept on short-time for fouror more consecutive weeks or, within a period of thirteen weeks, for a seriesof six or more weeks of which not more than three were consecutive, and(b) after the expiry of the relevant period of lay-off orshort-time mentioned in paragraph (a) and not later than four weeks after thecessation of the lay-off or short-time, he gives to his employer notice (inthis Part referred to as a notice of intention to claim) in writing of hisintention to claim redundancy payment in respect of lay-off or short-time.(2) Where, after the expiry of the relevant period oflay-off or short-time mentioned in subsection (1) (a) and not later than fourweeks after the cessation of the lay-off or short time, an employee to whomthat subsection applies, in lieu of giving to his employer a notice ofintention to claim, terminates his contract of employment either by giving himthe notice thereby required or, if none is so required, by giving him not lessthan one week\u2019s notice in writing of intention to terminate the contract, thenotice so given shall, for the purposes of this Part and of Schedule 2, bedeemed to be a notice of intention to claim given in writing to the employer bythe employee on the date on which the notice is actually given.]This new legislation inserts a new section 12A whichsuspends the employee\u2019s right to claim redundancy during the emergency periodwhich is defined as the period from 13th March 2020 to 31stMay 2020. This period oculd be extended, however, depending on how thecoronavirus is being dealt with.The critical impact of this provision is to give employerssome comfort regarding the fear they had that they would face a large number ofclaims for redundancy arising from forced layoffs or short time working.Here is the bill as it was passed by the Dail on Friday 27thMarch 2020: EmergencyMeasures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Bill 2020.This act also makes emergency provisions regarding theoperation of the Residential Tenancies act 2004, time limits relating toplanning and development, health and social care professions, the Mental HealthAct 2001, the Defence Act 1954, the Civil Registration Act 2004, the RedundancyPayments Act 1967.Follow @TGorrySolicitorTags:coronaviruscovid-19  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch the site\t\t\t\t\tCategoriesCategoriesSelect CategoryBlogData ProtectionEmployment ClaimsEmployment InjunctionsEmployment Law BooksEmployment Law Procedures and PoliciesEmployment PermitsEquality and DiscriminationFixed Term ContractsHealth and SafetyHR/Employment Law ServicesIndustrial RelationsLeave and HolidaysMediationMinimum NoticeNERA-National Employment Rights AuthorityPart Time WorkersPayment of WagesPodcastProtected DisclosuresRedundancyStaff HandbooksTemporary Agency WorkersThe Employment ContractTUPE-Transfer of UndertakingsUncategorizedUnfair DismissalVideocastWhistleblowingWorking Time/Rest PeriodsWorkplace Relations CommissionYoung Persons\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecent Posts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourt of Appeal overturns High Court decision in dismissal of employee on probation case\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChoosing the wrong complaint on the WRC complaint form-a fatal mistake\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRemote working-will the National Remote Work Strategy be a game changer for the employee?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid-19 Vaccine-the rollout and the legal issues in the workplace\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployee awarded \u20ac7,500 for penalisation under Safety, Health and Welfare Act, 2005\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended Sites\tTerry Gorry & Co.

welfare payments am Ientitled to during lay off or short-time working? \tWhere to get more information    IntroductionMany businesses have been forced to lay off staff or reduce their workinghours temporarily during the coronavirus (COVID-19)pandemic.This document outlines the difference between lay off and short termworking, gives information on social welfare supports and tells you when aredundancy payment can arise.If your job has been affected by COVID-19, you can get more information inour document on Employmentrights during the COVID-19 restrictions.What is a lay off? A lay-off situation arises if your employer: \tIs unable to provide work for you\tBelieves this is a temporary situation and\tGives you notification of the lay off before the work finishesDuring lay off you remain an employee even if you are not being paid.What are short-time workingarrangements? Short-time working refers to a very specific situation where:\tYour weekly pay is less than half your normal weekly pay or\tThe hours you work are reduced to less than half of your normal weekly    working hours\tYour employer has a reasonable belief that the situation will be    temporary and notifies you of the reduction in hours and/or payRules for short-term working and lay-offYour employer should follow certain rules if they bring in temporarylay-offs or short-term working arrangements.In your contract or with your agreementYour employer can lay you off or put you on short time if it is in yourcontract of employment or if it is custom and practice in your workplace.Otherwise your employer should not lay you off or put you on short timewithout your agreement. However, if you do not agree you maybe made redundant.You can read more about your options if you do not agree to the lay off orshort-time working in our document on beingasked to reduce your pay or hours of work.Give you notice and keep you informedYour employer should explain the reason for the lay off or short-timeworking to you and keep you informed of the situation during the period of layoff or short-time working.In both cases, these must be temporary situations and your employer mustgive you notification of this before they start. During the current coronaviruspandemic, you may have been given very short notice.How does an employer select employees for temporary lay-offs or short-termworking arrangements?When selecting employees for lay off or short-time working, employers shouldapply the same criteria for selection as for redundancy. The criteria should bereasonable and applied fairly.For example, the custom and practice in the workplace may be last in, firstout, or the contract of employment may set out criteria for selection.Under employmentequality legislation, the selection must not discriminate against employeeson any of the following 9 grounds:\tGender\tCivil status\tFamily status\tAge\tDisability\tReligious belief\tRace\tSexual orientation or\tMembership of the Traveller communityYour employment rights during lay off or short-timeDuring lay off or short-time working, you still are employed by youremployer and your contract of employment remains in force. This means that youare entitled to benefit for any publicholidays that occur during the first 13 weeks of lay off. Part-timeemployee must have worked at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks before the publicholiday. You can get more information in our document on publicholidays. You do not accrue annualleave during lay off but you are entitled to take annual leave that youaccrued before being laid off.Lay off and reckonable serviceTo qualify for statutory redundancy, you must have 104 weeks ofreckonable service with your employer. A period of lay off is notreckonable service. This means that if you are laid off and have less than 104weeks of reckonable service, you will not qualify for statutory redundancy. Italso means that the time you spend on lay off is not used to calculate yourredundancy lump sum.If you were laid off because of COVID-19 and are getting the COVID-19Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), a jobseeker\u2019s payment, or anothersocial welfare payment, this is counted as a period of lay off. This means thatthis period of time is not counted towards your reckonable service.But if your employer got payments through the Temporary Wage SubsidyScheme (TWSS) or the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme(EWSS) and continued to pay you during this time, then this period of timeis counted towards your reckonable service.Changes to redundancy rules duringCOVID-19 emergency periodThe law on claiming redundancy from your employer if you have beentemporarily laid off, or temporarily put on short-time work will change duringthe COVID-19 emergency period.Normally, if you are laid off or put on short-time hours, you can claimredundancy from your employer after 4 weeks or more, or 6 weeks in the last 13weeks.If you were put on lay off or short-time hours because of COVID-19, youcannot claim redundancy. This is set out in the EmergencyMeasures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act (pdf) and applies from 13March 2020.This rule has been extended until30 June 2021. Claiming redundancy from your employer The information below describes the law on claiming redundancy during ashort-time or lay-off period. These rules do not apply during theCOVID-19 emergency period. See 'Changes to redundancy rules duringCOVID-19 emergency period' above.In some cases when you have been in a lay off or short-time workingsituation for a certain length of time you may be entitled to claim redundancy.A lay-off does not involve the termination of your contract of employment,whereas a redundancy does.If a lay-off or a short-time working situation exists and has continued for4 weeks or more, or for 6 weeks in the last 13 weeks, you may give youremployer a notice in writing of your intention to claim redundancy under the RedundancyPayments Acts 1967-2014. If the period of lay-off or redundancy has ended,you must do this within 4 weeks.Unless your employer gives you a counter-notice within 7 days of yournotice, you may be entitled to a redundancy payment provided that you qualify for redundancy.If your employer gives you a counter-notice within the time allowed, it mustbe to the effect that within 4 weeks of the date ofyour claim for redundancy, it will be possible to offer you not lessthan 13 weeks' work without lay off or short time. (It may be difficult foremployer to guarantee 13 weeks unbroken employment, given the rapidly changingnature of the COVID- 19 pandemic.)You should note that if you claim redundancy in this way you are consideredto have left your job voluntarily and therefore you lose any right to notice fromyour employer under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts1973-2005.However if you have been laid off and you are subsequently made redundant byyour employer you do not lose your notice entitlements.You can get more information in our frequently askedquestions on redundancy.What social welfare payments am Ientitled to during lay off or short-time working? If you have been laid off as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, youremployer may continue to pay you most or all of your pay through Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme(EWSS). The State will pay a subsidy per employee to help keep you inemployment. The subsidy amount paid to employers will depend on the grossincome of each employee.If your working hours are reduced to 3 days or less per week you shouldapply for Short TimeWork Support which is a form of Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit.If your employer has decided to close their business and temporarily lay youoff and cannot pay you, you can apply for the new COVID-19Pandemic Unemployment Payment.This new payment is for employees and self-employed people who have lostall their employment due to a downturn in economic activitycaused by the COVID-19 pandemic. People getting Working Family Payment andstudents who have lost employment can also apply.

The suspension of these provisions, which relate to redundancy entitlements following temporary periods of lay-off and short-time work due to Covid-19 was introduced on March 13th under new emergency measures as existing provisions were not considered adequate to deal with the current Covid-19 emergency situation. A suspension of these provisions was considered vital to ensure the future viability of businesses and help prevent further permanent job losses.                Minister Doherty today emphasised:                            \u201cAs the Government has announced a roadmap for reopening society and businesses under which it is envisaged that most businesses should reopen by the 10th August 2020, it makes sense to extend our approach to redundancy entitlements during temporary layoffs to that date also. Given the ongoing emergency situation, serious risks to business and jobs remain.                                     For employees an extension of the end-date is important to ensure that they have a continued link to their job and a pathway to return. For employers, many still regard their businesses as being temporarily closed and plan to re-open as soon as is possible for them to do so.   If we did not extend the end date further, redundancies could occur in the very near future which will burden employers with further debt and have a serious impact on the potential for a business to recover.  This in turn increases the risk of insolvency and bankruptcy situations which will only exacerbate the risk of further permanent job losses.\u201d                          It is important to note that the employee\u2019s right to claim redundancy has not been removed, but deferred for the emergency period in circumstances of temporary lay-off or short-time employment.
