This is higher than the average for those working in the four sectors collectively designated above as \u2018severely impacted\u2019.

The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection said on Tuesday that about 54,000 people would receive the payment for the first time this week.                                                        It said the numbers receiving the Covid-19 unemployment benefit were in addition to the 210,000 who were on the live register. More than 42,000 employers have now registered with the Revenue Commissioners for the Government\u2019s temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme which is aimed at having workers remain on the books of their employer during the current coronavirus crisis.                                                        The department also said it had received 27,300 applications for the Covid-19 enhanced illness benefit of \u20ac350 a week. It said these applications were mainly from people who had been asked by their GPs to self-isolate as well as a smaller number of individuals who had been diagnosed with Covid-19.                                                        On Tuesday, Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection Regina Doherty suggested that with just over 50,000 additional Covid-19 benefits approved in the past week, \u201cwe are perhaps reaching a plateau in terms of those on the Covid-19 payment\u201d.                                                         The Minister said about 1.4 million people were still in full-time work.                                                                                                                                                             \t                                                                                    Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker: What's available in the Republic of Ireland and what else is coming?                                                                            \t                                                                                    Steady rise in number travelling further than 10km from home                                                                            \t                                                                                    Electric Picnic hopes vaccination programme will allow festival proceed                                                                                                                                                                                                          \tCoronavirus Data Dashboard                                                                      \u201cThis is a temporary health crisis but it needn\u2019t be a permanent economic emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we reach the plateau of those on income support, we hope to bend and lower that curve also \u2013 getting as many back to work as soon as possible, as and when the health environment permits.\u201d                                                        Duplicate claimsThe department added that in total, since mid-March, it had to process applications from 625,000 people for the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment or a jobseeker\u2019s benefit when duplicate claims were excluded.                                                        It said, to date, more than 40,000 people had contacted the department to close their Covid-19 payment. In the majority of such cases employers were taking the individuals back on to their payrolls under the Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme.                                                                                                                                                \u201cHowever, approximately 68,000 payments have been withheld for a variety of reasons. These include the people concerned who were still in employment, who had not been in employment prior to claiming the Covid-19 payment, a temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy was being paid in their name, who were not resident in the State or because they submitted incorrect details including invalid public service personal numbers [PPSNs] and international bank account numbers [Iban],\u201d the department said.                                                        \u201cThe department is continuing to resolve any issues, such as invalid Ibans or PPSNs, with legitimate applications and is contacting the people concerned directly over the next few days.\u201d                                                         It asked that people take care when submitting applications, to ensure that critical information such as dates of birth, PPSNs and Ibans are entered correctly.                                                         The department also said it was aware that \u201csome workers may be incorrectly registered as part of the temporary wage subsidy scheme\u201d or \u201cmay face difficulty in transitioning back from the pandemic unemployment payment to the employer payroll\u201d.                                                         \u201cSuch a situation may arise, for example, because a worker has been registered in error by their employer, or because an employer having registered for the temporary wage subsidy scheme has since ceased operating their payroll, or, due to differences in the weekly payment pattern of the pandemic unemployment payment as compared with a monthly or fortnightly payroll from the employer.                                                         \u201cAny worker

The measures are essential to prevent an economic depression, said Patricia King, general-secretary of Ictu.                                                        \u201cThese wage subsidies will help put workers\u2019 minds at ease and enable them and their families to meet the immediate challenge at hand - beating Covid-19,\u201d she said.                                                        \u201cWe reiterate that the business community stands ready to support whatever measures are required to address this unprecedented health challenge,\u201d said Ibec chief executive Danny McCoy.                                                        The business body also welcomed the confirmation that some manufacturing and other necessary services can remain open if they adhere to social distancing guidelines.                                                        Alongside new public health measures designed to slow the spread of the virus, Mr Varadkar outlined the ways in which the Government will assist people financially through the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                            The new 12-week wage subsidy scheme, which will see the State pay 70 per cent of employees\u2019 wages up to a cap of \u20ac410 per week, will be available to employers who suffer a minimum of 25 per cent decline in turnover or an inability to pay normal wages or other outgoings as a result of coronavirus.                                                        Jobless spikeIt is hoped that this scheme will keep as many people as possible on the payroll, amid fears that the spike in unemployment could be worse than previously expected. Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty said at the Government\u2019s press briefing that her earlier estimate that 400,000 people would lose their jobs now looked \u201cconservative\u201d.                                                                                                                                                However, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys said \u201ckeeping that crucial link between the employer and the employee\u201d would put the State in a better position to recover from economic shutdown, while Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said it was necessary to \u201cact now to avoid an even greater economic challenge in the future\u201d.                                                        The \u20ac350 a week Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment can also be claimed by self-employed people affected by the crisis.                                                        Small Firms Association director Sven Spollen-Behrens said this was important as self-employed people were \u201cexperiencing a significant loss of income\u201d.                                                        Ms King said Ictu would work with the Government and employers to confirm that the scheme supports all affected workers and ensure that employers pay the remaining 30 per cent of workers\u2019 pay.                                                        Restaurants and hotelsThe Restaurants Association of Ireland also welcomed the new measures, including the instruction that cafes and restaurants should move to take-away and delivery options only. It has been urging such an instruction over the past week to protect staff and customers.                                                        The association said it had some concerns about the wage subsidy scheme, saying further clarification was needed about how businesses qualified.                                                        The Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) said the new measures were essential, but were \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d to safeguard the future of the tourism sector, which would require specific assistance.                                                        \u201cCurrent and future bookings vanished in a matter of days,\u201d said IHF president Elaina Fitzgerald Kane.                                                         \u201cRevenues plummeted by up to 100 per cent across the sector with a catastrophic impact on cashflow.

Because of that, she is now lost \u20ac147 per week in welfare - money she says she simply cannot afford as she is \"penniless\".But Ms Coughlan is just one of over 110,000 PUP claimants in this position today.Up to now, all claimants received \u20ac350 a week regardless of their earning before the pandemic - which meant some part time lower paid workers were better off on the Pandemic Payment.Back in April, convenience stores reported that students who had been earning less than \u20ac100 a week for part time shifts had quit to go on the PUP - which was possible because unlike for Jobseekers' Benefit, PUP claimants did not have to prove they had been let go by their employer.However, from today, all those earning below \u20ac200 per week gross before the pandemic struck will see their Pandemic Payment plummet from \u20ac350 per week to \u20ac203 - the equivalent of Jobseekers benefit.We need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

Insofar as possible, we are continuing to collect survey information from businesses so that we can provide statistics that show the changing situation from March 2020 onwards.  We appreciate the ongoing support of the business community and understand the difficulties faced by all.                                                      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou are here:  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHome / Statistics  / Live Register June 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                     \t\t\t\t    PDF - Summary (KB)          PDF - Full (KB)    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \t\t                                  20200702055642            Live Register June 2020            Extra information             StatBank interactive tables:Live Register SeriesMethodology     Previous Releases   International comparison:Eurostat  No link available    See also:Press Statement Live Register June 2020  Information Note on Implications of COVID-19 on the Live Register and the Monthly Unemployment Estimates    YouTube Video              For more information on this release:E-mail: labour@cso.ieCatalina Gonzalez  (+353) 87 646 7535Martina O'Callaghan  (+353) 21 453 5491  For general information on CSO statistics:information@cso.ie  (+353) 21 453 5000On-line ISSN 2009-535X                                                                          COVID-19 Release Information                                     This release was compiled during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The available schemes are being administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) and the Revenue Commissioners. See our InfographicAt the end of June 2020, the majority of those whose income from employment has been affected due to COVID-19 were still being facilitated through the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (438,933 persons) which is administered by the DEASP while a slightly smaller cohort were being facilitated through the Revenue Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme (382,018 persons). See Table A2.The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has worked to identify the detail available from the different sources and how the different schemes should be classified for statistical purposes. There is some overlap between those who meet the criteria to be included on the Live Register and those who are benefitting from either of the two COVID-19 income support schemes. These overlaps occur due to the different frequency of the payments, and the fact that some persons who are included on the Live Register may not be receiving a payment and so might be benefitting from either the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. We have included a total column in the Headline Table above and in Table A2 of this release today which takes account of the overlap and counts each person only once.As users will be aware, the Live Register is a series which is available back to 1967 on the CSO\u2019s StatBank tabular data service. The Live Register series is of immense historical value and the CSO is keen to protect the continuity of the series, while also trying to make as much information as possible available to users, charting the labour market effects of COVID-19 at this time.The CSO published an information note on 1 April 2020 for users on the implications of the COVID-19 emergency payment measures on the Live Register and the Monthly Unemployment Estimates releases. That information note is available here \u00a0Information Note on Implications of COVID-19 on the Live Register and the Monthly Unemployment Estimates.\u00a0 The information note outlines why those in receipt of the COVID-19 income support payments are not included on the Live Register unless they meet the usual criteria to be included on the Live Register. Thus, the Live Register has been compiled in the traditional way and the usual tables are included below. The detailed commentary usually provided on the Live Register tables has not been included here but can be made available to users on request to labour@cso.ie.The unadjusted number of persons on the Live Register in June 2020 published here includes a small number of applicants for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment who have been advised to apply for jobseekers benefits if they have a dependant adult and at least one child, or four or more children in the case of no dependant adult. At this stage it is not possible for the CSO to quantify the number of those claimants; the Live Register totals for June 2020 may be revised should more information become available later.\tThe Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.\u00a0 It includes part-time workers (those who work up to three days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit (JB) or Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JA).\u00a0 Unemployment is measured by the Labour Force Survey.The Monthly Unemployment Rate (seasonally adjusted) is published in the\u00a0Monthly Unemployment\u00a0release.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The unadjusted Live Register total for June 2020 was 220,871 persons; this consisted of 121,108 males (54.8%) \u00a0and 99,763 females (45.2%). Of those on the Live Register for June 2020, 29,579, or 13.4%, are under 25 years of age, while 191,292, or 86.6%, are 25 years of age and over. See Table 1a.On an adjusted basis, the number of male and female claimants on the Live Register were 118,800 and 94,900 representing 55.6% and 44.4% of the seasonally adjusted Live Register total respectively. See Table 2a.A total of 438,933 persons were in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for the last week of June 2020; this consisted of 225,095 males (51.3%) and 213,838 females (48.7%). Of those claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, 96,023 or 21.9%, are under 25 years of age, while 342,910 or 78.1%, are 25 years of age and over. See Table A2.There were 382,018 persons benefitting from the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme at the end of June 2020 with 223,399 males and 158,619 females representing 58.5% and 41.5% of the total respectively. Of those benefitting from the Temporary Wage Subside Scheme, 47,838 (12.5%) are under 25 years of age, while 334,180 (87.5%) are 25 years of age and over. See Table A2.A total of 1,002,470 persons were either on the Live Register for June 2020 or benefitted from either the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme in June 2020. See Table A2.The Central Statistics Office (CSO) have worked with both the DEASP and the Revenue Commissioners to meet user needs for availability of more detailed aggregates for the recipients of both the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme respectively. Tables providing the breakdowns of the numbers receiving the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme for each week by sex, age group, county and nationality grouping are available at the following link: Detailed COVID-19 Tables. This link also contains tables for the corresponding numbers included on the Live Register for each week as well as a total number of persons with overlaps removed who are either on the Live Register for each week or who were benefitting from either the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The CSO will continue to work with both DEASP and the Revenue Commissioners to update these tables on a weekly basis and to make any additional relevant breakdowns relating to the schemes available at the link above.The Labour Market Analysis area of the CSO are compiling a mailing list of users who wish to register their interest in being kept informed of Labour Market related updates from the CSO. These email updates will include advising users of any updates to the aggregate tables available at the link above. If you wish to be included in this mailing list please email labour@cso.ie and ask for your email address to be included on the mailing list. null           \tDuration\tLess than one year\tOne year or

Persons aged 65 years can remain on a Jobseeker scheme up to their next birthday but are not included in the Live Register.Prior to January 2017, the DEASP provided tabulated claimant counts directly to the CSO to facilitate production of the Live Register. These claimant counts were grouped by age, gender, occupation, nationality, duration, region, county and local welfare office. Data provided in this fashion is available from 1967 to December 2016.Beginning with January 2017, the Live Register has been produced using claimant microdata from the DEASP Integrated Short Term Scheme (ISTS) database. Claimants are determined to be on the Live Register if they fulfil the Live Register criteria and such persons are summarised and cross-tabulated to produce the counts published in the Live Register release. As claimant count microdata was retrospectively available to January 2012, previously published Live Register data for this period were revised with data produced from the claimant microdata. These revisions were generally minor in nature and are included in this release as well as all relevant Statbank tables.Source and scope of the\u00a0Pandemic Unemployment PaymentThe Pandemic Unemployment Payment is a scheme set up by the Government in response to the loss of income for those whose employment had been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.\u00a0It is compiled from returns made to the Central Statistics Office by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP). Payments under the scheme commenced on the week ending March 22nd 2020, and will be reported under the Live Register release while the scheme is in place.\u00a0Source and scope of the\u00a0Temporary Wage Subsidy SchemeThe\u00a0Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme is another scheme set up by the Government in response to the loss of income for those whose employment had been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.\u00a0It is compiled from returns made to the Central Statistics Office by the\u00a0Revenue Commissioners. Refunds are issued to employers registered under the scheme, who in turn pay their employees. The figures in this release reflect the number of persons receiving a payment under the scheme based on the pay date of the employee and will be reported a weekly basis as well as a monthly cumulative. Refunds under the scheme commenced on the week ending March 28th 2020, but might\u00a0refer to earlier pay dates.\u00a0Please see Detailed COVID-19 Income Support and Live Register TablesReference PeriodsThe reference periods for the Live Register\u00a0and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (where applicable) results are as followsJune 2020 - 1 June to 28 June 2020May\u00a02020 \u2013 4 May 2020\u00a0to 31 May 2020April 2020 - 30 March 2020 to 3 May 2020March 2020 -2 March 2020 to 29 March 2020June\u00a02019 - 3 June 2019 to 30 June 2019From May 2015 (reference period) the reference\u00a0period for the Live Register refers to the week of the last Thursday in the month, previously the reference\u00a0period\u00a0referred to the week of\u00a0the last Friday in the month.The Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.\u00a0 It includes part-time (those who work up to three days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Allowance and or Jobseekers Benefit.\u00a0 Monthly unemployment is measured by the Monthly Unemployment release and quarterly unemployment is measured by the Labour Force Survey (formerly the Quarterly National Household Survey).The reference Period for the Temporary Wage Subsidy scheme as reported in this release on a monthly basis is as follows:June 2020 - 1 June to 28 June 2020May\u00a02020 \u2013 4 May 2020\u00a0to 31 May 2020April 2020 - 30 March 2020 to 3 May 2020March 2020 -2 March 2020 to 29 March 2020The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme is also reported on a weekly basis here:\u00a0\u00a0Detailed COVID-19 Income Support and Live Register TablesThe Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.\u00a0 It includes part-time (those who work up to three days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Allowance and or Jobseekers Benefit.\u00a0\u00a0Monthly unemployment is measured by the Monthly Unemployment release and quarterly\u00a0unemployment is measured\u00a0by the Labour Force Survey\u00a0(formerly the Quarterly National Household Survey).Standardised unemployment ratesThe Standardised Unemployment Rate (SUR) series, previously in Table 3, has been discontinued from May 2015. It has been replaced by the\u00a0Monthly Unemployment\u00a0series,\u00a0which is published two days before the Live Register.Labour Force Survey\u00a0The Labour Force Survey (LFS), was launched in January 2018 with the publication of Quarter 3 2017 data (Q3 2017). The Labour Force survey replaced the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS).The LFS provides quarterly estimates of the unemployment rate.The calendar reference quarters for survey results are:Q1 - January to March, Q2 - April to June, Q3 - July to September and Q4 - October to December.Seasonal AdjustmentSince January 2011 the seasonal adjustment of the Live Register is completed by applying the X-12-ARIMA model, developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. Seasonal adjustment is conducted using the indirect approach, where each individual series is independently adjusted (male under 25 years, female under 25 years, male 25 years and over and female 25 years and over). To preserve consistency between the individual and aggregate series, the series for gender, age group and total Live Register are then created from these four component series.The X-12 ARIMA method has the X-11 moving averages process at its core, but builds on this by providing options for pre-treating the series using a regARIMA approach for prior adjustment and series extension. In essence this methodology will estimate seasonal factors while taking account of temporary changes, outliers, level shifts and calendar effects (e.g timing of Easter).All Live Register series are updated monthly with the latest three years of seasonally adjusted data as part of the concurrent approach. The comprehensive annual review contains revisions to the entire series. Revisions to the series are typically very minor in scale.Seasonally adjusting the Live Register series during the Covid-19 crisis period will be challenging until the scale and shape of its impact on the time series is better understood. This initial seasonally adjusted result might be revised for some months ahead as future observations become available. Users should be aware that there is increases uncertainty around the seasonally adjusted figures during this period.For additional information on the use of X-12-ARIMA see detailed note in the January 2011 Live Register release.Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit DurationPrior to 19 January 2004 Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit was payable for 15 months (390 days).From 19 January 2004, Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit could be paid for a maximum of 15 months (390 days) to people who had at least 260 paid PRSI contributions.\u00a0 Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit could be paid for a maximum of 12 months (312 days) to people who had less than 260 paid contributions (Refers to new claims).From 15 October 2008, Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit could be paid for a maximum of 12 months (312 days) to people who had at least 260 paid PRSI contributions.\u00a0 Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit could be paid for a maximum of 9 months (234 days) to people who had less than 260 paid contributions.As of 3 April 2013, Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit can be paid for a maximum of 9 months (234 days) to people who have 260 paid PRSI contributions. Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit can be paid for a maximum of 6 months (156 days) to people who have less than 260 paid contributions (Refers to new claims).Claimants getting Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit for 6 months or more on 3 April 2013 (or 3 months for people with fewer than 260 contributions) will not be affected.One-Parent Family Payment (OFP)The One-Parent Family Payment is a social welfare payment for men and women who are younger than 66 and bring up children without the support of a partner and meet certain other criteria. Claimants on this scheme are not counted as part of the Live Register.From July 2013 new rules came into operation reducing the age limits for the One-Parent Family Payment. This means that some people no longer qualify for the payment and may avail of other schemes or supports.As a consequence, approximately 2,800 people in July 2013, 1,300 people in July 2014 and 2,786 people in July 2015, previously receiving the One-Parent Family Payment, made a claim for Jobseekers Allowance (JA) and will therefore appear on the Live Register.For information on the age-related changes to the OFP scheme from July 2013, please see the following link to the DEASP website:http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/278_One-Parent-Family-Payment.aspxLive Register FlowsLive Register flows are calculated by analysing persons on the Live Register in the reference week of the reference month compared to those on the Live Register in the reference week of the previous month. The flows are calculated as follows:Joined Live Register: Persons on the Live Register in the reference week of the current month who were not present on the Live Register in the reference week of the previous month.Stayed on Live Register: Persons on the Live Register in the reference week of the current month who were also present on the Live Register in the reference week of the previous month.Left Live Register: Persons not on the Live Register in the reference week of the current month who were present on the Live Register in the reference week of the previous month.Inflows and outflows published in this release relate to persons moving on or off the Live Register. Inter-scheme movement is not counted as a Live Register flow. For example, if a claimant exhausts his/her entitlement to JB and opens a new JA claim, this is not counted as an outflow in JB and an inflow in JA. The person has moved scheme but has not joined nor left the Live Register. Thus, those persons who move schemes from one month to the next are counted as \u201cStayed on the Live Register\u201d.Live Register Area AnalysisThe basis of the area analysis in Live Register statistics is the DEASP local office of registration.\u00a0 The areas served by Local Employment Offices do not correspond to specific geographic boundaries.\u00a0 Therefore, registrants at a given local office do not necessarily come from a particular region or area which can be precisely delineated e.g. data for the Cork City Local Offices of Registration refers to all persons signing on in Cork City but may include persons not resident in Cork City.\u00a0From January 2018, registrations which have yet not being assigned to a DEASP local office of registration are included in the Live Register totals. Therefore as these registrations are not included in the regional breakdowns, the sum of these regions may not add to the Live Register totals.The latest available Live Register data by Province, County and Local Office of Registration are published on the CSO website, through the CSO StatBank, on the publication of this release, see link here.\u00a0NUTS2 and NUTS3 regionsThe regional classifications in this release is based on the NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units) classification used by Eurostat. Until Q4 2017, the NUTS3 regions corresponded to the eight Regional Authorities established under the Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993, which came into operation on 1 January 1994 while the NUTS2 regions, which were proposed by Government and agreed by Eurostat in 1999, were groupings of those historic NUTS3 regions.However, the NUTS3 boundaries were amended on 21st\u00a0of November 2016 under Regulation (EC) No. 2066/2016 and have come into force from Q1 2018. These new groupings are reflected in the LFS results from Q1 2018 onwards. The changes resulting from the amendment are that County Louth has moved from the Border to the Mid-East and what was formerly South Tipperary has moved from the South-East to the Mid-West, resulting in the new NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions:\tNorthern & Western NUTS2 Region\tSouthern NUTS2 Region\tEastern & Midland NUTS2 Region\tBorder\tCavan\tMid-West\tClare\tDublin\tDublin City\t\u00a0\tDonegal\t\u00a0\tLimerick City & County\t\u00a0\tDun Laoghaire-Rathdown\t\u00a0\tLeitrim\t\u00a0\tTipperary\t\u00a0\tFingal\t\u00a0\tMonaghan\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\tSouth Dublin\t\u00a0\tSligo\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\tSouth-East\tCarlow\tMid-East\tKildare\tWest\tGalway City\t\u00a0\tKilkenny\t\u00a0\tMeath\t\u00a0\tGalway County\t\u00a0\tWaterford City & County\t\u00a0\tWicklow\t\u00a0\tMayo\t\u00a0\tWexford\t\u00a0\tLouth\t\u00a0\tRoscommon\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\tMidland\tLaois\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\tSouth-West\tCork City\t\u00a0\tLongford\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\tCork County\t\u00a0\tOffaly\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\tKerry\t\u00a0\tWestmeath\u00a0OccupationsLive Register occupational data is sourced from information collected by the DEASP on the most recent occupation of claimants when they sign on the Live Register.\u00a0 The classification used is based on the UK Standard Occupational Classification (SOC).\u00a0 \u201cNo occupation\u201d is an additional category and includes those who have never worked and those who have no stated occupation.Age by Duration AnalysisDetailed tables relating to regional and scheme data are available on the CSO website through the CSO Main Data Dissemination Service, StatBank, to see these please click\u00a0hereCasual and part-time workersThe number of claimants on the Live Register who work on a casual and /or part-time basis is supplied by the DEASP.

The number of people receiving a PUP payment this week represents an increase of 57,928 on the 277,671 people paid on Tuesday 22 December.                The sector with the highest number of people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is Accommodation and Food Service Activities (97,798) followed by Wholesale and Retail Trade (46,853) and Other Sectors, for example hairdressing and beauty salons (30,221).                These figures are in addition to the 194,058 people who were reported on the Live Register as of the end of November.                All COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payments issued will be in recipients\u2019 bank accounts or at their post office today, Tuesday 5 January.                In the period from 18 December to 24 December, the department processed some 23,000 PUP applications for workers who were laid off between those dates. Those eligible received their first payment over the Christmas period.                Anyone who has been made unemployed between Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Eve and who is eligible for PUP will receive their payment today.                Speaking today, Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys said:                            \u201cIt has been a really difficult Christmas period for people who lost their employment due to the move to Level 5 restrictions.                                     \u201cAs anticipated we have seen a significant increase in the number of people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment since 22 December.                                     \u201cEvery county has seen the number of people applying for PUP increase over the past two weeks and, similarly, there has been an increase in every sector applying for the payment over this period.                                    \u201cMy department officials worked right throughout the Christmas period in order to ensure people who applied for PUP were paid as soon as possible. Between 18 December and Christmas Eve, some 23,000 payments were processed and put into payment. People who lost their job between Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Eve will receive their first payment today.                                    \u201cPUP remains open to anyone who is eligible. The quickest and easiest way to apply is via www.mywelfare.ie.\u201d                        Minister Humphreys continued:                            \u201cThe Pandemic Unemployment Payment has proven to be an important financial lifeline for hundreds of thousands of workers since its introduction in March. To date, over \u20ac5 billion has been paid out in order to support workers and their families throughout this pandemic.                                    \u201cAs we move into January and with a difficult period ahead, I would plead with everyone to make every effort possible to suppress the virus.                                    \u201cBy staying home as much as possible, adhering to social distancing, washing our hands and limiting our contacts, we are lessening the spread of the virus and easing the pressure on our frontline workers.                                    \u201cIt is within our gift to get the COVID-19 figures down. We have done it before and I know we have it in us to do it again.\u201d                                                                Self-employed people and PUP                        Self-employed people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) who are looking to maintain their business can now earn up to \u20ac960 over an eight week period, while retaining their full PUP entitlement.                 There is no formal application process and a self-employed person simply needs to inform the department if they earn over \u20ac960 in any eight week period.

Control Measures                        The department conducts a series of pre and post payment checks on all PUP claims. Subject to these checks being cleared the department then processes payments based on the clients\u2019 self-declaration.                Subsequently, the department runs post payment checks that includes verifying data against Revenue records, examining cases where the same Bank account is used multiple times, examining cases where employer or members of the public report concerns, use of data analytics to identify and check claims. We also undertake employer inspections.                 This work is undertaken by the department\u2019s Special Investigation Unit, which, for the past six years, includes over 20 Garda\u00ed on secondment to the department.                                                        COVID-19 Enhanced Illness Benefit Payment                        Since March, a cumulative total of 98,009 people under the age of 66 have been medically certified for receipt of the COVID-19 Enhanced Illness Benefit.                Today, some 1,661 people are currently in receipt of an Enhanced Illness Benefit payment. Full details are at Appendices 9, 10 and 11. It is expected that these numbers will increase substantially in the coming days and weeks as the number of people contracting the virus soars.

The Working Paper was prepared by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in collaboration with the Central Bank of Ireland for consideration by the Labour Market Advisory Council.                                 The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the essential public health measures to contain the spread of the virus, saw the largest monthly increase in the unemployment rate in the history of the State.                Currently, more than 1.1 million people are in receipt of social welfare unemployment supports which comprises:                \tpeople on the Live Register\tpeople receiving the newly introduced COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP)\temployers availing of the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)                                 Minister Doherty emphasised:                            \u201cThese income supports were rolled out in a very short period of time and have proven to be effective in insulating people from the worst effects of a severe income and employment shock. Now, as the numbers receiving payments begins to plateau, we need to start looking at how we get people back to work and concentrate on post-pandemic planning. Today\u2019s research is part of that work.\u201d                        Minister Doherty outlined the purpose of the Working Paper:                            \u201cEssentially, the Working Paper uses Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection administrative data to examine disruptions to Ireland\u2019s labour market \u2013 including the flows into unemployment \u2013 in the weeks since the initial outbreak of the virus in Europe.                                    \u201cIt sheds light on the profile and characteristics of those who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic and associated restrictions. The demographic and earnings profile of the sectors experiencing the largest share of COVID-19 related unemployment, as well as the financial position of households in the most affected sectors, is also investigated.\u201d                        On the basis of jobs lost (or displaced), the most severely impacted sectors are Tourism, Hospitality and Food Services; Retail; and Construction.                 Those who have lost their jobs as a result of the impact of COVID-19 are more likely to be young, low-skilled, female and previously in part-time employment. This reflects the higher share of these workers in the industry sectors most affected (Retail and Hospitality).                                 An examination of the financial position of households of those previously employed in sectors where the fall in employment has been 25 per cent or more has found that these households have very little savings or income put by to mitigate against economic shocks or financial hardship.                                 Minister Doherty commented:                            \u201cThe valuable work of the Labour Market Advisory Council and the findings of today\u2019s Working Paper will help inform this Department and the Government for the post-pandemic recovery period, to ensure that Ireland\u2019s labour market will recover quickly and that the thousands of workers displaced can return to work as quickly as possible.\u201d                        The Working Paper on the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Ireland\u2019s labour market can be viewed here:                                                        The Initial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Ireland's Labour Market                        Download                                         ENDS                                                        Notes to the Editor:                        The role of the Labour Market Advisory Council is to provide advice to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the government on labour force participation rates, minimising unemployment levels and reducing average unemployment durations.                                 The Council will publish its findings on a periodic basis and against the ongoing backdrop of the COVID-19 emergency will now also advise on the wider labour market and employment policy challenges that face the Irish economy in the post-pandemic recovery period.
