Acutely recognising that areas such as Tourism and Culture are a \u201cfundamental expression of who we are as a nation\u201d, the Minister \u2013 who took office in June \u2013 has put key supports in place for these essential industries during her first six months in office. Measures include:                July Jobs Stimulus The wide-ranging suite of measures, agreed at Cabinet level, unveiled grants and supports for the sectors. Notable announcements included: the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme; an additional \u20ac300m for the ReStart Grant Scheme for tourism businesses; the announcement of a Stay and Spend programme to encourage tourist spending; and funding for the audiovisual sector and the Culture Fund.                 October Budget                 Minister Martin and the Minister of State for Sport and An Ghaeltacht, Jack Chambers TD, announced a strong package of supports as part of an unprecedented total 1.08bn Budget for 2021. For the first time, the government provided support for live entertainment in the amount of \u20ac50m.The enlarged Department\u2019s two new areas \u2013 sport and tourism \u2013 received strong boosts, notably a new \u20ac55m support fund for strategic tourism businesses and a reduction in VAT in the sector to 9%. A new COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) offered rebates of up to \u20ac5,000 a week to hospitality, accommodation and arts businesses impacted by the pandemic.                 Other measures:                 \u2022\t\u20ac130m for the Arts Council \u2013 a record level                \u2022\tOver \u20ac78m funding allocation for Gaeltacht and Irish language sector \u2013 up \u20ac14.8m on initial 2020 allocation                \u2022\tFunding for TG4 up to \u20ac40.733m                \u2022\tSport Ireland allocated \u20ac104.5m \u2013 up \u20ac36m                Arts and Culture have been hard hit by COVID-19, a fact recognised by the Minister with a series of funding supports throughout the year. Arts and Culture. Combined with funding from the July Jobs Stimulus package, this additional funding announcement brought to \u20ac56m the overall support for arts and culture in the early autumn.                Night-Time Economy TaskforceAnnounced in July, the Taskforce sees a range of Departments, Agencies and groups working together to promote and develop a vibrant and sustainable night-time culture and economy.                \u20ac6m Live Performance Support Scheme Allocation of \u20ac5m under the \u201cLive Performance Support Scheme\u201d to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries, plus a \u20ac1m Music Stimulus Package. Some 184 musicians/bands were initially awarded a total of \u20ac896,000 to assist them to record singles, EPs and albums. The overall Music Industry Stimulus Package  was then increased to \u20ac1.7m due to an exceptional number of applications from musicians and the funds also covered 79song writing camps and 56 new album releases                Separately, 59 organisations benefited from the Live Performance Support scheme. Recipients included small to large venues, producers and promoters, with grants ranging from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac400,000.                 The Department has also played its part in backing creativity to light up the darkness. It has supported the Hot Press Y&E Series, which saw 40 Young and Emerging Series artists perform online to fans in Ireland and around the world in a series of concerts.                Support for the Other Voices programme of concerts and events emphasises the Department\u2019s commitment to helping wellbeing through a range of initiatives including cultural content.                Culture Ireland\u2019s Ireland Performs, in association with Facebook Ireland, showcased the best of Irish artistry through virtual events and music sessions, again supporting wellbeing, while Creative Ireland\u2019s Cruinni\u00fa na n\u00d3g saw one of our most cherished resources \u2013 our young \u2013 showcase their creativity in a summer\u2019s day of imagination and talent.                The Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce has kept the Minister briefed on the situation in the sector, after the announcement of the formation of the cross-industry body, chaired by Clare Duignan.                 Despite the importance of tackling the conditions created by COVID-19, the Minister has continued to emphasise that better days lie ahead. The appointment of Cultural Officers in London and New York, under the  Government's Global Ireland 2025 strategy, was a key statement of intent. The officers will play a vital role in widening and deepening Ireland\u2019s global cultural presence and engagement in the months and years ahead.                 Also looking to the future, Minister Martin has held high-level talks with EU Ministers for Culture and proposed Europe-wide concerts to mark the reopening of live performances.                 Participation is a key pillar of the vision for areas such as culture and sport. The Minister announced a \u20ac500,000 investment in the Creative Ireland Programme\u2019s new Creativity in Older Age Programme to emphasise that the arts is for all of us.                 Despite COVID-19, all areas have been working resolutely to ensure that the show goes on \u2013 virtually. Funding for Galway 2020's revised online programme saw 28 projects and over 350 artists supported.                 In Tourism, the Tourism Recovery Taskforce submitted a Recovery Planto the Minister detailing a number of recommendations to help the sector survive and recover from the pandemic. These recommendations were an important input into the Minister\u2019s deliberations for the Budget. Minister Martin subsequently appointed a Recovery Oversight Group to oversee the implementation of agreed recommendations of the Taskforce and monitor the sector\u2019s recovery from COVID-19.                 One of the key Budgetary measures to support tourism was the Stay and Spend Scheme, launched by An Taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin TD, the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe TD, and Minister Martin.                 Minister Martin addressed European Tourism Ministers in September, where she discussed developing more sustainable tourism policies, the safe return of international travel and allowing the maximum flexibility possible in State Aids rules, to enable Member States provide timely and appropriate supports for tourism.                 A cut in the VAT rate for the sector to 9% was also secured by Minister Martin in the Budget after a recommendation for such from the Taskforce.                 Sport is crucial to our wellbeing, both physically and mentally. As with other areas under the Department, participation and equality are key. This year\u2019s All Ireland games have brought joy to many. The success of Sam Bennett in the Tour de France, and the dedication of teams such as the Irish Women\u2019s soccer squad, have proved inspirational in a time of uncertainty.                 The Government, and the Department, have supported our sporting bodies. In November, the Ministers announced an unprecedented funding package of \u20ac85 million to support the sport sector (IRFU, GAA, FAI, National Governing Bodies of Sport, clubs and communities) . The Return to Sport Expert Group has been liaising with health authorities throughout, to ensure that this key component of Ireland\u2019s social fabric returns and reopens on a safe and sustainable footing.                The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme has helped clubs and associations, big and small, over the years. The 2020 programme has funding of \u20ac40m to help clubs in their vital work.                 Participation received a boost, too, in September, with the announcement of an investment package of \u20ac7.3m in Dormant Accounts Funding for a wide range of sport and physical activity measures countrywide. The investment focuses on people with disabilities, people who are educationally disadvantaged and from disadvantaged communities.                 In a further support for the sector, both Ministers announced a \u20ac2.5 million funding package for swimming pool operators across the country.                 As with arts and culture, both Ministers are looking to the future of sport while dealing with the pressures of the present. Minister Chambers addressed European Sports Ministers in December, where he discussed the safe return of spectators to sport as well as the prevailing Covid challenges to the sector.                 A key mission of the Department is to support the Irish language and to strengthen its use as the principal community language of the Gaeltacht. The Budget agreed a  \u20ac78m-plus funding allocation for the Gaeltacht and Irish language sector \u2013 an increase of \u20ac14.8m on the initial 2020 allocation.                It also announced total funding of \u20ac31.8m for \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta to help protect client companies from full impacts of Brexit and COVID-19.                There was also a first programme funding increase since 2016 for An Foras Teanga.                 Recognising the importance of storytellers, musicians and other artists, \u20ac280,000 was awarded to 57 Gaeltacht artists.                In December, Minister Chambers also announced the approval of a language plan for an tEachr\u00e9idh, Co. Galway, under the language planning process. An annual allowance of up to \u20ac100,000 will be allocated, allowing the Eachr\u00e9idh Language Plan Committee to employ a Language Planning Officer to help implement the language plan in the area.                Day-to-day commerce is crucial for the language, with Minister Martin and Minister of State Chambers collaborating with Minister of State Malcolm Noonan to announce additional supports for Irish language restoration works on traditional shopfronts.                 In their commitment to community, Ministers Martin and Chambers also announced total funding of \u20ac660,000 for capital projects in Gaeltacht areas, funding which will be used by clubs and associations to support their endeavours.                  The development of the language in the digital age was recognised in a Government report revealing progress of 2018-2022 Action Plan to promote the Irish language. Both Ministers noted the \u201csignificant progress\u201d in supporting the language which was reflected in the report.                 The Ireland of a century ago saw some of its darkest days. The Ireland of today is working to combat some of its most difficult times since then. Despite these considerable challenges, there is time \u2013 and motivation \u2013 to reflect. Minister Martin announced funding of \u20ac1.75 million for local authorities in 2021 to support their leading role in developing community-led commemorative activities for the final phase of the Decade of Centenaries Programme.                 The move followed increased funding in the Budget to allow for the appropriate commemoration of the centenary of events leading to the foundation of the State.                Under its new Media functions, the Department now holds responsibility for the development of the legislative and regulatory framework for broadcasting and for certain media in Ireland. It is also responsible for policy in relation to the funding of the public service broadcasters, RT\u00c9 and TG4, and the development of the broadcasting sector in general.                \u2022\tSupplementary funding of \u20ac1.9m was provided to TG4 in 2020 related to the additional COVID-19 programming costs, not least C\u00fala4 ar Scoil.                \u2022\tAdditional funding of \u20ac3.5m was secured in the budget for TG4 to bring its total exchequer funding to \u20ac40.733m in 2021 which will ensure that it continues to provide high quality and innovative Irish language and programming and better implement the strategy to attract and retain younger audiences across all platforms.                   \u2022\t\u20ac2m was provided under the July Stimulus for the BAI Sound and Vision Scheme to support broadcasters and independent producers.                \u2022\tA further \u20ac4.9m was provided to BAI in December to support local radio and audiovisual production that supports the live music sector.                 Recognising that \"it is important that national events which are of great importance to Ireland be shown free to air for us all to enjoy\u201d, Minister Martin has opened a public consultation on the designation of sporting and other events as being of major importance to society.                 The Minister also presented additions to the new law proposed for online safety and media regulation.                 These will further help avoid the spread of harmful content by allowing for substantial fines against companies or platforms and by ensuring senior management are held responsible.                Furthermore, the legislation will implement an EU directive to ensure standards for video on-demand content is brought into line with TV broadcasting regulations.                 The sector\u2019s future is also the subject of The Future of Media Commission, which will chart a pathway for public service broadcasting and independent media.                 Reflecting on her first six months as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin said: \u201cThe past six months have been difficult for the nation, with much of that pressure felt in areas overseen by my Department. It\u2019s been a challenging time, but a challenge I\u2019ve willingly accepted.                 \u201cSupports in place have enabled those in the artistic and Gaeltacht communities and tourism sector to survive. Our sports, though devoid of spectators, have managed to bring much-needed joy to the nation through our media. \u201cThere is a sense of hope. And the recent call to action from Tourism Ireland signals the message that our country will go back to hosting the world and also entertaining it through our rich heritage, artists and ambassadors.                \u201cThe Decade of Centenaries reminds us of the key and historic events of 100 years ago \u2013 events that would later gave birth to a strong, proud nation. Just like we overcame that chequered past, I have no doubt that history will repeat itself and we will have greater days ahead.                \u201cI am committed to doing my best to ensure sectors overseen by my Department are centre stage in the recovery. And I know the agencies under my remit - in this time of crisis - will rise to the challenge of reaffirming what is best about us as people in the year ahead.\u201d                 The Minister of State for Sport and An Ghaeltacht, Jack Chambers, said: \u201cThe Gaeltacht and sports worlds have faced huge tests this year, and I commend them for their resilience in the face of such adversity. Such resilience has required support in tandem, and I am happy to have been part of that mission to put their issues front and centre.                 \u201cEarlier this year, my Department implemented a COVID-19 support package worth \u20ac4.7m aimed at ensuring the maintenance of the Irish summer colleges sector. In  July we announced an additional \u20ac8m for \u00dadar\u00e1s Na Gaeltachta, bringing the total capital allocation to \u20ac18m. This extra funding is supporting a range of capital investments which will enhance an t\u00dadar\u00e1s\u2019 capacity to support local enterprises and is creating 40-50 new construction jobs. It is expected that the investment will support the creation of 320 new longer-term jobs.                \u201cThis year has seen also increased funding for the language planning process and the Gaeltacht Community and Language Supports Programme. In addition to this, further funding of \u20ac250,000 has been be provided to Eala\u00edn na Gaeltachta to provide a significant number of bursaries for Gaeltacht-based artists.                \u201cLikewise, sport is part of what we are as a nation. I am delighted that the All Ireland Championships \u2013 for men and women \u2013 have continued to delight us as we wear our respective colours and cheer on our heroes from afar. But supporting sport wasn\u2019t just about investment in the main bodies of the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU, it was also ensuring that everyone has a chance to shine at whatever level they choose.                 \u201cThe Sports Capital and Equipment Programme is open to all clubs, big and small, while the dormant accounts funding is particularly focusing on areas of disadvantage.

Recognising the continually changing landscape, an Emergency Fund to the value of \u20ac5.8 million has been ring-fenced to offset losses incurred by sports organisations during the current Level 5 restrictions and the remaining period of 2020. Sport Ireland was in a position to meet the requests of National Governing Bodies for their club networks to the tune of \u20ac9.7 million, allowing an additional \u20ac5 million to be invested in the GAA, IRFU and FAI club networks.Additional Funding for Gaelic GamesIn addition to the Covid-19 fund, the Government has allocated an additional \u20ac15 million to GAA, Camogie Association and Ladies Gaelic Football Association specifically for the running of the Inter-County Championships. Minister Martin said: \u201cThe Government recognises the vital contribution that sport has made to public health throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. While it is appreciated that this is a difficult time for sports organisations and individuals alike, sport has continued to respond and react to the evolving situation through innovative ways in keeping people engaged and active. The funding allocated by Sport Ireland today will protect the national sporting infrastructure and provide financial stability to the sector in the uncertain months ahead. Earlier this month I announced a significant increase in the budget for sport in 2021, which will provide further resilience to the sport sector as we look to emerge from the current crisis.\u201d                                                            The funding allocated by Sport Ireland today will protect the national sporting infrastructure and provide financial stability to the sector in the uncertain months ahead                      Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport & Media, Catherine Martin TD                                                 Minister Chambers added: \u201cSport has demonstrated its resilience throughout the ongoing pandemic. It is important that this resilience continues into the weeks and months ahead as we look to emerge from this crisis. The funding announced today will assist our sporting organisations and clubs in getting everyone active and keeping them active. This has never been more important and is essential for our physical and mental wellbeing. As we look to the future, it will ensure our high performance athletes and teams are as well prepared as possible ahead of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. Similarly, it is vital that sports organisations are ready to return to activity as soon as public health circumstances allow.\u00a0 \u201dKey to the schemes is support of grassroots across the country through schemes delivered through Sport Ireland\u2019s network of Local Sports Partnerships and through National Governing Bodies. Approximately \u20ac20 million will benefit thousands of clubs through the various schemes.Chairman of Sport Ireland, Kieran Mulvey, commented: \u201cThe \u00a0funding being allocated today will provide relief for funded bodies and club. It will provide much needed financial stability to the entire sector and has given organisations the confidence to continue trading through these difficult times. The funding recognises the wider economic and social impact of sport and the significant costs arising from the real threat of insolvency to sporting bodies. The needs of the disability sector were specifically addressed with a dedicated group being established to examine any particular issues arising during the Covid-19 pandemic; this has been recognised in our funding allocations. While the circumstances are unfortunate, Sport Ireland\u2019s investment in 2020 is the largest ever investment package for sport. The recent budget announcement by the Ministers has reinforced that sense of confidence that support is available and we look forward to working with our funded bodies to address their needs in 2021.\u201dIt has been recognised that the changing environment of restrictions has resulted in uncertainty and difficulty in planning for National Governing Bodies. This has been taken into consideration by Sport Ireland with funds being ring-fenced specifically to the address this issue. Chief Executive of Sport Ireland, John Treacy, said: \u201cThe initial schemes announced in June were designed to support Organisations with Covid-19 related losses in 2020. However, having engaged with our funded bodies, we understand that the current Level 5 restrictions present additional challenges. As such, we are ring-fencing finances to address any immediate needs that may arise in the sector in the coming weeks. Sport has shown itself to be incredibly resilient throughout the Covid-19 restrictions having made a critical contribution to Irish life with more people being active than ever before. Through exemptions put in place by Government, we have been able to follow high performance and professional athletes and teams, which has provided a welcome lift to the nation. We look forward to working with the sector in the challenging weeks and months ahead, and will continue to provide ongoing support.\u201d                                                      Notes on Funding Schemes:Scheme 1: FAI, IRFU & GAAThe combined support being provided to the family of Gaelic Games (GAA, Camogie & Ladies Gaelic Football) through the Covid-19 scheme is in excess of \u20ac15 million. Together with the additional Government allocation of \u20ac15 million for Inter-County Championships, overall support will be almost \u20ac31 million.The funding provided to the IRFU will address all aspects of the game \u2013 NGB, Provinces & club network.Funding being provided to the FAI will include a ring-fenced amount to support clubs.\u00a0Scheme 2: National Governing Body Resilience Fund20 National Governing Bodies will be supported with in excess of \u20ac5 million to offset 2020 losses. Broadly, this funding encompasses the loss of income from events, ticket sales, sponsorship, affiliation & membership fees, courses and services and the additional costs arising from the implementation of social distancing and Covid-19 protocols.\u00a0Scheme 3: Club Resilience FundThe Club Resilience Fund supports Sports Clubs that find themselves in need of assistance due to Covid-19. NGBs could elect to apply for funding directly on behalf of affiliated Clubs. Alternatively, NGBs provided an estimated level of support required for their club network and propose to run a Covid-19 Club Support Grant Scheme directly. It is recognised that any of the challenges faced by Governing Bodies are replicated across their club network with income from affiliation & membership fees, events, competition, coaching courses and ancillary services all reduced. The additional costs arising from the implementation of social distancing and Covid-19 protocols have also had a significant impact on most club activities where the sharing of equipment, facilities and resources is common place. Sport Ireland will not fund Clubs, Affiliates, Provinces or Branches directly and funding will be accessed through programmes established by each of the National Governing Bodies in receipt of funding.\u00a0Scheme 4: Restart & Renewal FundScheme four \u2013 LSP small grants 1.9m supporting over 1600 clubs, dedicated funding for Disability and Older Adults, Broad range of Innovative and restart projects supported through LSPs/NGBs.A Sports Restart and Renewal Fund of up to \u20ac5 million has been made available to support four primary focus areas:1) An LSP Led Small Grants Scheme 2) A Disability Sport Support Scheme 3) Older Adults4) A Sports Innovation Fund\u00a0LSP Small Grant Scheme Through this scheme, Local Sports Partnerships were encouraged to operate a local scheme for small clubs and community groups similar to the national club scheme (Scheme Three). These schemes provide an additional mechanism to support community groups & clubs who may not be affiliated to a national organisation or recognised National Governing Body but provide a vital local service. The primary aim of the grants is to cover the costs associated with implementing Covid-19 hygiene and social distancing protocols. There is a \u20ac1,500 limit on this grant scheme and only one application is accepted per club. The club grant scheme is designed and intended to support return to sporting activities only.\u00a0Disability Sport Support SchemeIn recognition of the disproportionate impact Covid-19 has had on people with a disability, Sport Ireland ring-fenced a proportion of the Scheme to directly target the disability sport sector.A specific Disability Sport Working Group was established to identify & quantify the unique financial & sporting challenges for organisations delivering in this sector.The Working Group was comprised of representatives from Special Olympics Ireland, IWA Sport, Vision Sports Ireland & Paralympics Ireland. Disability focused programmes in mainstream Governing Bodies and the broader sports and physical activity sector were represented by both CARA and the LSP Network.\u00a0Older AdultsFunding will be provided to Age & Opportunity and Ireland Active to deliver projects for older adults.\u00a0Sports Innovation FundNGBs, LSPs and other funded bodies were invited to apply for funding under this scheme.

The physical and organisational infrastructure is at risk from COVID-19 and it is recognised that the cost of rebuilding would be significantly higher.The secondary purpose of the funding is to invest in sports and programmes that will play a major part in\u00a0the long-term public health response to the crisis.The funding is made up of four separate allocations:\tFunding of up to \u20ac40 million for the three main field sports organisations \u2013 the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU, \ta Resilience Fund of up to \u20ac10 million to support the National Governing Bodies of Sport,\ta Sports Club Resilience Fund of up to \u20ac15 million to support clubs, and\ta Sports Restart and Renewal Fund of up to \u20ac5 million.The new finance will be invested through new grant schemes, which will be designed by Sport Ireland in consultation with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. With regard to the resilience funds announced, National Governing Bodies on their own behalf and on behalf of clubs and affiliates must, in the first instance, be able to verify the costs associated with Covid 19. The crisis has affected some sport more than others and, ultimately, that will be reflected in the investment awards. Speaking today, Chairman of Sport Ireland, Kieran Mulvey, said: \u201cThe announcement today by Ministers Ross and Griffin is most welcomed by everyone in sport. The Board of Sport Ireland has received regular updates on how the necessary Covid-19 restrictions have affected sport at all levels. When restrictions were put in place in March, Sport Ireland identified three key areas of focus, which were \u2013 making sure sport was represented on the Government\u2019s roadmap; creating an environment where high performance athletes could return to training as quickly as possible; and, establishing a financial support for Sport Ireland funded bodies. Sport Ireland worked closely with Ministers Ross and Griffin and colleagues in in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to ensure that all three were delivered. Sport Ireland has already facilitated a return to training for a number of our high performance athletes and has extended funding arrangements for carded athletes to support them through the postponed Olympic and Paralympic schedule. I thank both Minister Ross and Minister Griffin for their ongoing support in ensuring the ongoing viability of sport in Ireland.\u201dSport Ireland Chief Executive, John Treacy, outlined how the funding process will work: \u201cFollowing engagement with Sport Ireland, we will invite applications from funded bodies, which will require them to demonstrate and verify what is required for them to continue in terms of funding. These applications will be processed by Sport Ireland in line with our robust grant processing procedures and high standards of due diligence. It is important to highlight that only those organisations in absolute need will be assisted. It is acknowledged that there may be a need to support previously commercial activities to get them back up and running again as the absence of these may put a strain on an organisation\u2019s viability and its wider participation objectives. We thank Ministers Ross and Griffin and look forward to working with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Governing Bodies to get sport back on track.\u201dIn addition to the financial support announced today, Sport Ireland continues to provide a range of training & support resources to the sector in relation to Covid-19, including an online e-learning platform, which is free and available to all on www.sportireland.ie.
