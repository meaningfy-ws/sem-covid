This amount is the same for all homeworkers. The office allowance covers a range of costs: the office in the private home, small office equipment, electricity, water, heating, insurance, property tax, etc. In order to avoid double use of the expense allowances, employees have to renounce the already existing monthly homework allowance.\r\rIn addition to the office allowance, the employer may also reimburse an expense allowance of up to \u20ac40 per month for the use of a private Internet connection with a subscription (maximum \u20ac20 ) and a private computer (maximum \u20ac20).\r\rIf the employee has to incur other costs such as the use of his own telephone or the purchase of a screen, the employer may also reimburse them.
