The Commission\u2019s immediate priority is fighting the virus and mitigating the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic. At the same time, we must start looking ahead so that Member States can gradually lift their containment measures, with a view to entering the recovery phase and revitalising our societies and economy.While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to a gradual, science-based and effective lifting of containment measures, a highly coordinated way forward is a matter of common European interest.Responding to the call of the European Council of 26 March, the Commission, in cooperation with the President of the European Council, has put forward a European roadmap towards lifting coronavirus containment measures. It takes into account the expertise of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the Commission\u2019s Advisory Panel on the Coronavirus, experience of Member States and guidance from the World Health Organization. Evidently, any such reflection is based on the scientific knowledge available today, and should be revised as further evidence appears.FinlandFinlandEstoniaEstoniaSwedenSwedenDenmarkDenmarkNetherlandsNetherlandsIrelandIrelandBelgiumBelgiumFranceFranceItalyItalyGreeceGreeceCyprusCyprusCroatiaCroatiaSloveniaSloveniaMaltaMaltaAustriaAustriaSlovakiaSlovakiaHungaryHungaryRomaniaRomaniaBulgariaBulgariaCzechCzech RepublicRepublicPoland  Poland  PortugalPortugal SpainSpainGermanyGermanyLuxembourgLuxembourgLatviaLatviaLithuaniaLithuaniaJRC Map 13 April at 16.00 UTCEuropean Union | COVID-19 restricton measuresSource: JRC, WebCritech, National AuthoritiesRESTRICTION MEASURES PER COUNTRYNational events stopSchools, nurseries, kindergartends, educational facilities closureNational movements restrictionsn-essential shops closureInternational movements  restrictionsFlight restrictionsNational measuresPartial/regional measuresNo restrictionsNUMBER OF COVID-19 CASES PER COUNTRY384 \u2013 500501 \u2013 1,0001,001 \u2013 10,00010,001 \u2013 50,00050,001 \u2013 100,000100,001 \u2013 169,496https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/43076/26-vc-euco-statement-en.pdfhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_-_a_european_roadmap_to_lifting_coronavirus_containment_measures_0.pdf2A European approach  based on common principles Even though the situation differs drastically between Member States, it is essential to operate under a common approach. Three principles should guide the EU and its Member States when gradually lifting restrictive measures:\u2022 Action should be based on science and have public health at its centre, while balancing social and economic remedies.\u2022 Action should be coordinated between the Member States to avoid negative effects for all Member States and political friction.\u2022 Respect and solidarity between Member States remain essential to better coordinate, communicate and to mitigate the health and socio-economic impacts.1A gradual rollback of confinement measures will unavoidably lead to an increase in new cases of infection with the coronavirus. Constant monitoring and a readiness to adjust and reintroduce new measures is required. Clear and timely communication and transparency with citizens is essential in this respect. Three main sets of criteria should be considered when assessing whether the time has come roll back the measures:\u2022 Epidemiological criteria indicating a sustained reduction and stabilisation in the number of hospitalisations and/or new cases for a sustained period of time.\u2022 Sufficient health system capacity, for example in terms of an adequate number of hospital beds, pharmaceutical products and stocks of equipment.\u2022 Appropriate monitoring capacity, including large-scale testing capacity to quickly detect and isolate infected individuals, as well as tracking and tracing capacity.Timing is essential 3Accompanying measures  to phase-out confinement Successfully lifting confinement measures requires a policy-mix of accompanying measures that are relevant for all Member States. The EU is taking steps to support all of them.\u2022 Gather data and develop a robust system or reporting. Harmonised gathering and sharing of data at national and subnational level by public health authorities is essential to better manage the lifting of measures.\u2022 Create a framework for contact tracing and warning with the use of mobile apps, which respect data privacy.\u2022 Testing capacities must be expanded and harmonised. Fast and reliable testing is key to swift diagnoses and to measure the population\u2019s acquired immunity. The Commission has presented Guidelines on coronavirus tests.\u2022 The capacity and resilience of health care systems should be increased. Particularly, to address the predicted rise in infections after rolling back the containment measures. The EU budget has been mobilised to help.\u2022 The availability of medical and personal protective equipment should be increased. The Commission supports Member States by stockpiling and distributing supplies and equipment via rescEU and via Joint Procurement.\u2022 Develop and fast-track the introduction of vaccines, treatments and medicines. The development of a safe and effective vaccine would be game-changing and essential in putting an end to the coronavirus outbreak.https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/testing-kits-communication_enThe following recommendations should guide Member States\u2019 reflections on gradually lifting containment measures:\u2022 Action will be gradual. Measures will be lifted step by step and sufficient time should pass between the steps (e.g. one month), as their effect can only be measured over time.\u2022 General measures should progressively become targeted. This would allow gradually going back to normality, while continuing to protect the EU population from the virus. For example:1. The most vulnerable groups should be protected for a longer time.2. Diagnosed people should remain quarantined and treated adequately to decrease transmission risks.3. Safe, targeted alternatives should replace existing general prohibitive measures.4. General states of emergencies should gradually be replaced by more targeted interventions by governments. This would ensure the democratic accountability of the measures taken and a wide acceptance by the populations.\u2022 The lifting of measures should start with those with a local impact and gradually extended to measures with a broader geographic coverage, taking into account national specificities. This would allow for effective and tailored actions and the potentially swift redeployment of measures in case new infections occur.\u2022 A phased approach to opening internal and external borders to allow for the flow of essential workers and goods.1. Internal border controls should be lifted in a coordinated manner. Travel restrictions should first be eased between identified low-risk areas. Neighbouring Member States should stay in close contact to facilitate this.2. In a second phase, external borders would reopen access for non-EU residents, taking into account the spread of the coronavirus outside the EU. Restrictions to non-essential travel to the EU must be continuously reviewed.\u2022 Economic activity should be phased in to ensure that authorities and businesses can adequately adjust to increasing activities in a safe way. The whole population should not return to the workplace at the same time and social distancing should continue to apply. Teleworking should be encouraged. At the work place, occupational health and safety rules should be observed.\u2022 Gatherings of people should progressively be permitted. When reflecting on the most appropriate sequencing, Member States should focus on the specificities of different categories of activity, such as:1. Schools and universities;2. Commercial activity (retail) with possible gradation;3. Social activities (restaurants, caf\u00e9s, sport centres) with possible gradation;4. Mass gatherings.\u2022 Efforts to prevent the spread of the virus should be sustained with awareness campaigns to encourage the population to keep up the strong hygiene practices and social distancing.\u2022 Measures should be continuously monitored and a certain readiness should be developed, as there is a risk of a strong resurgence and a return to strict containment measures. This is particularly important for health care systems.4Next steps The recovery phase \u2013 revitalising an economy  that works for peopleWhile confinement measures are gradually lifted, there is a need to strategically plan the recovery, revitalising the economy and getting back on a path of sustainable growth. This includes enabling the twin transition towards a greener and digital society, and drawing all lessons from the current crisis for the EU\u2019s preparedness and resilience. The Commission will develop a recovery plan, based on a revamped proposal for the next long-term EU budget (Multiannual Financial Framework) and including an updated Commission Work Programme for 2020.\u00a9 European Union, 2020.

EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS            Short-term EU health preparedness for COVID-19 outbreaks                                                                                    COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS                                       Short-term EU health preparedness for COVID-19 outbreaks                                                   I.INTRODUCTION                                       The COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought about one of the worst crises in recent history, requires continuous vigilance and coordinated action.                                       Though many unknowns remain, significant knowledge is being acquired on the disease itself, its transmission, prevention and treatment. Member States, supported by the Commission and EU Agencies, are increasing their testing capacity, improving surveillance and strengthening health system capacity, for instance through an increase in intensive care unit beds or reinforced medical countermeasures. The EU and its Member States have introduced measures to mitigate social and economic impacts, such as maintaining the functioning of the internal market, supporting the transport and tourism sector, protecting employment and supporting medical care services for vulnerable groups. Member States are increasingly coordinating their response. Public health measures have helped stabilise the situation and bring the number of new infections to a level manageable by health systems. This has allowed the progressive lifting of many restrictions imposed over the last months and the resumption of most activities.                                        Yet, the virus still circulates in the across the world. Regional outbreaks across the EU and a growing number of daily new cases across the globe reinforce the fact that the pandemic will only end once under control everywhere. Infectious diseases such as COVID-19 often come in waves and new, localised outbreaks are appearing across Europe and other continents.                                        Learning the lessons of the earlier stages of the pandemic, Europe must use this period of lower transmission rates to reinforce its preparedness and coordinated response capacity to counter further outbreaks of COVID-19. Time is of the essence to ensure that science-based measures are in place and have been stress tested to guarantee adequate implementation.                                        This Communication aims at ensuring the EU\u2019s short-term health preparedness in case of further COVID-19 outbreaks in Europe. It draws particular attention to the need to reduce the burden of the 2020/2021 seasonal flu, so to mitigate the additional strain on health systems should this coincide with a further outbreak of COVID-19. For each domain, this Communication draws on the main lessons learned, positive and negative, and outlines key measures to be taken in the coming months. This will require strong coordination and exchange of information in and between Member States and communities as well as commitment to implement these measures, which are a national competence. Going forward, agreement on common approaches on health measures will continue to be sought within the Health Security Committee                  1                (HSC) as well as in other fora such as the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR).                                        Experience has shown that coordinating actions with neighbours and at EU level is vital. Containment and management of any new outbreaks will also require continued cooperation and support to EU\u2019s immediate neighbourhood and beyond. Therefore, where appropriate and feasible, the Commission will associate the Western Balkans, the Neighbourhood countries and other partner countries with the actions proposed in this document.                                                   II.Enhancing preparedness \u2013 lessons learned and short-term actions                                                   1.Testing, contact tracing and public health surveillance                  2                                                      Sufficient testing capacity is an essential aspect for preparedness and response to COVID-19                  3               . Without adequate testing, there is no early detection of potentially infectious individuals and no visibility on infection rates and transmission within communities. It is a prerequisite to adequate contact tracing.                                        However, over the past few months, Europe has been suffering from shortages of tests and testing materials, trained laboratory personnel and for some supplies of laboratory equipment, while the EU is one of the largest producers of some of this equipment. Moreover, testing policies and methodologies have greatly differed across countries and national contact tracing capacities were often overwhelmed as large-scale community transmission occurred                  4               .                        \t                                             Localised outbreaks - local & national response                                                                                       After several weeks into the lifting of very restrictive measures, we now observe a resurgence of reported cases in several Member States, with a number of localised outbreaks in specific settings and community transmission still reported in most EU/EEA countries. The recent outbreaks are illustrating that local outbreaks must be immediately contained to avoid larger community transmission. In order to do so, immediately scaled testing and tracing should be implemented in the concerned area. Local mitigation measures, such as isolation, should then be enacted.                                                                                       The necessary capacity should be deployed immediately and can be sourced both at the local and national level. The importance of local capacity and local knowledge must be recognised to ensure a tailored and specific response. Segmenting specific activities that require local knowledge for optimal efficiency, such as contact tracing, and those that can be developed without specific local knowledge, such as the provision of mobile labs or the technical running of RT-PCR tests, will be pivotal in best responding to these outbreaks. Such an approach will require coordination and information sharing between the local and national authorities.                                                                  .                                                                  Finally, as containment measures are being gradually lifted                  5               , testing, contact tracing and public health surveillance are required, as they enable the control of localised outbreaks. Their rapid scalability is crucial to keep up with a possible progression in the pandemic and to avoid having to reinstate strict confinement measures. These activities must also be specifically tailored for vulnerable groups and in settings with high density and limited ability to physically distance. A key step in preparedness is therefore the systematic identification of vulnerable locations and populations in all Member States.                                       a)Testing                                                         Laboratory capacities for testing COVID-19 infection have increased                  6               , combined with developments in point of care testing, 3D printing of testing equipment and new testing methods. The Commission has launched a joint procurement with Member States, with a ceiling budget of over \u20ac350,000,000 for laboratory supplies.                  7                Increased laboratory capacity, trained staff and innovation needs to be in place across all Member States to ensure a system that allows fast scalability, robust results and localised deployment response.                                        Now that Member States have increased their testing capacity in line with the ECDC guidance, they have to make sure that they can quickly increase testing coverage to mildly symptomatic patients and people who have been in contact with positive cases.                  8                It is also important that Member States continue to monitor the volume of tests performed and their results over time.  Testing must also be able to be rapidly deployed through decentralised strategies to help control localised clusters. Finally, Member States should ensure that the expansion of testing capacity for COVID-19 does not come at the expense of other surveillance programmes (e.g. for influenza).                                       b)Contact Tracing                                       The coupling of standard contact tracing approaches with interoperable mobile applications (\u2018apps\u2019) can reinforce the ability to stop new chains of transmission and prevent spread to the community                  9               \u00a0while maintaining the data protection principles as outlined in relevant legislation                  10               . Ten Member States have already launched apps for contact tracing and warning. Eleven more intend to launch an app in the near future. Following the adoption of the Recommendation                  11                on technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis, EU solutions and a common toolbox                  12                were developed to facilitate the interoperability of national apps                  13                while safeguarding privacy and data protection.                  14                Interoperability among all national apps should be a reality, so that travellers and workers can continue to move confidently across EU borders. The Commission has amended                  15                today the eHealth Network Implementing Decision 2019/1765/EU in order to provide the modalities for operating a secure IT infrastructure which supports the interoperability of contact tracing and warning apps across the EU. The Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) ensures secure and effective sharing of information between Member States\u2019 health authorities. Moreover, preparedness measures                  16                at the points of entry                  17                into the EU, such as international airports, ports, international railway stations or land border crossings need to be implemented and can further support contact-tracing efforts, again helping to ensure the freedom of movement across the EU.                                                    c)Surveillance                                       Public health surveillance should take place based on the following parameters: Intensity and geographical spread; Viral strain changes through molecular typing                  18               ; Nosocomial outbreaks                  19               ; Changes in risk groups including links to environmental exposure; Respiratory disease syndromes; Age specific population immunity; situation in residential care institutions; or the impact on healthcare systems.                                        This must enable the detection of hot spots at an early stage. Member States must therefore share standardised and timely epidemiological data at subnational level, including hospitalisation data and intensive care occupancy.  The accumulation of such data, including through digital epidemiology relying on social media analysis, helps tracking the pandemic and allows for accurate modelling of the disease\u2019s spread.                                     \t                                             Action area: Testing, contact tracing and public health surveillance                                       \t                                       \t                                             Timeline                                       \t                                             \u00d8Run scenario-based national stress tests for contact tracing systems, testing capacities and testing deployment (Member States)                                                                  As localised outbreaks are being identified and are likely going forward, these stress tests should be performed at local levels, based on specific scenarios, such as superspreader events, outbreaks in targeted sectors such as slaughterhouses, educational settings and residential homes\u00a0that could later be expanded to other areas of activity.

In particular, access to personal protective equipment, medicines and medical devices was a major shortfall across the EU in the early days of the pandemic. As the crisis deepened, global supply chains could not cope with the increased demand. Disruption of production in the then most affected locations occurred. The introduction of export bans by national and third countries\u2019 authorities, as well as problems with international transport of goods, bottlenecks in conformity assessment, as well as the prevalence of not compliant, unsafe and fake products, exacerbated shortages. It became clear that a global race for supplies has come at a high price for products which in some cases lacked in quality. Coordinated solidarity at EU level via the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) was also hampered or delayed, given that all countries faced the same type of shortages at the same time\u00a0                  22               . Moreover, the commercial cargo market was disrupted and access to transport options became uncertain.                                        A range of measures were introduced to overcome these challenges. They included industry conversions, monitoring of shortages with the European Medicines Agency, supporting industry initiatives to optimise production and supply of essential medicines                  23               , export authorisations                  24                and engagement with third party countries as well as freely available standards                  25               . In addition, the Commission launched joint procurements                  26               , constituted strategic stockpiles (rescEU), increased cooperation and controls of market surveillance and safety authorities to ensure that only safe protective equipment were offered in the Single Market and new guidance on community coverings was asked to the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)                  27               .                                         Furthermore, the Commission adopted guidelines on export restrictions                  28                and on the optimal and rational supply of medicines to avoid shortages during the COVID-19 outbreak                  29               , and actively worked towards lifting national export restrictions and other obstacles to the free movement of medical equipment and medicinal products. The Commission also adopted a decision                  30                authorising Member States affected by the coronavirus pandemic to temporarily suspend customs duties and VAT on protective equipment, testing kits or medical devices such as ventilators. This has made the medical equipment that doctors, nurses and patients desperately need more accessible.                                        To ensure the free flow of goods within the EU, the Commission actively worked towards lifting national export restrictions. The Single Market Enforcement Task Force (SMET) started meeting with the immediate aim to address restrictions to the free movement of goods, including medical supplies.                                        Protecting the integrity of the single market, as one of our main assets towards recovery, remains one of the Commission\u2019s priorities. Unjustified obstacles to the free movement of goods, in particular medical equipment and medicines, will continue to be actively challenged by the Commission, using all tools available, including infringement procedures.                                        The Commission recalls the obligation of Member States to notify draft national technical regulations before they are actually adopted in order for the Commission and other Member States to react. Should the need arise, such as the sudden proliferation of barriers as witnessed during the COVID-19 crisis, SMET should be used as an urgency mechanism to coordinate an appropriate response.                                       Experience gained from the implementation of the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) \u201cmobility package\u201d                  31               , may serve as a basis for developing a coordinated EU response to possible future reductions in global and regional cargo transport capacity.                                       The Commission also put in place a clearinghouse mechanism, the Clearing House for medical equipment used for COVID-19 (CCH), which serves as a platform for exchange and assessment with Member States on demand and supply of key COVID-19 medical countermeasures, as well as monitoring and helping to improve EU industry capacity.                  32                An online information collection platform on supply and demand was created to facilitate the match-making of supply and demand between Member States expressing needs and companies offering medical equipment. Despite some improvements, there are no indications that shortages of medical equipment have been fully resolved. The\u00a0ECDC and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), are supporting forecasting and modelling.                                                          However, more is needed to prepare for possible future surges in cases. Member States are invited to urgently establish a clear overview on their needs for medical supplies, national production capacities and stockpiles of essential equipment. Procurement activities at the EU level are ongoing to ensure the availability of Personal Protective Equipment, ventilators, laboratory equipment and critical ICU medicines (see annex), as well as access to therapeutics when they will receive market authorisations from the European Medical Agency, and support to the production and deployment of potential successful vaccines. Large EU procurement framework contracts provide support to the preparedness work for Member States. Member States are encouraged to make use of the possibilities to buy medical equipment under the current contracts. It will also be important to ensure that measures are in place to ensure that adequate Personal Protective Equipment reaches the critical social support care sector which provides essential services for older persons and persons with disabilities.                                                   Member States are also invited to map out possibilities for flexible production capacity and conversion of production on their territory. The Commission stands ready to support Member States in industrial reconversion and the establishment of plans for flexible production capacity.                                                   Moreover, research and innovation is geared towards the development of medical countermeasures and providing the evidence base for development and creation of needed common standards for essential products (e.g. diagnostics tests, health data, product approvals, joint public procurement of innovation, and development of clinical guidelines). This needs to be maintained and coordinated and can also be supported by ensuring that relevant European research organisations remain operational in the case of further outbreaks.                                                   As highlighted by the Commission\u2019s EU Strategy for COVID-19 vaccines of 17 June 2020, a permanent solution to the current crisis will most likely be brought about by the development and deployment of an effective and safe vaccine against the virus. In this regard, the European Commission is currently negotiating with vaccine producers on behalf of Member States with a view to agree Advance Purchase Agreements. This will be instrumental in returning economic and social life to normality across Europe and the world.                                       \u00a0                        \t

capacity                                       The Covid-19 pandemic has strongly impacted healthcare workers that have been caring for Covid-19 patients, often under high levels of stress for sustained periods of time. They are not only vulnerable to contagion due to their heightened exposure to the virus, but also often needed to work in the context of shortages of appropriate personal protective equipment. Shortages of intensive care unit capacities and specialised healthcare workers to treat COVID-19 patients were also widespread. In most of the EU, national solutions to the shortage of intensive care unit beds proved to be feasible. However, one of the key lessons learned was that, whilst physical infrastructure could be expanded, the most pressing need became the availability of healthcare staff that were competent within intensive care units. In some instances, health care service reservists and medical students were called in and, where needed, rapid training was provided. The Commission also supported a European clinicians\u2019 network allowing healthcare professionals to exchange information and improve their management of COVID-19 patients. However, this reallocation of resources sometimes came at the expense of provision of care for patients with other conditions.                         \t                                             Cross-border support: healthcare personnel and transfer of patients                                                                                       During the first outbreak in Europe, certain areas were significantly more affected than others. In some cases, the local capacities were overwhelmed, which was aided by European cross-border support via the sending of specialised healthcare personnel as well as the transfer of COVID-19 patients. For example, co-financed under the EU\u2019s UCPM, Romania and Norway dispatched doctors and nurses to Northern Italy, and in terms of patients, 6 Member States were involved in cross-border transfers of COVID-19 patients.                                                                                       Based on preliminary initial lessons learned, national strategies should be in place to maximise health systems\u2019 ability to cope. However, in certain instances, support from neighbouring and EU Member States is indeed essential. As such, the Commission has bolstered the solidarity mechanisms by allocating dedicated ESI funding and implementing specific mechanisms to support cross-border transfer of patients and transport of medical teams.                                                                                       Maintaining rapid access to surge public health capacities without neglecting other areas of healthcare is essential.                  37                Moreover, it is also essential to ensure that, in critical shortage situations, the prioritisation (or \u201ctriage\u201d) of healthcare provision is done on the basis of guidance strictly based on medical criteria. Finally, based on experience of the transfer of patients across borders and the need for supplementary healthcare worker capacity when national levels are overwhelmed                  38               , the Commission has already activated financial support through the Emergency Support Instrument for the transport of medical personnel and patients between Member States. In addition, the UCPM coordinates the deployment of emergency medical teams and equipment to requesting countries.                        \t                                             Action area: healthcare surge capacity                                                            \t                                       \t                                             Timeline                                       \t                                             \u00d8Finance and organise the\u00a0transport of medical personnel and teams into the EU and between Member States and transfer of patients between Member States and to third countries (ESI \u2013 European Commission)                                       \t                                             Ongoing                                       \t                                             \u00d8Guidelines for optimisation of hospital space, including de-isolation and discharge of patients clinically healed but still COVID-19 positive (ECDC)                                       \t                                             July                                       \t                                             \u00d8Online European network of clinicians and development of training modules on COVID-19 for health professionals (including via a virtual academy) in partnership with European federations, such as the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (Member States, ECDC, European Commission)                                                                  This includes practical trainings and information, such as the donning and doffing of personal protective equipment and may extend to intensive care training modules.                                       \t                                             Ongoing                                                                              4.Non-pharmaceutical countermeasures                                        A number of non-pharmaceutical countermeasures, such as restriction of movement, social distancing, use of facemasks in public areas and border controls, were implemented across Member States and third countries                  39               . These measures have often been necessary to slow down the spread of the virus and have saved tens of thousands of lives, but they have come at a high social and economic cost. Restriction of movement and measures such as closure of public spaces caused disruptive and unprecedented negative social and economic consequences on societies (e.g. access to their workplace for cross-border workers, family separation, access to education and childcare, standstill and disruption in a number of economic sectors and social effects like isolation) and economies of the EU by disrupting the functioning of the single market. They have also negatively affected the single market for goods, restricting their free movement and disturbing supply chains all over the EU and beyond. They also had serious consequences for the freedom of movement inside the EU and the functioning and integrity of the Schengen area. Moreover, the exponential use of technology for daily activities such as communication, receiving information, shopping, working and learning posed a challenge for all those with limited or no access to such ICT.                                       In view of this economic and social impact, it is in the general interest to avoid large-scale lockdown measures in case of further outbreaks and to address impact of different sectors, including transport and tourism                  40               . Rather, the response should be to have targeted and localised non-medical countermeasures, informed by research and evidence. Aggregated and anonymised mobility data allowing an assessment of the effectiveness of such measures will help. Once compiled, this can provide the basis for scenario planning of possible evolutions of further outbreaks and the corresponding non-pharmaceutical measures to introduce. Ensuring that workplaces are safe is instrumental to the continuity of work and economic activities, as well as providing childcare services and education for children to allow continuous work life balance for all parents. Preventive and protective measures based on EU rules on occupational health and safety and specific guidance                  41                should be put in place to protect workers\u2019 health and prevent the spread of the virus at the workplace. In particular, the obligation on the employer of an updated risk assessment and preventive measures adapted to the changing context is essential in line with the legal framework.                                                                     The reestablishment of ineffective restrictions and internal EU border controls must be avoided moving forward. Any measures that imply restrictions on the movement of persons or goods within the EU should be used only in situations where it is strictly necessary. Such restrictive measures should be coordinated and proportionate and non-discriminatory to address public health risks. Temporary controls at borders may only be used in exceptional circumstances to provide a response to situations seriously affecting public policy or internal security and, as a last resort measure, they should last only as long as the extraordinary circumstances persist.                                                    Restrictions inside the territories of the Member States need not necessarily be accompanied by travel restrictions and internal border controls. If border controls are nevertheless introduced, this should be done in consultation with the other Member States, using existing channels and in line with the existing rules, while the free movement of goods, workers exercising critical occupations and essential transport workers should be safeguarded at all times. Green lanes                  42                and the existing guidance on border management measures                  43               , air cargo                  44               , as well as the free movement of workers                  45                and crew changes                  46               , should be immediately implemented. The Single Market Enforcement Task Force will continue monitoring and addressing any unjustified obstacles to free movement of goods. As regards the continuation of passenger transport, the guidelines on transport services                  47                and passenger rights                  48                remain relevant and should be applied in accordance with the epidemiological situation. Restrictions on non-essential travel to the EU are under continuous assessment.\u00a0It is essential that any progressive lifting of the travel restrictions to the EU are done in a fully co-ordinated way between EU Member States.                                    \t                                             Action area: Non-pharmaceutical measures                                                            \t                                       \t                                             Timeline                                       \t                                             \u00d8Timely exchange of Member States information on effectiveness of measures and any re-introductions to respond to secondary outbreaks                                                                   A data entry website and database will be hosted by JRC and will be populated by JRC and ECDC with contributions from the Member States and available for use in modelling, risk assessment, monitoring of the situation in Member States.                                       \t                                             July to September                                       \t                                             \u00d8EU handbook on COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (ECDC and JRC)                                                                  Compiling best practices and scientific guidance informed by modelling results to assist Member States with the calibration of public health measures (including mass gatherings) based on different parameters, criteria and triggers.                                       \t                                             August                                       \t                                             \u00d8Sharing of information and best practices related to internal and external border crossings for limiting the negative consequences for the freedom of movement of persons and goods (European Commission & Member States)                                       \t                                             Ongoing                                                                  5.Support to vulnerable groups                                        Certain groups are more vulnerable to the virus than others. This relates to three categories: (1) medically vulnerable \u2013 such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, obesity, etc.); and (2) socially marginalised \u2013 such as those residing or working in certain physical settings prone to high density and reduced ability to social distance or a reduced financial budget for protective measures (such as people in poverty) as well as (3) professions which entail closer proximity to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. About half of all fatalities in some Member States were among the elderly, in particular in nursing homes. Additionally, the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted and exacerbated existing inequalities, including increased cases of domestic violence, and as it has hit marginalised communities in our society disproportionately hard. Further outbreaks should not lead to expansion of socio-economic divergences in the European societies. Given the array of different groups, measures to protect their health must therefore be tailored to each specificity, as there will be differing needs and requirements in each case. This includes their needs also with regard to mental health support, addressing for example isolation and loneliness.\u00a0                                                   Specific settings require specific measures. The situation of healthcare workers, workers in long-term care settings and other front-line workers, as well as vulnerable groups and settings such as residential homes, will need continuous and adequate monitoring through regular testing in order to avoid further spread of the virus in these settings. In addition, outbreaks in settings such as slaughterhouses, mines,                  49                certain air-conditioned areas, necessitate immediate deployment of outbreak control capacities to ensure such outbreaks remain localised. Communities of migrant or seasonal workers need specific attention too.                         \t                                                                  Action area: Support to vulnerable groups                                                            \t                                       \t                                             Timeline                                       \t                                             \u00d8Design and implement specific high density, low threshold testing strategies for vulnerable groups & settings (Member States and ECDC)                                       \t                                             July to August                                       \t                                             \u00d8Sharing best practices in supporting COVID-19 prevention, testing and care in socially and marginalised groups and medically vulnerable groups and settings (European Commission & ECDC)                                       \t                                             July to September                                       \t                                             \u00d8Sharing of best practices and provision of mental health and psychosocial support to vulnerable prone to COVID-19 (European Commission and Member States)                                       \t                                             July to September                                       \t                                             \u00d8Provision of specific online trainings to frontline staff working with vulnerable groups (ECDC)                                       \t                                             July to September                                                                  6.Reducing the burden of seasonal influenza                                       Every year, seasonal influenza creates a burden on health systems                  50               .

This requires short-term and strongly coordinated action to strengthen key areas of preparedness and response. Early detection of cases and a rapid response to prevent further spread, combined with specific measures to protect the most vulnerable in our societies, are currently our best shot to avoid having to reinstate large-scale restrictions such as lockdowns. Building on the ongoing work in the Member States, the Commission and EU Agencies, this Communication has set out the necessary actions to be taken.                                        These efforts should be underpinned by robust evidence and extensive public communication efforts. Preventing a resurgence of cases largely depends on individual behaviours and adherence to public health recommendations. Sustained vigilance by all is key to ensure that a core set of basic individual precautions remains in place at all time.\u00a0This, in turn, relies on the public\u2019s acceptance and understanding of the well-founded nature and importance of these measures. Monitoring the degree of social acceptance and addressing early societal concerns will be a key determinant of future developments. These communication efforts also entail a systematic and immediate response to disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic                  51               , whilst further efforts should also be made to enhance the cyber resilience of key health infrastructure.\u00a0In case a Member State would reintroduce emergency measures, these should be designed in a measured and limited way so that they do not obstruct the rule of law and parliamentary democracy.                                       The virus does not stop at EU borders and this is why the EU and its Member States provide over EUR 36 billion with emergency aid, humanitarian aid bridges and longer-term support to third countries in need.  It has also set up an EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to maintain vital transport links for humanitarian and emergency health workers and supplies.                                       Efforts should thus continue in coordination with other global actors, including the UN and WHO, to ensure the required international response to this global health threat, including equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine. This should go hand in hand with efforts to address the socio-economic impacts of this crisis, which threaten to unravel progress made in achieving the SDGs as well as investment in the resilience of partner countries, notably through health-system strengthening, hence underpinning the global recovery                  52               . This is the only way to bring an end to the current pandemic crisis in the EU and globally.                                       More than any other year, attention must be given to reducing the impact of seasonal influenza for 2020/2021 and activities must be put into place now to mitigate this scenario. The combined effects of simultaneous outbreaks of COVID-19 colliding with a heavy influenza season could stretch even further the limits of our healthcare systems.                                                         The European Commission will continue working side by side with Member States in the fight against COVID-19. Together, we will continue funding research for predicting the spread and resurgence and to support the development of necessary medical countermeasures. We will also promote the identification and dissemination of local good practices. Through an ambitious recovery plan supported by a revamped long-term budget 2021-27 and the Next Generation EU instrument, Europe will also invest to secure its recovery and resilience against possible future Covid-19 outbreaks, support structural changes across healthcare systems and reinforce the Union\u2019s crisis management systems and capacities. Europe will thoroughly draw the lessons from the COVID-19 crisis to ensure it comes out stronger, more united and better equipped to face future crises.                                          \t                                       (1)                                                          Decision No\u00a01082/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22\u00a0October 2013 on serious cross-border threats to health and repealing Decision No\u00a02119/98/EC Text with EEA relevance.

The JRC together with DG ENV and with the involvement of DG SANTE took the initiative to launch a pan-European Umbrella Study connecting the leading national and regional reference study in a unique approach.                                 \t                                       (21)                                                          Such studies aim to gather information on infection rates across populations.                                  \t                                       (22)                                                          Under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, the EU supports coordination and co-finances EU Member States and six additional Participating States in providing assistance to countries requesting EU assistance. As of 23 June, the ERCC has received 47 requests for assistance, related to COVID-19 pandemic, concerning medical items and PPEs. Of these requests, only 16 have been partially answered.                                  \t                                       (23)                                                          The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in overcoming the risk of shortages of essential products and services resulting from COVID-19 outbreaks in the EU. The exceptional circumstances and resulting challenges may trigger the need for undertakings to cooperate with each other in order to overcome, or at least to mitigate, the effects of the crisis to the ultimate benefit of citizens. In this context, on 8 April 2020, the Commission adopted the communication Temporary Framework for assessing antitrust issues related to business cooperation in response to situations of urgency stemming from the current COVID-19 outbreak (\u201cTemporary Framework\u201d, OJ C 116I, 8.4.2020, p. 7\u201310). This sets out the main criteria that the Commission will apply when assessing under EU competition rules cooperation projects aimed at addressing shortages of supply of essential products and services during the coronavirus outbreak. The Temporary Framework also foresees the possibility of providing companies with written comfort (via ad hoc \u201ccomfort letters\u201d) on specific cooperation projects falling within its scope. On the basis of the Temporary Framework, the Commission has issued on 8 April 2020 a comfort letter to \u201cMedicines for Europe\u201d, an association of pharmaceutical manufacturers, and participating companies in relation to a voluntary cooperation project to address the risk of shortages of critical hospital medicines for the treatment of coronavirus patients (                     https://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/medicines_for_europe_comfort_letter.pdf                     ).                                 \t                                       (24)                                                         \u00a0COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2020/568 of 23 April 2020 making the exportation of certain products subject to the production of an export authorisation                                 \t                                       (25)                                                          Temporarily provided by CEN and CENELEC, on request of the Commission, for medical and protective face masks, gloves, clothing and respiratory ventilators, to support production and placing on the market of essential supply.                                 \t                                       (26)                                                         \u00a0EU joint procurements cover personal protective equipment, ventilators and ICU medicines \u2013 more information is available in the annex                                 \t                                       (27)                                                          In May 2020, the European Commission requested CEN to develop technical specifications on community face coverings.

OVERVIEW \u2013 JOINT PROCUREMENT                                       The Joint Procurement Agreement - Legal Basis and Objectives                                       On 10 April 2014, the Commission adopted the Joint Procurement Agreement (JPA)                  1                for the EU institutions, together with States that have joined JPA, to purchase: Vaccines; Antivirals and Medical countermeasures for serious cross-border threats to health. As of April 2020 the JPA has been signed by all 27 EU countries, the UK, the 3 EEA countries (Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein) and Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, North Macedonia and Kosovo                  2                as well.                  3                These countries may participate in any future joint procurement procedure. The Joint Procurement Agreement has been signed by 37 partners and covers 537 million people. The joint procurement mechanism was established with the objective of improving the preparedness of Member States to respond to emergency situations, namely to establish stocks of medical countermeasures before an emergency situation occurs. It was not primarily designed as a tool to be used during an emergency situation. Current circumstances highlight the relevance of preparedness while placing enormous strain on the mechanism. Nevertheless, the instruments, pressed as they might be, are already starting to prove useful.                                       Practical modalities & Speed of implementation of Joint Procurements related to COVID-19                                       In the context of COVID-19, the negotiated procedure for reasons of extreme urgency is used. This means that potential tenderers are identified through a market analysis and only invited companies may submit a tender. Once the tender is awarded, participating Member States receive the total quantity of the ordered or reserved measures. However, the rate of delivery depends on the production capacity of the manufacturers and the applicable allocation criteria. The final allocation of available amounts of medical countermeasures is allocated by the specific steering committee. The Commission has on its initiative proposed a number of measures of exception to speed up the processes. Processes are slowed down by time required for all interested member states to finish submitting needs and by reactivity of the companies/market.                                       Ongoing Joint Procurements related to COVID-19                                       Five joint procurements procedures have been launched covering personal protective equipment, ventilators and laboratory equipment. For the first procurement on PPE, Member States could order gloves as of the beginning of April onwards. As of beginning of May, Member States can also place orders for coveralls. For the second procurement on PPE, Member States can order goggles, face shields and masks since the beginning of April. For the third procurement on ventilators, Member States can order since 15 April.  For the fourth joint procurement on laboratory equipment, Member States already have the possibility to order since May. For the fifth joint procurement on the ICU medicines tender has been launched on 17 June.                                       Contracts for personal protective equipment and ventilators and laboratory equipment will provide Member States with a total ceiling budget of over \u20ac 3.3 billion of critical supplies that they can procure over the course of 1 year.                  4                                                      Further joint procurements can be launched at any time if the need arises.

INTRODUCTION More than eight months have passed since the World Health Organisation recognised COVID-19 as a major public health emergency needing a global effort. Europe has adapted to an unprecedented situation and has led the global response. As our Union confronts a resurgence of cases, Member States are better prepared and coordinated than they were in the early months of the pandemic. We have more knowledge of how to combat the spread of the coronavirus, and how to do it in a way that limits the damage to our daily lives. However, citizens, families and communities across Europe continue to face an unprecedented risk to their health and well-being, while uncertainty undermines our societies and economies. Recent weeks have seen an alarming spread of the virus across Europe, and new measures have had to be applied. With health systems again under pressure, more needs to be done to control and overcome the situation, protecting lives and livelihoods, and promoting European solidarity. Whilst cooperation between Member States has improved since the start of the pandemic, it remains essential if we are to tackle effectively the threats we face. Unilateral and uncoordinated action undermines the impact of the EU\u2019s response and the confidence of citizens. The relaxation of applied measures during the summer months was not always accompanied by steps to build up sufficient response capacity. This means that urgent steps are needed now at both national and EU level: stronger measures now can pay human and economic dividends in the coming months.  The Commission has worked ceaselessly to support national efforts since the onset of the pandemic. The measures it has introduced have, amongst others, helped keep essential goods and services flowing, supported national healthcare systems which found themselves under pressure, supported the economy, facilitated free movement of people and crossing of borders and boosted preparedness. Work with EU agencies has helped the EU to build its operational response1 too. Work to combat the virus and to sustain the economy goes hand in hand, addressing citizens\u2019 understandable anxieties and \u2018fatigue\u2019. It is essential to maintain and reinforce efforts until reliable treatments and/or vaccines are widely available and taken up. In October, the European Council underlined the need for more cooperation: \u201cto continue the overall coordination effort based on the best available science, notably regarding quarantine regulations, cross-border contact tracing, testing strategies, the joint assessment of testing methods, the mutual recognition of tests, and the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU\u201d2. This mirrors a strong wish amongst citizens for a strong EU role3. This Communication sets out next steps in key areas to reinforce the EU\u2019s response.  2. THE NEXT PHASE IN EU RESPONSE MEASURES  2.1. Ensuring the flow of information to allow informed decision-making  Citizens, policy-makers, and businesses depend on the information they have to inform their decisions: ensuring the quality and timeliness of that data is therefore crucial.                                                             1  See Communication on short-term EU health preparedness for COVID-19 outbreaks, COM(2020) 318, 15 July 2020. 2  European Council Conclusions, EUCO 15/20, 16 October 2020. 3  Standard Eurobarometer 93 (published October 2020) found that 62% of people trusted the EU to make the rights decisions about the pandemic in the future.   2   Up to date, accurate, comprehensive and comparable epidemiological data is essential to know the status of the spread of the coronavirus at regional and national level. Provision of both numerical and qualitative information on testing, contact tracing and public health surveillance is crucial in the next months. The sharing of data on the EU COVID-19 Data Platform needs to become the norm: at present only five Member States are using this to share information. A new enhanced surveillance portal will act as an online entry point for all key activities. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is pivotal as the central point for the data flow and needs to have the information required. Its surveillance of the situation should rest on data compiled according to common EU definitions, to have a better ability to detect early signals, and to support more accurate risk assessments and responses. Next month, the Commission will make proposals to improve the longer-term health security framework at EU level, but in the meantime, Member States must step up their sharing of data on a common basis, and ensure a strengthened and integrated surveillance system across the EU. This should extend beyond data relating to the pandemic itself, to areas such as data on the economic situation and on health systems (hospital beds availability and medicines shortages). Knowledge-sharing on the impact of different treatments is also critical to both the effectiveness and the efficiency of response. The Commission, in close cooperation with the ECDC, should facilitate discussion among epidemiologists and other experts at EU level to coordinate national approaches and exchange best practices. The use of existing networks or the creation of a new platform will be explored. This will allow for a better use of tools to target EU support where it is most needed. For example, accurate mapping of intensive care bed availability would help in the transfer of patients or medical teams between Member States, which can be supported through a \u20ac220 million mobility action already in place.   Next steps: \uf0b7 Member States should provide all relevant data to the ECDC and the Commission using common criteria. \uf0b7 An upgraded ECDC online portal to bring together all key data by April 2021.  2.2. Effective and rapid testing   Testing \u2013 in conjunction with contact tracing and effective isolation practices - is one of the main tools available to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. Accurate and widespread testing allows for public health decisions to be taken on the best basis; rapid testing allows the minimum interruption in the essential work of staff in hospitals or care homes and for swift action to be taken in epicentres such as universities. It can also facilitate travel in certain circumstances. The Commission has been encouraging the development of reliable tests, national testing strategies and rapid antigen tests4. The current shortfalls in the testing capacity in the face of a resurgence of infection show that further swift action is indispensable.  There are two types of tests now developed for COVID-19. The category of \u201cReverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction\u201d tests are considered as \u201cgold standard\u201d for their                                                            4  Communication from the Commission Guidelines on COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and their performance, C(2020) 2391, 15 April 2020.  3  accuracy, but they take time and use various reagents that can be subject to demand constraints. Rapid antigen tests5 are a new generation of faster and cheaper COVID-19 tests, allowing for a test result in often less than 30 minutes. These are starting to reach the market and Member States are increasingly exploring their wider use. They offer the possibility for rapid, inexpensive and early detection of the most infectious cases, but are recognised as substantially less sensitive. This points to the need for careful strategies for their use: they can be particularly beneficial in scenarios such as suspected outbreaks of COVID-19 in remote settings or to help investigate outbreaks investigations in residential facilities such as care homes, or when there is widespread community transmission.  The Commission is today adopting a Commission Recommendation on COVID-19 testing strategies, including the use of rapid antigen tests to promote effective testing. The Recommendation sets out key elements to be considered for national, regional or local testing strategies: the scope of COVID-19 testing strategies, groups to be prioritised in case of capacity problems, and key points linked to testing capacities and resources. The EU should monitor these national strategies shared by Member States to allow mutual learning and to identify gaps, on the basis of timely, accurate and comparable data at national, regional and local levels. The Recommendation should also accelerate the selection and deployment of rapid and reliable antigen tests.  As a first step, the Commission is now mobilising \u20ac100 million under the Emergency Support Instrument to directly purchase rapid antigen tests and deliver them to the Member States, based on clear criteria reflecting defined needs at national level and stringent quality criteria. In parallel, the Commission is also launching a joint procurement to enable a second stream of access for Member States to these promising tests.  Testing plays an important role in facilitating free movement in the EU. Some Member States are applying prior testing requirements which depend on the ability of other Member States to undertake such tests. Travellers unable to obtain them, for example because there are no testing capacities foreseen for asymptomatic travellers in the Member State of departure, should be offered to undergo a test after arrival6. The mutual recognition of tests, of either type, is essential. If negative COVID-19 tests are to be required or recommended for any activity, this relies on the availability of such tests and the need for all tests meeting agreed minimum and sufficient standards to be accepted as valid. Absence of such mutual recognition could in particular become a serious hurdle if Member States require or recommend testing prior to travel (cf. section 2.6 below). As set out in the Council Recommendation on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement, Member States should enhance cooperation on different aspects related to testing, including verification of test certificates, taking into account research and advice of epidemiological experts as well as best practices. Cross-border cooperation on testing (e.g. on laboratory processing) would be one way to alleviate capacity shortfalls until these are remedied.  Next steps: \uf0b7 The Commission is mobilising \u20ac100 million from the Emergency Support Instrument to directly purchase rapid antigen tests and distribute them as soon as possible to Member States, based on a defined allocation strategy. \uf0b7 The Commission will launch a joint procurement to make rapid antigen tests available                                                            5  Rapid antigen tests are immunoassays that detect the presence of a viral antigen. 6  Point 17, Council Recommendation 2020/1475 of 13 October 2020 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  4  and calls on all Member States to participate. \uf0b7 National strategies on testing to be submitted by mid-November and an analysis completed by end of November.      2.3.   Making full use of contact tracing apps  Contact tracing is one of the most critical tools to prevent the spread of the virus and break transmission chains. But as infection rates increase, manual contact tracing operations become more difficult. Contact tracing and warning apps can make a real difference by using digital technology to send warnings more quickly. These apps alert users if they have been in proximity for a defined period to a person who reports a positive test for COVID-19: while ensuring full compliance with data protection and privacy rules. An EU toolbox7 has supported the development of many national apps, now launched in 19 Member States and downloaded by 50 million Europeans. This is a good start but much more is needed if the apps are to play a major role in controlling the spread of the coronavirus. All Member States should have an app in place, and there should be a new communication effort at EU and national level to promote uptake of these apps.  At Member States\u2019 request, the Commission has also recently launched a solution for linking national apps across the EU through a \u2018European Federation Gateway Service\u2019. Three national apps (Germany, Ireland, and Italy) are now linked through this service with five more Member States expected to connect in the coming days. This means that, for example, someone with the German app can receive a warning if they have had contact with someone who reported a positive test for COVID-19 via the Italian app. A further 16 Member States plan to join by the end of November. The Commission stands ready to assist Member States in any way possible to develop and roll out national contact tracing apps, and to interconnect them via the Gateway.  Next steps:  \uf0b7 The Commission will support Member States to develop national tracing apps and connect them to the European Federation Gateway Service. \uf0b7 All Member States should set up effective and compatible apps to allow an EU-wide system. 2.4.   Effective vaccination   The development and procurement of an effective vaccine is essential to bringing an end to the crisis. Under the EU Strategy on COVID-19 vaccines, the Commission is negotiating and concluding Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs) with vaccine producers so as to secure access to promising vaccine candidates at the earliest possible opportunity once proven safe and effective, and on the best possible terms. Contracts with upfront payments of \u20ac1.02 billion have been signed so far, with exploratory talks concluded with three companies involving a further \u20ac1.45bn in upfront payments.                                                            7  Common EU Toolbox for Member States, Mobile applications to support contact tracing in the EU\u2019s fight against COVID-19, eHealth Network, 15 April 2020. https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdfhttps://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdfhttps://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdfhttps://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdf 5  There is no guarantee that any given vaccine candidate will succeed. A broad portfolio of vaccine producers is therefore needed. The portfolio will be kept under constant review as the development of vaccines evolves. This will also require additional funding from Member States under the Emergency Support Instrument8. In addition, a network is being set up to support smaller developers of promising vaccines9. The EU has also led the global effort to provide fair and equitable access to vaccines and facilitate their deployment worldwide, as global public goods, via the COVAX facility10. Vaccines do not save lives in themselves - vaccination does. Having a vaccine available is not enough. It also needs to be distributed and deployed to maximum effect. On 15 October 2020, the Commission set out the key steps that Member States need to take in order to prepare11. This includes getting ready all the equipment and infrastructure to undertake the immunisation, and define clear priority groups to be the first to benefit. Member States were called on to establish national vaccination strategies to ensure full readiness and the approach to be taken as vaccination is rolled out to all.  This work needs to be taken forward and operationalised as much as possible in a coordinated manner. The Commission will put in place a common reporting framework so that Member States can work together and learn from each other. The European Centre for Disease Prevention will compile a first overview of national vaccination plans by the end of October 2020, to allow lessons to be drawn and experience to be shared. A \u201ctest day\u201d will be organised as an exercise to allow plans for strategy and deployment to be stress-tested.  Citizens also need to know that vaccines are safe. This requires robust data, strong controls, and full transparency. In addition to the robust authorisation process before use, it calls for continuous observation as the vaccines are rolled out, with a real-time assessment of the impact of the vaccines once mass vaccination begins. As well as the pre-deployment authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, the Commission will support a platform for post-authorisation studies monitoring the safety, effectiveness, and impact of vaccination. As work on the development and deployment of vaccines develops, other issues are likely to emerge which may require a degree of EU-level coordination and cooperation between Member States, such as the use of proof of vaccination to be provided to citizens.  Next steps: \uf0b7 Conclusions from first overview of national vaccination plans in November. \uf0b7 Platform to be set up as part of strategy to monitor effectiveness of vaccine strategies as they are rolled out.   2.5.  Effective communication to citizens  Effective communication is a critical element of any public health crisis response. The success or failure of pandemic response largely depends on community engagement,                                                            8  The Emergency Support Instrument has been triggered as a financing arm of the Joint European Roadmap towards lifting coronavirus containment measures, to help Member States mitigating the immediate consequences of the pandemic and anticipate the needs related to the exit and recovery. 9  To be set up and funded under Horizon 2020 before end of 2020 10  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1694  11  Communication on preparedness for COVID-19 vaccination strategies and vaccine deployment, COM(2020) 680, 15 October 2020. https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1694 6  individual behaviour and adherence to public health recommendations. It is therefore imperative that there is a sustained communication effort to keep citizens up to date on epidemiological developments as well as possible restrictive measures, which need to be consistent and clear in order to foster compliance among citizens.  This is particularly important against a backdrop of the false and misleading information that continues to circulate, as well as to address the risk of \u201cpandemic fatigue\u201d and an increasing unwillingness to respect precautions such as physical distancing and reduced social interactions. Every effort should be made to ensure that targeted communication reaches segments of the population that are most vulnerable and those most likely to spread the disease through social interaction. It needs to be clear, consistent and up-to date. Special attention needs to be paid to social media monitoring and response. Vaccination is a specific area where public authorities need to step up their actions to tackle misinformation as a main cause of hesitancy, and coordinate on disinformation response. Next Steps: \u2022 All Member States should relaunch communication campaigns adapted to the current situation.  2.6. Securing essential supplies  Since the start of the outbreak, the EU has supported manufacturers to ensure availability of the essential medicines and medical equipment needed in the fight against COVID-19. This has included joint procurement and strategic medical stockpiling to build up key supplies. The large Joint Procurement framework contracts provide support to the preparedness work by Member States. In case of emergency needs, reflecting European solidarity, under both the rescEU reserve of medical equipment and the Emergency Support Instrument, equipment such as ventilators and masks as well as therapeutics, such as Remdesivir, have been delivered to the Member States with most acute needs. Efficient distribution inside an open Single Market makes a major contribution to the effective delivery of supplies essential to the medical response. The Commission will remain vigilant and react quickly to disproportionate unilateral restrictions on these or any other types of goods, which undermine the collective effort. Open Joint procurements (where participating Member States and countries can place orders) ITEMS AVAILABLE SINCE VOLUME (OVER 12 MONTHS) BUDGET CEILING  GLOVES AND COVERALLS April (gloves) May (coveralls) Several million  \u20ac97 million  EYE AND RESPIRATORY PROTECTION  April 20 million goggles 12 million face shields 37 million FFP2 masks 26 million FFP3 masks 301 million surgical masks \u20ac1,4 billion  7   As well as for tests (see above), a new Joint Procurement is also under way for medical equipment for vaccination (vaccine carriers, waste containers, injecting devices, disinfectants, personal protective equipment and anaesthetics). The EU has supported projects for the industrial repurposing of production capacities to meet urgently increased needs across Member States. Member States are invited to monitor the production capacity for essential medical supplies and map flexible production possibilities on their territory. In parallel, the EU led international efforts \u2013 in the G20 and bilaterally \u2013 to keep critical supply chains open and undisrupted. The next step will be for the EU to promote the \u201ctrade and health\u201d initiative in the World Trade Organisation to bring new actions and commitments on keeping healthcare goods moving across borders. One step taken was to support the market by reducing the burden of customs duties and value added tax (VAT). The Commission authorised requests from Member States to suspend temporarily customs duties and VAT on the import of medical equipment from non-EU countries. It defined an indicative list of goods, such as personal protective equipment, testing kits, ventilators and key medicines. This will now be extended to April 2021. There is also room to further adapt the VAT framework to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines and tests become more affordable for health services and citizens. The Commission is therefore proposing to temporarily adapt the rules to apply a reduced rate or exemptions of VAT in respect of COVID-19 testing kits, and to allow Member States to grant a zero rate in respect of COVID-19 vaccines.   Next steps:  \uf0b7 Take forward the new joint procurement for vaccination equipment. \uf0b7 Suspension of customs duties and VAT on imported medical equipment to the end of April 2021. \uf0b7 The Commission call on the Council to swiftly adopt the proposal on exemptions for testing kits and vaccines.  2.7 Facilitating safe travel Free movement within the EU and the border-free Schengen area are key achievements of European integration. At the worst periods of the first wave of the pandemic, many national governments and local authorities applied travel restrictions at the local or regional levels, and reintroduced internal borders controls inside the EU, with only essential travel permitted. As  VENTILATORS  April 110,000 units \u20ac1,4 billion  LABORATORY EQUIPMENT  May 30 different lots \u20ac192 million  MEDICINES USED IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS October (contracts are being signed) 21 medicines in  45 presentations,  over 103 million vials \u20ac543 million  REMDESIVIR (VEKLURY)  October Over 500,000 treatment courses \u20ac3,4 billion  8  the situation improved, controls on free movement inside and between Member States were lifted and most Member States opened their borders to non-essential travel. The improved coordination since then of measures linked to people moving around the EU further reduces any need for border controls. Any remaining COVID-19 related internal border control measures should therefore also be lifted.  Most Member States have nevertheless required travellers from other Member States to undergo quarantine or testing before or upon entry into their territory, with requirements modulated according to the epidemiological situation. While such restrictions can be justified in the interests of public health, they must be proportionate and must not discriminate between citizens of different Member States, either de jure or de facto12. In addition, a patchwork of different rules developed, with restrictions varying both in terms of which regions are covered and what measures are required upon entry (such as length of quarantine or the role of testing). This confusing situation was harmful to both the European economy and to citizens\u2019 exercise of their right to freedom of movement. For this reason, the Commission made proposals for a more coordinated approach13. The Council has adopted a Recommendation14 setting out a number of important steps towards clarity and consistency in defining regions according to their risk level. The ECDC has also started publishing the common map that should serve as the basis for Member States\u2019 risk assessments15. Member States should now implement these arrangements to give citizens and businesses clarity and predictability and the EU should continue to work on bringing the nature and extent of measures closer through a common approach.  As the epidemiological situation deteriorates, it will be crucial to maintain safe travel for professional and imperative family reasons. It is important to ensure a consistent implementation of the list of essential travellers exempted from quarantine requirements. This has important economic as well as personal implications, and we must allow our economy to continue functioning even as restrictions on non-essential movement are tightened to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation carefully. A testing protocol for travellers The European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are working together on guidelines on testing which could be used by public health authorities, airlines and airports to help the safe arrival of passengers16. This work is now being brought together in an EU Health Safety testing protocol, with the full involvement of national authorities. This would mean that common rules could be applied whenever testing is used, covering areas such as the timing of tests (both ahead of departure or upon arrival), proof of tests taken in another Member State, target groups, and the                                                            12  For example, de facto discrimination may result if mutual recognition of tests is not assured under a testing requirement. 13  Proposal for a Council Recommendation of 4 September 2020, COM(2020) 499 14  Council Recommendation 2020/1475 of 13 October 2020 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 15  Available at: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/situation-updates/weekly-maps-coordinated-restriction-free-movement  16  This will build on the Aviation Health Safety Protocol produced by EASA-ECDC in May 2020. The Joint Action EU Healthy Gateways has also worked on a common strategy for testing of travellers at EU international airports. https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/situation-updates/weekly-maps-coordinated-restriction-free-movementhttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/situation-updates/weekly-maps-coordinated-restriction-free-movement 9  resources and infrastructure needed at airports, which could be extended to other potential locations. Regard should at all times be had to the overriding criterion of proportionality17. Consistent quarantine rules  The development of testing strategies, based on validated technologies and available capacities, should also inform an EU policy on quarantine. At present, there is a wide variety of measures applied, as Member States assess the different impacts on health, restrictions on freedom and likely compliance. For example, some quarantine measures are implemented on a voluntary basis, others are mandatory; some take testing into account in the process; and the duration of isolation and quarantine likewise varies from 7 to 14 days. The Commission has tasked the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to provide scientific guidance on quarantines, with a view to working with Member States on a common and proportionate European approach. A Common Passenger Locator Form Passenger Locator Forms help Member States undertake risk assessment of arrivals and enable contact tracing. The Council has agreed to work towards a common digital European Passenger Locator Form which would help both the swift processing of the information and improve data exchange between Member States. Work has been under way since July to develop this approach18 so that a common system can be put in place. Full respect for data protection requirements is needed. Each EU Member State would have access only to their national data, and personal data exchange for contact tracing would occur through existing channels. A pilot next month will allow Member States to prepare for its use and pave the way to launch the EU Passenger Locator Form in December. Re-open EU Planning and making a trip in Europe is becoming more complex by the day and citizens need clear information to minimise risks and costs. To provide timely and accurate information on health measures and travel restrictions in all Member States, the Commission launched the \u2018Re-open EU\u2019 online tool in mid-June. Nearly 7 million visitors have used the service since its launch. Once Member States provide a full information flow to the ECDC, it will become the one-stop-shop for information about the state of health measures and travel possibilities inside the EU.  Tools like Re-open EU are crucial in terms of helping citizens make informed decisions to travel while keeping safe and healthy, and in supporting the economy. Tourism makes up some 10% of EU GDP, and is as high as some 25% in some Member States. A mobile Re-open EU app is being developed and will be launched in the coming weeks. The impact is of course lessened when information arrives late or is incomplete, such as failing to reflect regional differences in the measures in place. In order to maximise the benefits of this tool and make sure that information is accurate and up-to-date, the Commission calls on Member States to:                                                             17 For example, the relative costs and benefits of rapid testing during a waiting period for boarding at an airport or port are quite different to those applicable to road transport at border crossings. 18  Communication on Short-term EU health preparedness for COVID-19 outbreaks, COM/2020/318 final, 15 July 2020. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_-_short-term_eu_health_preparedness.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_-_short-term_eu_health_preparedness.pdf 10  \uf0b7 Provide timely and frequent updates of health and travel measures, when measures change and prior to announcement.  \uf0b7 Provide complete and accurate information.  \uf0b7 Provide regional information, where possible and relevant.  Guidance on essential travel from outside the EU In March 2020, a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU was introduced and was extended several times. The result was a list of countries for which travel restrictions on non-essential travel could be lifted, which has been regularly updated. One aspect of the Recommendation was to define certain categories of people to be considered as essential and therefore be exempted from the restrictions. This needs to be further refined, and the Commission is adopting guidance to promote consistent application. The Commission will keep the Recommendation under review in order to update the criteria used as the situation evolves. Next steps:   \uf0b7 Full implementation of the Council Recommendation of 13 October 2020 by Member States and further steps towards a common approach on restrictions to free movement. \uf0b7 Commission to work with ECDC and member States on a common approach on quarantine (ECDC contribution in November 2020). \uf0b7 Common EU digital Passenger Locator Form to be launched in December 2020. \uf0b7 A mobile Re-open EU app to be launched in the coming weeks. \uf0b7 Review of the criteria used for Common approach on free movement to be applied by all Member States    2.8  Extending the Green Lanes  The application of Green Lanes \u2013 most notably for road freight to cross borders in less than 15 minutes \u2013 has been instrumental in maintaining the supply of goods and the economic fabric of the EU. This has made a major contribution to limiting the damage of the pandemic to daily life. Some restrictions continue to hamper the situation, including the application of quarantine restrictions and the closure of essential services for freight drivers: these should be addressed. Closing borders leads to serious delays, affecting trucks and their goods, as well as service providers and frontier workers. The Commission proposes to extend the Green Lane approach to ensure that multi-modal transport works effectively by extension to areas including rail freight, air cargo and waterborne freight, and to make specific arrangements for seafarers. Extending the Green Lane approach would aim at ensuring that where Member States in fact impose temporary restrictions at borders or sanitary controls, these do not excessively hamper the Single Market, and in particular, the free movement of goods, the freedom to provide cross-border services, and the free movement of frontier workers and transport workers across borders.  Next step:   \uf0b7 The Commission will monitor to ensure that more than 90% of border crossing points continue to be permanently fluid with under 15 min crossing time.   11  3. CONCLUSION: BUILDING A STRONGER FRAMEWORK FOR THE FUTURE  While working continuously on improving the global, European and national response to the resurgent pandemic, lessons must also be learned to put in place a robust system for the future. COVID-19 has revealed a number of shortcomings in the EU\u2019s health crisis response structures and actions and ad hoc responses have meant that the potential of coordination has not been used to the full. Member States should now heed their own call for a more consistent and coordinated approach.  The Commission will adopt a package of initiatives on 11 November, establishing the first building blocks of a European Health Union. It will include a proposal on tackling serious cross-border health threats, setting out a more comprehensive approach to crisis preparedness, surveillance and response. It will also include changes to the mandates of the European Centre for Disease Control and the European Medicines Agency, to improve their capacities to contribute to crisis preparedness and response. These measures will address more structural gaps and upgrades that are needed to the EU\u2019s health security framework. Other changes for the future include the need for more built-in emergency contingencies in the transport sector.  The months ahead will be challenging. The capacity of healthcare to respond will be put to the test, and governments will face difficult choices about what restrictions are needed to control the spread of the virus. The steps set out in the Communication show how the EU can and must act to bring a European dimension to the efforts to combat the resurgence of infection. Cooperation is essential to using the potential of new technologies, to ensure that scarce resources are deployed to best effect, and to ensuring that citizens and business can continue to benefit from the economic and societal benefits of the Single Market. The measures proposed should be swiftly followed up at Member State as well as EU level.

A FRAGILE SITUATION As the end of 2020 approaches, the world continues to face an expanding global pandemic. While the SARS-CoV-2 virus is better understood and the healthcare systems across the EU are better prepared, the high number of cases might quickly overrun even the best prepared hospital and overwhelm the best designed strategies.  Every 17 seconds, a person dies in the EU due to COVID-19. It is essential to control the spread of the virus and avoid further deaths and severe illness. The upcoming holiday season poses particular risks in this fragile context due to the drop in temperature and the social proximity it entails. It will be a different type of festive season; one where individual and collective responsibility will save lives. This Communication provides recommendations to Member States aiming to keep the number of COVID-19 cases down and avoid losing the progress made so far at great cost. Further recommendations will be presented early next year, to design a comprehensive COVID-19 control framework based on the knowledge and experience so far and the latest available scientific guidelines. The strict control measures, implemented by countries across the EU from March this year onwards in response to the first pandemic wave, were able to successfully slow down the spread of the virus and sharply diminish the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations, saving lives across the continent.  Numbers stabilised over the summer period. The relaxation of restrictions \u2013 facilitated in part by the summer temperatures \u2013 provided a much-needed boost for social well-being of Europeans, and to economies hard-hit by the pandemic. However, the autumn surge in numbers shows the risk of failing to anticipate a rapidly changing epidemiological situation, and the need to make any relaxation of measures conditional on both the evolution of the pandemic and having sufficient capacity for testing, contact tracing and treating patients. Health services and health workers have again been under enormous pressure. As a result, many European countries reintroduced new lockdowns and strict social restrictions in October.  The latest epidemiological numbers indicate that the COVID-19 restrictions reintroduced since October are starting to reduce the transmission of the virus.  Moreover, COVID-19 vaccine producers have started to publish promising results in terms of vaccine efficacy. Over recent weeks, Pfizer/BioNTech1 and Moderna2 announced in the press that first results are showing a vaccine efficacy rate of around 95%, with minimal side-effects, followed by the announcement from AstraZeneca3 that their vaccine candidate has shown an average efficacy of 70%. These, and other vaccines, will progressively go through the rigorous process of review by the European Medicines Agency to ensure they are safe and effective. Within the next weeks, and provided there is a positive independent scientific assessment, we should see the first authorisation of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in the EU, ensuring that Member States and their citizens will eventually have access to the vaccines, thanks to EU\u2019s advance purchases of vaccines.                                                             1 https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against 2 https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy 3 https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222hlr.html  2  Whilst priority groups may start receiving vaccines soon after they are authorised, it will take time before COVID-19 vaccines are more widely available. The EU and its Member States therefore need a bridging strategy to manage the situation for the coming months until vaccines are deployed with sufficient critical mass and their protective effects are felt.  This Communication follows the guidance and recommendations published by the Commission in April4, July5 and October6 on COVID-19 measures. It sets out a number of measures to be considered by Member States, while fully respecting their competences, in particular in the area of health, when designing their national approaches towards a more sustainable way of managing the pandemic over the coming months, including the festive end-of-year period. It covers both restrictions on social and economic life and actions to strengthen healthcare systems in their response to fight the pandemic. Taken together, and based on close cooperation at European level, they support a coordinated approach to winter containment measures and curtailing new outbreaks of COVID-19 infections in the EU.  As before, decisions must be taken in a coordinated and targeted manner. Isolated measures will weaken the overall response to the pandemic, will derail progress achieved and lead to a longer period of high incidence with all known negative consequences. Coordination at EU level and with neighbouring regions is essential for mitigating cross-border issues, a continued rise in the number of cases and sustained negative economic and social impacts. Therefore, the countries neighbouring the EU, especially those participating in the EU Health Security Committee as observers, are also invited to align with these measures. 2. PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND LIMITING SOCIAL CONTACTS REMAIN KEY The current measures implemented across the EU remain the main public health tool to control and manage COVID-19 outbreaks. These include physical distancing measures and limitations in social contacts, widespread use of masks, use of remote working solutions wherever possible, closure of public places, and limitations of the number of people allowed at indoor and outdoor gatherings; all this accompanied by increasing testing and contract tracing. The importance of these measures cannot be overstated, as they have proven to be crucial in slowing down the spread of the virus and in saving lives.  Whilst effective, some of these measures have a considerable negative impact on the general well-being of people, the functioning of society, and the economy. However, the quick transmission of the virus and ensuing risk can be increased by cultural traditions such as end-of-year festivities and gatherings or ceremonies. The usual public gatherings inevitably bring a risk of becoming \u2018super spreading\u2019 events, with an impact on those taking part, and on wider society. Colder weather conditions also mean that such gatherings would often take place indoors, where risks of transmission are much greater. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has therefore stressed that the use of \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d, which encompass the current measures, should be guided by data on the local epidemiological situation and take into                                                            4 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020JC0011 5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0318 6 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-additional-covid-19-response-measures.pdf  3  consideration community transmission levels.7 In addition to the epidemiological situation, any decision on the optimal strategy for implementation of non-pharmaceutical measures needs to take into account the characteristics of the population being targeted. The goal should be to implement non-pharmaceutical measures in the most effective and targeted manner, while minimising their personal, social and economic impact. The successful approach of avoiding the three C's: closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings should be reinforced.  The buy-in of citizens and communities is critical to the success of any action. This is more likely to be achieved if measures are clear, proportionate, communicated transparently and do not change too often. It would therefore be helpful for Member States to set, and communicate, quantified goals and epidemiological targets, taking into consideration the local and national capacity of the public health and healthcare systems. Insights into mobility patterns and role in both the disease spread and containment should ideally feed into such targeted measures. The Commission has used anonymised and aggregated mobile network operators\u2019 data to derive mobility insights8 and build tools to inform better targeted measures, in a Mobility Visualisation Platform, available to the Member States. Mobility insights are also useful in monitoring the effectiveness of measures once imposed.   The ECDC has stressed that policymakers should keep in mind that there may be a delay of up to 40 days between the introduction of measures and an observed effect on the trajectory of the epidemic \u2013 considerably longer than the incubation period of the infection. This may be related to the time it takes for behavioural change to take effect, for chains of transmission to diminish in size, and for delays in reporting9. It is a lesson on how important it is to thoroughly assess the impact before gradually lifting any measure. While COVID-19 infection rates are slowly starting to stabilise in some EU countries, albeit at high absolute levels, any potential easing of current restrictions needs to be done very carefully to ensure that further outbreaks are kept to a minimum and under control. A recent publication by ECDC10 shows that, based on mathematical modelling and the current epidemiological situation, if countries were to lift all their measures on 7 December, this may result in hospitalisation rates increasing around 24 December. On the other hand, if countries were to lift all their measures on 21 December, there would be a subsequent increase in COVID-19 hospital admissions in those countries as early as the first week of January 2021. These simulations show that in the current epidemiological context in the EU, it is difficult to justify lifting control measures. Member States are encouraged to use scenario-based modelling to inform decisions11.                                                            7 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-guidelines-non-pharmaceutical-interventions-september-2020.pdf.

The Commission strongly encourages Member States to consider this guidance.    RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR MEMBER STATES  \uf0b7 Pursue measures on physical distancing, use of masks, hand washing and other hygiene measures as they continue to be key to contain virus spread in social gatherings, both indoors and outdoors, and in families with people at higher risk.  \uf0b7 Put measures in place to ensure appropriate care for vulnerable people, particularly in case of restrictions and closures; e.g. elderly people who live alone or in residential care (for both need to ensure continued access to health and social care, measures to prevent loneliness and isolation), people suffering from mental ill-health and people experiencing homelessness. Also ensure that persons with disabilities are provided with the appropriate care and information in accessible formats. \uf0b7 Consider not allowing any mass gatherings, and define clear criteria for the exceptional events that can go ahead, e.g. maximum number of people allowed for indoor and outdoor social gatherings and specific control measures.   \uf0b7 Define clear criteria for small social gatherings, small events, e.g. maximum number of people allowed to ensure compliance with physical distancing rules and use of masks.   \uf0b7 Continue to set clear criteria for household gatherings (i.e. maximum number of people per household gathering).  \uf0b7 If considered, any temporary loosening of rules on social gatherings and events should be accompanied by strict requirements for people to self-quarantine before and after for a number of days (preferably at least seven). \uf0b7 Encourage employers to allow people to work from home or from the place where they intend to spend their end-of-year festivities some days before and after \u2013 preferably around seven days, whenever possible. This will allow workers to self-quarantine before engaging in social or household gatherings, or events and/or before coming back to workplaces. Where the remote working is not possible, employers must put in place measures that would allow safe return to work12.                                                              12 https://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/covid-19-back-workplace-adapting-workplaces-and-protecting-workers/view  5  \uf0b7 If considered, when loosening restrictions, implement the use of \u201chousehold bubbles\u201d, which means that people are encouraged to spend the days of the festivities with the same people and to reduce further social contacts.  \uf0b7 Remind citizens that they should be particularly careful concerning contacts with older family members or those who belong to specific groups at risk for severe COVID-19, such as people with chronic diseases13.  \uf0b7 Introduce or maintain night time curfews.  \uf0b7 Provide guidance and advice on overnight visitors and visits to households (particularly in case of night curfews).  \uf0b7 Encourage the organisation of online social gatherings and events, such as workplace end-of-year celebrations.   \uf0b7 In order to reduce transmission risks in the period following the festive season, consider extending school holidays or introducing a period of online learning as a way of introducing a buffer period and avoiding infections to be brought into schools. In such cases it will be important to specify a date several days before the return to school by which time families with children and educators are asked to have returned home in case they have travelled. \uf0b7 In case of ceremonies, consider avoiding large services or using online, TV or radio broadcasts, allocating specific spots for close families (\u201chousehold bubbles\u201d) to sit together, and banning of communal singing. The use of masks is particularly relevant during these types of gatherings.   3. REINFORCING TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING Testing and contact tracing remain crucial elements for monitoring, containing and mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Backward and forward contact tracing is an essential tool to detect infection clusters and avoid further transmission. Effective testing also plays a key role in the smooth functioning of the single market as it allows for targeted isolation or quarantine measures. Testing and contact tracing will be central to control strategies, particularly to monitor the impact of any loosening of measures. As also stressed by the Commission in its Communication on additional COVID-19 measures14, adopted on 28 October, swift action by EU countries, supported by the Commission, is required to address current shortfalls in access to testing, testing capacities, shortages in testing materials and long testing turn-around-times (the time between the test request and result), which are limiting the effective implementation of mitigation measures as well as swift contact tracing.  In this context, the use of rapid antigen tests, which is a generation of faster and cheaper COVID-19 tests, allowing for a result in often less than 30 minutes are increasingly being explored by Member States. A specific Commission Recommendation15, addressing the use of these types of tests, provides guidance for countries regarding their use. In particular, two                                                            13 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/latest-evidence 14 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-additional-covid-19-response-measures.pdf 15 https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/preparedness_response/docs/sarscov2_rapidantigentests_recommendation_en.pdf https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/latest-evidence 6  aspects are of increasing importance: the independent clinical validation of the tests and mutual recognition of rapid antigen test results between countries. Experiences with regards the mutual recognition of rapid antigen test results as well as data, new evidence and publications on clinical validation studies carried out by EU countries are shared and discussed on a continuous basis in the Health Security Committee.  A specific ECDC guidance on rapid antigen tests16 points to the most important opportunities with the use of these tests are to quickly detect highly infectious cases and to facilitate rapid self-isolation to avoid further transmission.  Most Member States have now launched a national contact tracing and warning app to complement manual contact tracing measures based on the Recommendation17 and Toolbox, and are in the process of connecting to the European Federated Gateway Server (EFGS). The more people use an app, the likelier the positive effect on combating the virus.  As a result, the more Member State that launch an App, and join the EFGS the more effective these technologies will be. Effective back-office systems in Member States are essential to support the implementation of digital contact tracing. It is also important to have mechanisms that provide citizens with clear and swift information on what to do. Citizens are encouraged to download their national app and contribute to overcoming the pandemic.  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR MEMBER STATES  \uf0b7 Ensure sufficient testing capacities and materials, and set a target for testing rates per 100.000 population.  \uf0b7 Ensure easy and free access to testing for citizens with quick results. \uf0b7 Focus efforts on ensuring a short testing turn-around-time to facilitate the swift identification of positive COVID-19 cases; in the case of RT-PCR, the testing turn-around-time should be less than 24 hours and the use of rapid antigen tests could be explored in case of limited RT-PCR testing capacity and increased testing turn-around-times where appropriate. \uf0b7 Investigate the use of rapid tests in addition to RT-PCR where appropriate, and focus efforts on early detection of most infectious cases and quick self-isolation of these individuals. \uf0b7 Rapid antigen tests are best used in high prevalence settings and up to five days post symptom onset.  \uf0b7 Rapid antigen tests should go through independent clinical validation and mutual recognition of results between countries should be ensured, as elaborated on in the Commission Recommendation published on 28 October.  \uf0b7 Strengthen the deployment of digital contact tracing and warning Apps or manual contract tracing if more appropriate.                                                                16 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Options-use-of-rapid-antigen-tests-for-COVID-19.pdf 17 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_670  7  4. MAINTAINING SAFE TRAVEL WITHIN AND ACROSS THE EU  At present, the majority of Member States advise against all but essential travel, and the majority have tracing and/or quarantine requirements for people crossing borders. On 13 October, the Council adopted a Recommendation on a coordinated approach to the restrictions of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic18, aiming to avoid fragmentation and disruption, and to increase clarity and predictability for citizens and businesses. The Recommendation states that any measures restricting free movement to protect public health must be proportionate and non-discriminatory, and must be lifted as soon as the epidemiological situation allows. On the basis of the Recommendation, the ECDC has been publishing, on a weekly basis, a traffic-light map using agreed criteria and thresholds19. Member States expecting an increase in travel, both inside and between Member States and particularly during the end-of-the-year festive season, will need to carefully plan ahead. Airports, bus stations, train stations, public transport, refuelling stations, and resting areas are all places where travellers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. Travellers should be provided with the relevant advice and real-time information both on the applicable restrictions as well as the public health guidance 20 and the application of physical distancing, wearing of masks and strict hygiene rules should be thoroughly observed at such locations.   During the winter months, winter tourism is a popular activity in the EU. Given its cross-border aspects, Member States should carefully consider a common approach based on coordination, coherence and scientific evidence. This could be discussed in the Integrated political crisis response (IPCR) on the basis of scientific guidance by the ECDC. Whilst travel itself is a risk factor, the generalised widespread transmission of COVID-19 across Member States means that at present, intra-EU cross-border travel does not present a significant added risk. In the context of air travel, and under the current epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA and the UK and based on existing evidence, ECDC and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) do not recommend quarantine and/or testing of for air travellers for SARS-CoV-2 when travelling to/from zones with a similar epidemiological situation, as outlined in the guidelines for COVID-19 testing and quarantine of air travellers was published on 2 December. What is important is to improve information flow in such cases: this includes simple procedures for passenger locator forms where possible digitalised; an effective link between cross-border information and contact tracing capacities in the community, in full respect of data protection rules; and coordinated communication between aviation stakeholders and public health authorities, as well as tourism accommodation establishment.  To enhance contact tracing capabilities across borders, Member States are encouraged to support ongoing efforts to develop a common EU digital Passenger Locator Form (PLF) and to join the exchange platform developed by EASA for air transport in time for the end-of-2020 travelling season. The more countries participate, the higher the benefits in terms of accelerating and simplifying contact tracing linked to travel.                                                            18 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/do/document/ST-11689-2020-REV-1/en/pdf 19 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/situation-updates/weekly-maps-coordinated-restriction-free-movement  20 For example: https://reopen.europa.eu/ https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/situation-updates/weekly-maps-coordinated-restriction-free-movementhttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/situation-updates/weekly-maps-coordinated-restriction-free-movement 8  Should Member States opt to maintain or introduce travel related quarantines, they should do so in line with the principles of Council Recommendation 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restrictions of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and agree on a common approach to coordinate their measures and inform citizens in advance of any measure taking effect. This should be discussed in the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR).   RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR MEMBER STATES  \uf0b7 Where available, encourage persons who intend to travel to get the season flu vaccine. \uf0b7 Reinforce communication campaigns to strongly discourage persons with symptoms of COVID-19 from travelling. \uf0b7 Where possible, public transport options and capacities should be increased to reduce crowding, particularly on days or at times expected to be relatively busier to ensure social distancing. The use of masks should be compulsory in public transport and all vehicles should be well ventilated. \uf0b7 Ensure that workers in transport, tourism and other exposed sectors are provided with necessary information and protection measures to ensure their own health and safety.  \uf0b7 Ensure that if quarantine and testing of travellers is requested (i.e. in the situation where a country has reduced transmission levels to close to zero), these requirements are proportionate, non-discriminatory, clearly communicated and easily followed, and assess how testing can lead to lifting of quarantine or other restrictions for travellers. \uf0b7 Where quarantine requirements are imposed for travel from a high-risk area, consider shortening required quarantine time should a negative PCR test be obtained after 7 days upon return.  \uf0b7 Ensure that travel infrastructure, including control stations, is prepared, equipped and manned, respecting the hygiene protocols in place, so that risks to travellers are minimised as far as possible by reducing to the minimum waiting times, crowding and congestion. \uf0b7 Ensure that national measures are aligned with the principles and mechanisms of Council Recommendation 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \uf0b7 Join the exchange platform developed by EASA to enhance contact tracing capabilities based on PLFs and support efforts towards a common EU digital PLF.  5. PRIORITISING HEALTHCARE CAPACITY AND PERSONNEL  With hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy rates and numbers of new admissions to hospitals still being high and increasing in the majority of EU countries, a continued focus and prioritising of healthcare capacity and personnel is of utmost importance. Given the high probability of an increase in COVID-19 cases in case of relaxation of measures concurrently with the festive period, EU Member States should ensure that their health systems are ready for possible increased admissions. They should avoid any risks of shortages of essential equipment and materials, as well as ensuring the well-being of healthcare personnel facing huge pressure and on whom the system is dependent.   9  Besides hospitals, primary care providers are involved in combating infection and disease consequences in numerous ways: implementing a triage system in a coordinated and transparent manner, testing, supporting quarantine, and providing psycho-social response. Some public authorities in Europe established fever clinics as the primary care arrangements. The role of general practitioners in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the community has become increasingly important due to their key role in testing and contact tracing, as well as meeting post-COVID-19 diagnosis care needs and addressing the care needs of the general population. To boost capacity, many countries created alternate care sites in converted premises or mobile field hospitals, used social care facilities as well as novel forms of public-private partnerships to respond in a socially accountable way to nationwide demand.21 Addressing and ensuring the well-being of all health care staff remains an absolute priority. EU Member States should guarantee access to adequate personal protective equipment to all health care staff, as well as to support services to alleviate the mental health impact from the exceptional stress levels health professionals have been subjected to during the crisis. Guaranteeing timely access to mental health support for health professionals is important especially in light of emerging evidence suggesting that the psychological drain from the health crisis may have long-term effects on their well-being. For example, in Italy, a survey of health care workers in March 2020 found increased symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia, especially amongst frontline workers and young females. In Spain, research found that in April 2020, 57% of health workers presented with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder22.  In parallel to this, the continuation of healthcare services other than those linked to COVID-19 are of the same great importance. The current pandemic has had \u2013 and is still having \u2013 major implications on the diagnosis and treatment of other diseases and health problems including cancer. Temporary disruptions in routine and non-emergency medical care access and delivery have been observed during periods of considerable community transmission.  For example, several countries, such as Italy, reported that admissions for acute myocardial infarction were significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a parallel increase in fatality and complication rates23. Moreover, in France, the number of cancer diagnoses decreased by 35-50% in April 2020, as compared to April 201924, and the Netherlands Cancer Registry has seen as much as a 40% decline in weekly cancer incidence25. This is despite many countries prioritizing cancer, cardiovascular and diabetes services. Also, in the area of supply and use of blood for transfusion, studies indicate that countries should anticipate reductions in donations and loss of crucial staff because of sickness and public health restrictions26. Contingency planning includes prioritisation policies for patients in the event of predicted shortage.  The delay or avoidance of medical care because of COVID-19 is also an area of particular concern, as it might increase morbidity and mortality risk associated with treatable and preventable health conditions and might contribute to reported excess deaths directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. While controlling the pandemic is of utmost importance, the                                                            21 https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/expert_panel/docs/026_health_socialcare_covid19_en.pdf 22 https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/state/docs/2020_healthatglance_rep_en.pdf 23 De Rosa, Spaccarotella et al. 2020 24 https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/state/docs/2020_healthatglance_rep_en.pdf  26 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352302620301861  10  long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases is significant. These diseases appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, and SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with non-communicable diseases may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Additionally, physical distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing non-communicable diseases risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Many countries have made changes to routine management of patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for non-communicable diseases management, diagnosis of new-onset diseases, medication adherence and disease progression27. The Commission is working with pharmaceutical companies to achieve access to new therapeutics currently under regulatory approval (e.g. antibodies), and will ensure developments are swiftly shared with the Member States.  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR MEMBER STATES  \uf0b7 Ensure that healthcare services are reinforced for increased hospital and ICU admissions in view of the upcoming festive season, for example by putting in place specific COVID-19 business continuity plans, surge capacities in staff and equipment that ensure maintaining healthcare personnel capacity while at the same time allowing some reprieve.  \uf0b7 Take steps to maximise the accessibility of primary care service to alleviated pressure on hospitals, including by expanding the role of nurses, pharmacists and community health workers, and via increasing the use of telehealth services, to preserve continuity of care for non-COVID\u2011 19 patients. \uf0b7 Carefully monitor capacities of required healthcare equipment and materials, and make use of the relevant Joint Procurements and other financial support, including the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII)28 made available by the Commission.  \uf0b7 Countries should develop integrated strategies for their healthcare systems, ensuring that care for diseases and medical problems other than those linked to COVID-19 can continue and be safeguarded.  \uf0b7 Continue investing in the training of new staff, including via the Online European network of clinicians and development of training modules on COVID-19 for health professionals (including via a virtual academy) in partnership with European federations, such as the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. \uf0b7 Encourage citizens to follow up all necessary medical services, including those taking place in hospitals.  \uf0b7 Healthcare facilities should further ensure that the most protective PPE is available now and in the months to come and appropriately used to safeguard those providing patient and resident care.   \uf0b7 Support healthcare personnel to cope with increased pressure due to the pandemic (e.g. by putting in place free of charge support hotlines, free peer support service, provide information to help manage wellbeing and mental health).                                                             27 https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc7248450 28 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1864  11  6. ADDRESSING \u201cPANDEMIC FATIGUE\u201d  The resurgence of COVID-19 this autumn inevitably brought disappointment to Europeans having to face restrictions they had thought they had left behind. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 60% of countries in the European region are currently experiencing a form of \u201cpandemic fatigue\u201d29. People are tired of taking the necessary precautionary actions, including physical distancing, reduced social interactions and economic restrictions. This makes essential restrictions more difficult to implement, and provides fertile ground for disinformation about the pandemic. Pandemic fatigue is an expected and natural response to a prolonged public health crisis on the scale of COVID-19. It is therefore important for Member States to address and recognise this problem. The WHO Regional Office for Europe has developed guidance to support countries in developing multifactorial action plans to maintain and reinvigorate public support for protective behaviours30.  In addition to the pandemic fatigue, the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of populations should not be underestimated. The concern and destabilisation felt by the population at large can be particularly acute amongst the most vulnerable groups such as older adults or people with underlying health conditions, those living alone, or persons with disabilities. Health and care workers are particularly exposed, and best practices to reduce the impact on these and other front-line workers should be promoted. The main psychological impact to date is elevated rates of stress or anxiety31. But as new measures are introduced \u2013 especially stay-at-home policies, quarantine and prolonged curfews and their effects on many people\u2019s usual activities, routines or livelihoods \u2013 levels of loneliness, depression, harmful alcohol and drug use, and self-harm, domestic violence or suicidal behaviour also rise32. Member States should be addressing these issues and ensure that appropriate measures and services are put in place for those in need.  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR MEMBER STATES  \uf0b7 Clearly communicate to citizens and communities on new measures, the reasons why these are being implemented and when and how they might be lifted. If possible, link it to certain targets, such as the reproduction value, to make the measures tangible and understandable. Citizen\u00b4s buy in and compliance with measures is essential. \uf0b7 Ensure the availability of and easy access to mental health and psychosocial support services for people in need, including frontline and essential workers or service providers (e.g. free of charge support hotlines). Provide support to persons with disabilities and vulnerable populations. \uf0b7 The Health policy platform has brought stakeholders together to identify numerous best practices from the first wave of the pandemic which could be promoted with Commission support at the request of Member States.                                                             29 https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/statements/statement-rising-covid-19-fatigue-and-a-pan-regional-response 30 https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/335820/WHO-EURO-2020-1160-40906-55390-eng.pdf 31 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/covid-19-and-counter-measures-both-detrimental-mental-health 32 https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/publications-and-technical-guidance/noncommunicable-diseases/mental-health-and-covid-19  12  7. THE IMPORTANCE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION STRATEGIES  As Europe learns to live with the pandemic, the development and swift global deployment of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 remains an essential element in the eventual solution to the public health crisis. In line with the 17 June EU Strategy for COVID-19 vaccines33, the European Commission and Member States are securing the production of vaccines against COVID-19 through Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers. Any vaccine will need to be authorised by the Commission following a rigorous analysis by the European Medicine Agency according to regular safety and efficacy standards.  The Commission has also set out the need for the access to safe and effective vaccines across Europe, to be matched by a coordinated approach of vaccination strategies for deployment of the vaccines. Member States should ensure that the transport services and logistics needed for the safe delivery of the vaccines are planned accordingly. In case of need, the Commission stands ready to support Member States in the deployment of vaccines via the Union Civil Protection Mechanism and other relevant schemes. On 15 October34, the Commission presented key elements to be taken into consideration by Member States for their COVID-19 vaccination strategies to ensure orderly and timely deployment, related to required capacities of vaccination services, easy, affordable and preferably free of charge access for the population, transport and storage capacities, and communication to citizens on the benefits, risks and importance of COVID-19 vaccines. As the overall number of vaccine doses will be limited during the initial stages of deployment and before production can be ramped up, the Communication also provides examples of priority groups to be targeted by vaccination first.  Member States have shared knowledge and experiences, and reported on the development of national vaccination strategies, including the definition of population groups and communities that will be prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination. Priority target groups defined by reporting Member States include older persons, healthcare workers, workers of essential public services other than health, transport personnel, persons with chronic diseases, persons with disabilities and social care workers. The large majority of Member States that have reported on the current state of play of their vaccination strategies are planning to offer COVID-19 vaccination free of charge, and some will be using vaccination centres across their country to ensure that they will reach populations in rural areas or groups who have difficulties in accessing vaccination services or centres.   Many European countries are currently revising their vaccination infrastructures, in particular to ensure additional cold chain capacity, and are reinforcing existing vaccination services by recruiting and training additional healthcare staff. Concerning the medical and personal protective equipment needed for vaccination services, most reporting Member States plan to use current reserves, but many countries also plan to stockpile items via national or EU joint procurement procedures, in particular concerning items specifically required for COVID-19 vaccination.  In case national capacities are overwhelmed, Member States could request assistance via the Union Civil Protection Mechanism via both the EU Civil Protection Pool and the rescEU stockpile of emergency medical equipment. Together with this Communication, the ECDC has published its \u201cOverview of current EU/EEA and UK deployment and vaccination plans for COVID-19 vaccines\u201d. Based on this document,                                                            33 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1597339415327&uri=CELEX:52020DC0245 34 https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/vaccination/docs/2020_strategies_deployment_en.pdf  13  discussions in the Health Security Committee and ECDC surveys, the Commission will consider the need for further guidance on national vaccination plans for COVID-19. Once COVID-19 vaccines will become available, and it will then be known which vaccines with which specific characteristics and requirements will enter the market, the Commission will publish specific recommendations on how such vaccines are best to be used and deployed. In parallel, the Commission and the EEAS will continue to engage with the WHO and international partners to support a global access and deployment roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as to lead the global response in support of partner countries and exchange best practice in measures to control and bring an end to the pandemic. Vaccination registries, paper based or in the form of Immunization Information Systems (IIS) are in place in most countries, or are in the process of being updated, and will be key to ensure that COVID-19 vaccination data can be processed. These are an important tool for vaccination programmes. They hold data both at the personal and population levels, and are a valuable resource for individuals and the community. Individuals are empowered to make informed decisions on vaccination, while improving the ability to detect patterns of vaccination in the community leads to better targeted vaccination programmes and consequently better public health.   All reporting Member States are actively looking into communication around COVID-19 vaccination, and many are preparing dedicated communication plans. The Commission will work closely with Member States to support their communication efforts towards citizens on COVID-19 vaccines so that citizens can make informed decisions.  With vaccines now around the corner, there are international efforts to take forward the development of electronic vaccination information systems and vaccination certificates, including in digital forms in order to ensure the close monitoring of vaccination and surveillance of adverse effects and provide citizens trusted tools to display vaccination status. A common approach to trusted, reliable and verifiable vaccination certificates across the EU, would reinforce the public health response in Member States and the trust of citizens in the vaccination effort.  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR MEMBER STATES  \uf0b7 Further development of COVID-19 vaccination strategies, taking into consideration the elements highlighted in the Commission Communication of 15 October 2020 and ECDC advice.  \uf0b7 Reporting of Member States to the ECDC on their COVID-19 vaccination strategies, and sharing their knowledge and experiences, also in the context of fora such as the Health Security Committee and the National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups collaboration (NITAG). \uf0b7 Member States should coordinate efforts in tackling the misinformation and disinformation around a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in coordination and collaboration with international bodies and online platforms. The Commission will facilitate these efforts.     14  8. A DIFFERENT END OF THE YEAR Europe has made considerable advances in understanding how to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in the course of 2020. Promising vaccines might bring an end to the pandemic.  But the reality is that the EU still faces several difficult months ahead before large-scale deployment of vaccines permit a significant improvement in the lives of citizens. In the meantime, the relaxation of measures must be gradual.  A rushed de-escalation of protective measures should be avoided, or it will lead to stronger and more restrictive control measures after the end-of-year festivities and over a longer period of time. The support and buy-in of citizens will be decisive in overcoming this difficult period. Support for those whose mental health has been negatively impacted by the pandemic is a crucial element in helping EU citizens collectively endure restrictions on their daily lives for a while longer. Similarly, supporting those businesses and employees enduring hardship due to the necessary restrictions is essential. Proportionality of introduced measures and clear communication as to the measures imposed, and the rationale behind them, will be of the greatest importance in the coming months. Lack of consistency across Member States has been a major source of confusion for many EU citizens during this period. For this reason, it is important that Member States continue coordinate their approaches with the European Commission and to keep each other clearly informed about the measures they are taking, and the decision-making framework within which they are operating. Cooperation and coordination at EU level remain essential to design and implement a coherent evidence-based control framework to overcome the pandemic in a sustained and effective way. The EU Strategy for COVID-19 vaccines, which led to the EU advance purchase agreements on vaccines, shows that joint efforts bring better results. It should serve as a model for a structured common approach to responding to COVID-19. With these measures the EU will continue its efforts to overcome the pandemic. It will be a different kind of end of the year. One with restrictions, masks and social distance. However, it will be an occasion to rest and gather strength for the continued challenge posed by the pandemic. Everyone\u2019s efforts count.  "}]}
