Eligible businesses can now register for the scheme on the Revenue Online Service (ROS). The registration process will include providing details such as the location of the business and average weekly turnover for 2019. The claims process will be available from mid-November. Once they have registered, a taxpayer will be able to make a claim for the period their business is limited from operating due to public health guidelines and restrictions.                The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.                The details of the scheme have been published in the Finance Bill 2020 and the key features of the scheme are:                \tCRSS is designed to assist those businesses whose trade has been significantly impacted or temporarily closed as a result of the restrictions as set out in the government\u2019s \u2018Living with COVID-19\u2019 Plan\tthe scheme will generally operate when Level 3 or higher is in place and will cease when restrictions are lifted\tthe scheme will apply to businesses where government restrictions prohibit or reduce access by customers to their business premises\tqualifying businesses can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a cash payment in respect of an advance credit for trading expenses for the period of the restrictions\tto qualify under the scheme, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the COVID-19 restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made\tthe scheme will operate from 13 October 2020 to 31 March 2021 and there is provision for the Minister for Finance to vary aspects of the scheme by Ministerial Order                Revenue have published an overview of the scheme with some detailed examples, together with guidance on the operation of the scheme on www.Revenue.ie.                Speaking at the launch of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme, Minister Donohoe said:                            \"I am confident that the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme will provide much needed support to businesses that have had to close as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions. With the recent change to level 5 throughout the country, this means many more businesses have had to temporarily close and this scheme is designed to provide targeted and timely assistance. We understand the difficulties businesses and individuals are facing and this measure is just one part of the government\u2019s supports, which also include the wage subsidy schemes and temporary reduction in the VAT rate.                                    \"Specific sectoral schemes are also being rolled out which will support many businesses that may not qualify for CRSS. The scheme came into effect from Budget Day 13 October, and claims can be submitted in the coming weeks to cover the period from that date to cover the current period of restrictions (to 1 December). Registration opened earlier this week and Revenue have informed me that over 3,853 businesses have registered nearly 4,160 premises for CRSS with Revenue, which shows the importance of this support to businesses during this time. I\u2019m encouraging all eligible businesses to register with Revenue on ROS so that they can participate in the scheme with payments issuing shortly. Registration to participate in the scheme is now open for qualifying businesses through Revenue\u2019s Online Service, ROS.\"                        The T\u00e1naiste, Leo Varadkar said:                            \"This government is determined to support businesses across Ireland that have been adversely impacted by COVID-19. Budget 2021 prioritised investment in helping businesses respond to the twin crises of Brexit and COVID-19. The funding announced in the budget comes on top of the measures announced earlier this year in the July Stimulus \u2013 a \u20ac7bn package, aimed at protecting jobs and creating new opportunities.                                    \"I welcome the Covid Restriction Support Scheme which specifically targets businesses that have either been forced to temporarily close their premises or only been able to trade at significantly reduced levels as a result of restrictions. The intention of the scheme is to recognise the challenges experienced in particular by sectors that have been most affected by restrictions since the onset of the pandemic in March. We recognise the strain that businesses are under and have taken steps to help through this difficult period. The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme will allow businesses to meet their ongoing costs.\"                        Minister Martin said:                            \"Ensuring our tourism and arts sectors have the supports to help them survive the pandemic is a key priority for Government. It is vital these businesses continue operating and are ready to reopen their doors to help in our recovery, when the time comes. The CRSS helps maintain those crucial financial foundations, assisting hotels, restaurants, and arts venues, while their business are curtailed and restricted for public health reasons. This scheme, negotiated in the Budget, provides rebates, to a maximum weekly payment of \u20ac5,000 to facilities temporarily closed or restricted because of the virus. I want to ensure that, while tourism is struggling now, it continues to be a driver of recovery in the future, while arts venues very much need this financial lifeline.\"                        ENDS                                                        Notes                                                                Outline of Scheme                        The CRSS provides support for businesses that are forced to temporarily close or to operate at significantly reduced levels because of COVID-19 restrictions that either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers of the business from accessing the premises in which the business is carried on. Generally, this refers to COVID-19 restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the government\u2019s Plan for Living with COVID-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.                The scheme will be open to companies and the self-employed carrying on a trade in a business premises where the government restrictions directly prohibit or restrict access to the premises by customers. Where a business has multiple geographical trading locations it is proposed that the business will be in a position to claim for each trading premises separately. It is also available to persons who carry on a trade in partnership.                To qualify under the scheme, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the COVID-19 restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made.                A qualifying person will be able to make a claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment to be known as an \u201cAdvance Credit for Trading Expenses\u201d. This payment will be equal to 10% of their average weekly turnover in 2019 up to \u20ac20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of \u20ac5,000, for each week that their business is affected by the COVID-19 restrictions.                            \tWeekly turnover\tRate\tAmount\tFirst \u20ac20,000\t10%\t\u20ac2,000\tNext \u20ac60,000\t5%\t\u20ac3,000\tMaximum payment\t \t\u20ac5,000                        For businesses established between 26 December 2019 and 12 October 2020, the claim will be based on their actual weekly average turnover in the period between the date of commencement and 12 October 2020 (subject to the weekly cap of \u20ac5,000). Payments made under the scheme will be treated as an advance credit for trading expenses.                To make a claim under the scheme, a number of other conditions must be satisfied including that the person has an up to date tax clearance certificate and complied with their Value-Added Tax obligations. The person must register to claim on the \u2018Revenue Online Service\u2019 and make a declaration that they satisfy the conditions to make a claim under this section. Where COVID-19 restrictions for a geographical region are extended beyond the date on which they were due to expire, a new claim is required for each extension period.                \tspecific anti abuse provisions are included to deter the potential for fraudulent claims\tprovision is made for the publication of the name of claimants of CRSS on Revenue\u2019s website                                                        Duration                        The scheme will operate from 13 October 2020 to 31 March 2021 and there is provision for the Minister for Finance to vary aspects of the scheme by Ministerial Order.

The amount of the ACTE will be based on an amount equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in the case of new businesses, the average weekly turnover in 2020) up to \u20ac20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of \u20ac5,000.

The new scheme was launched today.Under the CRSS, a business that is impacted by Covid-19 related restrictions - including closure - can make a claim to Revenue for a payment for each week that it is affected by the restrictions.\u00a0The payment is subject to a maximum of \u20ac5,000.\u00a0Revenue have said that over 3,853 businesses have already registered nearly 4,160 premises for the new scheme.\u00a0Details of the proposed Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) were published in the Finance Bill.\u00a0To qualify under the scheme, a business must be able to show that because of the Covid restrictions, its turnover is no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 - or the average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business.The scheme will operate from October 14 to March 31, 2021 and will generally operate when Level 3 or higher is in place and will cease when restrictions are lifted.There is provision for the Minister for Finance to vary aspects of the scheme.\u00a0Launching the CRSS today, the Finance Minister said he was confident the scheme will provide much needed support to businesses that have had to close as a result of the Covid curbs.\u00a0\"With the recent change to Level 5 throughout the country, this means many more businesses have had to temporarily close and this scheme is designed to provide targeted and timely assistance,\" Paschal Donohoe said.\u00a0\"We understand the difficulties businesses and individuals are facing and this measure is just one part of the Government's supports, which also include the wage subsidy schemes and temporary reduction in the VAT rate,\" he added.Paschal Donohoe also said today that specific sectoral schemes are being rolled out which will support many businesses that may not qualify for CRSS.\u00a0Paschal Donohoe also said the Government's decision on the duration of Level 5 restrictions until December 1 still stands. \u00a0The Minister said that if the data shows that the disease is moving to a more stable place, the Government would do all it can to give businesses time to organise themselves. \u00a0He said there are clear signs that the Level 3 restrictions combined with the Level 5 are is having an effect on the spread of the disease within the country. \u00a0Mr Donohoe said the Government would evaluate the data and form a view about the appropriate exit strategy from the restrictions.But he said it was too early to say how the country would exit the restrictions.\u00a0The Finance Minister said the Government was deeply conscious of the economic and personal cost of the restrictions, but he added that they were in there to ensure that we are in a different place with the disease by the end of the year. \u00a0Mr Donohoe said he understood the calls being made by retailers to provide clarity to them on conditions beyond Level 5, but he said the Government had a duty to the health of the country as well as the economic health of the country.\u00a0Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht Minister Catherine Martin said that ensuring the country's tourism and arts sectors have the supports to help them survive the pandemic is a key priority for Government.\u00a0\"It is vital these businesses continue operating and are ready to reopen their doors to help in our recovery, when the time comes,\" Ms Martin added.More stories on\tNews\tBusiness\tRevenue\tPaschal Donohoe\tCoronavirus\tCatherine Martin\tCovid Restriction Support Scheme\tWeatherDiscover\tRT\u00c9 Archives\tRT\u00c9 Brainstorm\tHistory\tGaeilge\tRT\u00c9 LearnWatch\tRT\u00c9 Player\tTV\tRT\u00c9 One\tRT\u00c92\tRT\u00c9 News\tRT\u00c9jrListen\tRadio\tPodcasts\tRT\u00c9 Radio 1\tRT\u00c9 2FM\tRT\u00c9 lyric fm\tRT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na GaeltachtaServices\tOrchestras\tRT\u00c9 Weather\tLotto\tCentury Ireland\tRT\u00c9 ShopKids & Teens\tTRT\u00c9\tRT\u00c9jrHelp\tContact\tFeedback\tPolicies and Reports\tComplaints\tTerms & Conditions\tIndividual Rights Guide\tPrivacy Policy\tCookie Policy\t Freedom of Information Information\tAbout RT\u00c9\tTV Licence\tVacancies\tLatest Annual Report\tAdvertise with RT\u00c9\t2rn\tSaorview\tNewsletters\tRT\u00c9 Supporting the ArtsFollow RT\u00c9  \u00a9 RT\u00c9 2021.
