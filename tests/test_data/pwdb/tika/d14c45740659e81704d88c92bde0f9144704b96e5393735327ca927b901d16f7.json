Its services include helplines and \u2018talking therapies\u2019 provided to supported housing and safe havens. These are run by more than 400 staff across the UK. Unsurprisingly, it  has seen increased demand during the crisis, so ensuring staff still take breaks at home and offering internal wellbeing webinars has been key.", "content_of_measure_description": "For MHM, the safety and wellbeing of its employees was paramount as the pandemic hit. With a spotlight shone on the country's mental wellbeing during lockdown, MHM remained open to support those in need. However, the charity had to \u201cbe creative\u201d about how it would deliver these vital services safely. \r\rLuckily a good IT infrastructure, combined with most staff already having work-suitable laptops and phones, saw the MHM team working remotely to full capacity within 48 hours of lockdown being announced. Aside from those working in supported housing, all MHM staff are working remotely, with no staff furloughed or plans to furlough staff. \r\rMHM is also in the process \u2013 with the help of the NHS \u2013 of setting up secure software to avoid hackers gaining access to confidential online therapy sessions. \r\rMHM expected an increased demand for its services, and when lockdown was announced, the HR team turned their attention to employee health and wellbeing \u2013 especially for those taking crisis calls and offering emotional support to people in need. For example, all support line workers taking crisis calls are encouraged to take breaks while in the office. However, given the shift to homeworking, there was concern that employees would miss out on that time to decompress between calls. \r\rThus, HR compiled wellbeing packs, which were delivered to all employees. These contained a reminder about the charity's Employee Assistance Programme and how to access it, as well as tips for working from home, alongside stress-busting and wellbeing tips to reflect social distancing. The charity also paired up with an external provider to give employees access to online therapies including CBT and stress management.  HR also started a weekly newsletter called Wellbeing Wednesday. The charity's L&D function has also run a series of webinars to help spread the wellbeing message for employees., focusing on emotional resilience, stress, anxiety, wellbeing and transformative learning.\r\rManagers have also been involved in internal webinars on the remote management of staff  wellbeing - how to have challenging conversations and then in general just how to manage people remotely. These were so well-received that the charity has started providing external webinars for other organisations wanting to improve their wellbeing training offering.\r\r\rAt the start of lockdown, MHM was already in the process of opening two new facilities in Staffordshire and Kent, which meant the team had to induct and train more than 25 members of staff virtually.  IT and phone equipment were couriered to the new employees. The charity also changed all of its 'onboarding' processes to be via Teams and telephone. New starters were given one-to-one calls to ensure they were OK, as well as being talked through the charity's systems and the HR/payroll portal. \r\rThe organisation\u2019s external emotional support hotline \u2013 which received more than 65,000 calls and 3,000 web chats last year \u2013 has experienced increased demand during the pandemic. As a result, MHM is currently still recruiting for hotline support workers. For both new inductees and those yet to join the charity, there is a series of compliance-based training modules to complete. This consists of 12 units, such as professional boundaries, mental health awareness and lone worker safety. Usually, these would be done face to face but they have now all moved onto the e-learning portal. Employees are however asked to stagger their learning so that they don't overload. The system has a built-in alert if a zealous employee completes too many at once.", "use_of_measure_description": "The charity's 400 workers are covered by the new measures.

Aside from those working in supported housing, all MHM staff are working remotely, with no staff furloughed or plans to furlough staff.\u00a0\u201cWe are in a fortunate position. We haven't furloughed any staff because we realised there was an even greater need for our services to remain open. People still need them,\u201d says Claire Hall, HR and L&D manager at MHM.\u00a0MHM is also in the process \u2013 with the help of the NHS \u2013 of setting up secure software to avoid hackers gaining access to confidential online therapy sessions.\u00a0Employee wellbeing\u00a0MHM expected an increased demand for its services, and when lockdown was announced Hall and her HR team immediately turned their attention to employee health and wellbeing \u2013 especially for those taking crisis calls and offering emotional support to people in need.\u00a0\u201cWe put together some wellbeing packs, which were delivered to all employees.

It offers more than the EAP scheme as it provides online support.\u201dHall highlights that all support line workers taking crisis calls were encouraged to take breaks while in the office. So her initial concern was that employees would miss out on that time to decompress between calls now they were working from home: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to do that when you\u2019re at home, but we want to give staff as much support and encouragement as we can to take that time away from their phones.\u201cL&D and HR started a weekly newsletter called Wellbeing Wednesday and we kept it quite light. We have photos of employees cooking at home and looking after their kids, music they listen to, and information on staying connected.\u201dInternal webinars\u00a0The L&D function has also run a series of webinars to help spread the wellbeing message for employees. \u201cThe internal webinars have been on emotional resilience, stress, anxiety, wellbeing and transformative learning,\u201d says Hall.\u00a0\u201cWe have also done internal webinars for managers about managing staff wellbeing remotely, how to have challenging conversations and then in general just how to manage people remotely. They\u2018ve gone down so well it has led to external webinars for other organisations wanting to improve their wellbeing training offering.\u201d\u00a0Recruitment and training\u00a0MHM was already in the process of opening two new facilities in Staffordshire and Kent, which meant the team had to induct and train more than 25 members of staff virtually.\u201cWe couriered IT and phone equipment to our new employees and changed all of our onboarding processes to be via teams and telephone,\u201d says Hall. \u201cThis meant giving new starters one-to-one calls to ensure they were OK, and talking them through all our systems and the HR/payroll portal.

For both new inductees and those yet to join the charity, there is a series of compliance-based training modules to complete.\u00a0\u201cAll staff have to do compliance training, which consists of 12 units, such as professional boundaries, mental health awareness and lone worker safety,\u201d says Hall. \u201cNormally they would be done face to face but we have put them on our e-learning portal.\u00a0\u201cBut we ask our employees to spread them out over a series of days. Doing 12 e-learning courses in one day isn\u2019t realistic, so we staggered them for wellbeing purposes [and to avoid overload]. The system alerts us if someone has completed too many at once, but everyone has stuck to it.\u201d\u00a0                                                                Advertisement                                                                                                            Advertisement                                                                                                                                                        View More Jobs                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Strategic Human Resources                                                                             Torfaen (Tor-faen)                        Grade 8 \u00a332,234 - \u00a337,890 Points 32 - 34                        Torfaen County Borough Council                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Director of HR                                                                            New Cross Gate, London predominantly, but also working across our school sites in south London                        Competitive to reflect experience and expertise.
