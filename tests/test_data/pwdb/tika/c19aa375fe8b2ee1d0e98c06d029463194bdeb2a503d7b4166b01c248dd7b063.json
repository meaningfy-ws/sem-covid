As of 1 April 2020, the CCSS is going to put the following temporary measures into place: \tSuspension of the calculation of default interest for late payments;\tSuspension of the initiation of proceedings for the forced collection of contributions;\tSuspension of the enforcement of constraints by bailiff;\tSuspension of fines to be pronounced against employers who are late in making declarations to the CCSS. These measures will continue until the Board of Directors of the CCSS finds that they are no longer necessary. They will enable employers who find themselves in a financially precarious situation because of the COVID-19 crisis to better manage the payment of their social security contributions in the coming weeks, without having to fear administrative sanctions. While it is clear that all social security contributions remain due, the employer can nevertheless better organise his cash flow, in combination with other economic measures introduced as part of the COVID-19 crisis. The aforementioned measures do not only apply to future calls for contributions, but also to the current balances of social security contributions, notwithstanding any mention (interest, fines, etc.) on the CCSS statement of account dated 14 March 2020. In addition to these measures, the CCSS will pay an advance on the financial compensation for extraordinary leave for family reasons granted to the parents of children affected by the temporary closure of basic and secondary education, vocational training and childcare facilities, etc.  The purpose of this measure is to advance a substantial part of the reimbursement of salaries that employers must continue to pay to the parents concerned and which would normally only be made in May 2020 through the Employers' Mutual Insurance Scheme (Mutualit\u00e9 des Employeurs). The CCSS will contact employers potentially affected by such extraordinary leaves for family reasons in order to provide them with the information necessary to request such an advance on the reimbursement of the Employers' Mutual Insurance Fund. The advance will be liquidated in mid-April 2020. \u00a0 Press release by the Ministry of Social Security                                                    Organisation(s)                                                \tMinistry of Social Security                                                        Topics                            \t                                                    Business / Trade / Industry / Craft                                            \t                                                    Coronavirus                                            \t                                                    Social justice / Social protection and security                                                                                                    Date of the event                                    \t                            19.03.2020                                                                                                                                                                Last update\u00a020.03.2020                Navigation menu        \t            Sections        \t                News                            \t                The Government                            \t                Ministries                            \t                Departments                            \t                Topics                            \t                Political system                            \t                Publications                                    \t            Support        \t                Contact            \t                Sitemap            \t                About this site            \t                General Legal Notice (GTCU)            \t                Declaration of Accessibility                        \t Stay informed \t  Twitter  \t  Facebook  \t  Youtube  \t  RSS  \t  Newsletter                             Page top                                        "}]}
