They've backed an agreement that protects their job and provides for a review of circumstances should they improve sooner than expected. Equally, it was important for us to have the restoration of pay built in to the agreement,\" Ms\u00a0Connolly said.She stressed that amid uncertainty about the future of the sector and the timeline for recovery, Forsa would remain focused on maximising protections for Ryanair workers. \u00a0Under the deal, a bonus of up to \u20ac1,800 a year for cabin crew which was due to expire in March 2021 will be replaced with a basic salary increase of \u20ac900 gross per year in July 2023, and \u20ac900 gross per year in July 2024.\u00a0\"This is designed to provide more certainty of earnings for cabin crew, as well as increasing the proportion of fixed pay as pay is restored over the four year duration of the agreement,\" the union stated.\u00a0More stories on\tNews\tBusiness\tWeatherDiscover\tRT\u00c9 Archives\tRT\u00c9 Brainstorm\tHistory\tGaeilge\tRT\u00c9 LearnWatch\tRT\u00c9 Player\tTV\tRT\u00c9 One\tRT\u00c92\tRT\u00c9 News\tRT\u00c9jrListen\tRadio\tPodcasts\tRT\u00c9 Radio 1\tRT\u00c9 2FM\tRT\u00c9 lyric fm\tRT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na GaeltachtaServices\tOrchestras\tRT\u00c9 Weather\tLotto\tCentury Ireland\tRT\u00c9 ShopKids & Teens\tTRT\u00c9\tRT\u00c9jrHelp\tContact\tFeedback\tPolicies and Reports\tComplaints\tTerms & Conditions\tIndividual Rights Guide\tPrivacy Policy\tCookie Policy\t Freedom of Information Information\tAbout RT\u00c9\tTV Licence\tVacancies\tLatest Annual Report\tAdvertise with RT\u00c9\t2rn\tSaorview\tNewsletters\tRT\u00c9 Supporting the ArtsFollow RT\u00c9 \u00a9 RT\u00c9 2021.

The deal aims to avoid redundancies by cutting pay by up to 10 per cent, but restoring wages over the agreement\u2019s life, which runs from the first of this month to July 1st, 2024.                                                        It also provides for rostering changes, part-time working, unpaid leave and maximising use of the Government\u2019s Covid-19 wage supports while they remain available.                                                        A document circulated to F\u00f3rsa members states that Ryanair can deal with surplus Irish crew without redundancies, based on the cost cuts and other changes, along with not renewing fixed-term contracts and the airline\u2019s own estimates of the number likely to leave the company of their own accord.                                                        \u201cIn the event of a resurgence of Covid-19, or other event leading to a reduction in aircraft allocations at Irish bases, the parties will engage to make all possible efforts to address any resulting cabin crew surplus, with recourse to redundancies only as a last resort,\u201d it adds.                                                        The document notes that surplus cabin crew numbers are significantly lower proportionately than surplus pilot numbers.                                                        Job cutsRyanair has said it may have to cut up to 3,000 jobs and temporarily reduce pay by 20 per cent across its entire operation, which embraces more than 80 bases across Europe, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s impact on air travel.                                                                                                                                                            \t                                                                                    Red tape logjam creates fear for Irish timber supply                                                                            \t                                                                                    Lossses at Ormonde Mining up seven fold after disposal of mine                                                                            \t                                                                                    Supplies of timber to build new homes in danger of drying up                                                                                                                                                                                                          \t       Inside Business with Ciaran Hancock \u00b7    Dublin Bus CEO Ray Coyne on the future of transport in the city   As the airline\u2019s Irish operations gradually return to full schedules, Ryanair will pay crew proportionately for days worked at the reduced rates. There will be no pay increase claims between July 1st this year and June 30th, 2024.                                                                                                                                                Senior cabin crew grades will have their basic pay rate cut by \u20ac750 a year, with restoration in stages between July 1st, 2022 and July 1st, 2024.                                                         Junior grades will have their basic pay rates cut by \u20ac550 a year with restoration staged over the same period.                                                         Ryanair will axe its \u20ac1,800 a year productivity bonus, already due to expire in March 2021, with no payments made under this discretionary scheme.                                                        Rather than reinstate this, the airline will replace this with two \u20ac900 a year increases in basic pay in 2023 and 2024.                                                        Other changes will require reduced rosters over the winter months with provisions for part-time working, job sharing and other arrangements, tied to aircraft numbers and flying activity.                                                        The document states that this element will be key to minimising job losses. Ryanair and F\u00f3rsa will agree specific arrangements covering this.                                                        The airline will also consider requests from crew wishing to take on extra work outside Ryanair, and will not reasonably refuse permission once the second jobs do not create a conflict of interest or affect workers\u2019 ability to operate within EU aviation safety rules.                                                        Staff are due to finish voting on the terms on Thursday, July 9th. The deal is also subject to Ryanair board approval.                                                        The company will also commit to continuing talks with F\u00f3rsa on an overall collective labour agreement covering annual leave, base transfers and transitions for agency staff.                                                        If the deal is passed, the sides have agreed to review the deal during March 2023.                                                        The document states that the Covid-19 crisis will have a profoundly negative impact on Ryanair\u2019s business and workers.                                                        It adds that the company and F\u00f3rsa have prioritised saving as many jobs as possible while recognising the need for significant cost cuts in the new environment.
