Under the BBLS, businesses will be able to apply for quick and easy-to-access loans between GBP 2,000 and up to 25% of their turnover; the maximum loan available under the Scheme is GBP 50,000. No loan repayments are required for the first 12 months and the government will cover the interest repayments for the same period.\r\rFor those businesses seeking more than GBP 50,000, BBLS is intended to sit alongside the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).   Under CBILS, a participating lender can provide up to GBP 5 million in the form of term loans, overdrafts, invoice finance or asset finance.  Both schemes are operated by the British Business Bank, through accredited lenders\r", "content_of_measure_description": "The scheme helps small and medium-sized businesses to borrow between GBP 2,000 and up to 25% of their turnover. The maximum loan available is GBP 50,000. The government guarantees 100% of the loan and there are\u00a0no fees or interest to pay for the first twelve\u00a0months. After twelve months, the interest rate will be 2.5% a year.\r\rAn SME can apply for the loan if the business: \r\r* is based in the UK\r* was established before 1 March 2020\r* has been adversely impacted by the coronavirus.\r\rSMEs from any sector can apply with the exception of banks, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers); public-sector bodies and state-funded primary and secondary schools. \r\rIf a firm is\u00a0already claiming funding under the CBILS (a loan of up to GBP 50,000), then this can be transferred into the Bounce Back Loan Scheme. Businesses have until the 4th of November to arrange this with their lender. \r\rThe loan will run for six years\rThe length of the loan is 6 years, but businesses\u00a0can repay early without paying a fee. No repayments will be due during the first 12 months.\r\rThe scheme is being run under the auspices of the British Bank, with eleven\u00a0lenders participating in the scheme (including many of the main retail banks). Businesses\u00a0should approach a suitable lender directly\u00a0via the lender\u2019s website. Applicants must complete a short online form and self-declare eligibility.\u00a0The lender will make the decision as to whether a loan will be offered.\r\r\r\r\r", "use_of_measure_description": "HM Treasury has published data on the total number of applications received, the number of successful applications and on the cumulative value of all loans/facilities granted.\r\rThus, on the 10 May, 363,646 applications had been received, of which 268,173 had been successful with a value of GBP 8.38 billion.

This comes after effective lobbying from the CBI.23 November:\u00a0Following the CBI urging the government to set out exit plans to enable businesses to hit the ground running when measures are eased, the Prime Minister announced plans for England to operate under a three-tier system of COVID-19 restrictions a week prior to the second lockdown ending on 2 December.23 November:\u00a0With the CBI continuing to call for the government to work with business to establish an effective mass-testing regime, the government announced a six-week mass, rapid testing surge.3 November: Following continued calls from the CBI to deliver further mass testing, the government\u2019s announcement was the first chink of light that rapid mass testing could move from warm words to action. Since the roll-out of rapid mass testing in the Liverpool City Region, it has been extended across 67 more areas across England - with anyone living or working in these areas offered repeated tests regardless of whether they have symptoms.                                    \t            October                                                                                                                                                                                                    Global Travel Taskforce and more support for jobs and workers                                                                        29 October:\u00a0The WRC, CBI Wales and ACS presented the Welsh government\u00a0with recommendations to\u00a0resolve the confusion over non-essential items.

The announcement included extra help to retain staff with business contributions dropping to 5%, expanded business grants - channeled through local authorities \u2013 to target those most in need of support and for the self-employed, grants doubled to 40% of previous earnings.12 October:\u00a0Following CBI calls for a simplification of the local lockdown rules, the Prime Minster laid out government\u2019s three-tiered approach to local lockdowns for England.9 October:\u00a0Prior to the Prime Minister announcing a three tier system for COVID-19 restrictions, the Chancellor announced an extension to the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) for businesses impacted by further local or national coronavirus restrictions. The CBI has long called for the government to announce financial support in lockstep with restrictions.7 October: With the business community highlighting the vital role effective airport testing could play in jumpstarting international travel and trade, the government set up a Global Travel Taskforce. This has since led to the introduction of testing at some UK airports.                                    \t            September                                                                                                                                                                                                    Funding for tests, small business grants and business support                                                                        24 Sept:\u00a0Following CBI calls for a successor to the Job Retention Scheme and extensive engagement with the Chancellor and the Treasury team, the government announced further business support to help firms through the autumn and winter via the Winter Economic Plan.21 Sept:\u00a0Members faced great uncertainty about the future of the railways after the expiry of the Emergency Measures Agreement. This has been allayed for a further 18 months following the announcement of the Emergency Recovery Measures Agreements. Not only was this critical for businesses involved in this sector, but it will ensure that businesses that rely on the railways for access to their workforces and clients will continue to be served by a consistent rail service.21 Sept:\u00a0Dido Harding, the Head of NHS Test and Trace, joined a CBI @10 webinar.\u00a0Prior to the Test and Trace app being launched on 24\u00a0September, Dido Harding discussed the app and how businesses should engage with it.\u00a09 Sept:\u00a0Following CBI calls for additional business support, the government announced new direct cash grants to help small businesses if their area falls under new restrictions to protect public health. The government will need to look at more targeted support in the coming months, including a successor to the furlough scheme and allowing businesses to defer VAT payments from July to September.9 Sept:\u00a0CBI\u2019s Chief Economist, Rain Newton-Smith, confirmed to sit on COVID Recovery Commission.\u00a0The Commission will consider the role of business and government in delivering the kind of jobs and opportunities that will boost peoples\u2019 life chances.

The announcement followed calls for an extension from the CBI to provide more certainty to the housebuilder market in the short-term and create a higher number of first time buyer homes available under the Help to Buy scheme, allowing builders to catch up on the several weeks of activity lost during coronavirus-enforced shutdowns.30 July: Changes to state aid rules mean that more small businesses can now benefit from loans of up to \u00a35m under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). Government expects lenders to make changes in the approvals process. The CBI worked closely with UK officials and industry groups including BVCA, UKF, UK Hospitality and BRC to lobby through Business Europe for the state aid rules to be amended.10 July:\u00a0The CBI\u2019s clear messaging on the business impact of the 14 day Quarantine policy in public and privately to senior officials and cabinet ministers about policy led to major new exemptions. With quarantining policy now being led by Foreign Office on a country-by-country approach, business and leisure traffic has reopened.8 July:\u00a0The CBI actively influenced policies which were announced during the Chancellor\u2019s statement. In a letter to the Chancellor, we called for a jobs package, a stamp duty \u2018cut\u2019 and the need for an under 25 jobs scheme \u2013 all of which were announced in the statement.The CBI also called for a targeted VAT reduction, which has been reflected in the VAT reduction applied on tourism and hospitality related activities from 20% to 5%. After conversations with the government referencing similar schemes in Austria and Japan, the Eat out to Help out discount scheme was also announced.\u00a33bn of new investment in green projects is a welcome development, and the CBI called for such investment several weeks ago.                                    \t            June                                                                                                                                                                                                    Creating jobs, sustainable access to cash and reduced social distancing                                                                        22 June: The government has announced that all planning permissions expiring between the start of lockdown and the end of this year\u00a0will automatically be extended until 1 April 2021. This will be welcome news for many businesses, who have had to urgently review their spending plans due to COVID-19, in order to safeguard their employees and the future of their business. The announcement followed calls from the CBI for an extension to expiring planning permission consent, to give businesses more time to responsibly manage their cashflow and therefore enable investment in projects.Also, though engagement across government departments and presenting health and economic evidence, the CBI played its part in the government reducing social distancing measures to help business reopen. With the two-metre social distancing rule in place many smaller businesses especially those in retail and hospitality could not reopen, as a result of our lobbying, more businesses can reopen helping the economic recovery of the UK.16 June: FCA and Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) agree to work with industry on a sustainable model of accessing cash. Cash usage has decreased in the last few years and the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated this. Preserving access to cash is an essential element of Financial Services infrastructure.

This announcement will ensure the framework for access to cash is discussed with industry and local communities.4 June: With businesses keen to support the government COVID-19 response and the economic recovery efforts, the CBI called for the Business Secretary to set up business groups for consultation.

As of 21st February, 93,216 BBLS top-ups had been approved worth \u00a30.83 billion.One topped up loan will still be reported as one loan to avoid double counting the number of facilities approved. (e.g. if there were previously two facilities worth \u00a340,000 each and subsequently one had been topped up to \u00a350,000, this would now be reported as two facilities worth a total of \u00a390,000).CBILS and BBLS data by constituencyStatistics from British Business BankFuture Fund\tData up to close of business\tTotal number of applications\tNumber of convertible loans approved\tValue of convertible loans approved\t27 May\t419\tn/a\tn/a\t31 May\t464\tn/a\tn/a\t7 June\t533\t53\t\u00a355.9m\t14 June\t577\t155\t\u00a3146.0m\t21 June\t623\t252\t\u00a3236.2m\t28 June\t674\t322\t\u00a3320.6m\t5 July\t722\t376\t\u00a3379.9m\t12 July\t750\t429\t\u00a3419.6m\t19 July\t781\t465\t\u00a3468.7m\t26 July\t816\t510\t\u00a3512.9m\t2 August\t839\t537\t\u00a3534.0m\t9 August\t868\t565\t\u00a3562.3m\t16 August\t902\t590\t\u00a3588.3m\t20 September\t1,072\t711\t\u00a3720.0m\t18 October\t1,243\t745\t\u00a3770.8m\t15 November\t1,325\t874\t\u00a3875.8m\t13 December\t1,432\t971\t\u00a3975.5m\t24 January\t1,925\t1,055\t\u00a31,066.6m\t21 February\t2,206\t1,140\t\u00a31,124.3mThe Future Fund closed on 31 January 2021 and is no longer accepting new applications. The scheme is still processing applications submitted prior to closure.Notes\tThe management information for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS is reported on behalf of accredited lenders. For Future Fund this is reported on behalf of the British Business Bank. HM Treasury accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of these figures.\tFigures for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS show cumulative applications and approvals up to close of business on 21 February 2021 by accredited lenders, as reported to HM Treasury by close of business 22 February 2021.\tA full list of accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS can be found here.\tManagement information (MI) are not classified as statistics. The MI in this release reflects timely information and do not suffer from lag effects. However, the trend from weekly figures may show some volatility. Moreover, these are initial figures which have not been rigorously quality assured and do not include data from all accredited lenders.\tUK Finance have also previously published MI on CBILS, but this only covers accredited lenders which are members of UK Finance. This data is available here.\tFuture Fund opened for applications on 20 May 2020. Provided that applicants provide the information required during the application process in a timely manner, it is expected that the process will take a minimum of 21 days from initial application to funding being made available. Convertible loans are reported as approved at the point the Convertible Loan Agreement document is issued by Future Fund for signature. The time to applicants subsequently receiving funds will depend on the speed with which they complete the documentation.\tThe Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code) is built around 3 main concepts, or pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. The following explains how we have applied the pillars of the Code in a proportionate way.\tTrustworthiness - the figures are based on management information supplied to HM Treasury by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund and represent their best estimates of the published totals. To support the management of departmental business, figures have been seen in advance by ministers and officials. This is in line with the Code, where pre-release access does not apply for releases based on routine management information \u2013 as covered in paragraph 3.6 of the National Statistician\u2019s guidance.\tQuality - the information presented is provided by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund based on their management information. Quality assurance processes are built in the design of the templates and the data production processes in the Treasury.\tValue - in publishing this data, we aim to support the information needs of society, parliamentarians and stakeholders. Business loan schemes are one part of the unprecedented support for public services, workers and businesses the Government has implemented to protect against the current economic emergency.See more statistics on coronavirus funding for businesses and self employed people here.

The primary goal of our economic policy remains unchanged - to support people\u2019s jobs - but the way we achieve that must evolve.Since the beginning of the pandemic, the government has taken swift action to save lives, limit the spread of the disease and minimise damage to the economy.Ministers have introduced one of the most generous and comprehensive economic plans anywhere in the world with over \u00a3190 billion of support for people, businesses and public services - including paying the wages of nearly 12 million people, supporting over a million businesses through grants, loans and rates cuts and announcing the Plan for Jobs in July.The government has been consistently clear that it would keep its support under review to protect jobs and the economy, with today\u2019s action reflecting the evolving circumstances and uncertainty of the months ahead.The package of measures, which applies to all regions and nations of the UK, includes:Support for workersA new Job Support Scheme will be introduced from 1 November to protect viable jobs in businesses who are facing lower demand over the winter months due to coronavirus.Under the scheme, which will run for six months and help keep employees attached to the workforce, the government will contribute towards the wages of employees who are working fewer than normal hours due to decreased demand.Employers will continue to pay the wages of staff for the hours they work - but for the hours not worked, the government and the employer will each pay one third of their equivalent salary.This means employees who can only go back to work on shorter time will still be paid two thirds of the hours for those hours they can\u2019t work.In order to support only viable jobs, employees must be working at least 33% of their usual hours. The level of grant will be calculated based on employee\u2019s usual salary, capped at \u00a3697.92 per month.The Job Support Scheme will be open to businesses across the UK even if they have not previously used the furlough scheme, with further guidance being published in due course.It is designed to sit alongside the Jobs Retention Bonus and could be worth over 60% of average wages of workers who have been furloughed \u2013 and are kept on until the start of February 2021. Businesses can benefit from both schemes in order to help protect jobs.In addition, the Government is continuing its support for millions of self-employed individuals by extending the Self Employment Income Support Scheme Grant (SEISS). An initial taxable grant will be provided to those who are currently eligible for SEISS and are continuing to actively trade but face reduced demand due to coronavirus. The initial lump sum will cover three months\u2019 worth of profits for the period from November to the end of January next year. This is worth 20% of average monthly profits, up to a total of \u00a31,875.An additional second grant, which may be adjusted to respond to changing circumstances, will be available for self-employed individuals to cover the period from February 2021 to the end of April - ensuring our support continues right through to next year.This is in addition to the more than \u00a313 billion of support already provided for over 2.6 million self-employed individuals through the first two stages of the Self Employment Income Support Scheme \u2013 one of the most generous in the world.Tax cuts and deferralsAs part of the package, the government also announced it will extend the temporary 15% VAT cut for the tourism and hospitality sectors to the end of March next year. This will give businesses in the sector - which has been severely impacted by the pandemic - the confidence to maintain staff as they adapt to a new trading environment.In addition, up to half a million business who deferred their VAT bills will be given more breathing space through the New Payment Scheme, which gives them the option to pay back in smaller instalments. Rather than paying a lump sum in full at the end March next year, they will be able to make 11 smaller interest-free payments during the 2021-22 financial year.On top of this, around11 million self-assessment taxpayers will be able to benefit from a separate additional 12-month extension from HMRC on the \u201cTime to Pay\u201d self-service facility, meaning payments deferred from July 2020, and those due in January 2021, will now not need to be paid until January 2022.Giving businesses flexibility to pay back loansThe burden will be lifted on more than a million businesses who took out a Bounce Back Loan through a new Pay as You Grow flexible repayment system. This will provide flexibility for firms repaying a Bounce Back Loan.This includes extending the length of the loan from six years to ten, which will cut monthly repayments by nearly half. Interest-only periods of up to six months and payment holidays will also be available to businesses. These measures will further protect jobs by helping businesses recover from the pandemic.We also intend to give Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme lenders the ability to extend the length of loans from a maximum of six years to ten years if it will help businesses to repay the loan.In addition, the Chancellor also announced he would be extending applications for the government\u2019s coronavirus loan schemes that are helping over a million businesses until the end of November. As a result, more businesses will now be able to benefit from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, the Bounce Back Loan Scheme and the Future Fund. This change aligns all the end dates of these schemes, ensuring that there is further support in place for those firms who need it.Investment in public servicesAt the start of the pandemic, the Chancellor pledged to give the NHS and public services the support needed to respond to coronavirus \u2013 and as of today, \u00a368.7 billion of additional funding has been approved by the Treasury, including \u00a324.3 billion since the Summer Economic Update in July.This funding has helped ensure the procurement of PPE for frontline staff, provided free school meals for children while at home and protected the country\u2019s most vulnerable. In addition, the \u00a312 billion funding to roll-out the Test and Trace programme has played a key role helping to unlock the economy, enabling businesses like restaurants and bars to serve customers again.As announced earlier this year, the Treasury has also guaranteed the devolved administrations will receive at least \u00a312.7 billion in additional funding. This gives Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the budget certainty to for coronavirus response in the months ahead.Responses from business groupsDame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said:  These bold steps from the Treasury will save hundreds of thousands of viable jobs this winter. It is right to target help on jobs with a future, but can only be part-time while demand remains flat. This is how skills and jobs can be preserved to enable a fast recovery.  Wage support, tax deferrals and help for the self-employed will reduce the scarring effect of unnecessary job losses as the UK tackles the virus. Employers will apply the same spirit of creativity, seizing every opportunity to retrain and upskill their workers.  The Chancellor has listened to evidence from business and acted decisively. It is this spirit of agility and collaboration that will help make 2021 a year of growth and renewal.Mike Cherry OBE, Federation of Small Businesses National Chair, said:  The UK\u2019s small businesses are facing an incredibly difficult winter.  Today\u2019s support package is the flipside of the coin to Tuesday\u2019s COVID-19 business restrictions.  It is a swift and significant intervention, extending emergency SME loans, creating new wage support for small employers and the self-employed, and providing cashflow help on VAT deferrals and new Time To Pay for any tax bills to HMRC.  We welcome that the Chancellor is ensuring that decisions to protect public health are informed by the need to protect the economy, people\u2019s jobs and prospects for young people in our schools and workplaces.BCC Director General Adam Marshall said:  The measures announced by the Chancellor will give business and the economy an important shot in the arm. Chambers of Commerce have consistently called for a new generation of support to help preserve livelihoods and ease the cash pressures faced by firms as they head into a challenging and uncertain winter.  The Chancellor has responded to our concerns with substantial steps that will help companies preserve jobs and navigate through the coming months. The new wage support scheme will help many companies hold on to valued employees after furlough ends, and the extension of business lending schemes and tax forbearance will lessen the immediate pressure on cash flow for many affected firms.  As we look past the immediate challenge, more will need to be done to rebuild and renew our economy. Chambers of Commerce across the UK will continue to work with government to ensure the benefits of these schemes are delivered to firms on the ground.

A BBC report revealed that criminals were setting up fake firms to get loans worth tens of thousands of pounds. The Bounce Back Loan Scheme has already paid out more than \u00a338bn.In early May, just two days before the scheme launched, the chief executive of the BBB, Keith Morgan, wrote of the \"very significant fraud and credit risks\", adding that it was \"vulnerable to abuse by individuals and organised crime\". The bank, he said in a letter to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, could not guarantee \"robust controls\".  Other concerns included an \"extensive reliance on customer self-certification\" and \"potential for market distortion\". He said that the BBB had commissioned a review of the scheme by accountants PwC, which had classified its fraud risk as \"very high\". In his letter, dated 2 May and which followed a email warning the day before, Mr Morgan also raised concerns that the quick introduction of the scheme had \"created huge operational challenges\".However, Mr Sharma said the scheme should go ahead despite the risks, because of what he called the \"unprecedented situation facing the country\". \t'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan'\tArrest over \u00a3110k Covid small business loan fraud\tUK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first dayBounce Back Loans are 100% government-backed loans of up to \u00a350,000, and were introduced to mitigate the huge pressure on small businesses after the economy went into coronavirus lockdown. They do not have to be paid off for six years, and are interest-free for the first 12 months.According to latest Treasury figures, there have been 1.55 million applications, with 1.26 million approvals and \u00a338.02b paid out.At the weekend, the BBC's Angus Crawford revealed how fraudsters were targeting the loan system. One bogus company, Tellings Home Made Furniture, \"borrowed\" \u00a350,000 by stealing the personal details of a man called Mark Telling.media captionWatch the moment Mark Telling finds out he's been a victim of fraudThe revelations come after the head of the National Audit Office told the Guardian Bounce Back Loans were the \"riskiest\" of all the bailout measures.But a government spokesman told the BBC the loan scheme had been vital for many businesses and that fraudsters would be pursued.He said: \"Our loan schemes have provided a lifeline to thousands of businesses across the UK - helping them survive the outbreak and protecting millions of jobs. \"Our support has been targeted to ensure we help those who need it most as quickly as possible and we won't apologise for this.\"He said the government worked with agencies to minimise fraud, \"with lenders implementing a range of protections including anti-money laundering and customer checks, as well as transaction monitoring controls. Any fraudulent applications can be criminally prosecuted for which penalties include imprisonment or a fine or both\".Related Topics\tUK banking\tCoronavirus pandemic\tAlok SharmaMore on this story\t'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan'\tPublished\t28 September 2020\tArrest over \u00a3110k Covid small business loan fraud\tPublished\t14 August 2020Top Stories\tMeghan: Royal had concerns about son's skin colourThe duchess tells Oprah Winfrey that a family member talked about how \"dark\" her baby's skin might be.\tPublished\t16 hours ago\tSkin colour remark 'not Queen nor Duke' - Oprah\tPublished\t24 minutes ago\tMeghan 'didn't want to be alive any more'\tPublished\t54 minutes agoFeatures\t'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism'\tThe woman with HIV helping others have a 'good death'\tCovid map: Where are cases the highest?\t12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview\tCovid: 'My family told me to marry at 14'\tThe ballerina dancing on ice for a real \u2018swan lake\u2019 VideoThe ballerina dancing on ice for a real \u2018swan lake\u2019\t'The first black fairytale' gets modern reworking\tWhat's causing vaccine delays in some Asian countries?\t'Deepfake is the future of content creation'Elsewhere on the BBC\tLyrics quizHave you been getting these songs wrong?\tFeeling hotWhat happens to your body in extreme heat?Most Read\tSkin colour remark 'not Queen nor Duke' - Oprah1\t12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview2\tBillionaire Mackenzie Scott marries science teacher3\tMeghan 'didn't want to be alive any more'4\t'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism'5\tPastor on leave after Melania 'trophy wife' sermon6\tEU bank authority hit by Microsoft email hack7\tCovid: 'My family told me to marry at 14'8\tBanksy to auction hospital art for NHS9\tEquatorial Guinea blast deaths rise to 3110BBC News Services\tOn your mobile\tOn smart speakers\tGet news alerts\tContact BBC News\tHome\tNews\tSport\tReel\tWorklife\tTravel\tFuture\tCulture\tMusic\tTV\tWeather\tSounds\tTerms of Use\tAbout the BBC\tPrivacy Policy\tCookies\tAccessibility Help\tParental Guidance\tContact the BBC\tGet Personalised Newsletters\tWhy you can trust the BBC\tAdvertise with us\tAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info\u00a9 2021 BBC.
