The ETUC will lobby the German Presidency, and the European institutions, in order to ensure that the Council conclusions pave the way to an effective EU anti-poverty action. This should be:  - Aimed at fully granting the implementation of principle 14 of the European Pillar of Social Rights and fulfilling the objectives of the 2030 Agenda1 - Based on  o a European framework directive setting binding common principles and minimum standards for minimum income schemes that are highly inclusive, adequate, accessible and enabling  o monitoring and benchmarking frameworks, built on an in-depth assessment of the implementation of such a directive in all MS - Implemented in a highly participative manner through social dialogue and include a monitoring mechanism  - Combined with solid, inclusive, accessible and well-designed welfare systems, which are able to provide adequate and effective protection to all citizens and residents across all ages - Sustained by adequate financial resources provided by EU funds and also specifically tailored recovery instruments that invest in quality job creation and active inclusion measures - Implemented via the European Semester coherently with societal needs - Underpinned by fair wages, collective bargaining and decent minimum wages, fair working and employment conditions, high job quality and security  Context Poverty and inequalities in the EU represent a major political, social and economic challenge. The Covid 19 pandemic has exacerbated an already dramatic situation in the EU2 , with increased vulnerabilities and further risks of socio-economic divides.  Minimum Income (MI) protection, accompanied by activation and enabling services, plays a vital role in mitigating risks of poverty and social exclusion, especially during this crisis once other layers of social protection have been exhausted and thereby supports the most disadvantaged in society, both now and in the future.   1 especially the objective to reduce by 2030 at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions 2 Data are available in the ETUC discussion paper European tools for minimum income schemes, a cornerstone for a European anti-poverty and social inclusion strategy https://www.etuc.org/en/document/european-tools-minimum-income-schemes-cornerstone-european-anti-poverty-and-socialhttps://www.etuc.org/en/document/european-tools-minimum-income-schemes-cornerstone-european-anti-poverty-and-socialETUC/EC/241/LC/JS/ey   2 The EPSR clearly states that: \u201cEveryone lacking sufficient resources has the right to adequate minimum income benefits ensuring a life in dignity at all stages of life, and effective access to enabling goods and services. For those who can work, minimum income benefits should be combined with incentives to (re)integrate into the labour market.\u201d In order to make this right to adequate minimum income effective for all EU citizens and residents, the ETUC will lobby the European institutions with specific demands that meet the need for income protection and social inclusion. With respect to an EU framework against poverty and social exclusion, the ETUC demands:  A European framework directive establishing common principles, definitions, minimum standards and methods to grant principle 14 of the EPSR and the objectives of SDG1 right across the EU. The EU approach based on soft-law3  and the open method of coordination adopted so far proved to be inadequate and unfit for the purpose to ensure a life in dignity and the effective participation into the society \u2013 as witnessed by the poor and highly uneven results across member states, where schemes for minimum income protection result mostly ineffective.  Binding minimum standards ensuring that schemes providing minimum income (MIS) comply with the qualitative, fundamental characters in order to fulfil their aim: a. Benefits have to be adequate, thus ensuring a level of income that is indispensable to be able to live a life in dignity and to fully participate in society, providing at least 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers and taxes. Benefits fixed at such a level should be referenced to and assessed in their sufficiency against the cost of a basket of goods and services, comparable across countries, considered as essential, (the AROP poverty threshold 60% + reference budgets). Benefits should thus be o higher than the poverty threshold,  o adjusted in order to protect purchasing power, at least assessed yearly and properly indexed o adapted to household size and other sources of  income b. Schemes must be accessible, thus providing comprehensive coverage for all people who need the schemes for as long as they need the support. Therefore, there should be: o Individual, means-tested, legal entitlement for all citizens and residents in need of assistance  o Accessibility expressively foreseen to economically dependent women, victims of domestic violence4  o Non-discriminatory access  o Automatic availability and a possibility of appeal o No stigmatisation, disrespect nor excessive, unreasonable conditions c. Schemes have also to be enabling: schemes must promote people's empowerment and participation in society and facilitate their access to quality services and inclusive labour markets. Schemes must ensure that: o MI benefits and services are combined with other social benefits and services, avoiding simplification and cumulation with other social allowances  Minimum income schemes providing concrete opportunities for social inclusion to everyone lacking resources:  3 Council Recommendation 92/441/EEC on common criteria concerning sufficient resources and social assistance in social protection systems, Commission Recommendation 2008/867/EC on Active Inclusion of people excluded from the labour market 4 Such provision is included the minimum income schemes recently introduced in Spain  ETUC/EC/241/LC/JS/ey   3 o For those who can work, the directive must ensure that MIS provide effective enabling services and incentives to re-integrate such people into the labour market (avoiding negative activation, sanctions on benefits, excessive conditionality, \u2018work fare\u2019 practices, unrealistic job search requirements\u2026). In particular, it is important to link this feature with the assessment of real inclusion opportunities through quality jobs (a job alone is not a solution to poverty); enhanced and strengthened public employment services; effective activation measures such as customised education and training; counselling services; and targeted programmes for people in poverty.  o For those who cannot work and in general for everyone in need, MIS must ensure adequate benefits, social services and social participation tools, thus the effective access and enabling character of goods and services for everyone in need.  o Specific attention must be paid to specific situations, to guarantee life in dignity and effective societal inclusion, such as for women who suffer higher poverty rates, discrimination in access to work and remuneration, both in society and the labour market; low work-intensity households; single parents households; people with disabilities; people in need of long-term care.  A social dialogue framework for social partners and governments, to implement the directive and related measures, and to assess coverage, adequacy and effectiveness of MIS, both at European and at national level, including other societal stakeholders, according to the specificity of the respective roles  The establishment of monitoring and benchmarking frameworks involving social partners  Coherent specific fund allocation to prevent and fight poverty.  o The EU funds (e.g. ESF+) and other extraordinary and new measures must ensure that MIS provide real inclusion opportunities for all.  o Investments must be made in education, quality job creation, public services.  Coherent policies within the European Semester, which allow for greater and more socially balanced public expenditure for social transfers and social assistance, as well as investments in public employment services and skilling and re-skilling of people (especially the long-term unemployed), and provision of high-quality services (especially public enabling services).  In order to develop a consistent strategy against poverty and social exclusion it is also fundamental that the implementation of an EU framework is developed in coordination with the implementation of the Recommendation on access to social protection for all workers and self-employed. Pensions in particular, will require good coordination between foreseen national reforms and actions targeting MIS (considering them as basic, last resort safety-net level of social protection and aiming at adapting the other forms assistance/protection schemes coherently).  This is crucial to ensure that the right to adequate minimum income is guaranteed to everyone lacking sufficient resources across all stages of life5 .   5 P.

The European Council's Strategic Agenda 2019-2024 identifies inequalities as a major political, social and economic risk and calls for providing opportunities for all. Describing the road for the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, the Commission Communication \u201cA Strong Social Europe for Just Transitions\u201d1 puts a spotlight on improving social protection and inclusion: leaving no one behind in an age of change means fighting poverty. 2. Despite the measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, its social and economic fallout reveals and exacerbates vulnerabilities in a dramatic fashion, increasing the risk of deepening socio-economic divides in Europe2. The \"Roadmap for Recovery\", welcomed by the Members of the European Council, states the need to address the socio-economic consequences of the crisis. Protecting the incomes of those losing their jobs, of those suffering a decline or loss in income and of those lacking sufficient resources represents a major challenge. Minimum income protection, accompanied by activation and enabling services, plays a vital role in mitigating the risk of poverty and social exclusion in this crisis and thereby supports the most disadvantaged in society, both now and in the future3.                                                  1  COM(2020) 14 final. 2  OECD 2020: COVID-19: Protecting people and societies. 3  ILO 2020: Social protection responses to the COVID-19 crisis: Country responses and policy considerations.   11721/2/20 REV 2  RS/mk 3 ANNEX LIFE.4  EN  3. Minimum income schemes not only contribute in an essential manner to the social protection of those groups that have been hit hardest by the crisis, they also have a stabilising effect on the overall demand for goods and services produced in the economy.4 4. Monitoring overall trends tends to confirm the importance of strengthening minimum income protection and active inclusion in Europe. Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty across the Union over the past decade. Still, the outcome falls short of the EU target to lift 20 million citizens from poverty by 2020. Even before the outbreak of the pandemic, overall, more than one in five Europeans and one in four children remained at risk of poverty and social exclusion5. The situation of single parent households and persons living in (quasi-) jobless households deserves specific attention as their vulnerability is particularly high. They face a continuing risk of poverty6 and the latter even an increase in the depth of poverty. This development exemplifies the gaps observed in minimum income protection across Europe as regards adequacy, coverage and access to enabling services7. Progress in closing these gaps over the past decade has been limited 8. 5. Minimum income protection ought to be regarded as part of the entire national welfare system: well-designed, integrated, adequate and sustainable social benefits and services provide effective protection for all. Investment in social protection systems yields valuable social and economic outcomes in the long term. Social protection contributes to socio-economic resilience, human capital development and equality of opportunity, in particular for children at risk of poverty and social exclusion.                                                  4  European Parliament 2010: Study on 'The Role of Social Protection as Economic Stabiliser: Lessons from the Current Crisis'. 5  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/t2020_50/default/table?lang=en. 6  Eurostat 2020: Rate of people at risk of poverty according to at-risk-of-poverty threshold and household type; Social Protection Committee 2019: Annual report. 7  Joint Employment Report 2020, p. 34. 8  European Parliament 2017: Study on 'Minimum Income Policies in EU Member States'; European Commission 2016: Minimum Income Schemes in Europe: A study of national policies 2015.   11721/2/20 REV 2  RS/mk 4 ANNEX LIFE.4  EN  6. The European Pillar of Social Rights highlights the principle that everyone lacking sufficient resources has the right to adequate minimum income benefits ensuring dignity at all stages of life, and to effective access to enabling goods and services.  7. A number of measures play a key role in combatting inequality, poverty and social exclusion, namely: adequate minimum income protection provided through social assistance, minimum income schemes or other, nationally defined sets of basic social protection guarantees for persons who have been unable either to enter or re-enter the labour market and have no means of subsistence. Their purpose is to alleviate poverty among households and to ensure a life in dignity9. Combined with incentives to (re)integrate into the labour market for those who can work as well as effective access to enabling goods and services, minimum income schemes promote peoples\u2019 active inclusion in employment and society. To reduce the greater exposure of women to situations of poverty and facilitate women\u2019s labour market participation it is among other factors especially important to address the challenges of combining work and caring responsibilities faced by single parents, eight out of ten of whom are women10.                                                   9  European Parliament 2017 (see above). 10  Eurostat 2020: Number of persons by sex, age groups, household composition and working status [lfst_hhindws], latest data from 2019.   11721/2/20 REV 2  RS/mk 5 ANNEX LIFE.4  EN  8. It is for Member States to design and implement national provisions ensuring minimum income protection. The Union framework on minimum income protection currently exists of the Council Recommendation 92/441/EEC11, the Commission Recommendation 2008/867/EC, and relevant monitoring and policy coordination activities within the European Semester that are underpinned by the EU benchmarking framework on minimum income protection. Its further elaboration could help close gaps still remaining in minimum income protection. Effective minimum income protection throughout the Union could help to reduce social inequalities and disparities within and among Member States, thus enhancing upward social convergence. Future work on the Union framework could also help strengthen the function of minimum income protection as an economic stabiliser12 in all EU economies, helping safeguard aggregate economic demand in times of crisis and beyond. 9. Effective minimum income protection entails the application of a set of key principles. These principles have also been addressed by the Council Recommendation 92/441, the Commission Recommendation on active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market13 and the relevant propositions of the ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation (2012, No. 202). In particular, key principles are: a. Access: Based on the principle of universality, individuals in need should have the right to access to benefits on non-discriminatory and comprehensive terms. Access to and take-up of benefits should be ensured in practice, including through accessible and simplified application procedures and a right to appeal.                                                  11  92/441/EEC: Council Recommendation of 24 June 1992 on common criteria concerning sufficient resources and social assistance in social protection systems, OJ L 245, 26.8.1992, p. 46\u201348. 12  European Parliament 2010 (see above).  13  Commission Recommendation of 3 October 2008 on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market (2008/867/EC), OJ L 307, 18.11.2008, p. 11\u201314.   11721/2/20 REV 2  RS/mk 6 ANNEX LIFE.4  EN  b. Adequacy: Based on the principle of a life in dignity, basic needs should be covered by minimum income benefits in an adequate manner taking account of living standards and price levels or national poverty lines in the Member State concerned. Needs should be assessed through the application of consistent and transparent methods; adjustment of benefits should be regular and linked to appropriate indicators. Adequate consideration should be given to household composition and specific individual needs, for instance disability, childcare or long-term care. c. Enabling Aspects: Based on the principle of active inclusion, minimum income protection should entail the provision of good-quality enabling services. For those who can work, incentives to work and adequate active labour market policies such as placement and training should be provided. A broad range of social services such as advice including legal advice and information on available support, adequate assistance and counselling should complement the schemes to ensure their effective outreach and provision of support for all.    11721/2/20 REV 2  RS/mk 7 ANNEX LIFE.4  EN  10. The European Semester contributes with valuable monitoring and policy coordination through the Joint Employment Report, Country Reports and Country-Specific Recommendations to the objective of improving the effectiveness of minimum income protection. Underpinning the EU level monitoring, the benchmarking framework developed by the Social Protection Committee on adequacy, eligibility and activation in the area of minimum income provides an important point of reference in that regard. For future developments of the monitoring framework in this field, further work on gathering comparable, high-quality information, both qualitative and quantitative, is beneficial, paying due regard to the diversified minimum income protection policies in Member States.  11. Evaluations14 show mixed or even relatively insignificant results in the implementation of the policy guidance provided by the Council Recommendation on common criteria concerning sufficient resources and social assistance in social protection systems and the Commission Recommendation on active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market. This underscores the need for further action. 12. The European Parliament resolution of 24 October 201715 calls on all Member States to introduce adequate minimum income schemes, highlighting the role of minimum income protection as a tool for fighting poverty. In a similar vein, the European Economic and Social Committee calls for action on minimum income protection in its opinion of 20 February 201916.                                                  14  Report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the implementation of the recommendation 92/441/EEC of 24 June 1992 on common criteria concerning sufficient resources and social assistance in social protection systems, COM/98/0774 final; Commission staff working document on the implementation of the 2008 Commission Recommendation on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market, SWD (2017)257 final. 15  European Parliament resolution of 24 October 2017 on minimum income protection as a tool for fighting poverty (2016/2270(INI). 16  Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee of 20 February 2019, SOC/584-EESC-2018.   11721/2/20 REV 2  RS/mk 8 ANNEX LIFE.4  EN  THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION INVITES the Member States to: 13. STRIVE TO ENSURE that their national minimum income protection schemes meet the relevant recommendations of the Union and the International Labour Organization, are accessible and adequate, and enable beneficiaries\u2019 social and labour market inclusion; 14. ENGAGE with stakeholders concerned such as relevant authorities including local and regional bodies, social partners and civil society organisations and, whenever appropriate, with people experiencing poverty in the development, updating and implementation of respective schemes; 15. EXAMINE as part of the regular evaluations, the functioning and adequacy of minimum income protection schemes for mitigating the negative socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis as well as for supporting social and labour market inclusion and, where necessary, DEFINE and IMPLEMENT measures to improve their effectiveness both in the short and long term;  16. MAKE EFFORTS to provide information to people who potentially meet the nationally established eligibility requirements about their rights to minimum income protection; ENCOURAGE these people to apply for cash or in-kind benefits and to take up respective benefits accompanied by activation and enabling services; and 17. COLLECT data disaggregated by sex to monitor and assess minimum income protection policies and their effects, and SUPPORT the European Commission, the Social Protection Committee and the Employment Committee in preparing a periodic report on the development of minimum income protection inter alia by providing information and data on key indicators for access, adequacy and enabling aspects.   11721/2/20 REV 2  RS/mk 9 ANNEX LIFE.4  EN  INVITES the Member States and the European Commission, in accordance with their respective competences, taking into account national circumstances and different labour market models, to:  18. WORK TOGETHER to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights, and to commit themselves to addressing the remaining gaps in minimum income protection in combating poverty and social exclusion; 19. STRENGTHEN employment and social aspects within the European Semester as coordination for economic, employment and social policy with regard to minimum income protection, and PROVIDE respective policy recommendations that take a long-term view and balance economic, fiscal, employment and social policy needs; 20. STRENGTHEN the exchange of best practices, the networking of national contact points for cross-country assistance and the mutual learning in further developing minimum income protection at national and regional level including within the Minimum Income Network (MINET) as a technical forum of the Social Protection Committee; and 21. MAKE BEST USE of targeted support from available EU funds, notably the European Social Fund Plus and the Next Generation EU recovery instrument to promote social inclusion and labour market participation as well as to tackle poverty. INVITES the European Commission, within its competences as set out in the Treaties, while paying due regard to national circumstances to: 22. INITIATE an update of the Union framework to effectively support and complement the policies of Members States on national minimum income protection.   11721/2/20 REV 2  RS/mk 10 ANNEX LIFE.4  EN  INVITES the Commission, the Social Protection Committee and the Employment Committee, in accordance with their respective competences, taking into account national circumstances, to: 23. DEVELOP FURTHER the existing EU benchmarking in the area of minimum income protection in order to facilitate the monitoring of performance and support policy levers across the three key dimensions of minimum income protection, namely adequacy, access and the provision of enabling services, including those facilitating labour market participation; and 24. PREPARE periodically a joint report to analyse and review progress achieved in the development of minimum income protection in the Member States, building on the benchmarking framework for minimum income protection established at EU level. The report should in particular analyse empirically the role of minimum income protection in supporting employment and addressing poverty as well as inequalities of income and opportunities including aspects of gender inequality. The report should cover the application of the dimensions of access, adequacy and enabling aspects of minimum income protection. It should also study the potential of minimum income protection to stabilise the economy and society in times of economic downturn, in conjunction with other employment support and social protection measures.    ___________________   \t\t2020-10-12T11:21:49+0000\t Guarantee of Integrity and Authenticity\t"}]}
