As security guards control access to supermarkets, nursing homes, protect hospitals and critical infrastructure, they support the enforcement of public health, as well as safety and contingency measures.   Despite their remarkable job in contributing to a safe and secure society for the benefit of every citizen and organisation, too often private security workers remain invisible. For that reason, the EU social partners in private security \u2013 CoESS and UNI Europa \u2013 welcome that the European Commission1 and many European governments have officially recognised private security as \u201cessential services\u201d. This \u201cessential services\u201d-status should lead public authorities to rethink how they purchase security services and value a sector whose goal it is to put the health and safety of workers and citizens first. The European sectoral social partners for the private security industry, CoESS and UNI Europa, share the common goal to ensure business continuity in a situation where the provision of private security services is essential as well as to retain staff in a safe and secure working environment. It is in this context that maintaining and using collective bargaining is key to finding equitable and sustainable solutions for businesses and workers during the crisis. At the same time, the private security industry is severely affected by closures of buildings and offices, substantially reduced air traffic, and the cancellation of events. In some countries, business activity has declined by 25-30 per cent compared to the prior financial year. For that reason 75 per cent of CoESS members report that lack of liquidity has become a problem for the sector. By no means are new service demands compensating for the downturn and standstill in service segments such as aviation and event security. As a consequence, the future of many businesses, especially those specialised in the above services, hangs in the air and workers face an uncertain future.  Despite the sector\u2019s substantial challenges that threaten business continuity and the protection of workers, the private security industry remains committed to contributing to a safe, healthy, sustainable and secure economic recovery in Europe, in collaboration with or on behalf of public forces. For that reason, CoESS and UNI Europa congratulate the European Commission and Council for the valuable \u201cJoint European Roadmap towards lifting COVID-19 containment measures\u201d which outlines the necessary criteria to respect upon the lifting of the confinement measures. Private security will continue to provide expertise and help to enforce many of the health and safety measures with which citizens will have to live for the foreseeable future.   1 C(2020) 102I final   https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-european-roadmap-lifting-coronavirus-containment-measures_en   2 To support this process, CoESS and UNI Europa have adopted the following joint recommendations for competent authorities, at European and national level, to address in cooperation with sectoral social partners: (I) Better recognition of private security as essential services: Although the crisis has proven that private security provides essential services, and both the European Commission and many Member States have recognised the profession as such, many CoESS members report a lack of recognition of the profession by public authorities in practice. More than 30 per cent of CoESS members report that governments did not respond to the urgent need to recognise private security as an essential service \u2013 which stands in contrast with the work carried out by guards, the support they require and the public praise the sector received in many countries. We therefore call on competent authorities in Member States to provide private security workers and businesses with the special consideration and support they need and deserve, and to engage with sectoral social partners on our recommendations. This also includes adequate childcare options for workers that are working during the lockdown.   (II) Access to personal protective equipment (PPE): In many countries, companies still face challenges in procuring a sufficient amount of suitable PPE. Competent authorities must ensure the dissemination of information on how to use PPE as well as the provision of appropriate PPE to businesses in order to protect workers and citizens without creating market competition to the healthcare sector. Financial support should be considered, either by buyers or competent authorities, to enable businesses in covering the rising, additional costs for risk assessments, analysis and the distribution of PPE to the workforce. Public authorities should also provide up-to-date training on infectious disease protocols.    (III) Financial and administrative support to struggling businesses and workers: We highly welcome the EU\u2019s and Member States\u2019 efforts to provide administrative and financial support to workers and businesses suffering from the COVID-19 situation. Aid and support must be quickly available with low administrative burden, and competent authorities must engage with sectoral social partners to find quick, sector-specific solutions. Financial aid should aim to improve the working conditions, pay, and health and safety standards of the industry. If it is linked to collective bargaining, expanded public aid into private security would support sustainable growth in the wake of the crisis and provide millions of workers with stable employment. Private security is also part of the value chain of many other sectors. To address the likely increase in demand for services during the gradual lifting of containment measures in many different sectors, it is important to retain workers and ensure the sustainability of businesses now.  Financial support will also be necessary for those industries that have been put to a halt and will not be able to restart without additional safety measures performed by private security.  (IV) Best value procurement: The European Commission and many European governments have rightly recognised private security as essential services. This recognition must continue once Member States gradually lift contingency measures in terms of best value procurement that respects important quality criteria. Guards will play a central role to implement, in collaboration with or on behalf of public forces, public health and safety measures that support the safe and secure recovery of the European economy. It is important to hire qualified staff in qualitative working conditions for these tasks. CoESS and UNI Europa call on public and    3 private buyers of private security services to apply the social and quality procurement criteria and approaches defined in the Best Value Guide, which was jointly developed in the framework of the European Social Dialogue and co-funded by the European Commission. It is available at www.securebestvalue.org.   (V) Contracting practices: 50% of CoESS members report that public and private buyers have adopted bad contracting practices, including: unilaterally scaling-down or suspending services without bridging agreements, extending or suspending payment terms, or forcing contractors to lower rates that compromise quality and collective agreements. Such practices exacerbate businesses\u2019 financial difficulties; incentivise working conditions that are not compliant with collective agreements; and stand in contrast to the role that private security plays in managing the COVID-19 situation. They ultimately compromise health, safety and security for both the client and the security personnel. Beyond that such practices undermine the sustainability of many businesses. After all, the very businesses and workers that protect the public need financial security themselves. We therefore call on competent authorities to urgently address this matter and engage with sectoral social partners to discuss practical, temporary solutions during the ongoing crisis. Now more than ever, buyers who incentivise unfair competition are a danger to occupational health, public safety and economic recovery.  (VI) Adequate removal of barriers for the redeployment of workers: The standstill of numerous service segments such as aviation and event security is hitting private security businesses hard. At the same time, the sector has difficulties responding to a growing demand for other essential services, such as access control and enforcement of public health and safety measures in the healthcare and retail sectors, banks and public administration, as well as private properties including offices and factories. The demand can be expected to increase when schools, universities, transportation, HORECA and tourism are gradually opening again with the obligation to implement additional safety measures. It is therefore crucial to retain workers in the sector now, address existing barriers to the redeployment of guards and find qualitative solutions to train and license personnel in a way that reflects new market demand, necessary occupational health protection procedures, as well as physical distancing measures that will likely stay in place for a longer period and that may inhibit training and licensing.   (VII) Ensure that cash continues to offer access to payment for all: Cash payments are currently stigmatised and restricted in many shops, although it is particularly vital to older people, the homeless and other marginalised groups. This trend has therefore led to a severe financial situation of Cash-in-Transit businesses and their workers. Governments and central banks should ensure that everyone who wants to pay with cash can do so. The World Health Organisation, the European Central Bank and other national central banks have ruled out that the coronavirus spreads through banknotes.

On 10 March 2020, the Heads of State or Government emphasised the need for a joint European approach and a close coordination with the European Commission. In particular, Health Ministers and Interior Ministers were invited to consult daily to ensure proper coordination and aim for common European guidance (1). The scale of the global threat faced today underlines the imperative need for EU coordination, to maximise the potential impact of measures taken at the national level. It is against this backdrop that on 16 March 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council (2), calling for a temporary Restriction on Non-Essential Travel to the EU in view of COVID- 19 (\u2018the Communication\u2019). It sought to ensure that action taken at the EU\u2019s external borders was consistent and appropriate. The Communication complements the Guidelines of the Commission for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services (3) (\u2018the Guidelines\u2019) whose objective is to protect citizens\u2019 health, ensure the appropriate treatment of people whose travel is essential, and make sure essential goods and services remain available inside the EU. The Communication underlined that the EU\u2019s external border should act as a security perimeter and that Member States and Schengen Associated Countries should restrict any non-essential travelling from third countries into the EU+ area. It made clear that they are allowed to refuse entry at the external borders to \u2018non-resident third-country nationals where they present relevant symptoms or have been particularly exposed to risk of infection and are considered to be a threat to public health\u2019 (4). On 17 March 2020, the Heads of State or Government endorsed the call to reinforce the external borders by applying a coordinated temporary restriction of non-essential travel to the EU for a period of 30 days, based on the approach proposed by the Commission. The Heads of State or Government also endorsed the Guidelines on border management (5).

In order to assist this action at the external border, the European Commission has prepared this guidance (the Guidance) based on input from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), with the support of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and Europol. The Guidance also follows up on the joint statement of the Members of the European Council of 26 March 2020 which emphasised the need to step up efforts to ensure that EU citizens who are stranded in third countries who want to go home can do so. The Guidance provides advice and practical instructions to implement measures adopted by the Member States (6) and Schengen Associated Countries following the Communication. In particular, it provides guidance as regards: \u2014 The introduction of temporary travel restriction applying to all non-essential travel from third countries to the EU+ area; \u2014 The facilitation of transit arrangements for the repatriation of EU citizens and their family members stranded in third countries; \u2014 Minimum service in consulates for processing visa applications; and \u2014 Dealing with overstay caused by travel restrictions, including for visa-waived third country nationals. 1. The introduction of temporary travel restriction applying to all non-essential travel from third countries to the EU+ area (7) a) General Under the Schengen Borders Code (8) and national law adopted in order to ensure coordinated action to fight COVID-19, it is possible to refuse entry to non-resident third-country nationals where they present relevant symptoms or have been particularly exposed to risk of infection and are considered to be a threat to public health: \u2014 Article 2(21) of the Schengen Borders Code defines \u2018threat to public health\u2019 as any disease with epidemic potential as defined by the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organisation, and other infectious diseases or contagious parasitic diseases if they are the subject of protection provisions applying to nationals of the Member States. \u2014 Article 6(1) of the Schengen Borders Code determines entry conditions for third-country nationals, including the condition that they must present no threat to inter alia public health (Article 6(1)(e)). \u2014 Article 14 of the Schengen Borders Code stipulates that third-country nationals not fulfilling the entry conditions from Article 6(1) and not belonging to the categories of persons referred to in Article 6(5) shall be refused entry (9). (6) https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/03/17/conclusions-by-the-president-of-the-european-council- following-the-video-conference-with-members-of-the-european-council-on-covid-19/ (7) The \u201cEU+ area\u201d includes all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), as well as the four Schengen Associated Countries. It would also include Ireland and the United Kingdom if they decide to align. (8) Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code). (9) Without prejudice to the application of special provisions concerning the right of asylum and to international protection or the issue of long-stay visas (in accordance with Article 14(1) of the Schengen Borders Code). EN Official Journal of the European Union C 102 I/4                                                                                                                                         30.3.2020   Any decision on refusal of entry needs to be proportionate, non-discriminatory and implemented in a way that ensures full respect of the human dignity of the persons concerned. A measure is considered proportionate on condition that it has been taken following consultation of the health authorities and that it has been considered by them as suitable and necessary to attain the public health objective (10). Practical Guidance: Annex V, Part B of the Schengen Borders Code, the refusal of entry form mentions reason \u201cI\u201d as public health issues. Each Member State should indicate the references to its national law relating to the refusal of entry with reference to Articles 6(1) and 2(21) of the Schengen Borders Code. If third-country nationals traveling with a valid Schengen visa (Article 6 of the Schengen Borders Code) are refused entry on grounds motivated only by the travel restrictions based on threat to public health reasons (national measures recognising a situation of public health emergency) the following steps should be taken: \u2014 The interpretation of \u201cthe relevant symptoms\u201d is very important as for COVID-19 a range of mild respiratory symptoms can be present at the start of the illness. For persons \u201c\u2026particularly exposed to risk of infection\u2026\u201d the classification of \u201chigh risk contacts\u201d in the ECDC technical report should be followed; \u2014 The standard form for refusal of entry at the borders (Annex V part B - Schengen Borders Code) should be filled out, indicating the reason of refusal \u201cI\u201d(considered to be a threat to public health). The reference to the national measure adopted to ensure the coordinated action and determining the scope of temporary restrictions for non-essential travel should be clearly indicated; \u2014 The border guard shall specify the reason of refusal in the form under the section \u2018Comments\u2019; \u2014 The border guard performing border checks shall affix an entry stamp on the passport, cancelled by an indelible cross in black ink and write opposite it on the right-hand side, also in indelible ink the letter \u201cI\u201d. A valid visa shall not be stamped \u201cREVOKED\u201d or \u201cANNULLED\u201d only on the basis of refused entry substantiating the reason \u201cI\u201d; \u2014 To keep better records on the refusals related to the non-essential travel restrictions due to the threat to public health reason, this should be recorded in the national \u201cborder check\u201d systems, whenever the option to insert some additional information on the record of the checked passenger is available; \u2014 The traveller should be provided with an information leaflet on COVID-19: Infographics or leaflet available from ECDC; \u2014 For a healthy traveller there is no need for additional sanitary notification to the authorities of the neighbouring third-country to which the traveller is returned from an EU external land border crossing point (road or rail traffic) or from an EU external maritime border crossing point (for example ports designated for regular ferries connections or other ports with cruise ships or individual sailors or fishing boats). b) Cases of travellers who are authorised to cross the external borders on entry (1) EU c i t iz en s/na t iona l s  of  Sc hengen Associated  Countr ies  and  the ir  fami ly  memb ers  i r respect ive  of  the i r  nat ional i ty,  th i rd-countr y  nat ionals  holding  a  res idence  per mit  and  the ir  depend ants  The Communication provides that temporary travel restrictions must exempt nationals of all EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries, for the purposes of returning to their homes. This exemption must apply to: \u2014 all EU citizens (11) and citizens of the Schengen Associated Countries, and their family members irrespecive of their nationality; \u2014 third-country nationals who are long-term residents under the Long-term Residence Directive (12) and persons deriving their right to reside from other EU Directives or national law or who hold national long-term visas.

All persons (that is both EU/ Schengen Associated Countries and third-country nationals) who cross the external borders to enter the Schengen Area are subject to systematic checks at border crossing points. Border checks may include health checks as set out in Section III of the Guidelines (13). Member States must always admit their own citizens and EU citizens or third country nationals legally residing on their territory. Member States can, however, take appropriate measures such as requiring non-nationals entering their territory to undergo self-isolation or similar measures upon return from an area affected by COVID-19, provided they impose the same requirements on their own nationals. (2) Oth er  th i r d -countr y  nat iona l s  who can  be  author ised  to  enter  the  EU despi te  of  the  c lo sure  o f  the  E U  exter n al  border  The temporary restriction of non-essential travel should not apply to persons with an essential function or need, including: \u2014 Healthcare professionals, health researchers, and elderly care professionals; \u2014 Frontier workers; \u2014 Seasonal workers in agriculture; \u2014 Transport personnel; \u2014 Diplomats, staff of international organisations, military personnel and humanitarian aid workers and civil protection personnel in the exercise of their functions; \u2014 Passengers in transit (14); \u2014 Passengers travelling for imperative family reasons; \u2014 Persons in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons respecting the principle of non- refoulement. Coordinated and reinforced health checks should be carried out for the individuals allowed to enter the EU+ area. Practical Guidance: When carrying out border checks on the travellers authorised to cross the external borders on entry, national authorities shall strictly enforce the Schengen Borders Code. In particular they shall verify that passports, identity cards, residence permits or any other supporting document are authentic. National authorities shall enforce the systematic checks against the Schengen Information System (SIS) as this measure protects the Schengen Area against a potential terrorist threat or cross border criminality. Passports of third-country nationals shall be stamped. Health screening of travellers for COVID-19 involves the use of thermal scanning and/or symptom screening. The national decisions regarding entry procedure need to be applied. For example, several countries have decided to put everyone entering their country (also their own citizens) into 14 days of quarantine. Member States and Schengen Associated Countries may limit the number of border crossing points which remain open to the categories of travellers who are still allowed to enter the Schengen Area. This measure may help to ensure that the introduced public health measures related to COVID-19 are fully respected and there is a strengthened and focused control at the external borders. It could help Member States to concentrate the workforce in dedicated border crossing points properly equipped to fully comply with the Schengen Borders Code and the specific sanitary measures. Member States and Schengen Associated Countries are invited to communicate the list of those border crossing points to the Commission by 1 April 2020.

(14) Including those having been repatriated through consular assistance. EN Official Journal of the European Union C 102 I/6                                                                                                                                         30.3.2020   (3) Se cur i ty  i ssue s  In case of need, Europol stands ready to call for the deployment of additional guest officers from Member States to carry out secondary security checks against relevant databases (i.e. Europol Information System, Schengen Information System, Interpol). Cross-border police cooperation could also be stepped up on a bilateral/regional basis at the request of a specific Member State should this be necessary to combat or prevent criminal offences. Article 18 of the Pr\u00fcm Decision provides the legal basis for cross-border cooperation in situations of mass gatherings and similar major events, disasters and serious accidents, by seeking to prevent criminal offences and maintain public order and security. It allows for the dispatch of officers, specialists and advisers and the supply of equipment, at the request of the Member State within whose territory the situation has arisen. Europol could facilitate such support. Europol can also provide enhanced assistance for the Member States on terrorism, organised and other serious crime posing a risk to public order and security. Practical Guidance: Member States are reminded of the need to grant access and use at the external borders of information systems or common frameworks for exchange of information: the Schengen Information System (SIS II); the Visa Information System; Eurodac. In addition, other non-EU systems such as Interpol\u2019s Lost and Stolen Travel Documents database should be consulted. As regards secondary security controls, for high risk profiles, Member States should continue cooperation and information exchange to ensure an optimal use of Europol, SIS and Interpol data. A more systematic use of risk indicators provided by Europol and Frontex should be promoted to identify high risk profiles. A consistent three-tier information sharing approach should be implemented particularly regarding Foreign Terrorist Fighters since SIS II consultation does not cover the entire scope of known suspects from non-EU origin. A systematic consultation of Europol\u2019s databases is therefore required to extend border control reach to non-SIS II signalled individuals. To enhance security controls, Member States can ask the support of Europol with data-sharing, data-acquisition and data-analysis capabilities, including the Europol Information System, data management capabilities as well as other capabilities and forensics tools. c) Exit checks on persons who wish to leave the EU Border authorities should apply the Guidelines, when performing exit checks, as follows: \u2014 Provide information to passengers on COVID-19 temporary restrictions on non-essential travel to the EU. Cases of concern related to COVID-19 should be referred immediately to the relevant health services. \u2014 Perform exit health screening measures that aim at assessing the presence of symptoms and/or the exposure to COVID-19 of travellers departing from affected countries. Travellers identified as exposed to, or infected with COVID-19 should not be allowed to travel. EU+ citizens or third-country nationals who want to leave the EU should be notified as follows: \u2014 Issue a formal warning to persons about possible measures in the neighbouring EU Member States, Schengen Associated Countries or third countries with regard to travel and health issues, to the extent that these measures have been notified in the appropriate channels of communication. \u2014 Issue a formal warning to EU citizens and third-country nationals residing in a Member State informing them that national health-related measures may be applied to them in case of re-entry arriving from a third country. EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.3.2020                                                                                                                                         C 102 I/7   \u2014 Issue a formal warning for third-country nationals informing them on the special measures introduced which are enforced on entry and thus would apply to them on re-entry. \u2014 This formal warning should be available in all the official languages of the EU and in the language(s) of the country or countries bordering the Member State concerned and also in a language which third-country nationals understand or may reasonably be presumed to understand. Practical Guidance: While Member States and Schengen Associated Countries may limit the number of border crossing points remaining open to travellers on entry, they should then still allow travellers to exit from any land or maritime border crossing point, in case travellers show up spontaneously and provided that the neighbouring third-country of destination admits travellers at the border crossing point of arrival. Member States and Schengen Associated Countries are invited to agree with their neighbouring third countries which land or maritime border crossing points remain open for entry and/or exit checks. This measure intends to reduce as much as possible the number of travellers who are denied entry to a neighbouring third-country after completion of the exit checks by EU/Schengen border authorities. Member States and Schengen Associated Countries are invited to communicate those agreements to the Commission by 1 April 2020. d) Prioritisation of entry checks given the specific sanitary situation In view of a possible limitation by the Member States of the number of border crossing points open to travellers at the external borders, Member States may refer to Article 9 of the Schengen Borders Code (temporary relaxation of the border checks) which allows to give priority to entry over exit checks at the external borders. In line with the Schengen Borders Code, the border checks at external borders may be temporarily relaxed as a result of exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, leading to a traffic of such intensity that the waiting time at the border crossing point becomes excessive and where all resources have been exhausted as regards staff, facilities and organisation. In such circumstances the following points should be considered: \u2014 Priority should be given to the checks on entry movements over the border checks on exit; \u2014 Even if checks are relaxed, the border guard should stamp the travel documents of third-country nationals both on entry and exit, in accordance with Article 9(3) of the Schengen Borders Code; \u2014 The relaxation of checks should be temporary, adapted to the circumstances justifying it and phased out gradually. The above-mentioned provisions are without prejudice to sanitary measures according to Member States\u2019 national law. The measures proposed in the Commission Communication on the implementation of the Green Lanes under the Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services (15) should be duly taken into account. (15) C(2020) 1897, OJ C 96I, 24.3.2020, p. 1. EN Official Journal of the European Union C 102 I/8                                                                                                                                         30.3.2020   Practical guidance: Member States who need to temporarily relax exit checks in compliance with the Schengen Borders Code are urged to maintain the full enforcement of border checks on entry complemented with the adequate sanitary measures. This measure will be facilitated by the limitation of the number of border crossing points remaining open to travellers at the external borders. The information on the consequences of leaving the EU territory in the current situation, as referred to in point c) above, could take the form of a general information present in different locations and in at least in the languages of the Member States concerned and of the neighbouring country plus in English. e) Sanitary and safety measures protecting border guards and other public agents deployed at the external borders Member States are invited to equip all public agents involved in border, customs, sanitary or any kind of controls at the external borders with a personal protective equipment such as masks, gloves and sanitising gels. Practical guidance: Hand hygiene refers to the frequent washing of hands with soap and water or cleaning of hands with alcoholic solutions, gels or tissues. Hands should be washed regularly using soap and water for 20\u201340 seconds. Alcohol-based hand sanitisers provide limited added benefit over soap and water in community settings, and if used should contain 60\u201385 % alcohol. Poster on effective hand washing by ECDC. There is no evidence on the usefulness of facemasks worn by persons who are not ill as a community mitigation measure. However, people involved in customer service, who have large numbers of face-to-face contacts, such as border agents, are at a higher risk of encountering infected individuals. If masks are used, best practices should be followed for donning, doffing, and disposing of them. The hand hygiene measures detailed above should always be followed after removing a mask.

Guidance for wearing and removing personal protective equipment in healthcare settings for the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. 2. Transit and facilitating transit after repatriation In line with the joint statement of the Members of the European Council of 26 March 2020, it is necessary to step up efforts to ensure that EU citizens who are stranded in third countries who want to go home can do so. Member States must facilitate onward transit of EU citizens and their family members, irrespective of their nationality, as well as third country nationals holding a residence permit and their dependants who are returning to their Member State of nationality or residence. This applies notably to EU citizens and their family members stranded abroad who are repatriated to the EU, regardless of whether they arrive on commercial flights, charter flights or national planes. EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.3.2020                                                                                                                                         C 102 I/9   Nationals of Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey should be assimilated to those of Member States and Schengen Associated Countries for the application of the temporary restriction of non-essential travels set out in the Communication when they are returning to their countries of origin within the repatriation operations under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, given that they are Participating States to the Mechanism. Transit of all persons (16) and their families repatriated under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism from a Member State where they entered the external border to their place of origin must be ensured. Practical guidance: Given the reduced availability of commercial flights, citizens arriving at a Member State airport should be allowed to transit onward by any means of transportation available. Transit within the EU should not be conditional on the citizen\u2019s Member State of nationality or residence providing for a means of transportation. The goal must be to ensure that the flights available to EU citizens stranded abroad are used to best effect, by carrying passengers returning to all possible EU destinations. Member States are asked to inform airlines of the exemptions to the temporary travel restriction for EU citzens travelling home. Moreover, in line with Article 26 of the Schengen Convention, airlines transporting EU citizens from a third country into the Schengen area cannot face carrier liability in cases where transit through the Member State of destination of the flight is not guaranteed prior to boarding of the plane. EU provisions on carriers liability do not apply to EU citizens and potential refusals of entry for public health reasons. If a Member State requires EU citizens to provide proof of onward transit, for example a booked railway ticket, this information should be made available on the Member States\u2019 websites to ensure that citizens are adequately informed. Such a requirement should also be communicated to the other Members States, including to their embassies and consulates in third countries in the context of local consular cooperation. To facilitate onward transit through a Member State, EU citizens should be allowed to obtain such proof at the border, for example by allowing them to purchase railway or plane tickets directly at airports. 3. Minimum service in consulates for processing visa applications The Member States and the Schengen Associated Countries currently apply travel restrictions at their external borders. As part of the measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, most Schengen countries have suspended the processing of short stay visa applications for non-essential travel. Schengen countries\u2019 consular authorities are, however, invited to follow the guidelines on \u2018minimum service\u2019 for processing of visa applications from specific categories of visa applicants during the COVID-19 emergency period. The general rules on the examination of visa applications should be applied. These guidelines also apply if a formal representation arrangement is in place. If a formal arrangement is not in place, ad hoc representation for the processing of visa applications should be applied in individual cases and under extraordinary circumstances, e.g. for staff attending military/security summits, for urgent medical reasons, etc. The case handling Member State should consult the Member State of destination before issuing a visa. Visa holders should systematically be reminded that they will be required to justify their travel purpose and present supporting documents at the border crossing point. They should also be informed appropriately of the fact that they need to undergo health screening and of the consequences of their arrival in the EU (i.e. possibility of being subjected to self-isolation). The Communication lists a number of categories of travellers who are exempted from the temporary travel restrictions or to whom the temporary travel restriction should not apply. Travellers in some of these categories may be nationals of third countries under the short stay visa requirement. (16) Nationals of EU Member States, Schengen Associated Countries, the UK and Union Civil Protection Mechanism Participating States. EN Official Journal of the European Union C 102 I/10                                                                                                                                       30.3.2020   Despite temporary partial closure of visa sections, Member States\u2019 consulates (and possibly external service providers collecting applications) should therefore remain open and accept and deal with visa applications from the following categories of travellers: \u2014 Family members of EU citizens covered by Directive EC/2004/38/EC; \u2014 Healthcare professionals, health researchers, and elderly care professionals; \u2014 Frontier workers; \u2014 Transport personnel; \u2014 Diplomats, staff of international organisations, military personnel and humanitarian aid workers in the exercise of their functions; \u2014 Passengers needing to transit through the international transit areas of airports between connecting extra-Schengen flights; \u2014 Passengers travelling for imperative family reasons. The general rules on the examination of applications for short stay visas and airport transit visa (Visa Code) should be applied. Validity of the issued visa: it is recommended that multiple entry visas and visas allowing for multiple airport transits are issued by default with a validity of minimum six months, and an authorised duration of stay of 90 days (except for airport transit visas). Information to the public: Member States should immediately inform the public in the locations concerned on the practice that will be followed. Common information by all Member States should be favoured. Information to the host country: these guidelines are shared with the Local Schengen Cooperation correspondents in EU Delegations, and it is recommended that this information is shared with the national authorities of host countries. Practical guidance: When such cases arise, Member States and Schengen Associated Countries are invited to inform the national authorities of EU/Schengen border crossing point where a traveller is expected to arrive with a Schengen visa that was issued on the ground of an extraordinary circumstance. 4. Dealing with overstay caused by travel restrictions, including for visa-waived third country nationals The stay of visa holders present in the Schengen area who cannot leave at the expiry of their short-stay visa may be extended up to a maximum stay of 90/180 days by the designated Member States authorities (17). If the visa holders are compelled to stay beyond the extended period of 90/180 days, a national long-stay visa or a temporary residence permit should be issued by the competent national authorities. For visa-waived third-country nationals who are compelled to stay beyond the extended 90/180 days, a national long- stay visa or a temporary residence permit should be issued by the competent national authorities. Member States are encouraged to waive administrative sanctions or penalties on third-countries nationals unable to leave their territory due to the travel restrictions. Overstays due to travel restrictions should not be taken into account during the processing of future visa applications.
