Since the beginning of the pandemic the company has introduced safety measures which have never been loosen since then. Planning process has been completely changed \u2013 from annual-based planning to quarterly planning. Projects and advertisement costs for 2020 have been re-planned. \r\rA special focus has been put on online sales. The demand for some categories of products has notably increased through online channels. The company has invested in developing relationships with new e-sales partners and has expanded its staff dealing with them.\r\rA new portfolio of disinfectants for personal and home use has been developed in two of the company\u2019s best known brands on the Bulgarian market. ", "content_of_measure_description": "\r* Four and six-hour as well as full-time remote working schemes have been introduced.\r* Employers at the age of over 60 have been put on paid leave.\r* Strict measures for disinfection, hygiene and safety have been taken.\r* Two to three times more buses for transportation of factory workers have been rented in order to reduce the number of people using one vehicle. Additional incentives have been provided to factory workers to come to work by private vehicles. Protection consumables have been provided not only in the factories, but also for the homes of the employees.\r* A daily newsletter entitled Ficosota Daily has been introduced since the beginning of the pandemic. It has been written by the manager and after the first two months turned on a weekly basis. The contents were focused in four directions: safety recommendations - not only at work, but in general; sharing an internal website with suggestions of employees; information on how sales are going (how many trucks had left the factories, for which countries, which products were sold more and which \u2013 less, etc.); information on the \"Help Now\" campaign of the management of the company. This information tool has been very well welcomed by the employees. \r", "use_of_measure_description": "1,300 employees of Ficosota company, Bulgaria.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "No involvement.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "Yes", "private_or_public_sector": "Only private sector", "is_occupation_specific": "No", "actors": ["Company / Companies"], "target_groups": ["SMEs"], "funding": ["Companies"], "sectors": ["Manufacture of food products", "Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products"], "occupations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://ficosota.com/https://www.capital.bg/biznes/kompanii/2020/08/15/4096169_krasen_kjurkchiev_stroim_nova_fabrika_za_hrani_v_shumen/", "title": "Capital media: Interview with the owner of Ficosota ", "content_path": "res/2d32737041a3838cde280d26ba94ab88f058a5762eebaf0fb6824aa1c81d9ee8", "content": "Ficosota            Ficosota                    Home            Brands            Infographic            Careers            Contacts            Login            Privacy Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \t        page not found        go to home page      \t                                        Fast & Smart  FS            Brave Br            Contemporary Co            Next to You NY            Friendly FR                                    This website uses cookies according to the Cookie Policy.
