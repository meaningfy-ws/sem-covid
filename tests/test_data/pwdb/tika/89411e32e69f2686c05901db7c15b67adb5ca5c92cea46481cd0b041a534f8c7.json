While the majority of people were asked to stay at home, our frontline workers went to work. Among them were our healthcare professionals who acted selflessly, putting their own health at risk, in order to care for their patients. We owe them, and all frontline workers, a debt of gratitude. These experiences will have taken a toll on many, which is why this online professional mental health service from turn2me is so important. This new service, which is funded by Sl\u00e1intecare, is free for everyone who identifies as a frontline worker. I would strongly encourage any frontline worker who needs support to put their own health first and to use this service.\u201d", "content_of_measure_description": "Turn2me provides professional mental health support services entirely online. The new service for frontline workers is a peer support, instant chat service. Each session is facilitated by a mental health professional and supported by trained volunteers.\r\rThere are 20 groups available each week and there are job specific groups available, as well as groups based on shared issues such as stress, burnout and how to maintain a healthy work life balance.  Groups are scheduled at different times in the day throughout the week to accommodate shift workers, and participants can remain anonymous when online. The content and timings of the groups were developed following consultation and discussion with frontline workers from different disciplines.\r\rBrian Holohan, Clinical Manager with turn2me, said; \u201cDemand for turn2me\u2019s services has increased significantly, at the peak of the pandemic earlier this year for example, demand  spiked by 386%. It has been challenging for everyone, but especially for our frontline workers. The adverse psychological impact of working in such stressful circumstances, while at the same time dealing with the reality of Covid-19 in their personal lives, should not be underestimated. There\u2019s a large evidence base that peer support, like the service we\u2019re launching for frontline workers, is effective and that it can also act as a helpful gateway for people who haven\u2019t reached out for help before. If you\u2019ve been struggling in any way, please know that you are not alone and that talking will help. We have a team of mental health professionals and volunteers all over the country who are there to support you. Help is at your fingertips 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\u201d", "use_of_measure_description": "No information available to date.", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "N/A",

Its new service for frontline workers is a peer support, instant chat service. Each session is facilitated by a mental health professional and supported by trained volunteers.There are 20 groups available each week and there are job specific groups available, as well as groups based on shared issues such as stress, burnout and how to maintain a healthy work life balance.\u00a0 Groups are scheduled at different times in the day throughout the week to accommodate shift workers, and participants can remain anonymous when online. The content and timings of the groups were developed following consultation and discussion with frontline workers from different disciplines.Launching the service, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly TD said; \u201cIt has been a difficult year for everyone across the country, but especially for our frontline workers. While the majority of people were asked to stay at home, our frontline workers went to work. Among them were our healthcare professionals who acted selflessly, putting their own health at risk, in order to care for their patients. We owe them, and all frontline workers, a debt of gratitude. These experiences will have taken a toll on many, which is why this online professional mental health service from turn2me is so important. This new service, which is funded by Sl\u00e1intecare, is free for everyone who identifies as a frontline worker. I would strongly encourage any frontline worker who needs support to put their own health first and to use this service.\u201dLaura Magahy, Executive Director of Sl\u00e1intecare, said; \u201cOne of the main goals of Sl\u00e1intecare is to support innovative initiatives that help people engage in their own health and the stepped model of care provided by turn2me is a fantastic example of just that, providing the right care, at the right time and in the right place. This new peer support group for frontline workers is a targeted initiative designed to support the people who have been to the forefront of maintaining all essential public services throughout the pandemic.\u201dBrian Holohan, Clinical Manager with turn2me, said; \u201cDemand for turn2me\u2019s services has increased significantly, at the peak of the pandemic earlier this year for example, demand\u00a0 spiked by 386%. It has been challenging for everyone, but especially for our frontline workers. The adverse psychological impact of working in such stressful circumstances, while at the same time dealing with the reality of Covid-19 in their personal lives, should not be underestimated. There\u2019s a large evidence base that peer support, like the service we\u2019re launching for frontline workers, is effective and that it can also act as a helpful gateway for people who haven\u2019t reached out for help before. If you\u2019ve been struggling in any way, please know that you are not alone and that talking will help. We have a team of mental health professionals and volunteers all over the country who are there to support you. Help is at your fingertips 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\u201dAs well as being facilitated by a mental health professional, peer support is an important part of the turn2me model. Elaine O\u2019 Donoghue from Kerry is a community builder volunteer with turn2me and having worked as a teacher for more than 10 years she understands the pressures facing frontline workers. She encourages anyone who identifies as a frontline worker and who is in need of support, to try the service \u201cLike many people, I struggle with my mental health sometimes and living in a rural part of Ireland I found it hard to find a service that was accessible. I wish I had found turn2me sooner, it really helps me to maintain good mental health. Making that first step to seek help can be hard but the anonymous nature of the turn2me service means that you can be completely honest and open, in a completely non-judgemental environment and there\u2019s a real comfort in that when you\u2019re feeling vulnerable or mentally unwell. \u00a0It unburdens the mind.\u201cMany frontline workers feel the need to maintain a brave face, and to act like they\u2019re always confident and in control; for teachers for example, in front of the children, their parents, and your own friends and family. Admitting you\u2019re stressed or struggling can feel like a sign of weakness but of course it\u2019s not. Talking to other people in the same situation can really help.Sometimes it can be hard to know where or how to start when you feel mentally unwell. All you need to do is go to your phone or laptop and logon to\u00a0turn2me.ie.\u00a0\u00a0The thought catcher and support groups are\u00a0like a scaffolding to help you take the first step and provide a starting point for conversation. There\u2019s a community of people there to support you and who know what you\u2019re going through.\u00a0There\u2019s also the option to access professional counselling.\u201d she said.To find our more visit https://turn2me.ie/   \t   \t\t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\u2190 Asthma Society and COPD Support Ireland Announce COPD Self-Management Masterclass as Part of Winter Wellness Series\u00a0\tChildren\u2019s Health Ireland utilise the HSE City West Care Facility for a 6 week Allergy initiative, to reduce its waiting list for Oral Food Challenges by 474 patients \u2192\t            You May Also Like                                                                                                      Emerging evidence on use of remdesivir in COVID-19                               May 14, 2020            hpnadmin            0                                                                                                                        Hospital Professional Awards Photos                               June 26, 2019            Hospital Professional News            0                                                                                                                        Minister opens the 3rd National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) Conference in Dublin Castle                               October 17, 2018            Hospital Professional News            0                           \t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
