They stressed that given the nature of PHS which is to provide care and support to people, including to people who can be far more at risk to COVID-19 than the general population, the continuity of those services must be ensured while guaranteeing the safety of PHS workers and users. Additionally many users are forced to self-isolate, including from their PHS workers. As a result, many PHS workers are going unpaid and the sectors face an unprecedented fall in their activity.\r\rOn 1 April 2020  European Federation for Family Employment & Home Care (EFFE), European Federation for Services to Individuals (EFSI), European Federation of Food, Agriculture and Tourism Trade Unions (EFFAT) and European Services Workers Union (UNI-Europa) adopted a joint statement on this matter.", "content_of_measure_description": "EFFAT, EFFE, EFSI and UNI-Europa call EU and national authorities to: \r\r* issue detailed health and safety instructions towards PHS workers including guidance on how to behave with clients suspected to have COVID-19 and how to limit the risks to PHS \rworkers at this time, especially taking into consideration that some people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic;\r* ensure access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to PHS workers, such as masks, gloves, sanitising gel, etc., given the risks of contagion in care and support provided in private homes and especially to vulnerable people; \r* avoid that due to a lack of equipment, staff shortages or financial constraints, PHS providers find themselves in a situation where they are unable to continue to provide essential care services to vulnerable people;\r* ensure sick leave and access to healthcare for PHS workers in order for them not to be forced to choose between getting paid and possibly putting at risk the people they are providing support to;\r* provide exceptions for PHS workers to cross national borders as many PHS workers are migrants and are currently in some countries unable to cross borders and deliver essential work.

Many of these home care and domestic workers are facing contagion exposure, job and income insecurity and lack of guidance among other issues. UNI Europa has been working together with EFFAT, EFFE and EFSI to outline solutions to mitigate the danger in this time of need.\u201cThese frontline heroes are putting in the work that people rely on to keep going. It took a crisis to reveal to everyone just how essential that is. Now we must act and it is truly inspiring to see that we are able to work together with employers who recognise the scale of the issues we face.\u201cTogether we know what is needed and we know how to make it happen. We\u2019ve outlined the steps to take. We will continue to do our part but there is a clear need for European and national authorities to step up the support for this all too often neglected workforce,\u201d said Oliver Roethig, Regional Secretary of UNI Europa.There are 8 million formal personal and household care workers in the EU and at least as many working undeclared. They provide care-related services in people\u2019s homes such as childcare, care for older people and people with disabilities (approximately 60% of PHS activities) as well as household support services such as cleaning, ironing, home repairs, gardening, etc. (approximately 40% of PHS activities).The joint statement outlines key measures for public authorities to ensure that best practice can be brought to personal and household services. Workers and employers call on them to step up safety guidance, personal protective equipment, job and income security, sick leave and healthcare access for those undertaking these crucial tasks. These measures are particularly important given that, in light of the Covid-19 crisis, PHS could become one of the largest job growth areas as millions of people will be looking for work in the aftermath of Covid-19.Read the joint statement here:                                                                                                                                Loading...
