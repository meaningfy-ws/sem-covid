Introduction  1.1 Objective   The restrictions imposed by the Health Authorities to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus have impacted the Maltese economy by slowing down various business activities that require support in restarting their economic activity.  Many businesses were faced with fixed operating costs which they had to bear even though the business was not running at its full capacity.   To address the situation, undertakings operating from business premises (any physical location through which business functions and/or processes are conducted, including commercial sites, industrial setups and offices) will be supported with their rent and electricity payments.     1.2 Duration of the incentive   Aid may be granted under the measure as from the date of its approval until no later than 31st December 2020.    1.3 Legal Basis  COVID-19 Temporary Support Measures Regulations 2020 (Legal Notice 345 of 2020) as subsidiary legislation to the Malta Enterprise Act, form the specific legal basis of this scheme.   Malta Enterprise Corporation may issue and publish Incentive Guidelines in terms of Article 8 (3)(a) of the Malta Enterprise Act (Chapter 463 of the Laws of Malta) which empowers Malta Enterprise Corporation to issue Incentive Guidelines for providing support measures to undertakings.    This measure falls within the terms and conditions established by the Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak adopted by the European Commission on 19 March 2020 [OJ C 91I, 20.3.2020], as amended by the Communication from the Commission \u2013 Amendment to the Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak [OJ C 112I, 4.4.2020], by the Communication from the Commission \u2013 Amendment to the Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak (OJ C 164/03, 13.5.2020), and by the Communication from the Commission \u2013 Third Amendment to the Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak [OJ C 218/03, 2.7.2020], and as may be subsequently amended (hereinafter referred to as the Temporary Framework).   1.4 Designated Authority   This incentive is administered by Malta Enterprise Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Corporation\u2019).  1.5 Form of Aid The support shall be awarded in the form of a direct cash grant.

During this extraordinary time, we have ensured that our businesses are sustained, reaffirmed the confidence we have in them, compelling them to take a step further and invest. In this, we shall remain standing shoulder to shoulder with them and our workers\u201d, said Silvio Schembri.More than \u20ac233 million has been paid for the Wage Supplement from March to September this year. Minister Schembri added that through this budget more than \u20ac200 million have been voted to safeguard jobs through the Covid Wage Supplement.This has assisted 78,357 workers in Malta and 4,201 in Gozo, amounting to a total of 85,000 workers.In the context of the Wage Supplement, the number of businesses receiving aid was 16,894.Regarding the Telework scheme, it was explained that by 19 October there were 662 applications and the amount paid towards this scheme was \u20ac 899,813.Regarding the Quarantine Leave scheme, as of 19 October there were 2,664 applications. The total amount approved was that of \u20ac1,821,750, while the sum of \u20ac1,639,400 has already been paid out.The period for businesses to apply for and benefit from the rent rebate scheme and a 50% rebate on electricity bills has recently reached its deadline.Regarding the 50% scheme in the electricity bills and for which a budget of \u20ac35 million was allocated, the number of applications submitted to Malta Enterprise was 6,422 which amounts to a total of 7,274 bills.\u00a0Regarding the rent refund scheme for which a budget of \u20ac45 million was allocated and from which businesses could benefit from a maximum of \u20ac2,500, Malta Enterprise received 4,405 applications from businesses and the self-employed while there are 4,954 individual lease contracts.Minister Schembri explained that there were less than 16,000 applications submitted, which is the total number of businesses that benefited from the Wage Supplement. This is due to the fact that certain businesses do not consume as much electricity. There are also activities that do not require rented space to operate, while there are also those who fall into the category of casa bottega who cannot apply because in their case the electricity meter is a domestic one and not a commercial one.In addition, there is the VAT exemption scheme, i.e. those earning up to \u20ac30,000 a year now not being required to collect VAT but being able to operate as VAT exempt businesses, therefore reducing the amount of administrative work involved for those small businesses and self-employed who are either small or just starting out. This threshold has been increased from \u20ac20,000 to \u20ac30,000 per year. This will also save on administrative costs and therefore will also serve as financial aid for these small businesses.\u00a0Malta Enterprise Chief Executive Kurt Farrugia explained that a scheme aimed at companies employing less than 50 people to undertake innovation projects will be launched in the near future, a scheme, that as announced in the budget will aid technological investments which improve the operation of companies and which will be covering up to 50% of the cost, all the while continuing to bolster existing schemes to further help existing sectors while attracting new ones.                                                                                        \t                                                                                                                            \t\t                                                                                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \tRemove Image from GalleryDelete Image from Page\tRemove Image from GalleryDelete Image from Page\t\u200bRemove Image from GalleryDelete Image from Page              Add an Image\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                                                        \t                                                                                                                            \t\t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \t\t\t\t\t                                                                                                                                                                        "}]}
