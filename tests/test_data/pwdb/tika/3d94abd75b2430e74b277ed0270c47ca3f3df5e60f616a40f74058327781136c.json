The Coronavirus Act 2020 is the major piece of legislation covering the government response.\r\rAs part of the further measures announced on 17 March, the Bank of England and the Treasury launched a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF).

The facility will look through temporary impacts on firms\u2019 balance sheets and cash flows by basing eligibility on firms\u2019 credit ratings prior to the Covid-19 shock.\"\r\rSo the scheme will\u00a0support companies which are fundamentally strong, but have been affected by a short-term funding squeeze, enabling them to continue financing their short-term liabilities. It is also designed to\u00a0support corporate finance markets overall and ease the supply of credit to all firms.\r\r\rThe scheme is open to larger firms whether or not they have previously sought credit in this way. It will operate for at least 12 months. The Bank of England has set out overall guidance about eligibility and notes that the scheme is \u201cnormally\u201d intended for:\r\rUK incorporated companies, including those with foreign-incorporated parents and with a genuine business in the UK; companies with significant employment in the UK; firms with their headquarters in the UK.

We would nevertheless recommend checking information with primary sources to ensure that it\u2019s up to date. In a worst-case scenario, it was feared that up to one fifth of UK employees might have been absent from work during the initial coronavirus outbreak. This would have had major economic impacts for the UK. This briefing provides information on the various sources of support for businesses affected. Please note that there may be further support schemes for specific sectors that are not covered here. Pre-existing Government support schemes for businesses may be of help to firms. More information about these is available in our briefing Access to support for small firms.  Advice and information for affected businesses is provided in a number of different places. The Government has created a website with detailed guidance on the different support measures available to businesses. It has also set up a dedicated team, led by the Department for International Trade (DIT) and UK Export Finance (UKEF), to offer supply chain support and help for businesses with cashflow problems. Early in the pandemic the Government announced plans for a \u00a3330+ billion package of support for businesses, including:  \u2022 A Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme that will see HMRC pay 80% of \u201cfurloughed\u201d workers\u2019 wages, up to a \u00a32,500 per month cap for at least three months. \u2022 A Self-Employment Income Support Scheme that will pay self-employed individuals up to 80% of their profits for three months, up to a \u00a32,500 per month cap. \u2022 A new Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme that will see banks offer loans of up to \u00a35m to support SMEs. The Government will cover the costs of interest on these loans for the first six months. The scheme was extended to larger businesses from 20 April. A simplified scheme, Bounce Back Loans, launched on 4 May. \u2022 Scaling up HMRC Time To Pay service, allowing businesses and the self-employed to defer tax payments over an agreed period of time.  \u2022 Tax deferments on both self-assessment tax returns and the quarterly tax return for 20 March-30 June. \u2022 Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees will be met by the Government in full for up to 14 days per employee.  \u2022 Business Rate Relief for all businesses in the retail, hospitality or leisure sector in England, for one year in 2020-21. Eligible pubs will also be entitled to a business rate discount of \u00a35,000. \u2022 Cash grants worth: \u2500 \u00a325,000 to the smallest businesses in the retail, hospitality or leisure sector.  \u2500 \u00a310,000 for all business in receipt of Small Business Rates Relief (SBRR) and Rural Rates Relief.  \u2022 The Covid 19 Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) for large businesses. https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7690/https://www.businesssupport.gov.uk/coronavirus-business-support/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-uk-businesses/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-uk-businesseshttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-additional-support-to-protect-businesseshttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-additional-support-to-protect-businesses5 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 \u2022 Provisions to prohibit forfeiture of a lease for non-payment of rent initially for 3 months to 30 June 2020 but since extended to 31 December and then to the end of March 2021. The Bank of England reduced the base rate to 0.1%, enabled an expansion of low-cost credit to businesses through the CCFF, reduced the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate (which the Bank estimates will allow banks to lend up to \u00a3190 billion more to businesses), and advised banks not to increase dividends or bonuses in response to the other actions announced. Insurance arrangements for businesses are complex and cover a number of areas. The Association of British Insurers advises businesses to check their cover and to discuss concerns with brokers. Few companies are likely to have pandemic business interruption coverage (whether related to Government orders to close down or notifiable illnesses), although the level of those who do is still uncertain and policy wording may be open to challenge. The Government advises those not eligible to claim to take up the other support measures on offer. Several months into the pandemic, the Government made changes to corporate insolvency and governance arrangements to help businesses to focus on operation and survival. Later still the Chancellor announced the Eat Out to Help Out scheme to help support eat-in dining. The Government made further announcements on 24 September through the Winter Economy Plan. These included a new Job Support Scheme, continuation of the Self Employment Income Support Scheme and various tax arrangements, and measures to extend the term of business loans schemes.  But the return of more severe restrictions later in the year led to further policy updates \u2013 including the retention of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and extension of arrangements for business loans and for the self-employed. The Government also introduced new schemes that provide funding to local authorities in England to support businesses. All our briefings on coronavirus are listed on the Commons Library coronavirus page. This briefing also signposts relevant Library publications and other sources throughout. Information about spending on many of the main schemes appears in Coronavirus business support schemes: statistics.  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/winter-economy-planhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/winter-economy-planhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8938/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8938/6 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  1. Impacts on business and the economy The Government warned that up to one-fifth of employees may be absent from work during peak weeks of the pandemic.1 This may vary for individual businesses but could have significant economic impacts on individual businesses as well as the wider economy. In Budget 2020, HM Treasury stated: The impact of the outbreak of Covid-19 on the UK economy is highly uncertain, and while the effect could prove significant, it is expected to be temporary.2 1.1 Original closure of business premises The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/350) (\u2018lockdown regulations\u2019) require businesses in a range of sectors in England to close their premises, except for carrying out certain permitted activities. The regulations came into effect on 26 March 2020. The Government published a list of the business premises that were required to close. Public health is devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The three nations introduced their own lockdown regulations that were broadly similar to those in England.3 1.2 Re-opening businesses On 10 May 2020, the Prime Minister addressed the nation to announce the Government\u2019s roadmap for lifting the coronavirus lockdown in England. On 11 May the Government published its Covid-19 recovery plan, setting out a three-step plan for lifting restrictions. The Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive issued their own guidance to businesses and workers 1.3 New restrictions from autumn Increases in infection rates led to wider restrictions from the autumn. These have led to differing and changing rules about which businesses may open in which country or area. The latest information is available as follows: \u2022 England \u2013 New National Restrictions from 5 November (section 4) \u2022 Northern Ireland \u2013 Coronavirus (COVID-19) regulations guidance: what the restrictions mean for you \u2022 Scotland \u2013 Coronavirus (COVID-19): local protection levels \u2022 Wales \u2013 Closure of businesses and premises: coronavirus (COVID 19)  1  Department of Health & Social Care, Coronavirus action plan: a guide to what you can expect across the UK, 3 March 2020 2  HM Treasury, Budget 2020, 11 March 2020, para 18 3  See SSI 2020/103 (Scot); WSI 2020/353 (W.80) (Wales); NISR 2020/55 (NI).

Where can businesses get information and advice? The Government has consolidated information and resources for businesses affected by the Coronavirus outbreak on its business support webpage. This is likely to be the most comprehensive source of up-to-date information available about support and eligibility. Please note that some aspects of business support are devolved to individual countries of the UK. The main webpage gives a brief summary of which schemes are available where, but there are also links to overall support available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Government business support advice On the 9 March 2020 the Government set up a dedicated team, led by the Department for International Trade and UK Export Finance (UKEF) to support businesses facing challenges caused by the coronavirus: \u2022 Supply chain support: DIT has a global network of relationships with businesses across the world and, where possible, it says it will seek to provide advice on alternative suppliers. DIT can also direct queries to professional service and advisory firms who can assist UK companies to seek alternative suppliers. \u2022 UKEF is also helping businesses with cash flow problems by guaranteeing bank loans through its Export Working Capital Scheme. It also offers an export insurance policy to help recover the costs of fulfilling an order that is terminated by events outside the control of the business. UKEF also supports finance for overseas buyers through the Direct Lending Facility scheme. The Departmental Operations Centre can be contacted on COVID19@trade.gov.uk. Industry support and advice The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has created an online hub to assist businesses in dealing with the impacts of coronavirus, with ACAS producing similar advice. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has published their own advice, which includes information about the help members of the FSB can call on during the outbreak.  The Business Support Helpline provides help and advice to firms.  Regionally, Growth Hubs run by Local Enterprise Partnerships provide support and information to local businesses. Covid-19 scams HMRC has seen an increase in coronavirus-related scams and has published guidance on spotting them. https://www.businesssupport.gov.uk/coronavirus-business-support/https://www.businesssupport.gov.uk/coronavirus-business-support/https://www.businesssupport.gov.uk/coronavirus-business-support/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-individuals-and-businesses-in-scotlandhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-individuals-and-businesses-in-wales#businesseshttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-guidance-information-for-ni-businesses-employershttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-uk-businesses/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-uk-businesseshttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-working-capital-scheme-overview-and-how-to-applyhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-working-capital-scheme-overview-and-how-to-applyhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-insurance-policyhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/direct-lending-schemehttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/direct-lending-schemehttps://hopuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hirstd_parliament_uk/Documents/Briefings/COVID19@trade.gov.ukhttps://www.cbi.org.uk/articles/supporting-businesses-impacted-by-the-coronavirus/https://www.acas.org.uk/coronavirushttps://www.fsb.org.uk/resources-page/advice-to-small-businesses-and-fsb-members-about-the-novel-coronavirus-covid-19.htmlhttps://www.gov.uk/business-support-helplinehttps://www.lepnetwork.net/growth-hubs/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phishing-and-bogus-emails-hm-revenue-and-customs-examples/phishing-emails-and-bogus-contact-hm-revenue-and-customs-examples8 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  3. What support for businesses was announced? 3.1 Spring 2020 announcements In Budget 2020, the Chancellor set out plans for a \u00a312 billion package of \u201ctemporary, timely and targeted measures\u201d to support public services, individuals and businesses through the economic disruption caused by coronavirus.4  On 17 March, the Chancellor set out a package of additional financial measures worth \u00a3330 billion (\u201cequivalent to 15% of GDP\u201d) and \u201cpromised to do whatever it takes to support our economy through this crisis.\u201d The Chancellor went on to say \u201cif demand is greater than the initial \u00a3330 billion [for loans] I'm making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required. I said whatever it takes \u2013 and I meant it.\"5 To this end the Chancellor said it there would be new legal powers in the Coronavirus Bill enabling the Government to \u201coffer whatever further financial support we think necessary to businesses.\u201d6 On 19 March an Urgent Question on coronavirus employment support was debated in the House. During this debate several Members raised concerns that the package of support measures announced fell short of what was required.7 The Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen responded to the question, and ended by highlighting: \u201cThe Chancellor has said that he will look at further steps to help protect jobs and incomes, and he will announce further details in due course.\u201d8 A day later, on 20 March, the Chancellor provided an updated statement on coronavirus. This provided both new measures and updated information on those measures already announced.9  Taken together, the combined support measures announced for businesses and the self-employed affected by Coronavirus, included:  \u2022 The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme through which HMRC will reimburse 80% of \u201cfurloughed\u201d workers\u2019 wage costs, up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month. \u2022 A direct grant scheme for the self-employed, which will pay self-employed individuals up to 80% of their profits, up to a \u00a32,500 per month cap. \u2022 The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme to support long-term viable businesses to respond to cash-flow pressures  4  HM Treasury, Budget 2020, 11 March 2020, para 1.83 5  HM Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak on COVID19 response, 17 March 2020 6  HM Treasury, Chancellor announces additional support to protect businesses, 17 March 2020 7  HC Deb 19 Mar 2020 cc1137-1153 8  HC Deb 19 Mar 2020 c1137 9  HM Treasury, The Chancellor Rishi Sunak provides an updated statement on coronavirus, 20 Mar 2020 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/871799/Budget_2020_Web_Accessible_Complete.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rishi-sunak-on-covid19-responsehttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rishi-sunak-on-covid19-responsehttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8857/https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-03-19/debates/A72357FF-0207-4CE1-A3EF-B5F2D5AE5089/CoronavirusEmploymentSupporthttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-chancellor-rishi-sunak-provides-an-updated-statement-on-coronavirushttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-chancellor-rishi-sunak-provides-an-updated-statement-on-coronavirushttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/871799/Budget_2020_Web_Accessible_Complete.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rishi-sunak-on-covid19-responsehttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-additional-support-to-protect-businesseshttps://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-03-19/debates/A72357FF-0207-4CE1-A3EF-B5F2D5AE5089/CoronavirusEmploymentSupporthttps://bit.ly/3bfa15ghttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-chancellor-rishi-sunak-provides-an-updated-statement-on-coronavirushttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-chancellor-rishi-sunak-provides-an-updated-statement-on-coronavirus9 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 \u2022 Scaling up the HMRC Time To Pay Scheme \u2022 Tax deferments  \u2022 Statutory sick pay relief for SMEs. \u2022 Business Rate Relief for businesses in the retail, hospitality or leisure sector. \u2022 A \u00a325,000 cash grant to businesses in the retail, hospitality or leisure sector with a rateable value of less than \u00a351,000 \u2022 Small business grant funding of \u00a310,000 for all business in receipt of Small Business Rates Relief (SBRR) and Rural Rates Relief.  \u2022 Launching the Bank of England Covid-19 Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), which aims to provide liquidity for large firms to help them bridge Coronavirus disruption to their cash flows through loans. 10 11 \u2022 prohibiting forfeiture of a lease for non-payment of rent for 3 months to 30 June 2020 (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland). (Further refinements and new initiatives are discussed in relevant sections of this briefing.) The Bank of England On Budget Day, the Bank of England announced four specific measures to help support the economy against the threat posed by coronavirus: 1 Reduction of the base rate from 0.75% to 0.25% [and subsequently to 0.1%].12 2 Introduction of a new \u201cTerm Funding scheme with additional incentives for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (TFSME), financed by the issuance of central bank reserves\u201d, which is intended to support and encourage banks to maintain low-cost lending to SMEs over the next four years. 3 Reduction of the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate, which the Bank estimates will allow banks to lend up to \u00a3190 billion more to businesses. 4 Announcement \u2013 via the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) \u2013 that banks should not increase dividends or bonuses in response to the other actions announced. 13 The Guardian described the Bank\u2019s actions as \u201cperfectly timed\u201d to coordinate with the Budget. It further reported that the announcement appeared to have led to a (temporary) 2% rise in the FTSE100 index.  10  HM Treasury, Budget 2020: Support for those affected by COVID-19, 11 March 2020 11  HM Treasury, Chancellor announces additional support to protect businesses, 17 March 2020 12  Bank of England, Monetary Policy Summary for the special Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 19 March 2020, 19 March 2020 13  Bank of England, \u201cBank of England measures to respond to the economic shock from Covid-19\u201d, 11 March 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/launch-of-covid-19-corporate-financing-facility-ccffhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/launch-of-covid-19-corporate-financing-facility-ccffhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/bank-of-england-rate-cut-just-before-budget-is-perfectly-timed-covid-19https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-bank-of-england-makes-emergency-interest-rate-cuthttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/871900/Covid-19_Budget_fact_sheet_FINAL.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-additional-support-to-protect-businesseshttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2020/monetary-policy-summary-for-the-special-monetary-policy-committee-meeting-on-19-march-2020https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2020/monetary-policy-summary-for-the-special-monetary-policy-committee-meeting-on-19-march-2020https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/march/boe-measures-to-respond-to-the-economic-shock-from-covid-19https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/march/boe-measures-to-respond-to-the-economic-shock-from-covid-1910 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  3.2 Responses to the measures There was cross-party support for the emergency coronavirus measures announced in the Budget. Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, said that the \u201csteps the Government have announced today to head off the economic impact of the coronavirus are obviously welcome.\u201d14 However, he criticised the Government\u2019s prior handling of the economy and said some of the key challenges of dealing with the business and economic impact of coronavirus outbreak stemmed from this.  Business response Businesses and business leaders welcomed the suite of budget measures. The National Chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said: Covering the cost of Statutory Sick Pay and emergency measures for the self-employed are particularly welcome. Removing the minimum income floor for those on Universal Credit will bring help to those working hard to keep their businesses going. These are vital contingencies for the UK\u2019s 5.8 million-strong small business and self-employed community. There may need to be further steps in the weeks and months ahead. The Bank of England funding package means that there are no excuses for banks not to help, when a small business customer is in distress.15 Treasury Committee The Treasury Select Committee Chair, Mel Stride, said the support for small and medium-sized enterprises would be \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d in coping with the coronavirus outbreak. He welcomed these measures and said the Committee would want to ensure these support measures are working well, and would look to examine:  \u2022 how quickly support is mobilised, in particular \u201cwhether HMRC is spring-loaded to ensure that businesses are aware of what is available and how to take advantage of it as quickly as possible.\u201d \u2022 whether the support is enough; and \u2022 how well targeted the support is, because \u201cBusinesses in particular sectors are hurting more than others. We need to make sure that additional help is provided for them, just as we did in similar circumstances in the 2001 foot and mouth crisis.\u201d16 As part of its post-budget scrutiny inquiry, the Treasury Committee heard from Robert Chote, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) on 17 March 2020. He told the Committee the UK is facing a \u201cwartime situation\u201d that requires a mass expansion in government spending to support businesses through the worst of the coronavirus outbreak.17  14  HC Deb 11 Mar 2020 c294 15  FSB, Chancellor delivers business contingencies and election commitments, 11 March 2020 16  HC Deb 11 Mar 2020 c300-301 17  Steven Swinford & Gurpreet Narwan, It\u2019s just like the war, says budget watchdog, The Times, 17 March 2020 https://www.fsb.org.uk/resources-page/chancellor-delivers-business-contingencies-and-election-commitments.htmlhttps://www.fsb.org.uk/resources-page/chancellor-delivers-business-contingencies-and-election-commitments.htmlhttp://bit.ly/39QqtJihttps://committees.parliament.uk/event/588/https://committees.parliament.uk/event/588/https://committees.parliament.uk/event/588/http://bit.ly/3cS6eN1https://www.fsb.org.uk/resources-page/chancellor-delivers-business-contingencies-and-election-commitments.htmlhttp://bit.ly/2TJNzvfhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/its-just-like-the-war-says-obr-sjvg50gcr11 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 The Treasury Committee has since established a separate inquiry into the economic impact of coronavirus, which focuses on \u201cwhether the Government\u2019s response to the coronavirus is sufficient, and to suggest areas where more support is needed\u201d. Responses to the additional measures Responding to the Chancellor\u2019s statement setting out these measures, the then Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell said \u201cPeople are worried, and I am disappointed that today\u2019s package of measures does not really appreciate the urgency or the gravity of the situation for those individuals and their families.\u201d18 These concerns include: \u2022 whether businesses would want to take on the extra debt on the Government-backed loans \u2022 Whether businesses would be able to access the emergency government backed loans \u2022 The scale of the support measures compared with other countries \u2022 How companies without requisite insurance policies would continue to be able to operate. 3.3 The Winter Economy Plan (September 2020) On 24 September, the Government announced further (or extended) support measures as part of its Winter Economy Plan. The main announcements were: \u2022 A new Job Support Scheme \u201cto protect viable jobs in businesses who are facing lower demand over the winter months due to coronavirus\u201d. The Scheme will begin on 1 November \u2022 Continuation of the Self Employment Income Support Scheme to the end of the 2020/21 financial year \u2022 Continuation of the temporary 15% VAT cut for the tourism and hospitality sectors until the end of March 2021 \u2022 A New Payment Scheme that allows businesses that have deferred their VAT payments to repay what they owe over 11 interest-free payments in 2021/22 \u2022 A 12-month extension of the of the \u201cTime to Pay\u201d scheme for self-asssessment taxpayers \u2022 Extending the length of Coronavirus Business Interruption loans19 and Bounce Back loans to 10 years, with additional opportunities for payment holidays and interest-only payment holidays for the latter. All loan schemes would remain open to new applications until 30 November.  18  HC Deb 17 Mar 2020 c933 19  The extension to Coronavirus Business Interruption loans has not yet been implemented. https://committees.parliament.uk/work/224/economic-impact-of-coronavirus/https://committees.parliament.uk/work/224/economic-impact-of-coronavirus/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/winter-economy-planhttp://bit.ly/33rWG7312 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  3.4 November 2020 announcements In line with the announcement of a forthcoming second lockdown in England, the Government made a number of further adjustments to arrangements. On 2 November, it confirmed extensions to the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, as well as to the deadlines for the business loans schemes. It was also announced that the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) would be extended. The Treasury published a summary of these and other changes, including support to businesses in England via local authorities. On 5 November, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, made a further statement, confirming that the CJRS would be extended to the end of March 2021. 3.5 Continuing updates The spike in infections and the re-imposition of restrictions towards the end of 2020 has led to continuing revision and extension of business support arrangements, often at short notice and beyond the dates outlined above. More detail is available in relevant sections of this briefing paper and in the sources they refer to. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-increases-support-for-self-employed-across-the-ukhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/932077/ECONOMIC_SUPPORT_UPDATE__NOVEMBER__FINAL.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/932077/ECONOMIC_SUPPORT_UPDATE__NOVEMBER__FINAL.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme/extension-of-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme13 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 4. Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme How can businesses apply to the scheme? \u2022 The CJRS initially covered a period from 1 March to 31 October 2020. It has been extended to cover 1 November to 30 April 2021. \u2022 Under the extended CJRS, employers can designate as furloughed any employee on a payroll notified to HMRC on or before 30 October. Employees who stopped working 23 September can be re-employed and furloughed. \u2022 Rates of support have varied over time. From 1 November until at least 30 April 2021, HMRC will cover 80% of wages for usual hours not worked. Employers only cover NICs and pension contributions. \u2022 The Government has published basic guidance for employers on the extended scheme. Full guidance and a new Treasury Direction have yet to be published. \u2022 We provide more detailed information in our briefing FAQs: Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.  The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) was announced on 25 March. The scheme initially ran from 1 March to 30 June. Under the initial CJRS HMRC provided a grant to cover 80% of \u201cfurloughed employees\u2019\u201d wages, up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month. HMRC provided an additional grant to cover the cost of employer National Insurance and auto-enrolment pension contributions. From 1 July to 31 October the rules of the scheme changed to allow \u2018flexible furloughing\u2019. Employers could bring workers back on reduced hours and claim under the CJRS for any usual hours not worked. From 1 August the rate of support and employer contributions changed: \u2022 From 1 August the grant no longer covered employers National Insurance and pension auto-enrolment contributions; \u2022 From 1 September the grant only covered 70% of the employee\u2019s wages and employers were required to top it up to 80%; \u2022 From 1 October the grant has only covered 60% of the employee\u2019s wages and employers must top it up to 80%. On 5 November the Chancellor announced the CJRS would be extended again to cover the period from 1 November until 31 March 2021.  On 17 December the Chancellor announced the CJRS would be extended for a further month until 30 April 2021 in order to give businesses certainty. He also announced that the rate of support will remain at 80% with no employer contributions required. The rules of the extended CJRS are set out in a Treasury Direction, a type of legislation. The Treasury has also updated its guidance on the CJRS to reflect the rules that apply from 1 November.  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme/extension-of-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#what-employers-can-claim---calculationshttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8880/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8880/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-extends-furlough-to-march-and-increases-self-employed-supporthttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-extends-furlough-to-march-and-increases-self-employed-supporthttps://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-12-17/debates/20121728000021/EconomyUpdatehttps://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-12-17/debates/20121728000021/EconomyUpdatehttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/935146/201112_CJRS_DIRECTION_No_5___CJRS_extension_1_Nov_-_31_Jan__SIGNED.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-schemehttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme14 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  Extended CJRS: Eligibility All UK businesses are eligible for the scheme, as long as they have a PAYE payroll that was notified to HMRC on a real-time information (RTI) submission by 30 October 2020. There is no requirement for an employer to have previously used the CJRS. The CJRS covers any employee who was employed on 30 October on a payroll notified to HMRC on a real time information (RTI) submission on or before that date. Employees who were employed on 23 September on a payroll notified to HMRC before that date but who subsequently stopped working or were made redundant can be re-employed and furloughed. This is at the discretion of the employer. In order to furlough an employee, an employer must enter into a \u2018furlough agreement\u2019. This will say whether the employee is fully furloughed or flexibly furloughed. It will also set out the terms and conditions that apply during furlough, including rate of pay. Employers must pay employees at least 80% of their reference salary but may also agree to top it up. The timescales for making claims under the extended CJRS are quite tight. Claims must be made within 14 days of the end of the calendar month to which they relate (e.g. the deadline for making claims for December 2020 is 14 January 2021). Further detail can be found in the Government\u2019s guidance on submitting claims. Extended CJRS: rate of support From 1 November until 31 January 2021, HMRC will cover 80% of an employee\u2019s \u2018reference salary\u2019 for any \u2018usual hours\u2019 not worked. The rate of support and employee contributions will be reviewed in January. The rules on calculating \u2018reference salary\u2019 under the extended CJRS will be the same as the rules under the original CJRS. There is a difference for employees who are eligible under the extended CJRS but were not eligible under the original CJRS (see section 4.2 of the guidance). Further information can be found in the Commons Library Briefing, FAQs: Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CBP-8880). 4.1 Job Support Scheme The extension of the CJRS means that its proposed replacement, the Job Support Scheme, has now been postponed. The Government announced a new Job Support Scheme as part of the Winter Economic Plan. The rules of the JSS were changed a number of times between its announcement and the proposed commencement date of 1 November 2020. Ultimately the Government created two schemes: Job Support Scheme (Open) for all businesses and Job Support Scheme (Closed) for businesses required to close under lockdown laws. The Treasury published detailed guidance for the JSS.  https://www.gov.uk/paye-for-employershttps://www.gov.uk/running-payroll/reporting-to-hmrchttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wages-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-schemehttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme/extension-of-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#what-employers-can-claim---calculationshttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8880/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-claim-the-job-support-scheme15 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 5. The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) Following the announcement of the Government\u2019s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), there were calls for similar support to be provided to the self-employed.20 On 26 March, the Chancellor announced the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) \u2013 which would pay taxable grants worth 80% of someone\u2019s average monthly trading profit, over a three month period, worth up to \u00a37,500. On 30 April, the Government published the Treasury Direction to HM Revenue & Customs, the statutory provisions underpinning the SEISS. The Scheme opened for applications on 13 May and closed on 13 July.21 The Office for National Statistics estimates that just over 5 million people (15% of the UK workforce) are self-employed.22 The Government has stated that the SEISS covers 95% of people who get the majority of their earnings from self-employment,23 although the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that just 62% of all self-employed individuals are covered.24 On 29 May the Government announced a second round of the SEISS, with those eligible able to claim a second and (then) final grant, worth 70% of their average monthly trading profit, for a further three months, capped at \u00a36,570. On 2 July a second Treasury Direction was published to this effect. Applications for the second grant opened on 17 August and were closed on 19 October.25 On 24 September the Government announced an extension to the SEISS to be introduced in November, to cover the six months up to the end of April 2021. The SEISS Grant Extension would be in the form of two taxable grants \u2013 first to cover November 2020 to January 2021, second to cover February 2021 to April 2021. Initially it was proposed that the first of these grants would cover 20% of average monthly trading profits, capped at \u00a31,875, but this figure has been revised three times.  On 22 October the Chancellor announced the first grant would cover 40% of average monthly trading profits, capped at \u00a33,750. On 2 November the Chancellor announced that the payment for the first month (November) of the first grant would be set at 80% - increasing the total level of this grant to 55% of trading profits, capped at \u00a35,160. Subsequently on 5 November the Chancellor announced that all three months of the first grant would be calculated  20  For example, \u201cCoronavirus: Self-employed need financial help, unions warn\u201d, BBC News, 21 March 2020 21  For details on the take-up and cost of the Scheme see, HMRC, SEISS statistics: November 2020, 25 November 2020 22  ONS, Labour market economic commentary: March 2020, 17 March 2020 23  HM Treasury, Chancellor gives support to millions of self-employed individuals, 26 March 2020 24  Stuart Adam, Helen Miller, Tom Waters, Income protection for the self-employed and employees during the coronavirus crisis, Institute for Fiscal Studies, 2 April 2020 25  For an overview of the Scheme see, Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, Coronavirus: Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, 27 November 2020 The Commons Library Briefing: Coronavirus: Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (CBP8879) provides further information on eligibility and other frequently asked questions. https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-schemehttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882593/SEISS_Direction_Final_-_SIGNED.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882593/SEISS_Direction_Final_-_SIGNED.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/applications-for-self-employment-income-support-scheme-open-earlyhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/labourmarketeconomiccommentary/may2019https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-self-employment-support-scheme-and-confirms-furlough-next-stepshttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/897184/SEISS_Extension_Direction_final_19_Oct_closure_date_-_FINAL_SIGNED.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rishi-sunak-on-the-winter-economy-planhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51984275https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/self-employment-income-support-scheme-statistics-november-2020https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/self-employment-income-support-scheme-statistics-november-2020https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/labourmarketeconomiccommentary/march2020https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-gives-support-to-millions-of-self-employed-individualshttps://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14786https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14786https://www.litrg.org.uk/tax-guides/coronavirus-guidance/coronavirus-self-employment-income-support-scheme-seisshttps://www.litrg.org.uk/tax-guides/coronavirus-guidance/coronavirus-self-employment-income-support-scheme-seisshttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8879/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8879/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8879/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8879/16 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  on the basis of 80% of average trading profits, up to a maximum of \u00a37,500.26  On 24 November the Government published a further Treasury Direction underpinning the scheme. Applications for the third SEISS grant opened on 29 November and are to close on 29 January 2021. HMRC has published detailed guidance of the SEISS Grant Extension, an extract from which is reproduced below: Who can claim To be eligible for the third grant you must be a self-employed individual or a member of a partnership. You cannot claim the grant if you trade through a limited company or a trust. If you claim Maternity Allowance this will not affect your eligibility for the grant. You must have traded in both tax years: \u2022 2018 to 2019 and submitted your Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year \u2022 2019 to 2020 You must either: \u2022 be currently trading but are impacted by reduced demand due to coronavirus \u2022 have been trading but are temporarily unable to do so due to coronavirus You must also declare that: \u2022 you intend to continue to trade \u2022 you reasonably believe there will be a significant reduction in your trading profits Reasonable belief In order to claim, you must reasonably believe that you will suffer a significant reduction in trading profits due to reduced business activity, capacity or demand or inability to trade due to coronavirus during the period 1 November to 29 January 2021. You must keep evidence that shows how your business has been impacted by coronavirus resulting in less business activity than otherwise expected. Significant reduction Before you make a claim, you must decide if the impact on your business will cause a significant reduction in your trading profits for the tax year you report them in. HMRC cannot make this decision for you because your individual and wider business circumstances will need to be considered when deciding whether the reduction is significant. You should wait until you have a reasonable belief that your trading profits are going to be significantly reduced, before you make your claim.27   26  HM Treasury press notice, Government extends Furlough to March and increases self-employed support, 5 November 2020 27  HM Revenue & Customs, Check if you can claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, 29 November 2020   https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/938640/SEISS_Direction.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/938640/SEISS_Direction.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#impactedbyrdhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#impactedbyrdhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#tempunablehttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-extends-furlough-to-march-and-increases-self-employed-supporthttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-extends-furlough-to-march-and-increases-self-employed-supporthttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-schemehttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme17 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 6. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) Eligibility for SSP SSP is the minimum that employers have to pay out to qualifying sick employees. It is currently paid at \u00a395.85 and can be paid for up to 28 weeks. To qualify, for SSP employee\u2019s average weekly earnings must be above \u00a3120. Some employers may pay enhanced sick pay over and above the SSP rate. This would be detailed in an employment contract. The self-employed are not eligible for SSP. SSP is payable to an employee who is incapable for work or deemed to be incapable. The Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982 (\u2018SSP Regulations\u2019) set out the circumstances in which a person can be deemed to be incapable for work.28 The SSP Regulations, as amended by SI 2020/374, SI 2020/427 and SI 2020/681, now provide that a person who is self-isolating or shielding in line with official public health guidelines is eligible for SSP. Pregnant women will generally not be eligible for SSP unless they are classed as extremely clinically vulnerable and have been advised to shield.29 SI 2020/681 (and NISR 2020/134 in Northern Ireland) provide that a person who is shielding is only entitled to SSP for so long as they are in a \u2018shielding period\u2019, which is specified in the notice that was sent to them. All four governments in the UK paused shielding arrangements in August 2020. The UK Government reintroduced shielding guidance as part of the new temporary national lockdown from 5 November. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments have not reintroduced strict shielding rules. SSP is normally paid from the fourth \u2018qualifying day\u2019 (usually the fourth day of absence from work).30 However, by virtue of SI 2020/374, where a person\u2019s incapacity for work relates to coronavirus, SSP is paid from the first qualifying day. SSP and NHS Test and Trace On 28 May 2020 the NHS Test and Trace scheme launched in England. Similar schemes have launched in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. On 27 May the Government laid before Parliament the Statutory Sick Pay (General) (Coronavirus Amendment) (No. 4) Regulations 2020. These extend the right to SSP to anyone who self-isolates for 14 days after receiving a \u201crelevant notification\u201d from public health bodies. Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme  On 26 May the Government launched the Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme. Detailed rules are set out in the Statutory Sick Pay  28  Reg. 2, SI 1982/894. 29  Michael Ford QC and Karon Monaghan QC, Statutory Sick Pay, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and Pregnant Workers, UK Labour Law Blog, 28 April 2020. 30  Section 155, Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1982/894/regulation/2http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/374/contents/madehttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/427/contents/madehttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/681/contents/madehttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/681/contents/madehttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/681/contents/madehttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2020/134/contents/madehttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-shielding/pages/changes-to-shielding-advice/https://gov.wales/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-people-defined-on-medical-grounds-as-extremely-vulnerable-from-coronavirus-covid-19-htmlhttps://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-and-vulnerable-peoplehttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/374/contents/madehttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-workplace-guidance#guidance-for-employershttps://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-test-and-protect/https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-htmlhttps://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/covid-19-test-trace-isolate-support-strategyhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/539/contents/madehttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/539/contents/madehttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/512/contents/madehttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1982/894/contents/madehttps://uklabourlawblog.com/2020/04/28/statutory-sick-pay-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-and-pregnant-workers-by-michael-ford-and-karon-monaghan/https://uklabourlawblog.com/2020/04/28/statutory-sick-pay-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-and-pregnant-workers-by-michael-ford-and-karon-monaghan/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/4/contents18 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  (Coronavirus) (Funding of Employers\u2019 Liabilities) Regulations 2020. The Government has also published guidance for employers.  The Rebate Scheme is available to employers who had fewer than 250 employees on its PAYE scheme(s) as of 28 February 2020. Eligible employers can reclaim up to two weeks of SSP payments made to employees who were incapable of work because they: \u2022 had symptoms of Covid-19 on or after 13 March 2020; \u2022 had to self-isolate in accordance with public health guidelines on or after 13 March 2020; \u2022 had to shield in accordance with public health guidelines on or after 16 April 2020; or \u2022 self-isolated on or after 28 May after receiving a notification from a public health body that they had been in contact with someone with coronavirus. Employers can reclaim the payments at the statutory rate of \u00a395.85 per week (\u00a394.25 for payments made before 6 April 2020). Claims can be made through an online portal which lists the various pieces of information an employer will need to make a claim.

Business loans How do businesses apply for this support? \u2022 The schemes are overseen by the British Business Bank and funds are made available through banks and other accredited lenders. \u2022 The schemes were originally due to close between September and November 2020. The closure date has since been extended on several occasions. On 17 December the Chancellor announced that the three main schemes would remain open until 31 March 2021. \u2022 The original Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans scheme (CBILS) was modified several times to widen access. A scheme for larger businesses (CLBILS) opened on 15 April, and a simpler scheme for all businesses \u2013 the Bounce Back Loans scheme (BBLS) \u2013 opened on 4 May. \u2022 Businesses should first contact their financial provider, although they may also approach others for the support they need. There is information for businesses and lenders as part of the British Business Bank\u2019s overall online guidance. \u2022 There have however been delays in assessing applications. See our constituency caseworker article Coronavirus: problems with Bounce Back Loans. \u2022 More information about the policy behind the schemes is available in our briefing paper Coronavirus: Business loans schemes. Information about spending on and take-up of the schemes appears in Coronavirus business support schemes: statistics. The Government has established three main schemes to provide loans to businesses of different sizes affected by coronavirus: 1 All businesses \u2013 Bounce Back Loans (BBLS) of up to \u00a350,000 or 25% of turnover. The scheme offers streamlined application procedures and loans will be 100% backed by the Government. 2 Small and medium businesses \u2013 the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) offers loans of up to \u00a35m for businesses with a turnover under \u00a345 million. The loans are 80% backed by the Government. 3 Large businesses - Coronavirus Larger Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) extends the standard CBILS approach to larger businesses.  CBILS was the original loan scheme. The other schemes were developed after concerns about accessibility of funding and slow spending. This section outlines the features of the schemes before discussing the background to the schemes, revisions, and continuing policy issues. There are two further general loans schemes. The Coronavirus Future Fund is available to businesses such as start-ups that are ineligible for the three schemes that have developed from CBILS. The Covid Corporate Financing Facility is available to very large firms. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-and-loan-schemeshttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-and-loan-schemeshttps://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils/for-businesses-and-advisors/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils/our-partners/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils/for-businesses-and-advisors/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils/for-businesses-and-advisors/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/economy-business/business/coronavirus-problems-with-bounce-back-loans/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/economy-business/business/coronavirus-problems-with-bounce-back-loans/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8906/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8938/20 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  7.1 Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) As part of Budget 2020, the Government announced a new Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).31 CBILS offers loans and similar facilities of up to \u00a35 million to businesses with a turnover of up to \u00a345 million. Loans are interest-free for the first 12 months. The scheme went live on 23 March 2020 and was updated on 2 April 2020, with further widening of the scheme on 16 April 2020 to offer similar support to larger businesses through CLBILS. A simpler scheme for small businesses, Bounce Back Loans, was announced on 17 April. Who can apply? Smaller businesses from all sectors32 can apply for the full amount of the loan. To be eligible for a facility under CBILS, an SME must:  \u2022 Be UK-based in its business activity, with annual turnover of no more than \u00a345m \u2022 Have a borrowing proposal which, were it not for the current pandemic, would be considered viable by the lender. \u2022 Be UK-based in its business activity \u2022 Have an annual turnover of no more than \u00a345 million \u2022 Have a borrowing proposal which the lender would consider viable, were it not for the current pandemic \u2022 Self-certify that it has been adversely impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) \u2022 Not have been classed as a \u201cbusiness in difficulty\u201d33 on 31 December 2019, if applying to borrow \u00a330,000 or more.34 More information about the scheme is available from the BBB. The scheme provides facilities of up to \u00a35m for smaller businesses across the UK who are experiencing lost or deferred revenues, leading to disruptions to their cashflow. CBILS supports a wide range of business finance products, including term loans, overdrafts, invoice finance and asset finance. The scheme provides the lender with a government-backed guarantee.  31  HM Treasury, Budget 2020: Support for those affected by COVID-19, 11 March 2020 32  The following trades and organisations are not eligible to apply: Banks, Building Societies, Insurers and Reinsurers (but not insurance brokers); The public sector including state funded primary and secondary schools; Employer, professional, religious or political membership organisation or trade unions. 33  This is a potentially complex idea. There are similar constraints relating to insolvency and voluntary agreements in other support schemes, but approaches and limits vary. For CBILS, see British Business Bank, \u201cFAQs for SMEs: Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Scheme\u201d. 34  The BBB updated guidance relating to this matter in July, easing conditions for businesses with fewer than 50 employees and an annual turnover below \u00a39 million. https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils-2/cbils-faqs-for-smes/#f18https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils-2/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/871900/Covid-19_Budget_fact_sheet_FINAL.pdfhttps://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils-2/cbils-faqs-for-smes/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils-2/cbils-faqs-for-smes/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/changes-to-eu-state-aid-undertaking-in-difficulty-test-increases-access-to-the-coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-for-smaller-businesses/21 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 The maximum value of a facility provided under the scheme is \u00a35m, initially available on repayment terms of up to six years for loans and asset finance. On 24 September the Chancellor announced that the Government intended to increase the term to ten years in some circumstances. That change came into effect on 23 December 2020 but such extensions are likely to be limited to situations where not extending would \u201ccompromise\u201d the borrower\u2019s business. And such extensions should not increase the risk to the Government.35 The scheme provides the lender with a government-backed, partial guarantee (80%) against the outstanding facility balance. There will be no fee for smaller businesses. Lenders will pay a fee to access the scheme. For overdrafts and invoice finance facilities, terms will be up to three years. The Government will make a Business Interruption Payment to cover the first 12 months of interest payments and any lender fees. The borrower always remains 100% liable for the debt. Smaller businesses will benefit from no upfront costs and lower initial repayments. Fishery, aquaculture and agriculture businesses may not qualify for the full interest and fee payment. At the discretion of the lender, the scheme may be used for unsecured lending for facilities of \u00a3250,000 and under. Initially, the scheme required security for facilities above \u00a3250,000. It also limited support to businesses that could not be offered support on normal commercial terms. These requirements were changed as the scheme progressed, as discussed in our briefing paper, Coronavirus: Business loans schemes. In addition, businesses that have received a Bounce Back Loan and require more credit may apply for a CBILS loan, part of which will refinance the Bounce Back Loan (and therefore likely to be subject to higher interest rates). How to apply CBILS is available through the British Business Bank\u2019s accredited lenders. These include high-street banks, challenger banks, asset-based lenders and smaller specialist local lenders. Different lenders may offer different facilities. Businesses should normally apply to their own provider first \u2013 ideally via the lender\u2019s website. They may also approach other lenders for the type of support they need, although they should only have one live application at any time.  35  British Business Bank, \u201cCoronavirus Business Interruption Loans Scheme (CBILS): Final Recoveries Guidance\u201d, 23 Dece https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8906/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8906/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils/accredited-lenders/22 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  The British Business Bank oversees CBILS and accredits lenders. It publishes overall guidance and more detailed information for businesses and lenders. Decision-making on applications is fully delegated to the accredited lenders. On 25 March, the Chancellor, Governor of the Bank of England, and CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority together wrote to Britain\u2019s banking sector with a warning not to allow fundamentally viable companies to collapse because of the coronavirus crisis. The priority for all of us - banks, building societies, government and the financial authorities - should now be to take all action necessary to ensure that the benefits of the measures outlined above are passed through to businesses and consumers. This will require a willingness to maintain and extend lending despite the uncertain economic conditions. We must ensure that firms whose business models were viable before this crisis remain viable once it is over.36 7.2 Coronavirus Larger Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) The Coronavirus Larger Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) was announced on 16 April in an attempt to offer more help to businesses with a larger turnover. Who can apply? CLBILS eligibility is generally similar to the original CBILS scheme, but intended for larger businesses. The British Business Bank advises that it is open to businesses that: \u2022 are based in the UK and have an annual turnover of more than \u00a345 million \u2022 \u201chave a borrowing proposal which, were it not for the current pandemic, would be considered viable by the lender, and for which the lender believes the provision of finance will enable the business to trade out of any short-to-medium term difficulty\u201d \u2022 have not received support under the Bank of England\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). Although the scheme is open to \u201cbusinesses from all sectors\u201d, it excludes \u201ccredit institutions (falling within the remit of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive), building societies, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers), public-sector bodies, further-education establishments, if they are grant-funded, state-funded primary and secondary schools\u201d. What\u2019s on offer? The British Business Bank has published an outline of the scheme. It differs from CBILS most importantly in being targeted at larger firms and limiting loan terms to three years:  36  HM Treasury, Letter from Chancellor, Governor of Bank of England, CEO of FCA: COVID and Bank lending, 25 March 2020 https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils/for-businesses-and-advisors/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils/for-businesses-and-advisors/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme-cbils/our-partners/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/875266/COVID_19_and_Bank_Lending__25_March_2020_.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/875266/COVID_19_and_Bank_Lending__25_March_2020_.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/875266/COVID_19_and_Bank_Lending__25_March_2020_.pdfhttps://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/clbils/faqs-for-businesses/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/clbils/faqs-for-businesses/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/875266/COVID_19_and_Bank_Lending__25_March_2020_.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/875266/COVID_19_and_Bank_Lending__25_March_2020_.pdf23 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 The new CLBILS scheme will support term loans, revolving credit facilities (including overdrafts), invoice finance and asset finance facilities. It is designed to give lenders greater confidence to provide funding by providing a partial guarantee of 80% of the outstanding facility balance. \u2022 Up to \u00a350m facilities: up to \u00a350m for those with a turnover of over \u00a3250m, and of up to \u00a325m for businesses with turnover from \u00a345m up to \u00a3250m. \u2022 80% guarantee: The scheme provides the lender with a government-backed, partial guarantee (80%) against the outstanding facility balance. \u2022 Finance terms: Finance terms are from three months to three years. \u2022 Economic benefits go to the borrower: Borrowers will benefit from a proportionate reduction in pricing in return for lenders receiving capital and risk benefits. \u2022 Personal guarantees: No personal guarantees are permitted for facilities under \u00a3250,000. For facilities of \u00a3250,000 and over, claims on personal guarantees cannot exceed 20% of losses after all other recoveries have been applied. \u2022 The borrower always remains 100% liable for the debt. The announcement of the scheme noted that borrowers and lenders \u201care still free to enter into loan agreements outside of CLBILS e.g. where there is no economic benefit to the borrower of taking out a CLBILS loan over normal commercial lending\u201d. How to apply Businesses should apply to accredited lenders. The British Business Bank is developing accreditation from those accredited to offer the existing CBILS scheme: CLBILS will be available through a range of British Business Bank accredited lenders and partners, which will be listed on the British Business Bank website. Existing CBILS lenders can seek expedited accreditations to become Lenders under the CLBILS scheme. The Bank expects to accredit a number of existing CBILS lenders shortly and is publishing a request for proposals documents making the scheme available to new lenders. https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/coronavirus-large-business-interruption-loan-scheme-to-open-on-monday/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/coronavirus-large-business-interruption-loan-scheme-to-open-on-monday/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/coronavirus-large-business-interruption-loan-scheme-to-open-on-monday/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/coronavirus-large-business-interruption-loan-scheme-to-open-on-monday/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/clbils/current-accredited-lenders-and-partners-2/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/clbils/current-accredited-lenders-and-partners-2/24 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  7.3 Bounce Back Loans (BBLS) The Chancellor announced a new, simplified loan scheme on 17 April. The Bounce Back Loans Scheme (BBLS) opened on 4 May. It responds to concerns about access to rapid loan support. The simplified process and the 100% guarantee were intended to ensure that funds reached businesses \u201cwithin days\u201d, but many businesses report continuing delays. Although BBLS had been presented as particularly helpful to small businesses, it is open to firms of any size. Who can apply? The British Business Bank\u2019s guidance for the scheme sets out the following conditions for eligibility: Your business must be able to self-declare to the lender that it: \u2022 has been impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic \u2022 was not a business in difficulty at 31 December 2019 (if it was, you must confirm your business complies with additional state aid restrictions under de minimis state aid rules) \u2022 is engaged in trading or commercial activity in the UK and was established by 1 March 2020 \u2022 is not using the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS), the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) or the Bank of England\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility Scheme (CCFF), unless the Bounce Back Loan will refinance the whole of the CBILS, CLBILS or CCFF facility \u2022 is not in bankruptcy or liquidation or undergoing debt restructuring at the time it submits its application for finance \u2022 derives more than 50% of its income from its trading activity (this requirement does not apply to charities or further-education colleges) \u2022 is not in a restricted sector.37 What\u2019s on offer? BBLS offers: \u2022 Loans for up to ten years of \u00a32,000 to \u00a350,000, up to 25% of the business\u2019s turnover \u2022 A 100% government-backed guarantee to the lender for the full outstanding balance of the loan (although the borrower remains 100% liable for the debt \u2022 A Government Business Interruption payment to cover the first 12 months\u2019 interest on the loan \u2022 No repayment requirement for the first 12 months  37  The guidance notes that these are credit institutions falling within the remit of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, insurance companies, public-sector organisations and state-funded primary and secondary schools See our constituency casework article Problems with Bounce Back loans for more about some of the challenges that have arisen and how they might be resolved. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/small-businesses-boosted-by-bounce-back-loanshttps://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/economy-business/business/coronavirus-problems-with-bounce-back-loans/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/for-businesses-and-advisors/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/faqs-for-small-businesses/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/faqs-for-small-businesses/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/faqs-for-small-businesses/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus-problems-with-bounce-back-loans/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus-problems-with-bounce-back-loans/25 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 \u2022 An annual interest rate of 2.5% for all loans. As part of the \u201cPay as you grow\u201d scheme announced on 24 September 2020, BBLS loan terms were increased from six to ten years. Payment holidays and interest-only repayments of up to six months would be available. On 2 November, the Chancellor announced that borrowers would be permitted to top up existing Bounce Back loans once (within the existing financial limits). Businesses that have already received support under CBILS are also excluded, although there are provisions for them to transfer CBILS loans of up to \u00a350,000 to the new scheme. How to apply As in the other schemes, businesses should apply to an accredited lender. They should normally approach their own provider first, but may apply to others if they can\u2019t get the support they want. One of the main attractions of the scheme is its comparatively simple application process. It is based on seven questions on an online form. Lenders will decide on applications. Successful loans \u201cwill be subject to appropriate customer fraud, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. Some state aid restrictions may apply to your application.\u201d There has been very heavy demand for the scheme. Before it was launched, there were reports that lenders were concerned about promises of quick turnaround times and potential conflict with the Consumer Credit Act. The Government removed that conflict retrospectively via the Section 12 of the Business and Planning Act 2020. Since launch, lenders have adopted different strategies to managing demand. Some of these have led to applicants being rejected. In other cases, applicants face long waiting times. More information about how businesses might respond is available in our constituency caseworker article Coronavirus: Problems with Bounce Back Loans. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-outlines-winter-economy-planhttps://hopuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/brownings_parliament_uk/Documents/More%20information%20about%20policy%20issues%20relating%20to%20the%20schemes%20is%20available%20in%20our%20briefing%20Coronavirus:%20Business%20loans%20schemes.%20Information%20about%20funds%20disbursed%20is%20available%20in%20Coronavirus%20business%20support%20schemes:%20statistics.https://hopuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/brownings_parliament_uk/Documents/More%20information%20about%20policy%20issues%20relating%20to%20the%20schemes%20is%20available%20in%20our%20briefing%20Coronavirus:%20Business%20loans%20schemes.%20Information%20about%20funds%20disbursed%20is%20available%20in%20Coronavirus%20business%20support%20schemes:%20statistics.https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/current-accredited-lenders-and-partners/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/current-accredited-lenders-and-partners/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-bounce-back-loans-to-launch-todayhttps://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/bounce-back-loans/for-businesses-and-advisors/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-treasury-rushes-to-finalise-coronavirus-bounce-back-loan-schemehttps://enquiries.parliament.uk/Pages/TreeView.aspx?node=54355864694e593443376c4351594e4a34506d366a773d3dhttps://enquiries.parliament.uk/Pages/TreeView.aspx?node=54355864694e593443376c4351594e4a34506d366a773d3dhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/economy-business/business/coronavirus-problems-with-bounce-back-loans/26 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  7.4 Development, closure and extension of the schemes As noted, the original CBILS has been modified and supplemented by the launch of CLBILS and BBLS. This has led to various changes of policy and focus \u2013 so many rejected earlier applications could be reconsidered if questioned again. Originally, CBILS was due to close to new applicants on 30 September, CLBILS on 20 October, and BBLS on 4 November 2020. On 24 September, as part of his Winter Economy Plan, the Chancellor announced that the closure dates for all schemes would be extended to 30 November. On 2 November, he extended the deadline for all three schemes to 31 January 2021. He also announced that holders of Bounce Back loans could top up their original loan (subject to wider scheme restrictions). On 17 December, the closing date was extended again, to 31 March 2021. 7.5 Future Fund The range of loans available businesses did however exclude some businesses, notably \u201cunprofitable\u201d start-ups. As a result, BEIS and HM Treasury launched the Future Fund, which \u201cprovides government loans to UK-based companies ranging from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a35 million, subject to at least equal match funding from private investors\u201d: These convertible loans may be an option for businesses that rely on equity investment and are unable to access other government business support programmes because they are either pre-revenue or pre-profit. The scheme is delivered by the British Business Bank, which in turn notes that \u201cthe Government has made \u00a3250 million available for the Future Fund, and will keep this amount under review\u201d.  Who can apply? The Government states that a business is eligible to apply if: \u2022 it is UK-incorporated - if your business is part of a corporate group, only the parent company is eligible \u2022 it has raised at least \u00a3250,000 in equity investment from third-party investors in the last 5 years \u2022 none of its shares are traded on a regulated market, multilateral trading facility or other listing venue \u2022 it was incorporated on or before 31 December 2019 \u2022 at least one of the following is true: \u2500 half or more employees are UK-based \u2500 half or more revenues are from UK sales There is an online eligibility checker. Very importantly, though, applications must be made jointly by the business and one or more investors, as set out below.

The British Business Bank outlines what the Future Fund offers as follows: The Future Fund loan amount provided to the company ranges from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a35 million. Amounts of Future Fund loans must be at least matched by co-investment from investors. Funding must not be used to (a) repay any borrowings;(b) pay any dividends; (c) pay any bonuses; (d) pay any advisory fees. The loans will have a minimum of 8% per annum (non-compounding) interest charge applied. This interest will be higher if the company and the investor(s) agree between themselves. Unlike a typical bank loan, the interest is not payable on a monthly basis and instead will accrue until the loan converts. At this point, the interest will either be repaid or convert in equity. The loan will mature after 36 months. The loan cannot be repaid early by the company other than with the agreement of all of the investors. The loans will convert into shares in the company in certain circumstances, including an exit or a new funding round. Investors and the Future Fund both invest using a convertible loan agreement, which is predefined and cannot be negotiated. How to apply The initial application must be made by an investor (or group) of investors via the British Business Bank website. There are strict criteria that all investors must meet. The scheme is open until 31 January 2021. The investor must provide \u201ckey investment details\u201d. These are then confirmed by the business, which also submits a full application. All parties to successful applications will execute an agreement and meet certain conditions before funds are released. https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/future-fund/https://www.uk-futurefund.co.uk/s/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/future-fund/investor-information/https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/future-fund/investor-information/https://british-business-bank.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#3z000002Naf6/a/3z000000MDFe/MQPBr0RySVNE.QGVZpNIUEkWu_2mbCNOSSGpx.oMxqA28 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  8. Covid Corporate Financing Facility As part of the further measures announced on 17 March, the Bank and the Treasury launched a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). This: \u2026will help businesses across a range of sectors to pay wages and suppliers, even while experiencing severe disruption to cashflows. The facility will offer financing on terms comparable to those prevailing in markets in the period before the Covid-19 economic shock, and will be open to firms that can demonstrate they were in sound financial health prior to the shock.  The facility will look through temporary impacts on firms\u2019 balance sheets and cash flows by basing eligibility on firms\u2019 credit ratings prior to the Covid-19 shock.38 The scheme is open to larger firms whether or not they have previously sought credit in this way. It will operate for at least 12 months. The Bank has set out overall guidance about eligibility and notes that the scheme is \u201cnormally\u201d intended for: UK incorporated companies, including those with foreign-incorporated parents and with a genuine business in the UK; companies with significant employment in the UK; firms with their headquarters in the UK. We will also consider whether the company generates significant revenues in the UK, serves a large number of customers in the UK or has a number of operating sites in the UK.39 UK Finance provides further coordination of the scheme and lists main contacts. This scheme complements the original Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Scheme (CBILS), which is intended for small and medium firms. Larger businesses that have not received support under CCFF are eligible to apply for the Coronavirus Larger Business Interruption Loans Scheme. The Telegraph reported on 25 April that CCFF appeared to be operating successfully, particularly in comparison with CBILS. But it criticised the lack of detail about the recipients of support: The Bank of England revealed on Thursday that it had bought \u00a310.7bn of commercial paper issued by 35 companies. A further 40 big businesses have won approval to draw a further \u00a328.4bn. Another 101 companies have been approved in principle to borrow sums yet to be determined. It seems the scheme is performing its intended task well, which is to ensure important employers have access to enough cash to stay afloat through the crisis. Yet for some reason, the taxpayer is not allowed to know which companies have benefited from up to \u00a31bn of public support.  38  Bank of England, \u201cHM Treasury and the Bank of England launch a Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF)\u201d, 18 March 2020. 39 Bank of England, \u201cCovid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF): information for those seeking to participate in the scheme\u201d, 20 March 2020.  https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/march/the-covid-corporate-financing-facilityhttps://www.ukfinance.org.uk/covid-19-corporate-financing-facilitieshttps://www.ukfinance.org.uk/covid-19-corporate-financing-facilitieshttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/march/hmt-and-boe-launch-a-covid-corporate-financing-facilityhttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/march/hmt-and-boe-launch-a-covid-corporate-financing-facilityhttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/march/the-covid-corporate-financing-facilityhttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/march/the-covid-corporate-financing-facility29 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 The Bank of England says \u201cthe names of issuers and securities purchased or eligible will not be made public\u201d. It even requires applicants to sign a confidentiality agreement. To their credit, easyJet and the baker Greggs have told the world they have used CCFF. Housebuilders such as Redrow revealed they have the scheme. Have they breached a confidentiality agreement to do so? We don\u2019t even know that. That situation has since changed and total figures (and recipients) are now published weekly and collated in our briefing paper Coronavirus business support schemes: statistics. On 22 September 2020, the Bank of England confirmed that the CCFF will make no purchases of commercial paper after 22 March 2021. It closed to new applications from counterparties and issuers looking to become eligible on 31 December 2020. https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8938/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8938/https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2020/update-on-the-covid-corporate-financing-facility-22-september-202030 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  9. HMRC arrangements 9.1 Time to Pay HMRC\u2019s \u2018Time To Pay\u2019 was introduced in response to the 2008 economic crisis.40 HMRC may grant a business an additional amount of time to pay their bill without charging statutory penalties on the late payment. To be eligible businesses need to demonstrate that they are in genuine difficulty, unable to pay their tax on time, and are likely to be able to pay if HMRC allowed them more time. Detailed guidance is in HMRC\u2019s Debt Management and Banking Manual \u2013 from para 800000; there is a useful overview at para 800040.41 In the 2020 Budget the Government announced a dedicated Covid-19 helpline, to provide help and advice, including the possibility of agreeing Time to Pay arrangements. The helpline number is 0800 024 1222. Opening hours are Monday to Friday 8am to 8pm, and Saturday 8am to 4pm.42 Any Time to Pay arrangement would be agreed \u201con a case-by-case basis and are tailored to individual circumstances and liabilities.\u201d43 The Budget confirmed that HMRC would \u201cwaive late payment penalties and interest where a business experiences administrative difficulties contacting HMRC or paying taxes due to Covid-19.\u201d44 9.2 Tax deferrals VAT Generally, businesses are required to submit a VAT return and pay the VAT they owe on a quarterly basis.45 Following the 2020 Budget the Chancellor announced a number of further support measures including a deferral of the next quarter of VAT payments: \u201cThat means no business will pay any from now until the end of June; and you will have until the end of the financial year to repay those bills.

This is an automatic offer with no applications required. No penalties or interest for late payment will be charged if someone defers payment of their July 2020 payment on account until January 2021.53 As part of his Winter Economic Plan, the Chancellor announced that self assessment taxpayers would have additional time to pay taxes due in January 2021. Taxpayers with up to \u00a330,000 of self assessment liabilities due will be able to use HMRC\u2019s Time to Pay facility to secure a plan to pay over an additional 12 months. Self-assessment taxpayers who are not able to pay their tax bill on time, including those who cannot use the online service, can continue to use HMRC\u2019s Time to Pay Self-Assessment helpline to agree a payment plan.54 Further to this the Low Income Tax Reform Group has detailed guidance on the tax and benefit implications of Covid-19.  48  HM Treasury, Winter Economic Plan, CP297, September 2020 para 2.12 49  HMRC, Deferral of VAT payments due to COVID-19, updated 25 September 2020 50  HMRC, Understand your Self Assessment tax bill, retrieved November 2020 51  HM Treasury, The Chancellor Rishi Sunak provides an updated statement on coronavirus, 20 March 2020 52  HMRC, Defer your Self Assessment payment on account due to coronavirus (COVID-19), updated 15 October 2020 53  See also, HMRC press notice, \u00a311 billion boost for taxpayers facing difficulty due to coronavirus (COVID-19), 14 July 2020 54  HM Treasury, Winter Economic Plan, CP297, September 2020 para 2.13. see also, HMRC press notice, Self Assessment customers to benefit from enhanced payment plans, 1 October 2020. https://www.litrg.org.uk/tax-guides/coronavirus-guidancehttps://www.litrg.org.uk/tax-guides/coronavirus-guidancehttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/921059/CCS207_CCS0920237970-001_Winter_Economy_Plan_Web_Accessible.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferral-of-vat-payments-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19https://www.gov.uk/understand-self-assessment-bill/payments-on-accounthttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-chancellor-rishi-sunak-provides-an-updated-statement-on-coronavirushttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-chancellor-rishi-sunak-provides-an-updated-statement-on-coronavirushttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/defer-your-self-assessment-payment-on-account-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defer-your-self-assessment-payment-on-account-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19https://www.gov.uk/government/news/11-billion-boost-for-taxpayers-facing-difficulty-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19https://www.gov.uk/government/news/11-billion-boost-for-taxpayers-facing-difficulty-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/921059/CCS207_CCS0920237970-001_Winter_Economy_Plan_Web_Accessible.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/self-assessment-customers-to-benefit-from-enhanced-payment-planshttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/self-assessment-customers-to-benefit-from-enhanced-payment-plans32 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  10. Rates relief and national and local grants \u2022 Each country of the UK has run schemes to support businesses. Schemes may be related to the business rates system, business sector or wider business closure requirements. \u2022 The changing wider context means that arrangements may change quickly, so we recommend checking with national and local authorities for the most up-to-date information. 10.1 England The UK Government announced four grant schemes for businesses in England in November 2020. They comprise three versions of the Local Restrictions Support Grant and one of the Additional Restrictions Grant. There are also arrangements for how schemes run during the national lockdown that began on 5 January 2021. Like the earlier business support grants available between March and August 2020, local authorities operate these grant schemes, so individual businesses should contact their local authority if they want to apply.  Local Restrictions Support Grant (LRSG) As was the case in earlier schemes, eligibility is related to the rateable value of the property a business occupies. One grant is available for each occupied property. The type of grant available also relates closely to the tier system in operation in England. There are three basic variations of the LRSG \u2013 open, sector and closed. The last of these also features an \u201caddendum\u201d \u2013 a further arrangement that applies to businesses throughout England during the second lockdown (5 November to 2 December 2020). This scheme supersedes the others during that period. The Open scheme applies to businesses in Tier 2 and 3 areas that have been affected by local restrictions but have not been required to close. While local authorities have discretion about how to distribute the grants, the guidance asks them to prioritise the \u201chospitality, hotel, bed & breakfast and leisure\u201d sectors, although there will be no penalty for those whose local circumstances choose to operate differently. The Government allocates funding for this grant on the basis of the rateable properties in these sectors in the local authority area, plus a 5% top-up. \u2022 The Sector scheme applies to businesses in sectors that have to close due to national regulations. The guidance (para 20) notes that other types of businesses may have to close across England. If they do, they will become eligible for the scheme after being closed for 14 days. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-restrictions-support-grants-lrsg-and-additional-restrictions-grant-arg-guidance-for-local-authoritieshttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-restrictions-support-grants-lrsg-and-additional-restrictions-grant-arg-guidance-for-local-authoritieshttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/935141/local-restrictions-support-grant-OPEN-la-guidance.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/935141/local-restrictions-support-grant-OPEN-la-guidance.pdf33 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 \u2022 The Closed scheme applies to businesses in Tier 3 areas that have been required to close. The guidance excludes businesses that do not depend on supply direct in-person services from their premises (such as solicitors and accountants) (para 33). But pubs and bars that operate click-and-collect services are eligible (para 45). Funding is allocated according to the number of properties subject to closure in each local authority area. The guidance does not say that local authorities can use their discretion to allocate grants in the way set out for the Open scheme. \u2022 The Closed Addendum scheme is essentially an extension of the Closed scheme that applies across all of England during the lockdown from 5 November to 2 December. After that time, the other schemes apply as described above. Grants for the three basic schemes are payable to businesses in 14- or 28-day periods. Businesses only become eligible once a new 14-day payment cycle has begun, not in the middle of one. The Closed Addendum scheme operates on a 28-day cycle. Local authorities determine eligibility for the schemes and must take account of State Aid restrictions. The three basic schemes will run until 31 March 2021. The table below summarises the key features of the schemes. Additional Restrictions Grant (ARG) This is a one-off grant of \u00a320 per head to each district or unitary council. The ARG emerged from the deals negotiated with individual areas during September and October when they were required to move into Tier 3. The funding can be used in financial years 2020-21 and 2021-22. It can be used for general \u201cbusiness support activities\u201d, so eligibility is at the discretion of local authorities. The ARG became available to all local authority areas of England on 4 November. January 2021 grants The following arrangements apply during the national lockdown beginning on 5 January 2021: \u2022 The Local Restrictions Support Grant (Closed) scheme will be available to all businesses in England required to close. Payments to businesses will be available for a 42-day period beginning on 5 January 2021: the amounts available will be the same per week as were previously available under the \u2018Closed\u2019 scheme.  \u2022 The LRSG will be accompanied by a \u2018Closed Businesses Lockdown Payment\u2019, an additional one-off support grant for businesses totalling \u00a34.6 billion for England. This is a single rather than a recurring grant.  \u2022 Guidance for both these schemes was published on 13 January 2021. The eligibility criteria for these two schemes are the same. Businesses must apply by 31 March 2021 and payments must be made by 30 April; https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/935141/local-restrictions-support-grant-OPEN-la-guidance.pdfhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06775/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/46-billion-in-new-lockdown-grants-to-support-businesses-and-protect-jobshttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/46-billion-in-new-lockdown-grants-to-support-businesses-and-protect-jobshttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-restrictions-support-grants-lrsg-and-additional-restrictions-grant-arg-guidance-for-local-authorities34 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  \u2022 When the national lockdown beginning on 5 January comes to an end, business grants will once again be available on the previous basis, related to the tier of restrictions applying in a given area;   \u2022 The Additional Restrictions Grant will be increased by \u00a3500 million. Local authorities may make discretionary grants from this fund to businesses not eligible for the LRSG, or to other local businesses as they see fit; \u2022 Support is not available under this scheme for businesses not required to close, or for businesses that continue to trade but are struggling due to the restrictions. \u2022 An answer to a Parliamentary Question on 13 January 2021 also stated that \u201clocal authorities which are subject to restrictions on socialising (in particular a ban on indoor household mixing) will receive additional funding so that they can make grants of up to \u00a32,100 per month to hospitality, leisure and accommodation businesses which are able to remain open but which are experiencing a severe reduction in demand due to these restrictions\u201d.55 This support will come from the \u2018Open\u2019 element of the Local Restrictions Support Grant.    55  PQ HC 130838 2019-21, 13 Jan 2021 https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2020-12-16/130838?utm_source=R%26I+%28business+communications%29&utm_campaign=10bc9f8d26-Current_Awareness_PCC_14-01-2021&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4957411bec-10bc9f8d26-102480029&mc_cid=10bc9f8d26&mc_eid=ecbbc488cb35 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 Main features of the Local Restrictions Support Grant schemes (2020) Feature Open Sector Closed Closed Addendum Start date 1 August 1 November 9 September 5 November Eligible businesses Businesses in tier 2 and 3 areas in the hospitality, hotel, bed & breakfast and leisure sectors Nightclubs, dance halls, hostess bars, discotheques, sexual entertainment venues in all areas Any businesses in Tier 3 areas providing services in person from their premises that are required to close for 14 days or more All businesses providing services in person from their premises that are required to close for 14 days or more during the England-wide lockdown Frequency of payments to councils 14-day payment cycles from 2 December (was previously 28 days from 1 August) 14-day payment cycles starting 1 Nov 14-day payment cycles 28-day payment cycle Amount per business available to councils: rateable value up to \u00a315k \u00a3467 per 14 days \u00a3667 per 14 days \u00a3667 per 14 days \u00a31,334 per 28 days Amount per business available to councils: rateable value up to \u00a315,001 to \u00a350,999 \u00a3700 per 14 days \u00a31,000 per 14 days \u00a31,000 per 14 days \u00a32,000 per 28 days Amount per business available to councils: rateable value \u00a351k and over \u00a31,050 per 14 days \u00a31,500 per 14 days \u00a31,500 per 14 days \u00a33,000 per 28 days End date 31 March 2021 31 March 2021 31 March 2021 2 December 2020  36 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  Earlier initiatives Earlier in the pandemic, the UK Government instituted extensive relief from business rates for particular classes of businesses.  A series of extended reliefs had already been announced in a Written Statement on 27 January 2020.56 Some of these reliefs were extended further in the Budget speech on 11 March 2020.57 Yet more extensions were announced in a speech on 17 March 2020.58 These reliefs apply for the whole of the 2020-21 financial year. Funds for rate relief provided for England by the UK Government engage the Barnett formula, meaning that new reliefs in England resulted in additional funds for the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Retail, leisure and hospitality relief On 17 March 2020, the Government announced that it was \u201cgiving all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England a 100% business rates holiday for the next 12 months\u201d.59 It\u2019s important to note that this support was only available to businesses that are directly liable for business rates \u2013 so sub-tenants and others that don\u2019t receive a rates bill weren\u2019t eligible. This built upon the 2020 Budget statement on 11 March, in which the Chancellor provided 100% relief for all retail properties with a rateable value of \u00a351,000 and under. This relief was also made available to the \u201chospitality and leisure sectors\u201d.60 The Government originally published guidance on the definition of retail properties and music venues in January 2020.61 This was updated on 25 March 2020 to include definitions of the \u201chospitality and leisure\u201d sectors. A further publication on 25 March 2020 extended the retail relief scheme to estate agents, letting agents and bingo halls.62 The guidance included a number of examples of types of property that would and would not be eligible for relief. Properties of any rateable value that had to close as a result of the pandemic were eligible for the relief, but only if they were occupied. The Government will compensate local authorities fully for any forgone revenue arising from this relief scheme.63 Small business grant funding To support businesses affected by coronavirus, the Chancellor\u2019s 17 March statement provided that all businesses currently eligible for Small  56  HCWS 64 2019-21, 27 January 2020 57  HM Treasury, Budget 2020, p. 40 58  HM Treasury, Chancellor announces additional support to protect businesses, 17 March 2020 59  HM Treasury, Chancellor announces additional support to protect businesses, 17 March 2020 60  HM Treasury, Budget 2020, p. 40 61  MHCLG, Business rate retail relief: guidance, 27 Jan 2020.

This was an increase from a \u00a33,000 grant made available in the 11 March Budget statement. Separately, businesses in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors that were eligible for full business rate relief, and that occupied properties with a rateable value of \u00a351,000 or under, were entitled to a grant of \u00a325,000 for each qualifying property occupied in 2020-21.64  Guidance on eligibility was published on 24 March 2020.65 Businesses must have been eligible for Small Business Rate Relief on 11 March 2020 in order to qualify for the \u00a310,000 grant scheme. To qualify for the larger \u00a325,000 grant, a business would have to have been eligible for the retail/leisure/hospitality relief scheme on 11 March 2020. A Parliamentary Question answered on 11 September indicated that local authorities were required to make final payments by 30 September. Local Authority Discretionary Grants Fund On 2 May the Government announced an additional \u00a3617 million in funding alongside the schemes discussed above: the Local Authority Discretionary Grants Fund. The eligibility criteria were different from those for the original grant schemes, covering some additional categories of business. Guidance for the fund was published on 13 May. It stated that the Government wished to see four categories of business prioritised: \u2022 Small businesses in shared offices or other flexible workspaces. Examples could include units in industrial parks, science parks and incubators which do not have their own business rates assessment;  \u2022 Regular market traders with fixed building costs, such as rent, who do not have their own business rates assessment;  \u2022 Bed & Breakfasts which pay Council Tax instead of business rates; and  \u2022 Charity properties in receipt of charitable business rates relief which would otherwise have been eligible for Small Business Rates Relief or Rural Rate Relief.66  However, the guidance also stated: The list set out above is not intended to be exhaustive but is intended to guide local authorities as to the types of business that the government considers should be a priority for the scheme. Authorities should determine for themselves whether particular situations not listed are broadly similar in nature to those above and, if so, whether they should be eligible for grants from this discretionary fund.67  The guidance included a number of additional stipulations:  64  See HM Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak on Covid-19 response, 17 Mar 2020 65  HM Treasury, Coronavirus (COVID-19): business support grant funding - guidance for local authorities, 24 Mar 2020 66  BEIS, Local Authority Discretionary Grants Fund \u2013 guidance for local authorities, May 2020, p6 67  Ibid. https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2020-09-08/86676https://www.gov.uk/government/news/top-up-to-local-business-grant-funds-schemehttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/top-up-to-local-business-grant-funds-schemehttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rishi-sunak-on-covid19-responsehttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-business-support-grant-fundinghttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-business-support-grant-fundinghttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-business-support-grant-funding38 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  \u2022 Grant recipients must be small or micro-businesses, as defined in the Companies Act 2006; \u2022 A business\u2019s annual rateable value or rent must be under \u00a351,000;68 \u2022 Businesses were not eligible if they had received grants from any other central government funding scheme;69 \u2022 The maximum grant available was \u00a325,000; \u2022 Local authorities would not receive an allocation from this fund if they had a projected underspend of 5% or more on the original grant schemes. Other reliefs In 2020-21, a discount of \u00a35,000 is available on the rates bill of all pubs in England with a rateable value of under \u00a3100,000, in order to provide business support during the pandemic.70 The Government also announced that all childcare nurseries in England would be exempt from business rates. Nurseries are defined as properties \u201coccupied by providers on Ofsted\u2019s Early Years Register and wholly or mainly used for the provision of the Early Years Foundation Stage and which are subject to business rates in the year 2020/21\u201d.71 There is no rateable value limit on eligibility.  10.2 Northern Ireland The Northern Ireland Executive has published the following summary of arrangements: Financial support is available for businesses that have been required to close, or have had business activities at their premises directly curtailed by current health protection regulations.

Protection from forfeiture for non-payment of rent Where a tenant under a commercial/business lease fails to pay the rent, their landlord will usually have a contractual right to early determination of the lease agreement. This is referred to as forfeiture.  In recognition that commercial tenants are likely to experience interruptions in their income streams, with consequences for their ability to meet their rent commitments, section 82 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 provided that a landlord\u2019s right to treat a lease as forfeited for non-payment of rent could not be exercised for three months up to  30 June 2020. Since this initial announcement the moratorium on evictions has been extended three times: \u2022 On 19 June the moratorium was extended to 30 September 2020.72  \u2022 On 29 September there was a further extension to 31 December 2020.73 \u2022 Most recently, on 9 December the Government said the moratorium would be extended to the end of March 2021.74 All business tenancies within the meaning of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 are covered in England and Wales.  The Government also published a voluntary Code of Practice for commercial property relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to \u201cprovide clarity for businesses when discussing rental payments and to encourage best practice so that all parties are supported.\u201d75 There is an intention to publish additional guidance \u201cshortly\u201d which will \u201csupport negotiations between landlords and tenants\u201d.76 There is reference to further guidance in 2021: Additional guidance published early next year will sit alongside the government\u2019s Code of Practice, published in June, to encourage all parties to work together to protect viable businesses and ensure a swift economic recovery.77 Section 83 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 provides the same protection for business tenants in Northern Ireland. It applies to those within the meaning of the Business Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 1996. The 1996 Order allows a landlord in Northern Ireland to oppose renewal of a tenancy where there has been a \u2018persistent delay in paying rent\u2019. In recognition that this could present problems for tenants who rely on the  72  MHCLG, Government provides further halt to business evictions and more support for high street firms, 19 June 2020 73  The Business Tenancies (Protection from Forfeiture: Relevant Period) (Coronavirus) (England) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 74  MHCLG, Business evictions ban extended until March, 9 December 2020 75  MHCLG, Government provides further halt to business evictions and more support for high street firms, 19 June 2020 76  MHCLG, Business evictions ban extended until March, 9 December 2020 77  MHCLG, Business evictions ban extended until March, 9 December 2020 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893637/Code_of_Practice_for_commercial_property.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893637/Code_of_Practice_for_commercial_property.pdfhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-provides-further-halt-to-business-evictions-and-more-support-for-high-street-firmshttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-provides-further-halt-to-business-evictions-and-more-support-for-high-street-firmshttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/994/introduction/madehttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/994/introduction/madehttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/business-evictions-ban-extended-until-marchhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-provides-further-halt-to-business-evictions-and-more-support-for-high-street-firmshttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-provides-further-halt-to-business-evictions-and-more-support-for-high-street-firmshttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/business-evictions-ban-extended-until-marchhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/business-evictions-ban-extended-until-march41 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 moratorium against forfeiture if their leases were due for renewal during the period of the moratorium, section 83 provides that the \u201crelevant period\u201d will be ignored for the purposes of Article 12(1)(b) of the 1996 Order. The \u201crelevant period\u201d was extended to 31 December 202078 and has been extended again to 31 March 2021.79  The moratorium on non-collection of rent for the purpose of forfeiture during the specified period does not amount to a waiver of the landlord\u2019s right to pursue rent due. In Scotland, schedule 7 to the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020 extended the notice period before a commercial lease can be terminated for non-payment of rent from 14 days to 14 weeks.80 This measure has been extended to 31 March 2021.81 The Scottish Government \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the UK Government\u2019s Code of Practice for commercial property relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic and \u201cexpects it to be used in conjunction with the anti-irritancy measures.\u201d82  78  Business Tenancies (Coronavirus) (Restriction on Forfeiture: Relevant Period) (Northern Ireland) (No 2) Regulations 2020/209  79  The Business Tenancies (Coronavirus) (Restriction on Forfeiture: Relevant Period) (Northern Ireland) (No. 3) Regulations 2020/332 80  Scottish Government, New measures to protect business tenants, 10 April 2020 81  Scottish Government, Advice for commercial property tenants during the pandemic, 1 December 2020 82  Ibid. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/897901/Code_of_Practice_for_commercial_property.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/897901/Code_of_Practice_for_commercial_property.pdfhttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2020/332/introduction/madehttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2020/332/introduction/madehttps://www.gov.scot/news/new-measures-to-protect-business-tenants/https://blogs.gov.scot/scotlands-economy/2020/12/01/advice-for-commercial-property-tenants-during-the-pandemic/42 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  12. Insolvency and corporate reporting The pandemic and the consequent lockdown have provided major trading challenges to many otherwise economically viable businesses \u2013 whether dramatic falls in demand, difficulties with supply chains, or requirements to stop trading altogether. On 28 March 2020, the Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, announced that the Government would introduce measures at the earliest opportunity to help companies to avoid the risk of insolvency and to ease some of the requirements of corporate reporting. On 23 April, the Government announced further measures to protect businesses from \u201caggressive rent collection and closure\u201d. The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 received Royal Assent on 25 June 2020. Almost all its provisions came into force on 26 June 2020, but most of the temporary business protection measures it enacts have retrospective effect. The Act introduces permanent measures to update the UK insolvency regime, and temporary measures to give struggling businesses a lifeline during the current crisis. The Act\u2019s temporary insolvency measures consisted of the following (although as set out below, some of the dates have been extended): \u2022 Temporary suspension of the wrongful trading rules. The Act removes the threat of personal liability for wrongful trading from directors who try to keep their companies afloat through the emergency. However, all the other checks and balances on directors would remain in place. The measure orginally applied from 1 March 2020 to 30 September 2020. New measures were introduced in November 2020, as discussed below. \u2022 The Act temporarily removes the threat of statutory demands and winding-up petitions where unpaid debt is due to Covid-19. Statutory demands will be void if served on a company during the relevant period (between 1 March 2020 and 30 September 2020). Winding-up petitions presented during the relevant period (1 March 2020 to 30 September 2020) that claim that a company is unable to pay its debts will be reviewed by the court to determine the cause of non-payment. If a company cannot pay its debts because of Covid-19, no winding-up order will be made. The Act also contains temporary corporate governance measures intended to relieve the burden on companies and other types of business registered at Companies House and allow them to focus all their efforts on continuing to trade. Specifically, the Act contains measures that:  \u2022 Temporarily give companies and other bodies greater flexibility to hold Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and other meetings in a safe and practicable manner in response to the pandemic. This measure applies retrospectively from 26 March 2020 to 30 September 2020. Additionally, the Act allows https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-28-march-2020https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-measures-to-protect-uk-high-street-from-aggressive-rent-collection-and-closurehttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/12/contents/enacted43 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 companies and other bodies to postpone their AGMs. Directors are not be exposed to liability for failing to hold an AGM in accordance with a company\u2019s constitution or acting without shareholder endorsement.  \u2022 Temporarily extend filing deadlines at Companies House. The Act provides for a temporary extension to the period allowed for the directors of a public company to comply with their obligation under section 441 of the Companies Act 2006 to deliver accounts and reports for a financial year to the Registrar at Companies House. In addition, the Act empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations to extend the deadline for certain other filings at Companies House. Extension of deadlines On 24 September, BEIS announced extensions of deadlines as follows: \u2022 companies and other qualifying bodies with obligations to hold AGMs will continue to have the flexibility to hold these meetings virtually until 30 December 2020. This means that shareholders can continue to examine company papers and vote on important issues remotely (since extended to 31 March 2021) \u2022 statutory demands and winding-up petitions will continue to be restricted until 31 December 2020 to protect companies from aggressive creditor enforcement action as a result of coronavirus related debts \u2022 termination clauses are still prohibited, stopping suppliers from ceasing their supply or asking for additional payments while a company is going through a rescue process. However, small suppliers will remain exempted from the obligation to supply until 30 March 2021 so that they can to protect their business if necessary \u2022 the modifications to the new moratorium procedure, which relax the entry requirements to it, will also be extended until 30 March 2021. A company may enter into a moratorium if they have been subject to an insolvency procedure in the previous 12 months. Measures will also ease access for companies subject to a winding up petition. The temporary moratorium rules will also be extended to 30 March 2021. In November 2020, the Government introduced new regulations that re-introduced temporary suspension of the wrongful trading rules from 26 November 2020 to 30 April 2021. It also extended the provisions to allow virtual AGMs until 31 March 2021.

Insurance The Association of British Insurers (ABI) publishes and regularly updates general guidance about insurance and coronavirus. However, insurance arrangements vary and businesses should check their cover and discuss concerns with their brokers. There have been increasing disputes about business interruption insurance coverage. Although most policies are unlikely to cover closure resulting from the pandemic, some wording may be open to interpretation. See our briefing paper Coronavirus: Business interruption insurance for further details. Insurance arrangements for businesses are complex and cover a number of areas, including business continuity/interruption, event cancellation and contingency, and professional liability.83 The ABI emphasises that insurance arrangements vary and advises businesses to check their cover and to discuss concerns with brokers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates insurance in the UK, has published general guidance and expectations about insurance cover and management during the pandemic. It notes: We expect firms to consider very carefully the needs of their customers and show flexibility in their treatment of them. We are likely to see customers\u2019 behaviours change because of the pandemic. For example, this could mean that customers may need to work from home or commute by car. We would not expect to see their ability to claim impacted by circumstances over which they have little control. We expect firms to clearly communicate any policy exclusions that may impact the cover and use of individual policies. This applies both to new sales or changes to existing policies (either mid-term or at renewal) \u2013 they must clearly meet consumers\u2019 demands and needs. Treasury Committee The Treasury Select Committee is conducting an inquiry into the economic impact of coronavirus. As part of this, the Chair, Mel Stride MP, wrote to the ABI on 26 March 2020 with a set of questions about the scale of the industry\u2019s response and changes to what is on offer and the terms of insurance contracts. In its response, the ABI emphasised its commitment to supporting customers, but also the scale of demands that the industry faces: ABI members estimate they will pay \u00a31.2 billion in claims to policyholders as a result of Covid-19 covering losses by customers for business interruption, travel, events, weddings and school trips. Working estimates of the breakdown of the \u00a31.2 billion are \u00a3900m for business interruption, \u00a3275m for travel insurance and \u00a325m for events, weddings and school trips. If the period of business closures and travel restrictions continue well into the summer it is reasonable to expect this number would rise further.  83  See, for instance, Simmons & Simmons, \u201cCoronavirus (COVID-19) - the insurance issues\u201d, 5 March 2020, for a general overview. https://www.abi.org.uk/products-and-issues/topics-and-issues/coronavirus-qa/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8917/https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/insurance-and-coronavirushttps://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/insurance-and-coronavirushttps://committees.parliament.uk/work/224/economic-impact-of-coronavirus/https://committees.parliament.uk/work/224/economic-impact-of-coronavirus/https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmtreasy/correspondence/200325-Chair-to-ABI-coronavirus-threat.pdfhttps://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmtreasy/correspondence/200325-Chair-to-ABI-coronavirus-threat.pdfhttps://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmtreasy/correspondence/200325-Chair-to-ABI-coronavirus-threat.pdfhttps://www.abi.org.uk/globalassets/files/subject/public/tsc/abi-tsc-data-submission-covering-letter-23-april-2020.pdfhttps://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/publications/ck7eq726v0ymw090677ym3c0t/coronavirus-covid-19---the-insurance-issueshttps://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/publications/ck7eq726v0ymw090677ym3c0t/coronavirus-covid-19---the-insurance-issues45 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 The response also set out a range of more \u201cflexible\u201d responses to general policy terms, such as relaxed approaches to MOTs and home working. 13.1 Business interruption insurance There have been wide concerns about the coverage of business interruption insurance. Most businesses are unlikely to have cover for pandemics. A full discussion appears in our briefing paper Coronavirus: Business interruption insurance. Many businesses had expected that when Governments declared Covid-19 a notifiable disease and ordered them to shut down they would be able to make claims under interruption policies. But few have been able to do so successfully. Most insurers had revised the standard wording of their policies over the last decade or so to remove cover relating to new diseases. Affected businesses should read their policies, discuss the matter with their insurer or broker and ask for written advice. But many policy-holders argue that policy wording isn\u2019t clear or seems to allow them to claim, even when insurers have told them that they can\u2019t. What can businesses do? Small businesses who dispute decisions may follow the standard complaints procedure for complaints about financial services. It is however likely that reviews of such claims will take some time. As a result of the level of concern, though, the Financial Conduct Authority has published information for holders of business interruption policies. They also sought review of examples of contentious wording by the High Court. The judgment, released on 15 September 2020, largely found in favour of the policy-holders. A January 2021 judgment on an appeal against the decision once again found in favour of the policyholders. Further information about the case and the consequences is available in our briefing paper Coronavirus: Business interruption insurance. Businesses may also consider the other support options discussed in this briefing. It is likely that few businesses have relevant cover under standard wording. But this is not always straightforward. Our briefing paper Coronavirus: Business interruption insurance discusses the issue further. https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8917/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8917/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/constituency-casework/how-do-i-complain-about-a-financial-service-such-as-a-bank-or-insurance-company/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/constituency-casework/how-do-i-complain-about-a-financial-service-such-as-a-bank-or-insurance-company/https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/business-interruption-insurancehttps://www.fca.org.uk/firms/business-interruption-insurancehttps://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/bi-insurance-test-case-judgment.pdfhttps://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/supreme-court-judgment-business-interruption-insurance-test-casehttps://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/supreme-court-judgment-business-interruption-insurance-test-casehttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8917/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8917/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8917/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8917/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8917/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8917/46 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  14. Eat Out to Help Out Under the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme (the EOHO Scheme) the Government provided 50% off the cost of food and/or non-alcoholic drinks eaten-in at participating businesses UK-wide. It applied all day Monday to Wednesday from 3 to 31 August 2020. The discount was capped at a maximum of \u00a310 per head.84 There was no minimum spend requirement and no limit on the number of times customers could use the offer. Participating establishments provided the discount to customers and claimed the discount back from HMRC. The scheme was intended to restore consumer confidence and boost customer demand to help restaurants build back business following the coronavirus lock down period. It formed part of the Chancellor\u2019s Plan for Jobs announced on 8 July 2020, under the heading \u201cprotecting jobs\u201d.  As of 27 August 2020, 84,700 restaurants were registered to participate in the Scheme, \u00a3522.0 million had been claimed under the scheme spread across 100 million individual meal claims.85  Further information for businesses is available in the Government\u2019s guidance on the conditions for the scheme and making claims under the scheme.86 For further discussion and updates, see the Library briefing papers on the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme and on the Hospitality industry and Covid-19.    84  Inclusive of VAT but does not include service charge.

Kickstart As detailed in the library briefing Coronavirus: Impact on the labour market, youth unemployment in May-July 2020 was at its highest level since 2016, and the fall in employment in this quarter was the largest since March 2010. The Kickstart scheme intends to create \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of 6-month work placements. It is aimed at 16-24 year olds in Great Britain who are on Universal Credit and are deemed at risk of long-term unemployment. It was initially announced as part of the Plan for Jobs. There is guidance about how employers can apply for the scheme. The scheme The scheme will pay employers to create new jobs for these young people, and funding will be conditional on the employer proving that these jobs are new, and are not replacing jobs held by staff who have recently been made redundant. The jobs created must provide a minimum of 25 hours per week, for 6 months. Guidance for the scheme notes: Funding will cover for each job placement: \u2022 100% of the relevant National Minimum Wage for 25 hours a week \u2022 the associated employer National Insurance contributions \u2022 employer minimum automatic enrolment contributions There will also be extra funding to support young people to build their experience and help them move into sustained employment after they have completed their Kickstart Scheme funded job. The employers will also be expected to provide training and support to the Kickstarter to find a permanent job, although they should not need to undertake extensive training before they can begin the work placement. The Government will provide up to \u00a31,500 per job placement to cover setup costs, support and training. Jobcentre Plus work coaches will support Universal Credit claimants \u201cwho are ready for an opportunity\u201d to enrol in the scheme. Employers will then interview applicants and select the best candidate for their role. Applications for Kickstart grants must be for a minimum of 30 job placements. If an organisation is not able to offer this many placements, then they would need to partner with another organisation to reach this number. Where this is the case, a representative needs to be put in place to submit the application. Support for employers with fewer than 30 placements is also available from Kickstart gateways. There is a list of organisations that have put themselves forward to be gateways.  https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8898/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8898/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-plan-for-jobs-documentshttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/kickstart-scheme#guidance-about-the-kickstart-scheme-for-employershttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/kickstart-schemehttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-someone-to-apply-for-a-kickstart-scheme-grant-on-your-behalfhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-someone-to-apply-for-a-kickstart-scheme-grant-on-your-behalf48 Coronavirus: Support for businesses  Once a job placement is created, a different person can take over the role at the end of the six-month period. An initial \u00a32 billion has been provided for this scheme, and there will not be a cap on the number of places available. The Government has reported that, for a 24-year-old, the grant will be worth around \u00a36,500. This is based on the National Minimum Wage for those aged 21 to 24. The grant would be worth less for those aged below 21 as the minimum wage is less for these workers. 49 Commons Library Briefing, 13 January 2021 16. Other initiatives This is a fast-moving issue and should be read as correct at the time of publication. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. The Chancellor announced that the Government would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d. Further actions include the following: \u2022 Relaxed planning rules to allow pubs and restaurants to operate as hot food takeaways during the coronavirus outbreak. Through secondary legislation, the Government said it would allow the temporary change of use of a pub (A4 \u2013  drinking establishment) and a restaurant (A3 \u2013 restaurants and caf\u00e9s) to a hot-food take away for a period up to 23 March 2021. 87 Aspects of the temporary change relate to permitted development rights and permitted development rights for change of use. \u2022 The Business and Planning Act 2019-21 became law on 22 July 2020. The purpose of the Bill is to help businesses recover from the disruption caused by Covid-19 and to support them in implementing safer ways of working, in particular the need for social distancing. It sets out to: o make it easier for restaurants and pubs in England and Wales to seat and serve customers outdoors through temporary changes to licensing law and outdoor seating; o make changes to planning law in England to ensure that the planning system can support the planning and safe construction of new development following the impact of Covid-19; o facilitate Bounce Back Loans by disapplying \u2018unfair relationships\u2019 provisions in the Consumer Credit Act 1974 for lending made under the Scheme; o make changes to HGV and PCV licensing in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and roadworthiness testing for heavy vehicles in Great Britain to prevent a backlog of checks and tests from disrupting services, whilst respecting safety considerations. \u2022 In July 2020, the DCMS and Treasury announced a \u00a31.57 billion funding package for cultural, arts and heritage institutions: the Culture Recovery Fund. A DCMS written statement of 13 October gave details of the first round of awards.  87  Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, Government to grant permission for pubs and restaurants to operate as takeaways as part of coronavirus response, 17 March 2020 For further information, see our briefing papers Commons Library analysis of the Business and Planning Bill 2019-21 and Planning for the Future: Planning policy changes in England in 2020 and future reforms,  as well as MHCLG\u2019s planning guidance to accompany the Business and Planning Act 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-grant-permission-for-pubs-and-restaurants-to-operate-as-takeaways-as-part-of-coronavirus-responsehttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/330/madehttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/330/madehttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn00485/http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN01301https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/16/contents/enactedhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/157-billion-investment-to-protect-britains-world-class-cultural-arts-and-heritage-institutionshttps://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-10-13/debates/20101347000007/CultureRecoveryFundArtsFundinghttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-grant-permission-for-pubs-and-restaurants-to-operate-as-takeaways-as-part-of-coronavirus-responsehttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-grant-permission-for-pubs-and-restaurants-to-operate-as-takeaways-as-part-of-coronavirus-responsehttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-grant-permission-for-pubs-and-restaurants-to-operate-as-takeaways-as-part-of-coronavirus-responsehttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8947/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8947/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8947/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8947/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8947/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8947/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8981/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8981/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8981/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8981/https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8981/https://enquiries.parliament.uk/Pages/FullLog.aspx?EnquiryId=4a713035474367515773773dhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/draft-planning-guidance-to-support-the-business-and-planning-billhttps://enquiries.parliament.uk/Pages/FullLog.aspx?EnquiryId=4a713035474367515773773dhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/draft-planning-guidance-to-support-the-business-and-planning-billhttps://enquiries.parliament.uk/Pages/FullLog.aspx?EnquiryId=4a713035474367515773773dhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/draft-planning-guidance-to-support-the-business-and-planning-billhttps://enquiries.parliament.uk/Pages/FullLog.aspx?EnquiryId=4a713035474367515773773dhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/draft-planning-guidance-to-support-the-business-and-planning-bill BRIEFING PAPER Number 8847  13 January 2021  About the Library The House of Commons Library research service provides MPs and their staff with the impartial briefing and evidence base they need to do their work in scrutinising Government, proposing legislation, and supporting constituents.

The Chancellor set out a package of temporary, timely and targeted measures to support public services, people and businesses through this period of disruption caused by Covid. This page is designed for businesses who wish to use one of the major measures announced: the joint HM Treasury and Bank of England lending facility, named the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). The facility is designed to support liquidity among larger firms, helping them to bridge coronavirus disruption to their cash flows through the purchase of short-term debt in the form of commercial paper.At a summary level, to be eligible for the scheme, applicants currently need to:\tMake a material UK contribution\tBe investment grade rated (or equivalent) as at 1 March 2020 (as supplemented by the ongoing credit quality review described below)\tNot be PRA- or FCA-regulated\tNot be a public undertaking\tNot be a leveraged investment vehicle\t(NB: there is additional guidance for some specific types of entities \u2013 please see below for more details).\tThere is no requirement to have previously issued Commercial Paper (CP).This page sets out in detail the practical steps that your firm needs to take in order to access the CCFF, as well as other frequently asked questions.If you have any questions or concerns about processing time for your application or would like to talk through any stage of the application process please do not hesitate to contact us at\u00a0CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk.\u00a0Please note, the CCFF closed to new applications on 31 December 2020.

The issuer should follow the process outlined below for notifying the Bank, with sufficient notice, of their intention to issue CP into the CCFF.In cases where the credit rating/equivalent evidence of credit quality has fallen below levels deemed equivalent to investment grade (as defined in question B1), the issuer will have the option to pursue a review on which HM Treasury, as the ultimate risk-owner of the CCFF, will take the final decision. The review will consider whether the issuer\u2019s use of the CCFF remains within the purpose of the facility.\u00a0 The review should be expected to take at least four weeks to complete, which may mean that issuance cannot take place on the issuer\u2019s requested date. As part of this review, HM Treasury will request supporting information from issuers.An update on drawing limitsIn addition to the enhanced credit review process described above, from 9 October 2020, any firm whose long-term credit rating falls to, or below, BBB-/Baa3/BBB (low) or equivalent after 1 March 2020 will have their aggregate drawing limit capped at a maximum of \u00a3300 million.This will not affect outstanding drawings if already in excess of \u00a3300 million.Process for new issuance into the CCFFIn order to support the revised credit quality requirements, issuers should notify the Bank at CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk of their intention to sell CP (either initial CP issuance or roll-overs of maturing CP) into the CCFF no later than 11am five Business Days prior to their requested sale date. The Bank will endeavor to confirm within that timeframe whether the transaction can proceed on the requested sale date.Where a \u2018point in time\u2019 rating is obtained from a Credit Rating Agency, evidence of current investment grade status must date from no longer than eight weeks before the proposed date of issuance.\u00a0If the credit ratings/equivalent evidence of credit quality submitted with the issuers original application dates from no longer than eight weeks before any proposed date of issuance after the application is completed, no further evidence will be required.These changes do not affect outstanding drawings which the CCFF will continue to hold until maturity unless, under the existing terms of the scheme, outstanding CP is repurchased early by the issuer.\t                                                                    \t                                                                                                                X2: Why are we making these changes?                                                                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo support orderly repayment by issuing companies the credit quality of issuers in the CCFF is reviewed on an ongoing basis.

For such firms, investment grade means a short-term rating of A3/P3/F3/R3 or above, or a long-term rating of BBB-/Baa3/BBB-/BBB low or above by at least one of the major credit ratings agencies: S&P, Moody\u2019s, Fitch or DBRS Morningstar.If firms have different ratings from different agencies, and one of those is below investment grade then the commercial paper will not be eligible.\t                                                                    \t                                                                                                                B2: What do I do if my company does not have a credit rating?                                                                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you do not have a public investment grade rating there are two further options for applicants to consider.\u00a0Please ensure that you consider these options in the context of the Market Notice that was published on 9 October 2020, which sets out the latest requirements for participation in the CCFF. In particular firms should note the requirements for evidence of credit quality to be \u201ccurrent\u201d. This is explained in Question B3. \tThe Bank will accept banks\u2019 internal ratings of corporates to assess credit status. For this purpose, and following a request confirmed by HM Treasury, Credit Benchmark has provided a credit assessment file to the Bank, which consolidates in aggregate form the corporate credit estimates of a number of the largest UK banks.        To be considered as having investment grade status based on banks\u2019 internal ratings, and so deemed eligible for the scheme, firms will ordinarily be required to have at least three investment grade bank ratings and no speculative grade bank ratings as at 1 March 2020. To avoid a single bank\u2019s credit view unduly affecting the overall assessment, we will generally not exclude firms with speculative grade ratings provided the average of bank ratings available is at least BBB/Baa2/BBB/BBB. And we will only accept two bank ratings as sufficient proof of investment grade status where both view the firm as strongly investment grade i.e. BBB+/Baa1/BBB+/BBB(High) or above.        We may additionally ask you to submit confirmations of your banks\u2019 ratings to the Bank directly, in a form that clearly evidences that they derive from the bank rather than the applicant. You would also be asked to attest that you have disclosed all bank ratings related to your principal direct on-balance sheet borrowings, for example across syndicated loans, bilateral loans and revolving credit facilities.    \tA second route is to seek an assessment of credit quality from one of the major credit rating agencies. This would remain an option if we have not been able to deem you IG-equivalent under option (1) above due to insufficient evidence, so you may wish to pursue option (1) first. The credit assessment should be as at 1 March 2020 in a form that can be shared privately with the Bank of England and HM Treasury, noting that you are doing so because you wish to use the CCFF. The largest credit rating agencies are prepared to do this and the standard rating agency products we are prepared to view as suitable evidence of credit status are listed below. We reserve the right to make use of other products.\u00a0Following the update as of 9th October, any applicants considering obtaining an assessment of credit quality from one of the major credit agencies in order to evidence investment grade status should contact the Bank first at CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk.HM Treasury and the Bank each reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to deem any issuer ineligible after taking into account all available information.\u00a0Standard rating agency products viewed as suitable evidence of credit status:Moody\u2019s Investor Services\tLong and short term public corporate credit ratings\t(Private) \u2018Indicative ratings\u2019 at a recent point-in-time (for those approaching CRAs for the first time)Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services\tLong and short term public corporate credit ratings\t\u2018Private Credit Assessments\u2019 (PCAs) at a recent point-in-time (for those approaching CRAs for the first time)    Fitch\tLong and short term public corporate credit ratings\t(Private) Credit opinion at a recent point-in-time (for those approaching CRAs for the first time).

Issuers will be required to provide supporting evidence of their current investment grade status, to a comparable standard to the evidence submitted to establish initial eligibility for the CCFF (as defined in question B1 and B2). Where a \u2018point in time\u2019 rating is obtained from a Credit Rating Agency, evidence of current investment grade status must date from no longer than eight weeks before the proposed date of issuance.If an issuer has no intention to sell CP into the scheme, there is no requirement to provide updated evidence of investment grade status.In cases where the credit rating/equivalent evidence of credit quality falls below levels deemed equivalent to investment grade for an issuer, the issuer will have the option to pursue a review on which HM Treasury will take the final decision. The review will consider whether the issuer\u2019s use of the CCFF remains within the purpose of the facility.\u00a0 The review should be expected to take at least four weeks to complete, which may mean that issuance cannot take place on the issuer\u2019s requested date.As part of a review, HM Treasury will request supporting information from issuers. The outcome of this review \u2013 a decision on whether the issuer can issue CP into the CCFF - will be communicated to the issuer once the review is complete.Where appropriate HM Treasury may, in its sole discretion, allow an issuer to issue new CP into the CCFF while the review process is undertaken. This will be decided on a case-by-case basis on request by the issuer.Any such review will not affect existing outstanding drawings which the CCFF will continue to hold until maturity unless, under the existing terms of the scheme, outstanding CP is repurchased early by the issuer.If an issuer believes they are sub-investment grade rated, or they are unsure if they have a sufficient credit rating/equivalent evidence of investment grade credit quality, the issuer should contact the Bank at CCFF-Applications@bankofengland.co.uk if they intend to sell new CP into the CCFF well in advance, and considering the expected 6 week timeframe for HMT to complete a review.Last updated 28 January 2021\t                                                                                                               C: CP programmes            \t                                                                                                                C1: What is commercial paper?                                                                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0Commercial paper is an unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by a business.The Facility will purchase sterling-denominated commercial paper from eligible issuers, with the following characteristics:\tMaturity of one week to twelve months\tWhere available, a credit rating of A-3 / P-3 / F-3 / R3 from at least one of Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s, Fitch and DBRS Morningstar as at 1 March 2020.\tIssued directly into Euroclear and/or Clearstream\tGoverned by English law and subject to the jurisdiction of the English courtsWe do not accept commercial paper with non-standard features such as extendibility or subordination, for example.\u00a0\t                                                                    \t                                                                                                                C2: Do I need to have issued commercial paper before to use the facility?\u00a0 How do I set up a commercial paper programme?                                                                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo. You do not need to have issued commercial paper prior to using the CCFF.If you would like to use the facility and have not issued commercial paper before, you should contact your bank.

From 1 July, the Bank will apply an additional fee to be set at 5 basis points and kept under review, which will be deducted from the yield offered in the re-sale transaction before calculating the final price and cash proceeds.Last updated 19 May 2020\t                                                                    \t                                                                                                                E4: How much can be issued?                                                                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor primary market purchases, the Bank will purchase commercial paper subject to individual issuer limits. These limits will reflect a range of factors, including an issuer\u2019s credit rating. An indicative guide to the maximum limit pre-approved by HM Treasury for issuers at different ratings is set out in the table below, although applicants should note that the limits set will be adjusted down at the Bank/HMT\u2019s discretion in some cases (for example where they exceed 50% of the applicants\u2019 average revenues over recent years).\u00a0\tRating            (or equivalence to rating)\u00a0            \tInitial issuer limit            \tA1/P1/F1/R1            \tUp to \u00a31bn            \tA2/P2/F2/R2            \tUp to \u00a3600m            \tA3/P3/F3/R3            \tUp to \u00a3300m            These limits will be kept under constant review. The UK Government is the ultimate owner of the CCFF, and HM Treasury and the Bank of England set the eligibility criteria and limits in order to manage risk to the taxpayer.Any issuer whose long-term credit rating falls to, or below, BBB-/Baa3/BBB (low) or equivalent will have their aggregate drawing limit capped at a maximum of \u00a3300 million.\u00a0 This will not affect outstanding drawings if in excess of \u00a3300 million.Issuers are encouraged to disclose to the Bank the total amount that they wish to borrow. If a company would like to increase its named limit, it should indicate the desired limit in its application.For a limit extension request to be considered, the company will need to demonstrate that the increased limit will be used to support them through the Covid-19 crisis.Due to the nature of the increased risk to the taxpayer, for such an increase to be considered there would be detailed engagement between the company and HM Government to understand, for example, if the company has sought alternative sources of financing, and to discuss repayment strategies.The cost of borrowing is higher for drawings above your stated limit. Given the ultimate cost of the scheme rests with the taxpayer, as a result of the HM Treasury indemnity, limit extensions also come with conditions, including the suspension of dividends and agreeing voluntary conditions on senior pay. These conditions would apply for all of your CCFF transactions, while for CCFF participants within their original limits these conditions apply only on CCFF transactions that involve CP maturing on or after 19 May 2021. If your limit extension request is granted, you will need to provide a letter of commitment to any agreed conditions.Last updated 9 October 2020\t                                                                    \t                                                                                                                E5: Will I be able to repay early?                                                                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes. The Bank will provide a standing offer, on request, to sell back CP held by the Fund to the original issuer in advance of its agreed maturity date.Sales are offered at a price calculated in accordance with the details set out in the Market Notice\u00a0and subject to such terms and conditions as the Bank may specify in its absolute discretion. Please refer to the Market Notice and CCFF Operating Procedures for more information, including details of how to make a request for early repayment.The Bank will usually apply a fee to the price offered for early repayment, as published on the Information for participants page. In light of the changes to the CCFF outlined on 19 May, re-sale transactions entered into on or before 30 June 2020 will not be subject to this additional spread.Issuers do not need to notify the Bank in advance of any intended early repayment.Where an issuer is subject to a review by HM Treasury, any such review will not affect outstanding drawings which the CCFF will continue to hold until maturity unless, under the existing terms of the scheme, outstanding CP is repurchased early by the issuer.

Temporary, but significant, disruptions to supply chains and weaker activity could challenge cash flows and increase demand for working capital from companies.The CCFF will provide funding to businesses by purchasing commercial paper of up to one-year maturity, issued by firms making a material contribution to the UK economy.  It will help businesses across a range of sectors to pay wages and suppliers, even while experiencing severe disruption to cashflows.The facility will offer financing on terms comparable to those prevailing in markets in the period before the Covid-19 economic shock, and will be open to firms that can demonstrate they were in sound financial health prior to the shock.  The facility will look through temporary impacts on firms\u2019 balance sheets and cash flows by basing eligibility on firms\u2019 credit ratings prior to the Covid-19 shock. Businesses do not need to have previously issued commercial paper in order to participate.The scheme will operate for at least 12 months and for as long as steps are needed to relieve cash flow pressures on firms that make a material contribution to the UK economy.  The Bank will publish further details of the operation of the CCFF in a Market Notice on Wednesday 18 March. The Bank will implement the facility on behalf of the Treasury and will put it into place as soon as possible.By providing an alternative source of finance for a wide range of companies, the scheme will help to preserve the capacity of the banking system to lend to other companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises, which rely on banks.  Last week, the Bank of England boosted this capacity by:\tlaunching a new Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for lending to SMEs (TFSME).  This will, over the next 12 months, offer four-year funding to banks of at least 5% of participants\u2019 stock of real economy lending at interest rates at, or very close to, Bank Rate.  Additional funding will be available for banks that increase lending, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\treducing the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0% of banks\u2019 exposures to UK borrowers with immediate effect.

As of 21st February, 93,216 BBLS top-ups had been approved worth \u00a30.83 billion.One topped up loan will still be reported as one loan to avoid double counting the number of facilities approved. (e.g. if there were previously two facilities worth \u00a340,000 each and subsequently one had been topped up to \u00a350,000, this would now be reported as two facilities worth a total of \u00a390,000).CBILS and BBLS data by constituencyStatistics from British Business BankFuture Fund\tData up to close of business\tTotal number of applications\tNumber of convertible loans approved\tValue of convertible loans approved\t27 May\t419\tn/a\tn/a\t31 May\t464\tn/a\tn/a\t7 June\t533\t53\t\u00a355.9m\t14 June\t577\t155\t\u00a3146.0m\t21 June\t623\t252\t\u00a3236.2m\t28 June\t674\t322\t\u00a3320.6m\t5 July\t722\t376\t\u00a3379.9m\t12 July\t750\t429\t\u00a3419.6m\t19 July\t781\t465\t\u00a3468.7m\t26 July\t816\t510\t\u00a3512.9m\t2 August\t839\t537\t\u00a3534.0m\t9 August\t868\t565\t\u00a3562.3m\t16 August\t902\t590\t\u00a3588.3m\t20 September\t1,072\t711\t\u00a3720.0m\t18 October\t1,243\t745\t\u00a3770.8m\t15 November\t1,325\t874\t\u00a3875.8m\t13 December\t1,432\t971\t\u00a3975.5m\t24 January\t1,925\t1,055\t\u00a31,066.6m\t21 February\t2,206\t1,140\t\u00a31,124.3mThe Future Fund closed on 31 January 2021 and is no longer accepting new applications. The scheme is still processing applications submitted prior to closure.Notes\tThe management information for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS is reported on behalf of accredited lenders. For Future Fund this is reported on behalf of the British Business Bank. HM Treasury accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of these figures.\tFigures for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS show cumulative applications and approvals up to close of business on 21 February 2021 by accredited lenders, as reported to HM Treasury by close of business 22 February 2021.\tA full list of accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS can be found here.\tManagement information (MI) are not classified as statistics. The MI in this release reflects timely information and do not suffer from lag effects. However, the trend from weekly figures may show some volatility. Moreover, these are initial figures which have not been rigorously quality assured and do not include data from all accredited lenders.\tUK Finance have also previously published MI on CBILS, but this only covers accredited lenders which are members of UK Finance. This data is available here.\tFuture Fund opened for applications on 20 May 2020. Provided that applicants provide the information required during the application process in a timely manner, it is expected that the process will take a minimum of 21 days from initial application to funding being made available. Convertible loans are reported as approved at the point the Convertible Loan Agreement document is issued by Future Fund for signature. The time to applicants subsequently receiving funds will depend on the speed with which they complete the documentation.\tThe Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code) is built around 3 main concepts, or pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. The following explains how we have applied the pillars of the Code in a proportionate way.\tTrustworthiness - the figures are based on management information supplied to HM Treasury by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund and represent their best estimates of the published totals. To support the management of departmental business, figures have been seen in advance by ministers and officials. This is in line with the Code, where pre-release access does not apply for releases based on routine management information \u2013 as covered in paragraph 3.6 of the National Statistician\u2019s guidance.\tQuality - the information presented is provided by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund based on their management information. Quality assurance processes are built in the design of the templates and the data production processes in the Treasury.\tValue - in publishing this data, we aim to support the information needs of society, parliamentarians and stakeholders. Business loan schemes are one part of the unprecedented support for public services, workers and businesses the Government has implemented to protect against the current economic emergency.See more statistics on coronavirus funding for businesses and self employed people here.
