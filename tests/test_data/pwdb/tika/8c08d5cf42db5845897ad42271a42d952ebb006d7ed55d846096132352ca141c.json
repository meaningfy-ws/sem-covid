(7) Upon submitting the written application referred to in  Paragraph six of this Section, one of the following  justifications for terminating the insurance contract shall be  indicated:  1) early termination of the insurance contract by receiving  back the portion of the deposited insurance premium according to  Section 10, Paragraph five, Clause 1 of the Compulsory Civil  Liability Insurance of Owners of Motor Vehicles Law;  2) early termination of the insurance contract without  receiving back the portion of the deposited insurance premium for  the remaining period from the day of terminating the contract  until the expiration of the insurance contract. After renewal of  the registration of a vehicle and when the insurer has received a  written application for the conclusion of a new insurance  contract for the terms of validity of an insurance contract  referred to in the Compulsory Civil Liability Insurance of Owners  of Motor Vehicles Law, the insurer shall issue a new insurance  contract, and the unused insurance premium shall be included into  the portion of insurance premium of such contract. In such case  the new insurance contract shall come into effect not later than  within three months after the end of the emergency situation.  (8) The owner of the vehicle or - where the vehicle has been  leased - the holder of the vehicle indicated in the vehicle  registration certificate (if it has concluded an appropriate  insurance contract) who is not referred to in Paragraph six of  this Section has the right to terminate an insurance contract and  to receive back the unused portion of insurance premium in  accordance with Section 10, Paragraphs two and three and  Paragraph five, Clause 1 of the Compulsory Civil Liability  Insurance of Owners of Motor Vehicles Law, provided that the  registration of a vehicle is temporarily suspended, handing over  the vehicle registration plates to the Road Traffic Safety  Directorate.

(2) If the vehicle operation tax has been paid in accordance  with Paragraph one of this Section, in the next calendar year the  vehicle operation tax shall be paid into the State budget for the  current calendar year, and for the previous calendar year in the  amount of 50 per cent.  (3) If the vehicle operation tax has been paid in accordance  with Paragraph one of this Section, the registration of a change  in owner, the registration of holder, and also the removal of a  vehicle from the register for alienation in Latvia or for the  bringing out of Latvia shall be performed by the Road Traffic  Safety Directorate if the tax for the previous period is paid in  full.  [28 May 2020]  Section 52. Property of a public person may be  transferred for use without compensation to the authority  involved in the epidemiological safety measures for the  containment of the spread and elimination of consequences of  COVID-19 for the duration of operation of this Law. The decision  on the transfer of a property of a public person for use without  compensation shall be taken by the institution of the public  person in whose possession the relevant property is. Property of  a public person shall be transferred for use without compensation  by a deed of acceptance and delivery. The institution of the  relevant public person has the right to control whether the  property transferred for use without compensation is used in  conformity with the purpose of its transfer.

Movable property (personal protective  equipment and disinfectants) of a public person may be  transferred into the ownership of the authority involved in the  epidemiological safety measures for the containment of the spread  and elimination of consequences of COVID-19 without compensation.  Permission to alienate a movable property of the State shall be  given by the authority stipulated by the Cabinet, whereas the  permission to alienate a movable property of a derived public  person shall be given by the decision-making authority of the  relevant derived public person, without clarifying the need of  the public person or its institutions for such property. The  movable property which is transferred according to the procedures  laid down in this Section, but has not been used for the  containment of the spread and elimination of consequences of  COVID-19 during the operation of this Law, shall be given back to  the relevant public person. If the movable property which is  transferred according to the procedures laid down in this Section  is used for performing economic activities, the conditions of  Section 29 of this Law shall be met. The abovementioned solution  applies also to the transfer of movable property (personal  protective equipment and disinfectants) of a public person  without compensation into the ownership of a religious  association (church) for implementing the epidemiological safety  measures.  [23 April 2020]  Section 54. Property of a public person which has been  transferred for use without compensation to the authority  involved in the epidemiological safety measures for the  containment of the spread and elimination of consequences of  COVID-19 or movable property (personal protective equipment and  disinfectants) of a public person which has been transferred  without compensation shall be regarded as a donation (gift) that  is exempted from the application of the enterprise income tax or  personal income tax. If the property of a public person which is  transferred according to the procedures laid down in this Section  is used for performing economic activities, the conditions of  Section 29 of this Law shall be met.
