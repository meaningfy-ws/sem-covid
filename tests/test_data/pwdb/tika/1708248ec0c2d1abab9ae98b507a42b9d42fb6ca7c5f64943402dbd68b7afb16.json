Such serial testing of workforces in the industry must be maintained if we are to minimise the occurrence of outbreaks at processing plants.\n\n\n\n\nIt must be remembered that with this virus, no one is safe until everybody is safe.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, MII said that the new code of conduct will formalise the existing suite of measures in place at meat plants.\u00a0\n\n\n    \n\n        #Open journalism\n\n        No news is bad news\n        Support The Journal\n        \n            Your contributions will help us continue\n            to deliver the stories that are important to you\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Support us now\n    \n\n\nIts director Cormac Healy said: \u201cWe are pleased to have worked with\u00a0Siptu to agree this set of safety protocols to protect employees in our sector. It formalises a wide range of measures that have already been put in place and will provide reassurance that the industry is 100% committed to taking all appropriate steps to mitigate the risk posed by Covid-19.\n\n\u201cThe sharp reduction in clusters in meat plants and the low rate of positive test incidence shown by the ongoing serial testing is indicative that the efforts being made are working. However, there is no room for complacency. Given the wider community trends in Covid-19 cases, continued vigilance and rigorous enforcement of mitigation measures and testing, track and trace is essential.\u201d\n\n\n            \n\n\n                        \n            \n                \n                TheJournal.ie's coronavirus newsletter cuts through the misinformation and noise with the clear facts you need to make informed choices.
