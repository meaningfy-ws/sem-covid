As part of these measures, the Revenue service operates a Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The scheme enables employees whose employers are affected by the pandemic to receive significant supports directly from their employer through the payroll system. The scheme is expected to last 12 weeks from 26 March 2020.\r\rThe scheme was introduced as part of the terms of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020.\r\rOn Wednesday 15 April, the Minister for Finance announced further updates to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. \r\rThe scheme was closed on the 31 of August and replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) read more on the [COVID-19 data base website](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/IE-2020-36_1157.html?utm_source=externalDashboard&utm_medium=powerbi&utm_campaign=covid-19)", "content_of_measure_description": "The Scheme is available to employers from all sectors (excluding the public service and non-commercial semi-state sector) whose business activities are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\rIt is open to employers who retain staff on payroll; some of the staff may be temporarily not working or some may be on reduced hours and/or reduced pay. Provided the employer meets certain conditions and, subject to the levels of pay made to employees, the employer may be eligible for the scheme for some, or all of its employees.\r\rThe employer includes the subsidy as part of the employees\u2019 wages in addition to any amount that the employer would otherwise be able to pay. The subsidy element on the employee\u2019s payslip is indicated as a payment described as 'GovCov19 WageSub'.  \r\r* A subsidy of 85% is payable for employees whose net weekly income does not exceed \u20ac412. \r* A subsidy of 70% is payable for those whose net weekly pay was previously no more than \u20ac500 but less than \u20ac586, with a cap of \u20ac410.\r\rTo qualify for the Scheme, employers must be experiencing significant negative economic disruption due to COVID-19, be able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of Revenue, a minimum of a 25% decline in turnover and be unable to pay normal wages and normal outgoings fully. They must also retain their employees on the payroll.\r\rThe scheme is confined to employees who were on the employer\u2019s payroll as at 29 February 2020, and for whom a payroll submission was made to Revenue in the period from 1 February 2020 to 15 March 2020.", "use_of_measure_description": "47,400 employers are registered with Revenue for the scheme.\r\rAccording to the minister responsible, on 29 April 2020, 'The cumulative value of payments made to employers under the scheme is \u20ac652 million, almost 400,000 employees have now received at least one payment under the scheme'. \r\rAccording to preliminary statistics from the Irish Revenue, to 21 May: \r \r* Over 55,500 employers registered with Revenue for the wage subsidy scheme.\r* Over 48,300 employers have already received subsidy payments.\r* Over 473,500 employees have already received at least one payment.\r\rUp to 5 June 2020, over 58,300 employers had registered for the TWSS and over \u20ac1.37 billion had been paid out. The scheme has supported over 514,700 employees who received at least one payment. The cost of the scheme is over \u20ac500 million per month according to the Department of Finance.\r\rAccording to data from the Central Bank: \u201cThe TWSS supported a cumulative 663,600 people since its inception accounting for, 28 per cent of employment (in Q1 2020). At its peak (end-April), the TWSS supported 425,000 workers, with approximately 340,000 still in receipt of subsidy payments at the closing of the scheme in September. Seventy per cent of supported workers had been availing of the scheme prior to 1 May. On average 58% of recipients were male, 77% were Irish nationals and 39% were aged under 34 years.\r\u201cAt end-August, three sectors \u2013 Accommodation and Food Services (24%), Wholesale and Retail Trade and Repairs (19), and Industry (10) \u2013 accounted for more than half of the TWSS recipients (Table 1). Within sectors, Accommodation/Food (54% of workers) and Retail (24) workers are particularly reliant on subsidies.\u201d\r\rAccording to the Irish Times: The employment wage subsidy scheme paid \u20ac1.4 billion to 39,800 employers in respect of 443,100 employees between September 2020 and January 2021.\r\rAccording to a paper by the Department of Social Protection: \u201cas at April 23rd, males accounted for 61.5 per cent of TWSS employees. The principal age cohorts were those aged between 30-39 years and 40-49 years representing 25.9 and 24.9 per cent of employees, respectively. Across all sectors, 84 per cent of employees are receiving a \u2018top up\u2019 from their employer; with the highest proportion of Page 17 employees receiving top ups being seen in the Utilities (93.4 per cent) and Finance and Insurance (93 per cent) sectors.14 Aside from activities of households as employers, the Accommodation and Food services sector sees the largest share of employees without a top up under TWSS, at 30.2 per cent.\u201d\r\u201cData from Revenue shows the scheme has predominantly been utilised by smaller firms; 66 per cent of enrolled firms employ fewer than 10 workers, although these firms account for less than 22 per cent of all employees on the scheme\u2026 Meanwhile, the share of employers using the scheme is heavily weighted towards smaller firms; with over 80 per cent of employers availing of the TWSS seen in firms with less than 20 workers.\u201d", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "Social partners were consulted.

Today, Revenue has generated further payments to employers under the scheme of \u20ac52.2 million, these payments will be in the bank accounts of the majority of employers tomorrow.A subsidy of 85% is payable for employees whose net weekly income does not exceed \u20ac412.\u00a0A subsidy of 70% is payable by the State for those whose net weekly pay was previously no more than \u20ac500 but less than \u20ac586, with a cap of \u20ac410.Social distancingCanavan also provided an update on the State\u2019s monitoring of people\u2019s adherence to social distancing measures, saying that \u201cthe majority of people are complying with legislation\u201d.The official added that garda\u00ed have only been using emergency powers for enforcement \u201cas a last resort\u201d.\u00a0Enforcement powers under new regulations introduced during this crisis, have been used at 76 occasions between the 8 April, and the 25 April. All of these matters are referred to Director of Public Prosecutions for an independent decision on prosecution and a number have already appeared before the courts. An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na continue to use other relevant criminal legislative powers on that\u2019s more appropriate.Canavan also said that Dublin Bus has provided the government with an update on passenger numbers. These figures showed 57,858 journeys on Monday and 57,700 on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cTuesday\u2019s figure represents a 3.5% increase on the three-week average of 55,800. It\u2019s important to note that strict social distancing provisions are in place on double numbers,\u201d Canavan said.Hospital attendanceThe official also made anotehr plea to people not to avoid hospitals or GPs if they are in need of medical attention.\u00a0\u201cWe have seen an increase in the number of people attending appointments. But again, I want to reiterate that it\u2019s vital to still attend the hospitals, as you\u2019re being directed, and to call emergency services in the event of incidents such as a heart attack or stroke.The HSE have a reg have a regularly updated list on the website of every hospital, and any disruptions or changes they have had to make to normal operations in light of Covid-19, such as visitor restrictions and outpatient appointments, unless you\u2019ve been told otherwise normal services for patients are still available in hospitals.\u201d                                                                                                                                                Short URL                                                                \tTweet this\tShare on Facebook\tEmail this article\t\u00a0                                                                About the author:                                                                                                                                                                                                        About the author                                                                        R\u00f3n\u00e1n Duffy                                                                                                                                                                                        @ronanduffy_                                                                                                                                                                                        ronan@thejournal.ie                                                                                                                                    See more articles by R\u00f3n\u00e1n Duffy                                                                                        Contribute to this story:                                                                                        Leave a Comment                                                                                        Send a Correction                                                                            Read next:                Embed this post            To embed this post, copy the code below on your site                            600px wide                <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/wage-subsidy-covid-19-5086879-Apr2020/?embedpost=5086879&width=600&height=460\" ></iframe>                                        400px wide                <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/wage-subsidy-covid-19-5086879-Apr2020/?embedpost=5086879&width=400&height=460\" ></iframe>                                        300px wide                <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/wage-subsidy-covid-19-5086879-Apr2020/?embedpost=5086879&width=300&height=460\" ></iframe>                                                        Email \u201cCovid-19: Over \u20ac650 million now given to businesses to keep people employed \u201d.

Paschal Donohoe, the Minister for Finance, has announced that he has tweaked the temporary wage subsidy scheme (TWSS), which covers up to 85 per cent of an employee\u2019s wages up to \u20ac410 per week, to fix an anomaly that emerged that excluded returning mothers and people on adoptive leave.                                                        The change will be legislated for later in the year \u201cas part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process\u201d. In the meantime, he said, Revenue has agreed to implement it and it will be backdated to March 26th.                                                        The anomaly arose because the scheme, brought in to encourage employers to keep staff on their books who might otherwise have been laid off, required qualifying workers to have been on the payroll of their employer on February 29th, or to have been been paid in either January or February.                                                                                                                                                            \t                                                                                    Ardagh confirms plan to list $8.5bn drink cans unit                                                                            \t                                                                                    Household income would have fallen by 20% without Covid supports, study shows                                                                            \t                                                                                    All is calm in Christmas sales, as retailers say rules lack clarity                                                                                                                                                                                                          \tInside Business with Ciar\u00e1n Hancock \u00b7 Michael Smurfit on his life in business, The K Club years and criticism of lockdown \"panic\"                                                                      Mothers on maternity leave who subsequently returned to the workforce did not qualify under the old criteria. This lead to heavy criticism of the Government from women\u2019s advocacy groups and opposition politicians, who said mothers or parents who adopted were being discriminated against.                                                        \u201cThe Cabinet today agreed an important change to the scheme to ensure that workers are not denied access to us because of the personal circumstances, relating to maternity leave,\u201d Mr Donohoe said.                                                        \u201cThe government is making this important change, because we want to ensure that citizens are not denied access to the scheme, because of their personal circumstances,\u201d he said.                                                        \u201cI am satisfied that this change addresses the anomaly and ensures appropriate operation of the TWSS in recognition of the unique circumstances applying to those returning to work after a period of maternity or adoptive leave.\u201d                                                                                                                                                The latest figures from Revenue, two weeks ago, showed that \u20ac936 million had already been paid out by the State under the scheme.                                                        Mr Donohoe said that he and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had spoken about the scheme and the likelihood of extending it. He said it would be a \u201chollow\u201d victory if the Government ended the scheme and those who had relied on it lost their jobs because their employers could no longer stay in business. He indicated his department would begin an in-depth look at the scheme on a sector-by-sector basis to ensure that those employers and employees who will continue to rely on the scheme in order to survive will continue to receive it.                                                                                                                                          \tBusiness TodayGet the latest business news and commentarySIGN UP HERE                                           \t\t\t                                                                                                                                                                         \tTopics:\t                Work            \t                Paschal Donohoe                                                                            Read More                \t                    Some 55,000 homeowners behind with mortgage repayments in September                                    \t                    Irish consumers believe worst of pandemic \u2018firmly behind them\u2019                                    \t                    Post-Covid spending \u2018may not occur\u2019 in hardest hit sectors                                    \t                    Pilita Clark: Do not knock virtual Christmas parties until you try one                                    \t                    ECB boosts economic stimulus package as Covid-19 hits recovery                                                                                            \t                    Staff fear working remotely will damage career prospects \u2013 survey                                    \t                    \u20ac8.9bn hole in public finances as second lockdown hits tax take                                    \t                    AIB: \u2018Near-term outlook more clouded than medium-term\u2019                                    \t                    Britain is certainly not leading the fight against Covid-19                                    \t                    Retailers need to find their \u2018theatre\u2019 for town centres to survive                                    \t                    Dromoland Castle loses \u20ac50,000 in bookings in 48 hours over Covid rules                                    \t                    Pandemic brings a halt to Zara-owner\u2019s Irish expansion                                    \t                    A tale of two pandemics for Smurfit Kappa and Greencore                                    \t                    Central Bank rules out changes to mortgage rules during pandemic                                    \t                    Retail sales up 8.1% in October compared to last year                                    \t                    Pandemic supports will be removed once effective vaccine is rolled out, Government warns                                    \t                    Cabinet extends suspension of right of laid-off workers to seek redundancy                                    \t                    Covid-19 to exacerbate State\u2019s housing woes                                    \t                    Chris Johns: I think we are on the cusp of an economic boom                                    \t                    Europe needs to tackle economic fallout of Covid hard and fast                                    \t                    Covid-19 will worsen housing affordability, report warns                                    \t                    Stalled progress suggests Varadkar was right in Claire Byrne interview                                    \t                    Oxford Covid-19 vaccine shows promise among over 70s in trials                                    \t                    Hoteliers call for indoor dining and lifting of travel limits                                    \t                    Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is 95% effective with no serious side effects                                    \t                    Coronavirus: Moderna vaccine 94.5% effective according to early trials data                                    \t                    Think a vaccine will nuke Covid?

2020                        Ibec, the group that represents Irish business, has welcomed the announcement from Government today of the acceleration of the Covid roadmap, as well as the extension of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). The group added that as business reopens, we must prioritise the safety of our workforce, customers and suppliers and remain vigilant on Covid.\u00a0\u00a0Ibec CEO Danny McCoy said: \u201cAs Ibec has previously stated, the length of the lockdown in Ireland will help determine the scale of the fall in economic activity. Today\u2019s announcement from An Taoiseach of an acceleration of the roadmap phasing, particularly in relation to hospitality and retail, is a positive and sensible response.\u00a0\u201cThe extension of the TWSS scheme until August will provide confidence to employers and employees, helping vulnerable firms to stay afloat and keeping their employees engaged whilst protecting the incomes of individuals.\u00a0\u201cThe health of the public and the workforce remains a primary concern for all stakeholders. The Return to Work Safely Protocol must continue to underpin how we now live and work with Covid, ensuring that the safety and well-being of people at work can be securely managed as we begin to reopen our economy.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                      See all News                                                                                                                           Personal injury awards reforms do not go far enough but are a step in right direction                                            March 07, 2021                                                                                                                                                                               National Accounts demonstrate the K-shaped nature of the Irish economy                                            March 05, 2021                                                                                                                                                                               Irish manufacturing generates 30,000 jobs and stands out in Europe with 5.4% export growth                                             March 04, 2021                                                        See all News                            Featured Events / upcoming events                                            See all Events                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Webinar:  Addressing the practical implications of remote and hybrid working                                                                    March 09, 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Ibec Networks HR Forum                                                                    March 10, 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Ibec Engineering Network CEO Quarterly Forum                                                                    March 11, 2021                                                                                                                                                        See all Events                                                                                        Our networks / Ibec Trade Associations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Careers                Careers and Life at Ibec        Working in Ibec                                    Relevant Links                Join Ibec        About Ibec        Ibec Campaigns        Ibec Trade Associations & Networks        HR Management Guide        Ibec Management Training        Online SEPA DD Mandate form        Events        The KeepWell Mark                                    Other links                Ibec membership contract        Privacy Statement        Cookie Policy        Cookie Settings        GDPR        Ibec rules                  Contact usDublin Office84/86 Lower Baggot StreetDublin 2, Ireland\u00a0D02 H720+353 (01) 605 1500info@ibec.ieOther OfficesSign up to Newsletter        \u00a9Ibec, 2021    Ibec clg is registered in Ireland.

Excluding them from coverage was unacceptable to ICTU and in direct conflict with the spirit of the TWSS and the provisions in employment equality legislation.\u201d\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Twitter\t Facebook\t Youtube\t Flickr\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn Now\t\t\t\t\tConference is now over.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComing up\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConference is now over.\t\t\t\t\t\tClick here for motions.\t\t\t\t\t\tClick here for keynote speeches.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBDC 2019 Agenda\tCongress Constitution & Standing Orders\tReport of Proceedings BDC 2017 (Belfast)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Congress of Trade Unions\t\t\t\t31/32 Parnell Square\t\t\t\tDublin 1\t\t\t\tIreland\t+353 1 8897777\tcongress@ictu.ie\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland Committee\t\t\t\t45-47 Donegall Street\t\t\t\tBelfast BT1 2FG,\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland\t02890 247940\tinfo@ictuni.org\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tDigital Revolutionaries\t     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}, {"url": "https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/publications/economic-letters/vol-2020-no.11-wage-subsidies-and-job-retention-keenan-and-lydon.pdf?sfvrsn=23", "title": "Wage subsidies and job\rretention ", "failure_reason": "HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.centralbank.ie', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /docs/default-source/publications/economic-letters/vol-2020-no.11-wage-subsidies-and-job-retention-keenan-and-lydon.pdf?sfvrsn=23 (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(\"bad handshake: Error([('SSL routines', 'tls_process_server_certificate', 'certificate verify failed')])\")))"}, {"url": "https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/8f021-government-extends-subsidy-rates-for-the-employment-wage-subsidy-scheme-until-march-31st/", "title": "Government extends subsidy rates for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme until March 31st", "content_path": "res/c526a1cf97fda14dce2429d897fa84b0f236b9e3a5ed8aea2b9509f221e597c6", "content": "gov.ie - Government extends subsidy rates for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme until March 31st                Skip to main content                                                Toggle main navigation                                                                                                                Main navigation                        \tDepartments\tConsultations\tPublications\tPolicies\t                                    \t                                            Languages                                         \t                                                                    English                                    (current)                                                            \t                                                                    Gaeilge                                                                                                                                    \t                                                                                                \t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Press release                            Government extends subsidy rates for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme until March 31st                        From                    Department of Finance\u00a0                                                                                        Published on 6 January 2021                                                                    Last updated on 6 January 2021                                                            \u00a0                                                                                                                        The Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, T.D., has today (Wednesday) announced that the current rates of subsidy provided by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) will remain in place until 31 March 2021, aligned with the extension of the rates of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Both measures were agreed at Government today.                The EWSS is a key component of the Government\u2019s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis and by maintaining the current rates the Government is ensuring that the EWSS remains a strong incentive for employers and workers to maintain their relationship through the current challenging period.                Speaking following today\u2019s Government meeting, Minister Donohoe said:                            \u201cThe Government have agreed that additional public health restrictions will be in place for the coming weeks \u2013 but it is important that employers have the option of retaining their staff so that they may respond and recover quickly when these temporary restrictions are lifted.                                    That is why the EWSS has been central to the Government\u2019s response with nearly \u20ac4.5 billion worth of payments having been made via wage subsidies to sustain businesses and help people to manage financially in the midst of these very challenging times.                                    These measures have been put in place to help otherwise viable businesses who continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and I would encourage all eligible firms to apply for the schemes.\u201d                        ENDS                Notes to Editors                The rates of subsidy that will continue to apply until 31 March 2021 are set out as follows:                            \tGross Weekly pay\tRate of Subsidy to employer\tLess than \u20ac151.50\tNil\t\u20ac151.50 \u2013 \u20ac202.99\t\u20ac203\t\u20ac203 - \u20ac299.99\t\u20ac250\t\u20ac300 - \u20ac399.99\t\u20ac300\t\u20ac400 - \u20ac1,462\t\u20ac350\tOver \u20ac1,462\tNil\t\u00a0                        The estimated cost of the above is an additional \u20ac38 million per week, or an additional \u20ac323 million in total by the end of March 2021.

On Tuesday the exchequer figures showed that the pandemic had punched a \u20ac21 billion hole in the public finances. Remarkably (given that the jobless rate is running at 20.4 per cent) income tax receipts were down only 1 per cent.                                                         Fortunately, we are able to borrow at negative rates from bond investors \u2013 the National Treasury Management Agency raised \u20ac5.5 billion this week \u2013 to help keep the show on the road, but the tab will have to be picked up by future generations.

This was replaced by the employment wage subsidy scheme, with \u20ac1.4 billion paid to 39,800 employers in respect of 443,100 employees.                                                        The Covid restrictions support scheme, introduced in the budget to support businesses significantly affected by the lockdown restrictions, has seen \u20ac146 million paid out to 16,600 companies.                                                        And 70,000 businesses availed of the debt warehousing scheme, which allows Revenue to park VAT and payroll tax debt arising from the Covid restrictions. Some \u20ac1.9 billion of tax debt was warehoused last year, a cost that will have to be met by those businesses down the road.                                                         Perhaps more importantly, given that we are a small open economy heavily reliant on exports, was the warning that global investment flows are likely to be significantly curtailed in 2021 because of the ongoing impact of the pandemic and having to fight for \u201ca much smaller pool\u201d of activity. IDA chief executive Martin Shanahan outlined how the full impact of this was still to play out.                                                                                                                                                 Thankfully, there is light at the end of the tunnel with the rollout of vaccines globally. Yet, in economic terms, it\u2019s hard not to feel that this period is merely the calm before the storm and that once the various government supports begin to be removed, many businesses simply won\u2019t be able to survive.                                                                                                                                           \tNews DigestsStay on top of the latest newsSIGN UP HERE                                           \t\t\t                                                                                                                                                                         \tTopics:\t                Cantillon            \t                Coronavirus            \t                Brexit            \t                Martin Shanahan            \t                IDA Ireland            \t                National Treasury Management Agency                                                                            Read More                \t                    Immunity from Covid-19 lasts up to six months after infection \u2013 Hiqa                                    \t                    Cold and flu remedy sales dip 55% on social distancing                                    \t                    HSE to contact high-risk patients about vaccine, says chief clinical officer                                    \t                    Vending machines help ease access to Covid-19 tests in Japan                                    \t                    \u2018My 14-year-old son seems obsessed with boxing, and I don\u2019t like the sport\u2019                                                                                            \t                    When \u2013 or will \u2013 life ever go back to normal?

The Working Paper was prepared by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in collaboration with the Central Bank of Ireland for consideration by the Labour Market Advisory Council.                                 The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the essential public health measures to contain the spread of the virus, saw the largest monthly increase in the unemployment rate in the history of the State.                Currently, more than 1.1 million people are in receipt of social welfare unemployment supports which comprises:                \tpeople on the Live Register\tpeople receiving the newly introduced COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP)\temployers availing of the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)                                 Minister Doherty emphasised:                            \u201cThese income supports were rolled out in a very short period of time and have proven to be effective in insulating people from the worst effects of a severe income and employment shock. Now, as the numbers receiving payments begins to plateau, we need to start looking at how we get people back to work and concentrate on post-pandemic planning. Today\u2019s research is part of that work.\u201d                        Minister Doherty outlined the purpose of the Working Paper:                            \u201cEssentially, the Working Paper uses Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection administrative data to examine disruptions to Ireland\u2019s labour market \u2013 including the flows into unemployment \u2013 in the weeks since the initial outbreak of the virus in Europe.                                    \u201cIt sheds light on the profile and characteristics of those who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic and associated restrictions. The demographic and earnings profile of the sectors experiencing the largest share of COVID-19 related unemployment, as well as the financial position of households in the most affected sectors, is also investigated.\u201d                        On the basis of jobs lost (or displaced), the most severely impacted sectors are Tourism, Hospitality and Food Services; Retail; and Construction.                 Those who have lost their jobs as a result of the impact of COVID-19 are more likely to be young, low-skilled, female and previously in part-time employment. This reflects the higher share of these workers in the industry sectors most affected (Retail and Hospitality).                                 An examination of the financial position of households of those previously employed in sectors where the fall in employment has been 25 per cent or more has found that these households have very little savings or income put by to mitigate against economic shocks or financial hardship.                                 Minister Doherty commented:                            \u201cThe valuable work of the Labour Market Advisory Council and the findings of today\u2019s Working Paper will help inform this Department and the Government for the post-pandemic recovery period, to ensure that Ireland\u2019s labour market will recover quickly and that the thousands of workers displaced can return to work as quickly as possible.\u201d                        The Working Paper on the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Ireland\u2019s labour market can be viewed here:                                                        The Initial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Ireland's Labour Market                        Download                                         ENDS                                                        Notes to the Editor:                        The role of the Labour Market Advisory Council is to provide advice to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the government on labour force participation rates, minimising unemployment levels and reducing average unemployment durations.                                 The Council will publish its findings on a periodic basis and against the ongoing backdrop of the COVID-19 emergency will now also advise on the wider labour market and employment policy challenges that face the Irish economy in the post-pandemic recovery period.
