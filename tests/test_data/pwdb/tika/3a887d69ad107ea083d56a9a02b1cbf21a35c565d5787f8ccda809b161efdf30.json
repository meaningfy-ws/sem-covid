The moratorium is for credit facilities sanctioned prior to 1 March 2020 and is applicable to individuals, households and businesses who can show that COVID-19 had a negative impact upon them. The six-month moratoria period starts from the date of approval of the application.

After recovering somewhat in September, the European Commission\u2019s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) fell again in Octo-ber, standing slightly above its August level yet well below the level recorded before the onset of COVID-19. The latest deterioration occurred amid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Confidence fell sharply in the services sector and, to a more limited extent, in the construction sector and among consumers. These developments offset improved sentiment in industry and among retail-ers. Sentiment remained negative in all sectors. In September, the volume of retail trade and industrial production contracted again in annual terms. The number of registered unemployed and the unemployment rate fell when compared with a month earlier, with the latter remaining low from a historical perspective. The annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) eased to 0.5% in September, from 0.7% in August, while inflation based on the Retail Price Index (RPI) edged down to 0.2% from 0.4% over the same period. Maltese residents\u2019 deposits grew at a slightly slower annual rate of 5.8% over the year to September, while annual growth in credit to Maltese residents rose to 11.2%. In September, the deficit on the cash-based Consolidated Fund widened when compared with a year earlier, reflecting the impact on revenue from lower economic activity due to the global spread of COVID-19, and the impact of ongoing government support measures to mitigate the eco-nomic effects of the pandemic.Central Bank\u2019s BCI2In October, the Bank\u2019s BCI stood at -3.7 \u2013 unchanged from the updated value for Septem-ber (see Chart 1). The BCI sig-nalled low levels of economic activity, reflecting the contin-ued weak economic environ-ment triggered by COVID-19, although recent readings are higher than the lowest readings 1   The cut-off date for information in this note is 10 November 2020. Most of the data reported in this issue of the Economic Update refer to September 2020, and thus reflect the effects of the lifting of restrictive measures related to COVID-19, as from May. Data for the BCI and the ESI are for October 2020. As from 19 August, some containment measures were re-introduced following a resurgence of infections, affecting predominantly the entertainment sector. Tourism data for April, May and June have not been collected by the National Statistics Office (NSO) as airports and ports were closed in those months. Inbound tourism data for July were collected and published as the airport and seaport were reopened. With effect from 22 August, an amber list was added to the red and green travel lists, requiring tourists arriving from countries on this list to present a negative COVID-19 test result before boarding.2   The methodology underlying the BCI can be found here. A zero value of the BCI is consistent with average business conditions, which in the case of Malta tends to be consistent with a real GDP growth rate of close to 4%. When the value of the BCI falls repeatedly below -1, economic activity would be significantly below normal. From June 2020, the BCI methodology was updated to include a new variable: monthly development permits.-4.5-4.0-3.5-3.0-2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.0J2014MM J S N J2015MM J S N J2016MM J S N J2017MM J S N J2018MM J S N J2019MM J S N J2020MM J SBCI 1 standard deviation \u2013 upper range1 standard deviation \u2013 lower range 2009 averageChart 1BCI(standardised)Source: Central Bank of Malta.https://www.centralbankmalta.org/business-conditions-indexCENTRAL BANK OF MALTA Economic Update 11/20204estimate seen in May and June. The index continued to be affected by strong negative outturns in almost all variables, especially year-on-year decreases in inbound tourists and economic senti-ment, as well as higher unemployment, compared to a year earlier. Overall business conditions were worse than those observed during 2009, indicating the higher severity of the pandemic rela-tive to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. Business and consumer confidence indicators In October, the European Commission\u2019s ESI fell to 77.7, from 83.9 in September (see Table 1). Following this decline, sentiment stood below the 104.0 recorded a year earlier and its long-run average.3,4 The ESI also stood 13.2 points lower than that in the euro area. The month-on-month decrease in sentiment was largely driven by a significant decline in con-fidence in the services sector. Sentiment also decreased slightly in the construction sector and among consumers. These developments offset improved sentiment in industry and among retailers. 3  The ESI summarises developments in confidence in five surveyed sectors: industry, services, construction, retail and consumers. Weights are assigned as follows: industry 40%, services 30%, consumers 20%, construction 5% and retail trade 5%. 4  Long-term averages are calculated over the entire period for which data are available. For the consumer and industrial confidence indi-cators, data became available in December 2002, while the services and construction confidence indicator data became available in May 2007 and May 2008, respectively. The long-term average of the retail confidence indicator is calculated as from May 2011, when it was first published. However, the long-term average of the ESI is computed from December 2002.Table 1BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SURVEYSBalances; percentage points; seasonally adjusted 2018 2019Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr.

By contrast, the contributions of industry and the retail sector were less negative than a month earlier. Meanwhile, the contribution from consumers and the construction sector were broadly unchanged. In October, sentiment within the services sector decreased to -32.3, from -3.5 a month earlier. Following this decline, sentiment fell further below its long-term average of 20.0.5 The fall in senti-ment was largely driven by respondents\u2019 assessment of demand and, to a lesser extent, of the business situation over the past three months. Participants\u2019 expectations of demand also weak-ened in the month under review. Additional survey data show that the share of firms anticipating prices to fall in the months ahead more than doubled when compared with September. Confidence in the construction sector decreased to -4.9, from -3.0 in September. Notwithstand-ing this decline, sentiment remained above its long-term average of -11.6.6 Weaker sentiment was entirely due to falling orders. By contrast, employment expectations were less negative than before. Supplementary data indicate that a smaller share of respondents expected falling prices over the next three months.Consumer confidence also edged down in October. It stood at -9.4, marginally below the -9.1 recorded in September, yet still above its long-term average of -11.2.7 The recent decline in sen-timent largely reflected a weaker assessment of the financial situation over the last 12 months. Consumers\u2019 expectations of major purchases, as well as expectations of the general economic situation over subsequent months, eased marginally. Meanwhile, their assessment of the financial situation over the next 12 months improved. Additional survey data show that price expectations were more negative in October. At the same time, the share of respondents anticipating unem-ployment to rise in the coming months decreased marginally. By contrast, industrial confi-dence rose to -10.3 in October, from -13.2 a month earlier.8 5   The services confidence indicator is the arithmetic average of the seasonally-adjusted balances (in percentage points) of replies to survey questions relating to the business climate, the evolution of demand in the previous three months and demand expectations in the subsequent three months.6   The construction confidence indicator is the arithmetic average of the seasonally-adjusted balances (in percentage points) of replies to two survey questions, namely those relating to order books and employment expectations over the subsequent three months.7   The consumer confidence indicator is the arithmetic average of the seasonally-adjusted balances (in percentage points) of replies to a subset of survey questions relating to households\u2019 assessment and expectations of their financial situation, their expectations about the general economic situation and their intention to make major purchases over the subsequent 12 months. The computation of this indicator was changed as reflected in the January 2019 release of the European Commission.8   The industrial confidence indicator is the arithmetic average of the seasonally-adjusted balances (in percentage points) of replies to a subset of survey questions relating to expectations about production over the subsequent three months, to current levels of order books and to stocks of finished goods. -25-20-15-10-505September October September OctoberESI EEIConsumers Construction Retail Services Industry Confidence indicator(1) Demeaned data are based on the standardised equivalent of the balance statistics reported by the European Commission Each standardised component is weighted and re-aggregated into a demeaned ESI (or EEI).

Chart 2                                        ESI and EEI (seasonally adjusted; demeaned)1Sources: European Commission; Central Bank of Malta workings. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/esi_2019_01_en.pdfCENTRAL BANK OF MALTA Economic Update 11/20206Notwithstanding this increase, sentiment remained below its long-term average of -4.2. The recent increase in sentiment was mainly driven by firms\u2019 assessment of order book levels and improved production expectations. By contrast, a larger share of participants reported above normal stock levels, relative to September. Supplementary data show that, on balance, a smaller share of respondents anticipated a fall in selling prices in the coming months. Similarly, confidence within the retail sector rose to -42.7, from -63.7 in the previous month.9 In the month under review, respondents reported below normal stock levels relative to September.10 At the same time, retailers\u2019 expectations of business activity over the next three months and their assessment about sales over previous months improved. Additional survey data indicate that price expectations were more positive in October. The European Commission\u2019s Employment Expectations Indicator (EEI) \u2013 which is a composite indicator of employment expectations in industry, services, retail trade and construction \u2013 edged up in October.11 The EEI rose to 85.4, from 79.7 in September. Notwithstanding this increase, the indicator remained below its long-run average of around 100.0. Moreover, in October, Malta\u2019s EEI stood 4.4 points below the euro area average. Employment prospects improved in all sectors bar in the retail sector. The increase relative to September was largely driven by industry and services and, to a smaller extent, by the construction sector. The evolution of sentiment in the services sector and the retail sector largely explains why the overall EEI has remained below its long-term average in October, though sentiment also remained below its long-term average in the construction sector (see Chart 2).Activity indicatorsIn September, annual growth in the index of industrial production \u2013 which is a measure of eco-nomic activity in the quarrying, manufacturing and energy sectors \u2013 remained negative for the sixth consecutive month. The index fell by 3.2% in annual terms, following a contraction of 3.4% in August (see Table 2).12 The latest decline largely reflected a fall in output by firms in the \u2018other manufacturing\u2019 sector, which includes firms involved in the production of medical and dental instruments, toys and related prod-ucts, followed by those involved in the repair and installation of machinery and equipment. Firms that manufacture beverages also contributed significantly to the decline. Other drivers behind the fall in output include firms producing rubber and plastic goods as well those specialising in food prod-ucts. On the other hand, production rose among firms engaged in the production of pharmaceutical goods, as well as those producing motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers. Higher manufacturing 9  The retail confidence indicator is the arithmetic average of the seasonally-adjusted balances (in percentage points) of replies to survey questions relating to the present and future business situation and stock levels. 10  Above normal stocks of finished goods have a negative effect on the overall indicator. Thus, a rise in the balance of firms reporting above normal stock levels has a negative effect on the overall indicator.11  The EEI is based on question 7 of the industry survey, question 5 of the services and retail trade surveys and question 4 of the construc-tion survey, which gauge the respondent firms\u2019 expectations as regards changes in their total employment over the next three months. Before being summarised in one composite indicator, each balance series is weighted on the basis of the respective sector\u2019s importance in overall employment. The weights are applied to the four balance series expressed in standardised form. Further information on the compilation of the EEI is available in: European Commission. (2020), The Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys User Guide.12  The annual growth rates of the overall industrial production index are based on working-day adjusted data. Unadjusted data, however, are used for the components. CENTRAL BANK OF MALTA Economic Update 11/20207output was also recorded among firms involved in the production of computer, electronic and optical products as well as those engaged in printing and reproduction of recorded media.Meanwhile, production in the energy sector increased. In September, development permits for commercial buildings rose by 6.7% in annual terms, the first annual increase in over a year. Conversely, residential permits in September contracted by 61.5% in annual terms, following an increase in the previous month.The volume of retail trade, which is a short-term indicator of final domestic demand, contracted for the seventh consecutive time, with September\u2019s fall stronger than that recorded in the previous month. It declined by an annual rate of 12.2%, following a fall of 7.8% in August. The number of tourist arrivals, nights stayed and expenditure remained substantially below those recorded in 2019, as a result of quarantine and travel restrictions. September data also show that the modest improvement recorded in August \u2013 in the form of a weakening contraction \u2013 was reversed. The number of inbound tourists declined by 82.4%, while the nights stayed decreased by 77.4% on a year earlier. Furthermore, tourist spending in Malta decreased by 84.5% in annual terms.Customs data show that the merchandise trade deficit stood at \u20ac131.8 million in September, down from \u20ac323.1 million a year earlier. The smaller deficit reflected a \u20ac262.1 million fall in imports, which offset a \u20ac70.7 million decline in exports (see Chart 3). Lower imports continued to be observed across most categories. However, the fall in imports mostly reflected a signifi-cantly lower fuel import bill and substantial decreases in registrations of aircraft and sea vessels. Lower imports of organic chemicals, electrical machinery and of \u2018machinery and mechanical appliances\u2019 also contributed. These more than outweighed higher imports of fish and pharma-ceutical products.

Together these offset a rise in exports of organic chem-icals, optical and related instru-ments, and printed material.In the nine months to Septem-ber, the visible trade gap nar-rowed to \u20ac1,880.1 million from \u20ac3,192.0 million in the corre-sponding period of 2019, driven by a sharp fall in imports, which outweighed the drop in exports (see Chart 4).Labour market Jobsplus data show that the number of persons on the unemployment register stood at 3,385 in September, down from 3,672 in August but higher than the 1,668 registered a year earlier (see Chart 5). The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate stood at 4.0% in September, marginally lower than the 4.1% registered in the previous month, but still higher than the rate of 3.6% registered in the same month of the preceding year.Prices, costs and competitivenessAnnual HICP inflation stood at 0.5% in September, down from 0.7% in August (see Chart 6).

Conversely, services inflation picked up in September, due to higher trans-port prices. Meanwhile, energy inflation remained negative but unchanged from the previous month, which reflects a base effect corresponding to the same period of the previous year.Annual RPI inflation declined to 0.2% in September, from 0.4% in August (see Chart 6).13 This was driven by lower food and clothing and footwear inflation as well as further price reductions in household equipment and maintenance, and recreation and culture. These were partially offset by higher prices in housing and, to a lesser extent, in transport.Producer output inflation, measured by the producer price index, turned negative to -1.0% in Sep-tember, from 0.5% in August.14 This reflected a strong contraction in intermediate goods prices, as well as lower inflation in producer prices of consumer and capital goods. Energy inflation remained nil.Malta\u2019s nominal harmonised competitiveness indicator (HCI) increased by 3.3% in the year to September.15 This suggests a continued deterioration in the country\u2019s international competitive-ness due to an appreciation in the euro exchange rate against currencies of trading partners. The real HCI, which also takes into account relative price changes, rose by 2.9%, suggesting that favourable developments in relative prices vis-\u00e0-vis trading partners help offset unfavourable exchange rate movements.Public finance In September 2020, the Consolidated Fund recorded a deficit of \u20ac52.8 million, an increase of \u20ac6.7 million when compared to the \u20ac46.1 million deficit registered in September 2019. This was a result of a rise in government expenditure, which more than offset an increase in government revenue for the period (see Table 3). In turn, the primary balance registered a deficit of \u20ac35.5 mil-lion, higher than the \u20ac25.5 million primary deficit registered in September 2019.13  The RPI and the HICP both measure changes in consumer prices but through different methodologies. The HICP index weights are based on total expenditure in Malta, including that by tourists. In contrast, RPI weights only take into account expenditure by Maltese households.14  The Industrial Producer Price Index measures the prices of goods at the factory gate and is commonly used to monitor inflationary pressures at the production stage.15  HCIs act as an effective exchange rate measure for countries operating within the euro area monetary union. The nominal HCI tracks movements in the euro exchange rate against the currencies of Malta\u2019s main trading partners, weighted according to the direction of trade in manufactured goods. On top of this, the real HCI also takes into account the relative inflation rate of Malta vis-\u00e0-vis its main trading partners. A higher (or lower) score in the HCI indicates a deterioration (or improvement) in Malta\u2019s international price competitiveness.0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0J2016FMAMJ J ASOND J2017FMAMJ J ASOND J2018FMAMJ J ASOND J2019FMAMJ JASOND J2020FMAMJ JASHICP RPIChart 6HICP AND RPI INFLATION RATES IN MALTA (annual percentage changes)Source: National Statistics Office.CENTRAL BANK OF MALTA Economic Update 11/202010These developments reflect the impact on revenue of the slowdown in economic activity due to the global spread of COVID-19, as well as ongoing government support aimed at mitigating the economic effects of this pandemic.Government revenue increased by \u20ac36.7 million, or 10.8% in annual terms. This is the first annual increase registered since February and is driven by higher tax revenue. The latter mainly reflects a \u20ac40.4 million increase in indirect tax revenue, due to higher inflows from VAT and the timing of receipt of customs and excise duties. At the same time, revenue from direct taxes increased by \u20ac11.6 million, chiefly due to a rise in income tax receipts. On the other hand, inflows from non-tax revenue declined by \u20ac15.4 million, due to lower inflows from dividends on investments and fees of office. The improvement in tax revenue suggests that economic activity has started to gradu-ally pick up. In addition, repayment of tax dues under the tax deferral scheme, which expired in August 2020, may have also impacted revenue positively. Government expenditure increased by \u20ac43.4 million, or 11.2% when compared to the corresponding period of 2019. This was driven by an increase in capital expenditure. This increased by \u20ac44.9 million largely due to a higher subvention to Malta Enterprise to finance the COVID-19 Wage Supplement Scheme. On the other hand, recurrent spending fell slightly by \u20ac1.5 million. Outlays on programmes and initiatives increased by \u20ac29.2 million on the back of higher payments related to COVID-19 measures, in particular the voucher scheme. This was largely offset by a drop in contribution to entities, reflecting the timing of transfers to the University of Malta.

This was mainly due to higher outstanding Malta Government Stocks, which more than offset a decline in outstand-ing Treasury Bills.Deposits, credit and financial markets In September, residents\u2019 depos-its held with monetary financial institutions (MFI) and form-ing part of broad money (M3) expanded at an annual rate of 5.8%, down from 6.6% in August (see Chart 8). Overnight deposits remained the largest component of resi-dents\u2019 M3 deposits, comprising over 85% of their M3 balances. This deposit category \u2013 which is the most liquid \u2013 grew by 7.2% in the year to September. Meanwhile, time deposits with a maturity of up to two years \u2013 the second largest deposit category \u2013 fell by 2.2% in annual terms, following a contraction of 1.2% in the year to August. Credit to Maltese residents grew at an annual rate of 11.2% in September, above the 9.7% recorded a month earlier (see Chart 9).

The annual rate of change in loans to non-financial corporations stood at 4.2%, down from 4.8% registered in August (see Chart 10). The deceleration in growth was broad-based across almost all economic sectors, notably reflecting a larger contraction in loans to the wholesale and retail trade and vehicle repair sector. This was followed by slower growth in credit to the construction sector and the sector comprising information and communication. These developments were partly offset by faster growth in credit to real estate activities, followed by an increase in loans to the sector comprising accommodation and food services activities and, to a lesser extent, in credit to the professional, scientific and technical activities sector. Meanwhile, the annual rate of change of loans to households edged up marginally to 5.9%, from 5.8% in August. This reflected a smaller contraction in consumer credit and other lending, which fell by 3.9%, follow-ing a decline of 6.7% in August. By contrast, mortgage lending eased to 7.0% in September, from 7.2% a month earlier. As regards interest rates, the composite interest rate paid by MFIs on Maltese residents\u2019 outstanding deposits stood at 0.23% in September, margin-ally below the 0.24% recorded in the previous month. The composite rate charged on out-standing loans eased margin-ally to 3.39%, when compared with 3.40% in August. Hence, the spread between the two rates remained unchanged from a month earlier, at 316 basis points.In the capital market, the sec-ondary market yield on 10-year Maltese government bonds fell by eight basis points from a month earlier, to 0.37% at the end of October (see Chart 11). Meanwhile, the Malta Stock Exchange (MSE) Equity Price Index declined by 2.1% dur-ing the same period. Similar movements were recorded in the MSE Total Return Index, which accounts for dividends as well as changes in equity prices. -12-8-404812J2016FMAMJ JASONDJ2017FMAMJ JASONDJ2018FMAMJ JASONDJ2019FMAMJ JASONDJ2020FMAMJ JASTotal NFC Loans Household loansChart 10LOANS BY SECTOR(annual percentage changes)Source: Central Bank of Malta. 0.00.51.01.52.0J2016FMAMJ JASONDJ2017FMAMJ JASONDJ2018FMAMJ JASONDJ2019FMAMJ JASONDJ2020FMAMJ JASOSource: Central Bank of Malta.

This is the first monthly decline in loans subject to a moratorium since it started in March 2020, which suggests that some businesses and households have recommenced regular loan repayments. The largest declines are observed in the household ,transporta-tion and storage, and the real estate sectors. Conversely, the accommodation and food services activities sector have continued to increase the amount of loans subject to a moratorium, which suggests that this sector remains in dire need of liquidity.The largest number of loans covered by moratoria was held by households, with the sector accounting for around 72.0% of the total volume of loans subject to a moratorium. Maltese households held \u20ac554.0 million, or 30.8%, of the total value of loans subject to a morato-rium, equivalent to 8.8% of outstanding household loans. 16  The loans subject to moratorium include both pre and post the Legal Notice 142 of 2020 on the Moratorium on Credit Facilities Regulations in Exceptional Circumstances (see here) and Central Bank of Malta Directive No. 18. The latter entered into force on 13 April 2020. A number of banks had already started to provide moratorium facilities voluntarily in March 2020.17  These also include those loans falling under the Malta Development Bank COVID-19 Guarantee Scheme.Table 4(Number of loans; EUR millions; percentage)Volume of loans(1)Outstanding amounts(2)Share in sector's outstanding loans(3)Households 6,022 554.0 8.8Manufacturing 169 51.2 23.4Construction 126 62.2 9.7Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles 503 141.0 22.1Transportation and storage and information and communication 111 86.7 32.2Accommodation and food service activities 439 258.2 55.0Real estate activities 408 317.1 32.0Other(4) 558 326.3 16.3Total 8,335 1,796.8 15.6Source: Central Bank of Malta.(3) The percentage of loans subject to moratorium in total outstanding loans held by the sector as at end of month.(4) Includes loans to agriculture and fishing, mining and quarrying, public administration, education, health and social work, financial and insurance activities (including interbank loans), professional, scientific and technical activities, administrative and support service activities, arts, entertainment and recreation, other services activities and extra-territorial bodies & organisations, and the electricity, gas & water supply sector.LOANS SUBJECT TO MORATORIUM \u2013 AS AT END SEPTEMBER 2020(1) The number of loans subject to moratorium.(2) Outstanding amounts of loans subject to moratorium as at end of month, in EUR millions.http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&itemid=30087&l=1CENTRAL BANK OF MALTA Economic Update 11/202014Meanwhile, the real estate sector held \u20ac317.1 million in loans subject to a moratorium, or around 18.0% of such loans \u2013 equivalent to a third of this sector\u2019s outstanding loans. This was followed by the accommodation and food services activities, which held \u20ac258.2 million in loans subject to a moratorium. The latter was the sector most affected by the contain-ment measures and, indeed, more than half \u2013 55.5% \u2013 of the loans held by this sector were subject to a moratorium by the end of September. Moreover, as at end September, the wholesale and retail trade sector held \u20ac141.0 million in loans subject to a moratorium, making up 7.8% of loans subject to a moratorium, or 22.1% of loans held by the sector.  In order to further alleviate liquidity challenges, the Government launched the Malta Devel-opment Bank (MDB) COVID-19 Guarantee Scheme (CGS) for the purpose of guaranteeing new loans granted by commercial banks for working capital purposes to businesses facing liquidity shortfalls as a result of the pandemic. The scheme enables credit institutions to leverage government guarantees up to a total portfolio volume of \u20ac777.8 million.18 By end September 2020, 453 facilities were approved under the CGS, covering total sanc-tioned lending of \u20ac343.7 million (see Table 5). As the scheme provides loans for working capital, only \u20ac165.6 million were disbursed by the end of September, up from the \u20ac121.4 million disbursed by the end of August.  In terms of the number of facilities, the sector comprising wholesale and retail activities applied for the largest number of facilities and had the largest value of sanctioned loans at \u20ac81.9 million. This was followed by accommodation and food services activities, with 106 facilities making up a total of \u20ac69.8 million sanctioned loans, and the sector comprising transportation and ICT, which had a total of \u20ac49.4 million. 18   The CGS was approved by the European Commission on 2 April 2020.
