Property of a public person may be  transferred for use without compensation to the authority  involved in the epidemiological safety measures for the  containment of the spread and elimination of consequences of  COVID-19 for the duration of operation of this Law. The decision  on the transfer of a property of a public person for use without  compensation shall be taken by the institution of the public  person in whose possession the relevant property is.

The institution of the  relevant public person has the right to control whether the  property transferred for use without compensation is used in  conformity with the purpose of its transfer.

The  movable property which is transferred according to the procedures  laid down in this Section, but has not been used for the  containment of the spread and elimination of consequences of  COVID-19 during the operation of this Law, shall be given back to  the relevant public person. If the movable property which is  transferred according to the procedures laid down in this Section  is used for performing economic activities, the conditions of  Section 29 of this Law shall be met.

[23 April 2020]  Section 54. Property of a public person which has been  transferred for use without compensation to the authority  involved in the epidemiological safety measures for the  containment of the spread and elimination of consequences of  COVID-19 or movable property (personal protective equipment and  disinfectants) of a public person which has been transferred  without compensation shall be regarded as a donation (gift) that  is exempted from the application of the enterprise income tax or  personal income tax.
