The Fund is aimed at\u00a0innovative and high-growth British businesses, to facilitate their ability to\u00a0secure investment during the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0 The Fund will be open until September and is delivered in partnership with the British Business Bank. It is part of the raft of financial measures. launched by the government as part of its response to the crisis. ", "content_of_measure_description": "Announced by the Chancellor on the 20th of\u00a0April, the Future Fund issues convertible loans from GBP 125,000 to GBP 5 million, to innovative UK companies with good potential, that typically rely on equity investment and are currently affected by Covid-19. The government funding is subject to at least equal match funding from private investors.\r\rThese convertible loans may be an option for businesses that rely on equity investment and are unable to access other government business support programmes because they are either pre-revenue or pre-profit.\r\rThe key features of the scheme are as follows. The application process is investor-led. This means an investor, or lead investor of a group of investors, applies in connection with an eligible company. The Future Fund will match up to 100% of the amount provided by investor(s), up to a maximum of GBP5 million.\u00a0 The Future Fund loan amount provided to the company ranges from GBP 125,000 to\u00a0GBP 5 million (this must be at least co-matched by investor capital).\u00a0 \r\rFunding must not be used to \r\r* repay any borrowings;\r* pay any dividends; \r* pay any bonuses; \r* pay any advisory fees. \r\rThe loans will have a minimum of 8% per annum (non-compounding) interest charge applied. This interest will be higher if the company and the investor(s) agree between themselves. Unlike a typical bank loan, the interest is not payable on a monthly basis and instead will accrue until the loan converts. At this point, the interest will either be repaid or convert in equity. The loan will mature after 36 months.\u00a0 The loan cannot be repaid early by the company other than with the agreement of all of the investors.\u00a0 The loans will convert into shares in the company in certain circumstances, including an exit or a new funding round.\r\rIn order to be eligible for the scheme, each of the investor(s) and the company must meet specific criteria.\r\rTo be eligible for the scheme, the company must meet the following criteria:\r\r1. The company must have raised at least GBP 250,000 in equity from third-party investors in previous funding rounds in the last five years (from 1 April 2015 to 19 April 2020, inclusive).\r2. If the company is a member of a corporate group, it must be the ultimate parent company.\r3. The company does not have any of its shares or other securities listed on a regulated market, a multilateral trading facility, a recognised investment exchange and/or any other similar market, stock exchange or listing venue.\r4. The company must be a UK incorporated limited company or be eligible to apply as a non-UK parent company.\r5. The company must have been incorporated on or before 31 December 2019 (or in the case of\u00a0a non-UK jurisdiction company*, this criterion applies only to at least one UK subsidiary operating company).\r6. At least one of the following must be true for the company:\r\r* Half or more employees are UK based\r* Half or more revenues are from UK sales\r\rThe scheme's\u00a0eligibility criteria have been amended to include innovative companies that participate in accelerator programmes based outside the UK.\u00a0 Where before, these companies didn\u2019t qualify because they had to register in an overseas jurisdiction to take part in an accelerator programme, the new criteria means they can now access the fund, providing they meet all other conditions for eligibility.\r\u00a0\rThe scheme is designed by government and delivered by the British Business Bank.\u00a0Initially, GBP 250 million was made available by the government for investment through the scheme, to be matched by private investors. However, the\u00a0Treasury made clear that the amount could be increased if needed.\u00a0 ", "use_of_measure_description": "The Government has allocated GBP 250 million to the Future Fund, which will initially run until the end of September. Government may extend the scheme thereafter.\r\rHM Treasury has published data on the total number of applications received, the numbers of successful applications and the (cumulative) value of all successful applications. \r\rOn the 7 June,\u00a0533 applications had been received, of which 53 had been approved to a value of GBP 55.9m.

As of 21st February, 93,216 BBLS top-ups had been approved worth \u00a30.83 billion.One topped up loan will still be reported as one loan to avoid double counting the number of facilities approved. (e.g. if there were previously two facilities worth \u00a340,000 each and subsequently one had been topped up to \u00a350,000, this would now be reported as two facilities worth a total of \u00a390,000).CBILS and BBLS data by constituencyStatistics from British Business BankFuture Fund\tData up to close of business\tTotal number of applications\tNumber of convertible loans approved\tValue of convertible loans approved\t27 May\t419\tn/a\tn/a\t31 May\t464\tn/a\tn/a\t7 June\t533\t53\t\u00a355.9m\t14 June\t577\t155\t\u00a3146.0m\t21 June\t623\t252\t\u00a3236.2m\t28 June\t674\t322\t\u00a3320.6m\t5 July\t722\t376\t\u00a3379.9m\t12 July\t750\t429\t\u00a3419.6m\t19 July\t781\t465\t\u00a3468.7m\t26 July\t816\t510\t\u00a3512.9m\t2 August\t839\t537\t\u00a3534.0m\t9 August\t868\t565\t\u00a3562.3m\t16 August\t902\t590\t\u00a3588.3m\t20 September\t1,072\t711\t\u00a3720.0m\t18 October\t1,243\t745\t\u00a3770.8m\t15 November\t1,325\t874\t\u00a3875.8m\t13 December\t1,432\t971\t\u00a3975.5m\t24 January\t1,925\t1,055\t\u00a31,066.6m\t21 February\t2,206\t1,140\t\u00a31,124.3mThe Future Fund closed on 31 January 2021 and is no longer accepting new applications.

For Future Fund this is reported on behalf of the British Business Bank. HM Treasury accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of these figures.\tFigures for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS show cumulative applications and approvals up to close of business on 21 February 2021 by accredited lenders, as reported to HM Treasury by close of business 22 February 2021.\tA full list of accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS can be found here.\tManagement information (MI) are not classified as statistics. The MI in this release reflects timely information and do not suffer from lag effects. However, the trend from weekly figures may show some volatility. Moreover, these are initial figures which have not been rigorously quality assured and do not include data from all accredited lenders.\tUK Finance have also previously published MI on CBILS, but this only covers accredited lenders which are members of UK Finance. This data is available here.\tFuture Fund opened for applications on 20 May 2020. Provided that applicants provide the information required during the application process in a timely manner, it is expected that the process will take a minimum of 21 days from initial application to funding being made available. Convertible loans are reported as approved at the point the Convertible Loan Agreement document is issued by Future Fund for signature. The time to applicants subsequently receiving funds will depend on the speed with which they complete the documentation.\tThe Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code) is built around 3 main concepts, or pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. The following explains how we have applied the pillars of the Code in a proportionate way.\tTrustworthiness - the figures are based on management information supplied to HM Treasury by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund and represent their best estimates of the published totals. To support the management of departmental business, figures have been seen in advance by ministers and officials. This is in line with the Code, where pre-release access does not apply for releases based on routine management information \u2013 as covered in paragraph 3.6 of the National Statistician\u2019s guidance.\tQuality - the information presented is provided by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund based on their management information.

                                   Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, the CBI has worked closely with the government, unions and other stakeholders to develop and drive measures that give every business a fighting chance. Measures that provide stability to businesses of all sizes, in all sectors and UK regions. We\u2019ve worked with officials in No.10, HM Treasury and BEIS, providing ideas and evidence from the business community; making recommendations on vital policy changes; and ensuring the real needs of businesses like yours are understood and acted upon.

The CBI called for an improved Pay As You Grow scheme in our Budget submission, working to extend repayment holidays and ensure SMEs were supported. Pay As You Grow was launched, including capital and interest repayment holidays for 6 months, and increased repayment terms from 6 to 10 years.                                    \t            Friday 29 Jan                                                                                                                                                                                                    Government announces aviation funding support                                                                        Following CBI calls to provide further business support especially to those in herder hit sectors, the government announces aviation funding support.                                    \t            Tuesday 5 Jan                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chancellor announces lockdown grants to support business                                                                        Following CBI calls, the Chancellor announced \u00a34.6bn in new lockdown grants to support businesses and protect jobs.

As part of the Spending Review, the Chancellor set out his plans on job support and creation, announcing a new three-year \u00a32.9 billion Restart scheme to help one million unemployed people in their job search \u2013 alongside \u00a31.4 billion of new funding to increase Job Centre Plus capacity. The Chancellor also announced tens of billions of pounds of investment in infrastructure will support jobs and spur Britain\u2019s recovery from coronavirus.25 November:\u00a0Following strong engagement and calls for business support to match restrictions, the Northern Ireland Executive announced a package of \u00a3213m of financial support for businesses.24 November:\u00a0Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, announced that from 15 December 2020, passengers arriving into England from countries not featured on the government\u2019s travel corridor list will have the option to take a test after 5 days of self-isolation. A negative result will release them from the need to isolate. This comes after effective lobbying from the CBI.23 November:\u00a0Following the CBI urging the government to set out exit plans to enable businesses to hit the ground running when measures are eased, the Prime Minister announced plans for England to operate under a three-tier system of COVID-19 restrictions a week prior to the second lockdown ending on 2 December.23 November:\u00a0With the CBI continuing to call for the government to work with business to establish an effective mass-testing regime, the government announced a six-week mass, rapid testing surge.3 November: Following continued calls from the CBI to deliver further mass testing, the government\u2019s announcement was the first chink of light that rapid mass testing could move from warm words to action. Since the roll-out of rapid mass testing in the Liverpool City Region, it has been extended across 67 more areas across England - with anyone living or working in these areas offered repeated tests regardless of whether they have symptoms.                                    \t            October                                                                                                                                                                                                    Global Travel Taskforce and more support for jobs and workers                                                                        29 October:\u00a0The WRC, CBI Wales and ACS presented the Welsh government\u00a0with recommendations to\u00a0resolve the confusion over non-essential items. This has since led to a row back in policy by the Welsh government.22 October:\u00a0With the financial impact of the new restrictions are being felt by firms beyond those instructed to close by government, the Chancellor responded to CBI calls for additional support. The announcement included extra help to retain staff with business contributions dropping to 5%, expanded business grants - channeled through local authorities \u2013 to target those most in need of support and for the self-employed, grants doubled to 40% of previous earnings.12 October:\u00a0Following CBI calls for a simplification of the local lockdown rules, the Prime Minster laid out government\u2019s three-tiered approach to local lockdowns for England.9 October:\u00a0Prior to the Prime Minister announcing a three tier system for COVID-19 restrictions, the Chancellor announced an extension to the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) for businesses impacted by further local or national coronavirus restrictions. The CBI has long called for the government to announce financial support in lockstep with restrictions.7 October: With the business community highlighting the vital role effective airport testing could play in jumpstarting international travel and trade, the government set up a Global Travel Taskforce. This has since led to the introduction of testing at some UK airports.                                    \t            September                                                                                                                                                                                                    Funding for tests, small business grants and business support                                                                        24 Sept:\u00a0Following CBI calls for a successor to the Job Retention Scheme and extensive engagement with the Chancellor and the Treasury team, the government announced further business support to help firms through the autumn and winter via the Winter Economic Plan.21 Sept:\u00a0Members faced great uncertainty about the future of the railways after the expiry of the Emergency Measures Agreement. This has been allayed for a further 18 months following the announcement of the Emergency Recovery Measures Agreements. Not only was this critical for businesses involved in this sector, but it will ensure that businesses that rely on the railways for access to their workforces and clients will continue to be served by a consistent rail service.21 Sept:\u00a0Dido Harding, the Head of NHS Test and Trace, joined a CBI @10 webinar.\u00a0Prior to the Test and Trace app being launched on 24\u00a0September, Dido Harding discussed the app and how businesses should engage with it.\u00a09 Sept:\u00a0Following CBI calls for additional business support, the government announced new direct cash grants to help small businesses if their area falls under new restrictions to protect public health. The government will need to look at more targeted support in the coming months, including a successor to the furlough scheme and allowing businesses to defer VAT payments from July to September.9 Sept:\u00a0CBI\u2019s Chief Economist, Rain Newton-Smith, confirmed to sit on COVID Recovery Commission.\u00a0The Commission will consider the role of business and government in delivering the kind of jobs and opportunities that will boost peoples\u2019 life chances. The aim of the new group is to produce practical policy ideas to support higher productivity levels, encourage business investment across the UK and promote a culture of innovation.3 Sept: Following CBI President, Lord Bilimoria calling for widespread testing to help boost economic recovery and build confidence, the Health Secretary announced \u00a3500 million funding for instant tests.                                    \t            August                                                                                                                                                                                                    Back to work campaign and improved local lockdown planning                                                                        28 August: The CBI set an agenda ahead of September with calls to build the right environment for enabling a \u2018new normal\u2019 when it comes to the return to offices and workplaces. Following the CBI\u2019s intervention, the government published their back to work campaign.25 August: The government has announced improvements to its local lockdown planning, committing to communicating changes and actions during business hours, enabling firms to better prepare. Government will also publish a weekly watchlist of local authorities of greatest concern, as part of a no surprises approach to local lockdowns that enable businesses to plan effectively.                                    \t            July                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wins in the Chancellor's statement and improvements to local lockdown                                                                        31 July: The extension, from 31 December 2020 to 28 February 2021, recognises the significant halt in progress experienced by housebuilders and construction supply chains during the early months of the pandemic. The announcement followed calls for an extension from the CBI to provide more certainty to the housebuilder market in the short-term and create a higher number of first time buyer homes available under the Help to Buy scheme, allowing builders to catch up on the several weeks of activity lost during coronavirus-enforced shutdowns.30 July: Changes to state aid rules mean that more small businesses can now benefit from loans of up to \u00a35m under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). Government expects lenders to make changes in the approvals process. The CBI worked closely with UK officials and industry groups including BVCA, UKF, UK Hospitality and BRC to lobby through Business Europe for the state aid rules to be amended.10 July:\u00a0The CBI\u2019s clear messaging on the business impact of the 14 day Quarantine policy in public and privately to senior officials and cabinet ministers about policy led to major new exemptions. With quarantining policy now being led by Foreign Office on a country-by-country approach, business and leisure traffic has reopened.8 July:\u00a0The CBI actively influenced policies which were announced during the Chancellor\u2019s statement. In a letter to the Chancellor, we called for a jobs package, a stamp duty \u2018cut\u2019 and the need for an under 25 jobs scheme \u2013 all of which were announced in the statement.The CBI also called for a targeted VAT reduction, which has been reflected in the VAT reduction applied on tourism and hospitality related activities from 20% to 5%. After conversations with the government referencing similar schemes in Austria and Japan, the Eat out to Help out discount scheme was also announced.\u00a33bn of new investment in green projects is a welcome development, and the CBI called for such investment several weeks ago.                                    \t            June                                                                                                                                                                                                    Creating jobs, sustainable access to cash and reduced social distancing                                                                        22 June: The government has announced that all planning permissions expiring between the start of lockdown and the end of this year\u00a0will automatically be extended until 1 April 2021. This will be welcome news for many businesses, who have had to urgently review their spending plans due to COVID-19, in order to safeguard their employees and the future of their business. The announcement followed calls from the CBI for an extension to expiring planning permission consent, to give businesses more time to responsibly manage their cashflow and therefore enable investment in projects.Also, though engagement across government departments and presenting health and economic evidence, the CBI played its part in the government reducing social distancing measures to help business reopen. With the two-metre social distancing rule in place many smaller businesses especially those in retail and hospitality could not reopen, as a result of our lobbying, more businesses can reopen helping the economic recovery of the UK.16 June: FCA and Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) agree to work with industry on a sustainable model of accessing cash. Cash usage has decreased in the last few years and the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated this. Preserving access to cash is an essential element of Financial Services infrastructure. The CBI has discussed the importance of access to cash with regulators, government, and members and has pushed for a collaborative approach with industry. This announcement will ensure the framework for access to cash is discussed with industry and local communities.4 June: With businesses keen to support the government COVID-19 response and the economic recovery efforts, the CBI called for the Business Secretary to set up business groups for consultation. Following this, Alok Sharma, announced the creation of five new business-focused groups to unleash Britain\u2019s growth potential and create jobs to help the economy bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic. The CBI has been invited to sit on the taskforce on how to accelerate business innovation and adoption across the country.                                    \t            May                                                                                                                                                                                                    Workplace safety, large business finance and non-essential retail                                                                        29 May:\u00a0Future of the Job Retention Scheme (JRS): through strong engagement with HM Treasury, the CBI was able secure two of business' asks for the future of the JRS -\u00a0flexibility starting in July (earlier than expected) and that the business contribution builds up gradually to make it easier for businesses to pay.\u00a0Read our latest update about the scheme.25 May:\u00a0Prior to the government publishing guidance for the re-opening of non essential shops, the CBI fed into a consultation which helped shaped the guidance for retailers.19 May:\u00a0Large business loan scheme: the CBI lobbied HM Treasury directly to create a new loan scheme for all firms above \u00a345m turnover. Firms below \u00a3250m can access \u00a325m in loans, firms above \u00a3250m can access \u00a350m. Following additional concerns from business, this has since been extended to maximum loans of \u00a3200m.

This led to the 100% government guaranteed 'bounce back' loans for under \u00a350k for small businesses.\u00a0Read more about the measures here.17 April:\u00a0Coronavirus Large Business Interruption loan scheme: the CBI lobbied and consulted extensively on the design of the scheme to ensure the medium-sized businesses had access to loans.15 April:\u00a0Job Retention Scheme extension: the CBI successfully persuaded HM Treasury to extend the Job Retention Scheme to the end of June to avoid a cliff-edge ending of the support and protect millions of jobs.

overviewAnnounced by the Chancellor on 20th April 2020, the Future Fund issues convertible loans to innovative UK companies with good potential that typically rely on equity investment and are currently affected by COVID-19. The scheme will help these companies through the current period of economic disruption and the recovery, so they are able to continue their growth trajectory and reach their full economic potential. The scheme is designed by government and delivered by the British Business Bank.Initially, the Government made \u00a3250 million available for investment through the scheme, to be matched by private investors, with the Treasury making clear the amount could be increased if needed. Due to the popularity of the fund, more funding is being made available. The scale of the scheme will be kept under review.Scheme update \u2013 01 February 2021:The Future Fund scheme has now closed for new applicants. We are now processing applications which were correctly completed and submitted by a lead investor and matched by the investee business before 23:59 GMT on Sunday, 31 January 2021, when the scheme closed to new applications. The online portal will remain open for Investee companies with legally completed CLAs to submit information and MI for portfolio monitoring purposes.Scheme update \u2013 14 January 2021:As planned, the Future Fund will close for new applications from Sunday 31 January 2021. For your application to be considered it must be submitted to the portal by the lead investor and matched with a business (i.e. the investee company has also completed their part of the initial application) by 23.59 GMT on Sunday 31 January 2021. Please note that only one application per Investee Company can be accepted by the Future Fund.All applications, if successful, will need to have been accepted and legally completed, with the relevant CLA executed by all parties, including the Future Fund, by 23:59 GMT on Wednesday 31 March 2021.Please read our updated FAQs for more information about the scheme closing to new applications and how this impacts existing applications.\u00a0 If you have any further questions, our Contact Centre can be reached via email, web portal or telephone.Scheme update \u2013 1st December 2020:The Future Fund aims to continuously improve the scheme to make sure it is targeting companies that have been prevented from reaching their full economic potential because of COVID-19. With effect from 1 December, we will be clarifying the permitted use of proceeds to ensure that the funding provided by the Future Fund is used for the purpose of operating expenditure and/or capital expenditure within the investee company or its group and not for investing in companies outside of its group. In particular, we will be clarifying that companies which receive Future Fund loans cannot use the proceeds of those loans to lend to other companies alongside the Future Fund. We will be shortly updating the Future Fund Website, including updates to FAQs, the application process and the scheme documentation, to give effect to this clarification.Scheme update \u2013 2nd November 2020:The Government has announced an extension to the Future Fund. The Future Fund will now close for new applications on Sunday 31st January 2021.Scheme update \u2013 30th June 2020:Since the scheme launched in May 2020, its eligibility criteria has been amended to include innovative companies that participate in accelerator programmes based outside the UK.Where before, these companies didn\u2019t qualify because they had to register in an overseas jurisdiction to take part in an accelerator programme, the new criteria means they can now access the fund, providing they meet all other conditions for eligibility.If you have submitted an application and received\u00a0confirmation of eligibility, your application is currently\u00a0being reviewed and processed. If we require additional information or clarification on any aspect of your application, our Future Fund Support Team will be in touch with you directly. Thank you.Using the buttons below, select the option most relevant to you.  \u00a0How it worksInvestor applies\tThe investor, or lead investor of a group of investors, certifies they meet the scheme eligibility criteria and provides key investment details.Visit the Future Fund portalCompany confirms\tThe company confirms the accuracy of the investment application details provided, before submitting the full application.Contract is finalised\tIn the case of approved applications, all parties will execute an agreement (in the template form provided) and satisfy certain conditions set out in the agreement before the funds are released.\u00a0Key features of the scheme\tInvestor-led process\tMatched funding\tLoan size\tUse of proceeds \tThe application process is investor-led. This means an investor, or lead investor of a group of investors, applies in connection with an eligible company. Companies are still able to register their interest \u2013 see the \"Information for companies\" page.  \tThe Future Fund will match up to 100% of the amount provided by investor(s), up to a maximum of \u00a35 million. \tThe Future Fund loan amount provided to the company ranges from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a35 million. Amounts of Future Fund loans must be at least matched by co-investment from investors. \tFunding must not be used to (a) repay any borrowings; (b) pay any dividends; (c) pay any bonuses; (d) pay any advisory fees.  \tInterest rate\tTerm\tConversion\tStandardised terms \tThe loans will have a minimum of 8% per annum (non-compounding) interest charge applied. This interest will be higher if the company and the investor(s) agree between themselves. Unlike a typical bank loan, the interest is not payable on a monthly basis and instead will accrue until the loan converts. At this point, the interest will either be repaid or convert in equity.  \tThe loan will mature after 36 months. The company cannot repay the loan early other than with the agreement of all of the investors.\tThe loans will convert into shares in the company in certain circumstances, including an exit or a new funding round.  \tInvestors and the Future Fund both invest using a convertible loan agreement, which is predefined and cannot be negotiated.\u00a0Eligibility criteriaTo be eligible for the scheme, each of the investor(s) and the company must meet specific criteria.The investor must fall within any of the following categories:\tAn \u201cinvestment professional\u201d within the meaning given to that term in article 19 of the FPO\tA high net worth company, unincorporated associated or high-value trust falling within article 49(2) of the FPO\tA \u201ccertified sophisticated investor\u201d or a \u201cself-certified sophisticated investor\u201d within the meaning given in articles 50 and 50A respectively of the FPO\tA \u201ccertified high net worth individual\u201d within the meaning of article 48 of the FPO\tAn equivalent professional, high net worth, institutional or sophisticated investor in accordance with applicable law and regulation in such investor\u2019s home jurisdiction\tAn association of high net worth or sophisticated investors within the meaning of article 51 of the FPO\tCapable of being classified as a \u201cprofessional client\u201d within the meaning given in the glossary to the FCA RulesNote: all other investors must fall within one of the above categories to be eligible to invest in the convertible loan agreement. It is the responsibility of other investors to ensure they are eligible.Definitions\u201cFCA Rules\u201d means the FCA\u2019s handbook of rules and guidance\u201cFPO\u201d means the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005To be eligible for the scheme, the company must meet the following criteria:\tThe company must have raised at least \u00a3250,000 in equity from third-party investors in previous funding rounds in the last five years (from 1 April 2015 to 19 April 2020, inclusive).\tIf the company is a member of a corporate group, it must be the ultimate parent company.\tThe company does not have any of its shares or other securities listed on a regulated market, a multilateral trading facility, a recognised investment exchange and/or any other similar market, stock exchange or listing venue.\tThe company must be a UK-incorporated limited company or be eligible to apply as a non-UK parent company (see specific eligibility criteria in the FAQs for non-UK parent companies).\tThe company must have been incorporated on or before 31 December 2019 (or if you are a non-UK jurisdiction company, this criterion applies only to at least one UK subsidiary operating company).\tAt least one of the following must be true for the company (this criterion applies to your group): (i) half or more employees are UK-based; (ii) half or more revenues are from UK sales.If you are applying as a non-UK jurisdiction parent company, the company must also meet the following criteria:\tThe company must have participated in an accelerator programme, on or before 19 April 2020, and participation in the accelerator mandated incorporation of the ultimate parent company in a non-UK jurisdiction (see the definition of \u201caccelerator programme\u201d in the FAQs for non-UK parent companies).\tThe company must have received investment from the accelerator programme on or before 19 April 2020.\tThe company must be the ultimate parent company of a group which contains at least one subsidiary operating company incorporated in the UK on or before 31 December 2019.\tIf the group (or any entity within the group) was in existence before the company was incorporated, the ultimate parent company of the group (or the sole entity, if applicable) must have been incorporated in the UK.Note: for non-UK companies, to protect the use of public funds, all applications will be assessed against UK Government investment standards on specific jurisdictions by reference to factors such as sanctions, tax transparency, and the cost and complexity of implementation.The UK Government will also take into account concerns around the proper use of public finances and wider public policy risks, as well as whether investment would undermine the integrity or public credibility of the Future Fund. Once we have assessed the eligibility of the non-UK company and the compatibility of its jurisdiction of incorporation and corporate form with the scheme, we will be in touch.Investors and companies should note that the company must not use the proceeds of the convertible loan agreement to:\trepay any borrowings from a shareholder or a shareholder related party (other than the repayment of any borrowings pursuant to any bank or venture debt facilities)\tpay any dividends or other distributions\tfor a period of 12 months from the date of the relevant convertible loan agreement, make any bonus or other discretionary payment to any employee, consultant or director of the company other than as contracted prior to the date hereof and as paid by the company in the ordinary course of business, or\tpay any advisory or placement fees or bonuses to any corporate finance entity or investment bank or similar service provider on monies advanced by the Future Fund\u00a0Access to investmentTracking diversity and inclusionThe application form asks a number of questions on diversity and inclusion to help us monitor the diversity of the portfolio of loans backed by the Future Fund scheme.Investing in Women CodeThe Future Fund is a signatory to HM Treasury\u2019s Investing in Women Code.

As of 21st February, 93,216 BBLS top-ups had been approved worth \u00a30.83 billion.One topped up loan will still be reported as one loan to avoid double counting the number of facilities approved. (e.g. if there were previously two facilities worth \u00a340,000 each and subsequently one had been topped up to \u00a350,000, this would now be reported as two facilities worth a total of \u00a390,000).CBILS and BBLS data by constituencyStatistics from British Business BankFuture Fund\tData up to close of business\tTotal number of applications\tNumber of convertible loans approved\tValue of convertible loans approved\t27 May\t419\tn/a\tn/a\t31 May\t464\tn/a\tn/a\t7 June\t533\t53\t\u00a355.9m\t14 June\t577\t155\t\u00a3146.0m\t21 June\t623\t252\t\u00a3236.2m\t28 June\t674\t322\t\u00a3320.6m\t5 July\t722\t376\t\u00a3379.9m\t12 July\t750\t429\t\u00a3419.6m\t19 July\t781\t465\t\u00a3468.7m\t26 July\t816\t510\t\u00a3512.9m\t2 August\t839\t537\t\u00a3534.0m\t9 August\t868\t565\t\u00a3562.3m\t16 August\t902\t590\t\u00a3588.3m\t20 September\t1,072\t711\t\u00a3720.0m\t18 October\t1,243\t745\t\u00a3770.8m\t15 November\t1,325\t874\t\u00a3875.8m\t13 December\t1,432\t971\t\u00a3975.5m\t24 January\t1,925\t1,055\t\u00a31,066.6m\t21 February\t2,206\t1,140\t\u00a31,124.3mThe Future Fund closed on 31 January 2021 and is no longer accepting new applications. The scheme is still processing applications submitted prior to closure.Notes\tThe management information for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS is reported on behalf of accredited lenders. For Future Fund this is reported on behalf of the British Business Bank. HM Treasury accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of these figures.\tFigures for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS show cumulative applications and approvals up to close of business on 21 February 2021 by accredited lenders, as reported to HM Treasury by close of business 22 February 2021.\tA full list of accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS can be found here.\tManagement information (MI) are not classified as statistics. The MI in this release reflects timely information and do not suffer from lag effects. However, the trend from weekly figures may show some volatility. Moreover, these are initial figures which have not been rigorously quality assured and do not include data from all accredited lenders.\tUK Finance have also previously published MI on CBILS, but this only covers accredited lenders which are members of UK Finance. This data is available here.\tFuture Fund opened for applications on 20 May 2020. Provided that applicants provide the information required during the application process in a timely manner, it is expected that the process will take a minimum of 21 days from initial application to funding being made available. Convertible loans are reported as approved at the point the Convertible Loan Agreement document is issued by Future Fund for signature. The time to applicants subsequently receiving funds will depend on the speed with which they complete the documentation.\tThe Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code) is built around 3 main concepts, or pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. The following explains how we have applied the pillars of the Code in a proportionate way.\tTrustworthiness - the figures are based on management information supplied to HM Treasury by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund and represent their best estimates of the published totals. To support the management of departmental business, figures have been seen in advance by ministers and officials. This is in line with the Code, where pre-release access does not apply for releases based on routine management information \u2013 as covered in paragraph 3.6 of the National Statistician\u2019s guidance.\tQuality - the information presented is provided by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund based on their management information. Quality assurance processes are built in the design of the templates and the data production processes in the Treasury.\tValue - in publishing this data, we aim to support the information needs of society, parliamentarians and stakeholders. Business loan schemes are one part of the unprecedented support for public services, workers and businesses the Government has implemented to protect against the current economic emergency.See more statistics on coronavirus funding for businesses and self employed people here.
