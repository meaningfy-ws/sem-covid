Loans were initially due to be worth up to GBP1.2m to support SMEs. On 17 March, this was increased to GPB5 million. The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan. The Government has also said the first 12 months of the loan would be offered interest free, with Government meeting the cost of those interest payments. Initially, the interest free period was due to last 6 months.\u00a0 The scheme went live on 23 March 2020.\r\rThe background regulation is the Coronavirus Act 2020, emergency legislation which received Royal Assent on the 25 March after having been fast-tracked through Parliament in just four days.", "content_of_measure_description": "This temporary\u00a0scheme aims to allow\u00a0small and medium\u00a0businesses across the UK with an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million, which\u00a0are experiencing lost or deferred revenues to access\u00a0loans, overdrafts, invoice finance and asset finance of up to GBP 5 million for up to 6 years. The government will also make a Business Interruption Payment to cover the first 12 months of interest payments and any lender-levied fees. This means smaller businesses will benefit from no upfront costs and lower initial repayments. The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to pre-lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs. The scheme is delivered through commercial lenders, backed by the government-owned British Business Bank.\u00a0There are 40 accredited lenders able to offer the scheme, including all the major banks, as well as\u00a0challenger banks, asset-based lenders and smaller specialist local lenders.\u00a0 \r\rA business is eligible if:\r\r* it is based in the UK\r* has an annual turnover of up to GBP 45 million\r* has a borrowing proposal which the lender would consider viable, if not for the coronavirus pandemic. \r\rTo access the scheme, businesses should approach their own provider \u2013 ideally via the lender\u2019s website. They may also consider approaching other lenders if they are unable to access the finance they need.\u00a0Decision-making on eligibility for CBILS is fully delegated to the accredited CBILS lenders. On 25 March, the Chancellor, Governor of the Bank of England, and CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority together wrote to Britain\u2019s banking sector with a warning not to allow fundamentally viable companies to collapse because of the coronavirus crisis.\r\rFinance terms are up to six years for term loans and asset finance facilities. For overdrafts and invoice finance facilities, terms will be up to three years.\u00a0The borrower always remains 100% liable for the debt.\r\rAt the discretion of the lender, the scheme may be used for unsecured lending for facilities of GBP 250,000 and under. Initially, the eligibility criteria stated that for facilities above GBP 250,000, the lender must establish a lack or absence of security prior to businesses using CBILS. It also stated that if the lender could offer finance on normal commercial terms without the need to make use of the scheme, they should do so. \r\rHowever, these\u00a0were changed as the scheme progressed. Thus, on the 2 April 2020, the\u00a0Government made changes to the scheme, namely:\r\r* No personal guarantees for facilities under GBP 250k: Personal guarantees of any form cannot be taken under the scheme for any facilities below GBP 250k.\r* Personal guarantees for facilities above GBP 250k: Personal guarantees may still be required, at a lender\u2019s discretion, but recoveries under these are capped at a maximum of 20% of the outstanding balance of the CBILS facility after the proceeds of business assets have been applied. A Principal Private Residence (PPR) cannot be taken as security to support a personal guarantee or as security for a CBIL backed facility.\r* Security: For all facilities, including those over GBP 250,000, CBILS can now support lending to smaller businesses even where a lender considers there to be sufficient security, making more smaller businesses eligible to receive the business interruption payment.\r\rThe Government announced that these changes should be retrospectively applied by lenders for any CBILS facilities offered since 23 March 2020. For any commercial (non-CBILS) facilities offered since the same date, providing the borrower meets the CBILS eligibility criteria, lenders have been asked to bring these facilities onto CBILS wherever possible (e.g. where the lender is accredited to offer the same facility through CBILS) and changes retrospectively applied as necessary.\r", "use_of_measure_description": "By the 19 July (the latest available data), the CBILS had received a total of \r112,212 applications (this figure includes\u00a0approved applications, applications that are still to be processed, applications that have been declined or turn out not to be eligible as well as withdrawn applications, where borrowers decide not to proceed). This number also includes a number of\u00a0applications that have subsequently been converted to applications for the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS scheme) - see the [specific case for this new initiative](https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/GB-2020-19/944).\r\u00a0\rThe number of facilities/loans approved by the 19 July was 55,674 with a value of GBP 12.20 billion (HM Treasury, 2020).\r\rBy the 20 September (the latest available data), the number of facilities/loans approved under the scheme was 66,585 with a value of GBP 15.4 billion (HM Treasury, 2020).", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "The social partners were informed about the raft of measures at the inception of the crisis; however, they were not formally involved in the design, implementation or monitoring of the measure.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "No", "private_or_public_sector": "Not specified", "is_occupation_specific": "No", "actors": ["National government"], "target_groups": ["SMEs"], "funding": ["National funds"], "sectors": [], "occupations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-scheme", "title": "UK Government Corona Virus Covid-19 Guidance ", "content_path": "res/735d3cbcddf9b07df6982facbcde53ad8390ed5cd19b58174753ed2cbe271025", "content": "Apply for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme - GOV.UK                                          Cookies on GOV.UK                      We use some essential cookies to make this website work.We\u2019d like to set additional cookies to understand how you use GOV.UK, remember your settings and improve government services.We also use cookies set by other sites to help us deliver content from their services.

As of 21st February, 93,216 BBLS top-ups had been approved worth \u00a30.83 billion.One topped up loan will still be reported as one loan to avoid double counting the number of facilities approved. (e.g. if there were previously two facilities worth \u00a340,000 each and subsequently one had been topped up to \u00a350,000, this would now be reported as two facilities worth a total of \u00a390,000).CBILS and BBLS data by constituencyStatistics from British Business BankFuture Fund\tData up to close of business\tTotal number of applications\tNumber of convertible loans approved\tValue of convertible loans approved\t27 May\t419\tn/a\tn/a\t31 May\t464\tn/a\tn/a\t7 June\t533\t53\t\u00a355.9m\t14 June\t577\t155\t\u00a3146.0m\t21 June\t623\t252\t\u00a3236.2m\t28 June\t674\t322\t\u00a3320.6m\t5 July\t722\t376\t\u00a3379.9m\t12 July\t750\t429\t\u00a3419.6m\t19 July\t781\t465\t\u00a3468.7m\t26 July\t816\t510\t\u00a3512.9m\t2 August\t839\t537\t\u00a3534.0m\t9 August\t868\t565\t\u00a3562.3m\t16 August\t902\t590\t\u00a3588.3m\t20 September\t1,072\t711\t\u00a3720.0m\t18 October\t1,243\t745\t\u00a3770.8m\t15 November\t1,325\t874\t\u00a3875.8m\t13 December\t1,432\t971\t\u00a3975.5m\t24 January\t1,925\t1,055\t\u00a31,066.6m\t21 February\t2,206\t1,140\t\u00a31,124.3mThe Future Fund closed on 31 January 2021 and is no longer accepting new applications.

For Future Fund this is reported on behalf of the British Business Bank. HM Treasury accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of these figures.\tFigures for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS show cumulative applications and approvals up to close of business on 21 February 2021 by accredited lenders, as reported to HM Treasury by close of business 22 February 2021.\tA full list of accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS can be found here.\tManagement information (MI) are not classified as statistics. The MI in this release reflects timely information and do not suffer from lag effects. However, the trend from weekly figures may show some volatility. Moreover, these are initial figures which have not been rigorously quality assured and do not include data from all accredited lenders.\tUK Finance have also previously published MI on CBILS, but this only covers accredited lenders which are members of UK Finance. This data is available here.\tFuture Fund opened for applications on 20 May 2020. Provided that applicants provide the information required during the application process in a timely manner, it is expected that the process will take a minimum of 21 days from initial application to funding being made available. Convertible loans are reported as approved at the point the Convertible Loan Agreement document is issued by Future Fund for signature. The time to applicants subsequently receiving funds will depend on the speed with which they complete the documentation.\tThe Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code) is built around 3 main concepts, or pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. The following explains how we have applied the pillars of the Code in a proportionate way.\tTrustworthiness - the figures are based on management information supplied to HM Treasury by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund and represent their best estimates of the published totals. To support the management of departmental business, figures have been seen in advance by ministers and officials. This is in line with the Code, where pre-release access does not apply for releases based on routine management information \u2013 as covered in paragraph 3.6 of the National Statistician\u2019s guidance.\tQuality - the information presented is provided by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund based on their management information.

The primary goal of our economic policy remains unchanged - to support people\u2019s jobs - but the way we achieve that must evolve.Since the beginning of the pandemic, the government has taken swift action to save lives, limit the spread of the disease and minimise damage to the economy.Ministers have introduced one of the most generous and comprehensive economic plans anywhere in the world with over \u00a3190 billion of support for people, businesses and public services - including paying the wages of nearly 12 million people, supporting over a million businesses through grants, loans and rates cuts and announcing the Plan for Jobs in July.The government has been consistently clear that it would keep its support under review to protect jobs and the economy, with today\u2019s action reflecting the evolving circumstances and uncertainty of the months ahead.The package of measures, which applies to all regions and nations of the UK, includes:Support for workersA new Job Support Scheme will be introduced from 1 November to protect viable jobs in businesses who are facing lower demand over the winter months due to coronavirus.Under the scheme, which will run for six months and help keep employees attached to the workforce, the government will contribute towards the wages of employees who are working fewer than normal hours due to decreased demand.Employers will continue to pay the wages of staff for the hours they work - but for the hours not worked, the government and the employer will each pay one third of their equivalent salary.This means employees who can only go back to work on shorter time will still be paid two thirds of the hours for those hours they can\u2019t work.In order to support only viable jobs, employees must be working at least 33% of their usual hours. The level of grant will be calculated based on employee\u2019s usual salary, capped at \u00a3697.92 per month.The Job Support Scheme will be open to businesses across the UK even if they have not previously used the furlough scheme, with further guidance being published in due course.It is designed to sit alongside the Jobs Retention Bonus and could be worth over 60% of average wages of workers who have been furloughed \u2013 and are kept on until the start of February 2021. Businesses can benefit from both schemes in order to help protect jobs.In addition, the Government is continuing its support for millions of self-employed individuals by extending the Self Employment Income Support Scheme Grant (SEISS). An initial taxable grant will be provided to those who are currently eligible for SEISS and are continuing to actively trade but face reduced demand due to coronavirus. The initial lump sum will cover three months\u2019 worth of profits for the period from November to the end of January next year. This is worth 20% of average monthly profits, up to a total of \u00a31,875.An additional second grant, which may be adjusted to respond to changing circumstances, will be available for self-employed individuals to cover the period from February 2021 to the end of April - ensuring our support continues right through to next year.This is in addition to the more than \u00a313 billion of support already provided for over 2.6 million self-employed individuals through the first two stages of the Self Employment Income Support Scheme \u2013 one of the most generous in the world.Tax cuts and deferralsAs part of the package, the government also announced it will extend the temporary 15% VAT cut for the tourism and hospitality sectors to the end of March next year. This will give businesses in the sector - which has been severely impacted by the pandemic - the confidence to maintain staff as they adapt to a new trading environment.In addition, up to half a million business who deferred their VAT bills will be given more breathing space through the New Payment Scheme, which gives them the option to pay back in smaller instalments. Rather than paying a lump sum in full at the end March next year, they will be able to make 11 smaller interest-free payments during the 2021-22 financial year.On top of this, around11 million self-assessment taxpayers will be able to benefit from a separate additional 12-month extension from HMRC on the \u201cTime to Pay\u201d self-service facility, meaning payments deferred from July 2020, and those due in January 2021, will now not need to be paid until January 2022.Giving businesses flexibility to pay back loansThe burden will be lifted on more than a million businesses who took out a Bounce Back Loan through a new Pay as You Grow flexible repayment system. This will provide flexibility for firms repaying a Bounce Back Loan.This includes extending the length of the loan from six years to ten, which will cut monthly repayments by nearly half. Interest-only periods of up to six months and payment holidays will also be available to businesses. These measures will further protect jobs by helping businesses recover from the pandemic.We also intend to give Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme lenders the ability to extend the length of loans from a maximum of six years to ten years if it will help businesses to repay the loan.In addition, the Chancellor also announced he would be extending applications for the government\u2019s coronavirus loan schemes that are helping over a million businesses until the end of November. As a result, more businesses will now be able to benefit from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, the Bounce Back Loan Scheme and the Future Fund. This change aligns all the end dates of these schemes, ensuring that there is further support in place for those firms who need it.Investment in public servicesAt the start of the pandemic, the Chancellor pledged to give the NHS and public services the support needed to respond to coronavirus \u2013 and as of today, \u00a368.7 billion of additional funding has been approved by the Treasury, including \u00a324.3 billion since the Summer Economic Update in July.This funding has helped ensure the procurement of PPE for frontline staff, provided free school meals for children while at home and protected the country\u2019s most vulnerable. In addition, the \u00a312 billion funding to roll-out the Test and Trace programme has played a key role helping to unlock the economy, enabling businesses like restaurants and bars to serve customers again.As announced earlier this year, the Treasury has also guaranteed the devolved administrations will receive at least \u00a312.7 billion in additional funding. This gives Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the budget certainty to for coronavirus response in the months ahead.Responses from business groupsDame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said:  These bold steps from the Treasury will save hundreds of thousands of viable jobs this winter. It is right to target help on jobs with a future, but can only be part-time while demand remains flat. This is how skills and jobs can be preserved to enable a fast recovery.  Wage support, tax deferrals and help for the self-employed will reduce the scarring effect of unnecessary job losses as the UK tackles the virus. Employers will apply the same spirit of creativity, seizing every opportunity to retrain and upskill their workers.  The Chancellor has listened to evidence from business and acted decisively. It is this spirit of agility and collaboration that will help make 2021 a year of growth and renewal.Mike Cherry OBE, Federation of Small Businesses National Chair, said:  The UK\u2019s small businesses are facing an incredibly difficult winter.  Today\u2019s support package is the flipside of the coin to Tuesday\u2019s COVID-19 business restrictions.  It is a swift and significant intervention, extending emergency SME loans, creating new wage support for small employers and the self-employed, and providing cashflow help on VAT deferrals and new Time To Pay for any tax bills to HMRC.  We welcome that the Chancellor is ensuring that decisions to protect public health are informed by the need to protect the economy, people\u2019s jobs and prospects for young people in our schools and workplaces.BCC Director General Adam Marshall said:  The measures announced by the Chancellor will give business and the economy an important shot in the arm. Chambers of Commerce have consistently called for a new generation of support to help preserve livelihoods and ease the cash pressures faced by firms as they head into a challenging and uncertain winter.  The Chancellor has responded to our concerns with substantial steps that will help companies preserve jobs and navigate through the coming months. The new wage support scheme will help many companies hold on to valued employees after furlough ends, and the extension of business lending schemes and tax forbearance will lessen the immediate pressure on cash flow for many affected firms.  As we look past the immediate challenge, more will need to be done to rebuild and renew our economy. Chambers of Commerce across the UK will continue to work with government to ensure the benefits of these schemes are delivered to firms on the ground.

(e.g. if there were previously two facilities worth \u00a340,000 each and subsequently one had been topped up to \u00a350,000, this would now be reported as two facilities worth a total of \u00a390,000).CBILS and BBLS data by constituencyStatistics from British Business BankFuture Fund\tData up to close of business\tTotal number of applications\tNumber of convertible loans approved\tValue of convertible loans approved\t27 May\t419\tn/a\tn/a\t31 May\t464\tn/a\tn/a\t7 June\t533\t53\t\u00a355.9m\t14 June\t577\t155\t\u00a3146.0m\t21 June\t623\t252\t\u00a3236.2m\t28 June\t674\t322\t\u00a3320.6m\t5 July\t722\t376\t\u00a3379.9m\t12 July\t750\t429\t\u00a3419.6m\t19 July\t781\t465\t\u00a3468.7m\t26 July\t816\t510\t\u00a3512.9m\t2 August\t839\t537\t\u00a3534.0m\t9 August\t868\t565\t\u00a3562.3m\t16 August\t902\t590\t\u00a3588.3m\t20 September\t1,072\t711\t\u00a3720.0m\t18 October\t1,243\t745\t\u00a3770.8m\t15 November\t1,325\t874\t\u00a3875.8m\t13 December\t1,432\t971\t\u00a3975.5m\t24 January\t1,925\t1,055\t\u00a31,066.6m\t21 February\t2,206\t1,140\t\u00a31,124.3mThe Future Fund closed on 31 January 2021 and is no longer accepting new applications. The scheme is still processing applications submitted prior to closure.Notes\tThe management information for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS is reported on behalf of accredited lenders. For Future Fund this is reported on behalf of the British Business Bank. HM Treasury accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of these figures.\tFigures for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS show cumulative applications and approvals up to close of business on 21 February 2021 by accredited lenders, as reported to HM Treasury by close of business 22 February 2021.\tA full list of accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS can be found here.\tManagement information (MI) are not classified as statistics. The MI in this release reflects timely information and do not suffer from lag effects. However, the trend from weekly figures may show some volatility. Moreover, these are initial figures which have not been rigorously quality assured and do not include data from all accredited lenders.\tUK Finance have also previously published MI on CBILS, but this only covers accredited lenders which are members of UK Finance. This data is available here.\tFuture Fund opened for applications on 20 May 2020. Provided that applicants provide the information required during the application process in a timely manner, it is expected that the process will take a minimum of 21 days from initial application to funding being made available. Convertible loans are reported as approved at the point the Convertible Loan Agreement document is issued by Future Fund for signature. The time to applicants subsequently receiving funds will depend on the speed with which they complete the documentation.\tThe Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code) is built around 3 main concepts, or pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. The following explains how we have applied the pillars of the Code in a proportionate way.\tTrustworthiness - the figures are based on management information supplied to HM Treasury by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund and represent their best estimates of the published totals. To support the management of departmental business, figures have been seen in advance by ministers and officials. This is in line with the Code, where pre-release access does not apply for releases based on routine management information \u2013 as covered in paragraph 3.6 of the National Statistician\u2019s guidance.\tQuality - the information presented is provided by accredited lenders for CBILS, CLBILS and BBLS and by British Business Bank for Future Fund based on their management information. Quality assurance processes are built in the design of the templates and the data production processes in the Treasury.\tValue - in publishing this data, we aim to support the information needs of society, parliamentarians and stakeholders. Business loan schemes are one part of the unprecedented support for public services, workers and businesses the Government has implemented to protect against the current economic emergency.See more statistics on coronavirus funding for businesses and self employed people here.
