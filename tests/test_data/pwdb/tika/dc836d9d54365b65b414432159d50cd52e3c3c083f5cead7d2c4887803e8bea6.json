Via the Malta Enterprise, Government first offered a measure which subsidised the purchase of technological equipment for the purpose of fostering teleworking. This measure has now ended. This new measure acknowledged that some organisations, especially micro and small enterprises might require assistance in drafting new business plans and in exploring technological options. In view of this, Malta Enterprise is providing a maximum of \u20ac5,000 per business to be used to undertake reengineering exercises with approved companies.

SMEs with a vision to develop can seek support from external advisors to assist them in carrying out significant changes that will enable them to accelerate development and improve market access.   1.2 Duration of the Incentive This measure is ongoing until 31st December, 2023.   1.3 Legal Basis The Business Advisory Support Regulations as subsidiary legislation S.L. 463.36 to the Malta Enterprise Act forms the national legal basis of this aid.
