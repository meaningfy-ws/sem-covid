This guidance is intended to support billing authorities in using their allocation from the \u00a3500m hardship fund announced at the Budget to deliver relief to council tax payers in their area. The funding is for the 2020-21 financial year. Allocations for each billing authority are set out at Annex A. 2. This guidance applies to England only. It outlines the underpinning principles for use of the fund and expected eligibility criteria for delivery of the support package. 3. Any enquiries on this document or use of the fund should be addressed to: Council.tax@communities.gov.uk Introduction 4. As part of its response to COVID-19, the Government announced in the Budget on 11 March that it would provide local authorities in England with \u00a3500m of new grant funding to support economically vulnerable people and households in their local area. 5. The expectation is that the majority of the hardship fund will be used to provide council tax relief, alongside existing local council tax support schemes. This funding is distinct from the \u00a35bn COVID-19 response fund to support public services. 6. This document provides guidance to authorities about the operation and delivery of the relief. Underpinning principles 7. The Government recognises that COVID-19 is likely to cause fluctuations in household incomes and recognises that, as a result, some individuals may struggle to meet council tax payments. Councils will already have established their local council tax support schemes for 2020-21. The Government therefore expects that billing authorities will primarily use their grant allocation to reduce the council tax liability of individuals in their area, using their discretionary powers under s13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992. Councils may also want to use some funding to deliver increased financial assistance through other local support mechanisms, having considered local circumstances. 8. Councils should expedite provision of support to individuals in their area, using existing policies and schemes to deliver assistance where practical. Where council clearance processes are considered necessary, to avoid delays, they should be kept as light touch as possible within the governance arrangements of each authority. 9. Council tax reductions should be applied as soon as possible from the beginning of the 2020-21 financial year and billing authorities should rebill council taxpayers as quickly as practical. Authorities will want to make the local population aware of how the grant support package will be delivered, e.g. through providing information on their websites. 4 mailto:Council.tax@communities.gov.uk                                                                                                                                 10. The Government has confirmed that it will fund billing authorities in full for the new burdens cost for delivering the support. 11. Local authorities will wish to maintain a record of grant expenditure under this scheme, both through the council tax system and their own local support mechanisms. 12. It is the Government\u2019s intention that any assistance provided from the council tax hardship fund will not affect the eligibility of recipients for other benefits. Minimum reduction in council tax liability for working age local council tax support claimants 13. The Government\u2019s strong expectation is that billing authorities will provide all recipients of working age local council tax support (\u2018LCTS\u2019) during the financial year 2020-21 with a further reduction in their annual council tax bill of \u00a3150, using their discretionary powers to reduce the liability of council tax payers outside of their formal LCTS scheme design. 14. Where a taxpayer\u2019s liability for 2020-21 is, following the application of council tax support, less than \u00a3150, then their liability would be reduced to nil. Where a taxpayer\u2019s liability for 2020-21 is nil, no reduction to the council tax bill will be available. 15. There should be no need for any recipient of LCTS to make a separate claim for a reduction under this scheme. The billing authority should assess who is eligible for support from the hardship fund and automatically rebill those council taxpayers. 16. Whether or not a taxpayer has been affected by COVID-19, directly or indirectly, should not be taken into account in assessing eligibility for this reduction. 17. The Government is keen to ensure that support is provided as quickly as possible to individuals who are eligible. It therefore considers that there is a strong case for councils to provide the support up front to enable the maximum benefit to be delivered promptly. However, the Government recognises that in some cases, authorities may consider that the most effective assistance could be profiled across the year. 5                                                                                                                Wider consideration \u2013 additional discretionary support 18. The Government recognises that existing support mechanisms vary locally, including LCTS schemes, discretionary council tax discount/hardship schemes and local welfare schemes. 19. Having allocated grant to reduce the council tax bill of working age LCTS recipients by a further \u00a3150, billing authorities should establish their own local approach to using any remaining grant to assist those in need. Billing authorities will want to revisit their broader approach at intervals during the financial year, in order to ensure expenditure for 2020-21 remains within their allocation. In determining any broader approach to delivering support, authorities are best placed to reflect on the financial needs of their most vulnerable residents. In doing so, they may wish to consider using their remaining grant allocation as part of wider local support mechanisms. These may include, but are not restricted to: a) Council tax relief using existing discretionary discount/hardship policies (adapted where necessary in order to capture those most likely to be affected by COVID-19); and b) Additional support outside the council tax system through Local Welfare or similar schemes; c) A higher level of council tax reduction for those working age LCTS recipients whose annual liability exceeds \u00a3150. Allocation of funding 20.Money will be allocated to billing authorities on the basis of their share of the national caseload of working age LCTS recipients using the most recent published data (2019-20, Q3). Annex A sets out allocations for each billing authority for the financial year 2020-21. 21.The money will be paid out as soon as possible to billing authorities through a grant under section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003. 6

The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong and the government is well prepared to protect people\u2019s health and support their economic security throughout this period of temporary economic disruption. The Budget sets out a plan to support public services, individuals and businesses that may be affected by COVID-19.While the economy continues to face challenges, the government\u2019s careful management of the public finances means that it is able to support the economy in the short term, while investing in the future. The Budget announces investments in the roads, railways and digital networks that will underpin growth over the coming decade, as well as the world-class hospitals, schools, colleges and police forces that people rely on every day.The Budget supports the government\u2019s ambition for a fair and sustainable tax system that helps people and families with the cost of living, funds the first class public services they expect and creates an environment for business to succeed. The government will build on this across the Parliament, creating a tax system fit for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.The Budget also sets out a plan to invest in research and development (R&D) and cutting-edge technologies. It provides support for people in every nation and region of the UK to gain the skills that they will need as the economy evolves, so that the nation can seize the opportunities of the next decade and fulfil its potential.In the year that the UK hosts the COP26 UN climate summit, the Budget takes steps to decarbonise the economy and protect the UK\u2019s natural habitats, ensuring that every part of the UK economy is ready for the challenges of decarbonisation, and ready to capitalise on the opportunities to become leaders in the green markets of the future.This is the first Budget of a new government, the first of a new decade, and the first since the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union (EU). It is a Budget that lays the foundations of the UK\u2019s future prosperity and delivers on the government\u2019s promises to the British people.Economic contextThe UK economy has many strengths. It has a globally competitive tax system, it is home to many highly innovative firms, has a world-beating science and research base, and has sound, independent macroeconomic institutions. Employment growth remains strong \u2013 the employment rate reached a record high in the three months to December 2019 \u2013 and earnings growth remains above inflation.The recent COVID-19 outbreak is creating short-term uncertainty. The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR) economy and fiscal forecast does not reflect the now global spread of COVID-19 nor an outbreak in the UK. The OBR notes that the spread and impact of a COVID-19 outbreak clearly represents a downside risk to the forecast, but the scale is highly uncertain and the economic impact is likely to be temporary.Looking further ahead, the UK also faces challenges in the medium to long term. Productivity remains low compared to other countries and unevenly distributed across the country. And, in common with other advanced economies, the transition to a net zero emissions economy by 2050 will require radical changes in every sector. The Budget lays the foundations to address these challenges.Outlook for the public financesOver the past decade, the government has taken action to restore the public finances to health, reducing the deficit by four fifths. This, and the historically low cost of borrowing, mean that the government can support the economy in the short term, while providing significantly more investment in public services and infrastructure to support growth in the long term.The Budget launches the Comprehensive Spending Review 2020 (CSR), setting out the overall level of public spending within which the CSR will be delivered. The CSR will conclude in July and will set out detailed spending plans for public services and investment, covering resource budgets for three years from 2021-22 to 2023-24 and capital budgets up to 2024-25.The CSR will prioritise improving public services, levelling up economic opportunity across all nations and regions, strengthening the UK\u2019s place in the world and supporting the government\u2019s ambitions to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It will focus on linking departments\u2019 spending proposals to the real-world outcomes they seek to achieve, and delivering value for money for taxpayers.The policy changes set out in the Budget, including the spending totals that have been set for the CSR, have been delivered while ensuring the current budget is in surplus, public sector net investment does not exceed 3% of GDP and debt is kept under control.HM Treasury will review the fiscal framework ahead of Autumn Budget 2020 to ensure it remains appropriate for the macroeconomic context, while ensuring the sustainability of the public finances.Responding to COVID-19Public safety is the government\u2019s top priority in its response to COVID-19 and it is taking firm and comprehensive action, consistent with the best scientific evidence.As well as being focused on safety and the public health response to the outbreak, the government recognises that people will be concerned about the effect it will have on their livelihood, and business will be concerned about reduced demand, potential disruptions to supply chains and export markets, and to their workforce during this temporary period.The Budget announces a \u00a312 billion plan to provide support for public services, individuals and businesses, whose finances are affected by COVID-19. This includes a \u00a35 billion COVID-19 response fund to ensure the NHS and other public services receive the funding they need to respond to the outbreak as the situation develops, and recover and return to normal afterwards.For individuals it includes extending Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for those advised to self-isolate, and those caring for others who self-isolate, and support through the welfare system for those who cannot claim SSP, as well as a hardship fund.Finally, the government will support businesses that experience increased costs or disruptions to their cashflow. This includes expanded Business Rates reliefs, a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme to support up to a further \u00a31 billion lending to SMEs, a \u00a32.2 billion grant scheme for small businesses, and a dedicated helpline for those who need a deferral period on their tax liabilities.Tackling COVID-19 is a global challenge, and to complement our domestic response the Budget sets out steps the UK is taking to lead a swift and effective global response to deal with the impacts of the virus.The measures set out in the Budget to support health and other public services, protect people and families and support businesses will be reflected in the public finances at Autumn Budget 2020.Funding excellent public servicesThe people of the UK are rightly proud of its world-class public services. The NHS, schools and police provide the security and support that allow the British people to lead safe, prosperous and healthy lives. The government is committed to providing the funding that public services need and ensuring that excellent services are available in every nation and region of the UK.Total departmental spending is set to grow twice as fast as the economy over the CSR period. Day-to-day departmental spending is set to grow at the fastest rate over a spending review period since Spending Review 2004.Within this, the government will increase funding for its number one spending priority: the NHS. Compared to 2018-19, NHS England will receive a cash increase of \u00a334 billion a year by 2024. In addition, the Budget commits over \u00a36 billion of new funding over this Parliament, including to create 50 million more GP surgery appointments per year, ensure there are 50,000 more nurses, and fund wider commitments on hospital car parking and support for people with learning disabilities and autism. The Budget also sets out action to ensure that pensions tax rules do not deter doctors from taking on additional shifts.The government will invest in the security of everyone in the UK with additional funding for counter-terrorism policing and the UK intelligence community. The government will keep people safe with strengthened community sentences and increased victim support.Spending Round 2019 committed to a \u00a37.1 billion cash increase in funding for schools by 2022-23. The Budget builds on this by providing \u00a329 million per year by 2023-24 to support primary school PE teaching and help schools make the best use of their sports facilities, as well as \u00a390 million per year to introduce an Arts Premium from September 2021 to help schools provide high-quality arts programmes and extracurricular activities for pupils.Levelling up and getting Britain buildingThe government is committed to levelling up across the UK by raising productivity and growth in all nations and regions, creating opportunity for everyone, and addressing disparities in economic and social outcomes.For too long the UK has under-invested in infrastructure, leaving many people stuck with delays and poor service.By the end of the parliament, public sector net investment will be triple the average over the last 40 years in real terms. In total, around \u00a3640 billion of gross capital investment will be provided for roads, railways, communications, schools, hospitals and power networks across the UK by 2024-25. The government will publish a National Infrastructure Strategy later in the spring, and the CSR will provide full departmental spending plans. The Budget announces:\t    the largest ever investment in English strategic roads, with over \u00a327 billion between 2020 and 2025, enough funding to fill in around 50 million potholes across the country, and unprecedented investment in urban transport, with \u00a34.2 billion for five-year, integrated transport settlements for eight city regions on top of \u00a31 billion allocated to shovel-ready transport schemes  \t    funding for the Shared Rural Network agreement to radically improve mobile coverage in rural areas, and a record \u00a35 billion investment in gigabit broadband rollout in the hardest-to-reach areas of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland  \t    record funding of \u00a35.2 billion for flood defences between 2021 and 2027, offering better protection from flooding for 336,000 homes and non-residential properties. Additional funding of \u00a3200 million will help communities most at risk of flooding recover faster in cases where they are affected by flood damage  \t    a \u00a310.9 billion increase in housing investment to support the commitment to build at least 1 million new homes by the end of the Parliament, and an average of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s  \t    the government will invest \u00a31.5 billion (\u00a31.8 billion including indicative Barnett consequentials) over five years in capital spending to refurbish further education colleges, and has committed to a new \u00a32.5 billion National Skills Fund to improve adult skills (\u00a33 billion including indicative Barnett consequentials). It will also boost science, technology, engineering and maths teaching with capital investment for up to eight new Institutes of Technology and 11 maths schools. The government is committed to giving everyone the opportunity to fulfil their potential, regardless of where they are from.  The government is also taking action to review the Green Book, which sets out how decisions on major investment programmes are appraised in order to make sure that government investment spreads opportunity across the UK.The Budget reaffirms the government\u2019s commitment to strengthening the ties that bind the Union. As well as taking action that will support people and businesses in every nation of the UK, and targeted support to each nation, it sets out the funding the government will make available through Barnett consequentials for the devolved administrations to fund public services, infrastructure and other priorities.Supporting people and familiesThe government is committed to taking action to help with the cost of living for everyone across the UK and ensure that the most vulnerable in society get the support they need.Alongside the Budget, the government is formally announcing a new, ambitious target for the National Living Wage (NLW) to reach two-thirds of median earnings and be extended to workers aged 21 and over by 2024, provided economic conditions allow. Based on the latest OBR forecast, this means the NLW is expected to be over \u00a310.50 in 2024.This builds on the 6.2% increase of the NLW to \u00a38.72 an hour that takes effect from this April, meaning the government is on track to meet its current target of 60% of median earnings by 2020. Since the NLW\u2019s introduction in 2016 real wages have grown fastest for the lowest paid full-time workers.As people earn more, the government is committed to reducing taxes on their wages. The Budget confirms a tax cut for 31 million working people with the increase in the National Insurance contributions (NICs) thresholds for employees and the self-employed, saving the typical employee around \u00a3104 and a typical self-employed person around \u00a378 in 2020-21. Taken together with increases to the NLW and to the Personal Allowance, an employee working full-time on the NLW anywhere in the UK will be over \u00a35,200 better off compared to April 2010.The government is investing a further \u00a39.5 billion in the Affordable Homes Programme which in total will allocate \u00a312.2 billion of grant funding from 2021-22 to support the creation of affordable homes across England.The government is also helping people with the cost of living by freezing fuel duty for the tenth consecutive year, freezing all alcohol duties, applying a zero rate of VAT to e-publications, abolishing the tampon tax, and making it easier for parents of up to 500,000 school-age children to access Tax-Free Childcare.The Budget confirms the end of the benefits freeze and continues the rollout of Universal Credit to support the most vulnerable in society, with extra help for parents of sick or premature babies, carers and victims of domestic violence.The government will invest an additional \u00a31 billion to remove unsafe cladding from residential buildings above 18 metres to ensure people feel safe in their homes.The Budget also includes action to reduce rough sleeping, providing \u00a3643 million for accommodation and support services to help people off the streets.Backing businessFrom the largest UK-headquartered multinationals to the smallest family-owned firm, businesses are the lifeblood of the UK economy. They have created 3 million new jobs since 2010, giving more people the chance to succeed in life and provide for their families.The UK is one of the best places in the world to do business and the most attractive country for inward investment in Europe. The government is committed to unleashing businesses\u2019 potential, and the Budget supports the development of the high-tech, high-skill jobs of the future.The government wants to ensure that the United Kingdom continues to be attractive to investment and remains a dynamic environment to start and grow a business. To cut the cost of taking on staff the government is increasing the NICs Employment Allowance to \u00a34,000, benefiting 510,000 businesses. At 19% the UK\u2019s Corporation Tax rate remains the lowest in the G7 and G20. The government is reforming Entrepreneurs\u2019 Relief, while continuing to support the vast majority of entrepreneurs and increasing tax incentives for businesses investing in structures and buildings, and R&D.The Budget also announces the launch of a fundamental review of business rates, due to report in the autumn.The Budget will help businesses to take advantage of opportunities for the UK outside the EU, for example through new financial support for British exporters and by investing in additional business support for SMEs through Growth Hubs. The government will also extend the Start-Up Loans Programme to ensure would-be entrepreneurs can access the finance they need.To ensure that the UK remains a dynamic and competitive regulatory environment, the government is launching a Reforming Regulation Initiative to collect ideas for regulatory reform, as well as implementing the recommendations of the Furman Review of digital competition, publishing further detail on the Financial Services Bill which will ensure that the UK maintains its world-leading regulatory standards and openess to international markets.Investing in innovationThe UK\u2019s success in the global economy will be rooted in innovation and cutting-edge technology. By driving technological change, the government will create the high quality, highly paid jobs of the future, the Budget sets out plans to increase public R&D investment to \u00a322 billion per year by 2024-25. The government will invest that money in the people, ideas and industries that will cement the UK\u2019s world-leading position in science and technologies ranging from nuclear fusion to electric vehicles and life sciences.This landmark investment is the largest and fastest ever expansion in support of researchers and innovative businesses, taking direct support for R&D to 0.8% of GDP and placing the UK among the top quarter of OECD nations \u2013 ahead of the USA, Japan, France and China.Achieving the government\u2019s ambitions on R&D will require investment from the private sector. To boost that investment the government will increase the rate of R&D tax credits and consult on widening the definition of qualifying expenditure to include data and cloud computing.In life sciences, the government will provide the British Business Bank with additional resources to launch a dedicated \u00a3200 million investment programme which is expected to enable \u00a3600 million of investment, helping to ensure the UK remains a world leader in life sciences innovation.Growing a greener economyThe UK has already cut carbon emissions by more than any other G7 country and in 2019 was the first major economy to legislate for a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As the UK prepares to host this year\u2019s COP26 UN climate summit, the Budget announces a range of policies to reduce emissions, ensure our environment is protected and resilient to climate change, and generate green economic opportunities across the nations and regions of the UK.Increasing the UK\u2019s use of clean energy is a vital part of reducing carbon emissions and putting the nation at the forefront of new innovative industries. The Budget announces a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Infrastructure Fund to establish CCS in at least two UK sites, one by the mid-2020s, a second by 2030. To encourage more environmentally-friendly ways of heating homes and other buildings, the government will also introduce a Green Gas Levy to help fund the use of greener fuels, increase the Climate Change Levy that businesses pay on gas, and reopen and extend the Climate Change Agreement scheme by two years.Road transport is responsible for 91% of domestic transport emissions, and around a fifth of overall UK emissions. To support drivers to move away from polluting vehicles, the Budget announces investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which will ensure that drivers are never more than 30 miles from a rapid charging station, provides \u00a3532 million for consumer incentives for ultra-low emission vehicles, and reduces taxes on zero emission vehicles.In addition, the government will promote air quality improvement by removing the entitlement to use red diesel except for agriculture, fish farming, rail and non-commercial heating. The government will tackle air pollution by providing \u00a3304 million to help local authorities reduce nitrogen dioxide emissions and improve air quality.The government will also invest in the natural environment, planting enough trees to cover an area the size of Birmingham, restoring peatlands, and providing more funding to protect the UK\u2019s unique plants and animals. The government will also go further to tackle the scourge of plastic waste by introducing a Plastic Packaging Tax, as well as providing further funding to encourage producers to make their packaging more recyclable.Budget decisionsA summary of the fiscal impact of the Budget policy decisions is set out in Table 1.

Budget Report1.1  Economy and Public FinancesThe UK economy has many strengths: a globally competitive tax system, some of the best universities in the world, is home to many highly innovative firms, and its economic prospects are underpinned by a strong macroeconomic framework. Since 2010, the economy has grown faster than France, Italy and Japan. Employment is at a record high and the unemployment rate is the joint-lowest since 1975. In common with other advanced economies, the UK faces economic challenges. In the near term, the outbreak of COVID-19 is expected to have a significant but temporary effect on the economic outlook. Productivity remains weak and is distributed unevenly across the country; and the transition to\u202fa net zero economy by 2050 will require radical changes in every\u202fsector.The Budget announces a plan to support the economy over the short term in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This includes measures to support public services, individuals and\u00a0businesses.The Budget builds on the UK\u2019s economic strengths and takes steps to address the UK\u2019s long-standing structural challenges. The government is committed to levelling up across the UK in order to raise productivity and growth in all nations and regions, creating opportunity for everyone and addressing disparities in economic and social outcomes.Since 2010, the government has restored the public finances to health after inheriting debt that had nearly doubled in two years. The deficit has been reduced by four fifths from a post\u2011war peak of 10.2%[footnote 1] of GDP in 2009-10 to 1.8% of GDP in 2018-19.With historically low borrowing costs and the public finances in a more secure position, the government can now increase borrowing for investment without compromising fiscal sustainability. The Budget provides significant levels of funding for public services to meet the economic challenges and priorities of today, and to address the long-term challenge of low productivity growth.This increase in spending, which provides the envelope for the upcoming CSR, has been delivered while meeting a set of fiscal rules that ensures the government is only borrowing to invest over the medium term, with the current budget in surplus, and that limits public sector net investment to an average of 3% of GDP, to keep control of borrowing and debt. To ensure the fiscal framework remains appropriate for the current macroeconomic environment HM Treasury will undertake a review over the summer and announce any changes by Autumn Budget 2020.1.2  Economic contextThe OBR\u2019s economy forecast was closed for new data when the spread of COVID-19 was at a much earlier stage. As such, the OBR\u2019s forecast includes an estimate of the impact on global growth, based on the assumption that the spread of the virus would be relatively limited. The forecast does not reflect the now global spread of COVID-19 or an outbreak in the UK.1.3  Global economyThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that the global economy grew by 2.9% in 2019, down from 3.6% in 2018, and the slowest growth since the financial crisis (Chart 1). The COVID-19 outbreak is expected to reduce global growth this year. The OBR forecasts that annual global GDP growth will be 3.0% in 2020, down from 3.6% in its Spring Statement 2019 forecast. This includes an assumption that the outbreak would be \u201crelatively limited\u201d and its impact on the forecast \u201clargely confined to a modestly weaker outlook for growth in world trade and the UK\u2019s export markets.\u201d The OBR notes that, since closing its global forecast to new data, \u201cit\u00a0has become clear that the spread of coronavirus will be far wider than assumed in our baseline forecast, pointing to a deeper \u2013 and possibly more prolonged \u2013 slowdown.\u201d[footnote 2]There have already been clear signs that activity in China, where the outbreak began, has slowed. In its most recent economic assessment published on 2 March 2020, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) downgraded its forecast for Chinese growth in 2020 by 0.8 percentage points, to 4.9%.Highly integrated just-in-time manufacturing processes across the globe mean that disruption to Chinese output is likely to affect production globally. Lower Chinese growth will affect global demand. There will also be spillovers through financial markets and potential hits to business and consumer confidence.The OECD has produced two scenarios. In the \u2018baseline\u2019 scenario it assumes the virus is contained largely in China and revised down expectations of global growth in 2020 from 2.9% to 2.4%. In a second scenario, assuming broader contagion, the OECD suggests that global growth could be reduced more significantly in 2020, to 1.5%.Chart 1.1: Global GDP growth1.4  UK economyThe OBR closed its forecast before the spread of COVID-19 in the UK, noting that this means \u201cthe precise forecasts for the economy \u2026 can no longer be regarded as central.\u201d[footnote 3] As an open economy, the UK will be affected because of the wider impacts the outbreak is having on the global economy. The OBR\u2019s estimate of the impact on global growth, based on the spread of the virus being relatively limited, reduces UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points this year.The impact of a wider spread outbreak of COVID-19 on the UK economy is highly uncertain. The drivers of any economic impact are health-related factors, including how many people get infected, the persistence of an outbreak and measures put in place to protect public health and prevent the spread. There will likely be significant, temporary disruption to the economy. Disruption could include temporary absences from work and interruptions to global supply chains, both of which would constrain the UK\u2019s productive capacity for a temporary period. In addition, the economy could be affected by a reduction in consumer spending and lower business investment, largely reflecting the response to measures to contain the outbreak, and weaker demand for UK\u00a0exports.1.5  GrowthThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the UK economy grew by 1.4% in 2019, 0.1 percentage points higher than in 2018. Delays to the UK\u2019s departure from the EU affected the profile of economic activity throughout 2019, leading to volatility in quarterly growth over the year.Growth is distributed unevenly across the UK. England has historically had the highest GDP growth, averaging 2.2% between 1998 and 2018. Over the same period, Wales grew at an average rate of 1.7%, while Scotland and Northern Ireland both grew at an average rate of 1.9%. Growth is also uneven at a regional level \u2013 London has seen the fastest growth of all regions, averaging 3.1% between 1998 and 2018, while the North East of England had an average growth rate of 1.5%, the slowest of all regions.Over the forecast, the OBR has revised down its forecast for cumulative GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points, largely reflecting downward revisions to potential productivity and net migration. The OBR expects GDP growth of 1.1% in 2020, revised down from 1.4% in its Spring Statement 2019 forecast, with weaker contributions from both consumption and business investment growth. The OBR expects annual consumption growth to be 1.1% and for there to be no growth in business investment in 2020 (Chart 1.2). GDP growth is then expected to increase to 1.8% in 2021 before slowing slightly, reaching 1.4% in 2024.Chart 1.2: UK GDP \u2013 contributions to annual GDP growth1.6  The labour market and earningsEmployment is at a record high. The number of people aged 16 years and over in paid work was 32.8 million in 2019 and was at a record high of 32.9 million in the three months to December 2019. The employment rate \u2013 the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 who are in paid work\u00a0\u2013 also reached a record high of 76.5% in the same period (Chart 1.3). The OBR expects the employment level to increase further over the forecast period, reaching 33.4 million in 2024.Chart 1.3: UK employment and unemployment rates since 1971 (1,2)The unemployment rate \u2013 the proportion of the economically active population (those in work plus those seeking and available to work) who are unemployed \u2013 was 3.8% in the three months to December 2019, the joint-lowest in over 40 years. The OBR expects the annual unemployment rate to remain at 3.8% in 2020 and 2021, before rising to 4.1% by 2024.Every nation and region of the UK has higher employment and lower unemployment than in 2010. Wales has seen the largest reduction in its unemployment rate since 2010, of 5.6\u00a0percentage points. There are 3.9 million more people in work than in 2010, with over 60% of the increase taking place in UK nations and regions outside London and the South East. Table\u00a01.1 gives national and regional labour market statistics for the three months to December\u00a02019.Earnings growth remains above inflation. Nominal wage growth (including bonuses) and regular nominal wage growth (excluding bonuses) were 2.9% and 3.2% respectively in the final quarter of 2019. Over the same period, real total pay growth was 1.4% and real regular pay growth was 1.8%. The OBR forecasts average earnings to grow by 3.3% in 2020 and rise to 3.6% in 2021.[footnote 4] It then expects growth to fall back to 3.1% by 2024.Rising real wages have helped to support the growth of real household disposable income (RHDI) per head, a measure of living standards. RHDI per head grew by 0.3% in the year to Q3\u00a02019, down from 1.0% in the year to Q2 2019. The OBR expects annual growth in RHDI per head of 0.6% in 2020, before reaching 1.1% by 2024.[footnote 5]Table 1.1: National and regional employment and unemployment rates (3 months to December 2019)\t\u00a0\tEmployment rate\tUnemployment rate\t\u00a0\tActual (1)\tDifference from UK average (3)\tActual (2)\tDifference from UK average (3)\tNorth East\t71.1\t-5.4\t6.1\t2.3\tNorth West\t75.9\t-0.6\t4.2\t0.4\tYorkshire & the Humber\t73.3\t-3.2\t4.5\t0.7\tEast Midlands\t78.4\t1.9\t3.6\t-0.2\tWest Midlands\t75.5\t-1.0\t4.4\t0.6\tEast of England\t78.6\t2.1\t3.3\t-0.5\tLondon\t75.5\t-1.0\t4.3\t0.5\tSouth East\t80.0\t3.5\t3.1\t-0.7\tSouth West\t80.1\t3.6\t2.8\t-1.0\tWales\t74.4\t-2.1\t2.9\t-0.9\tScotland\t75.0\t-1.5\t3.5\t-0.3\tNorthern Ireland\t72.4\t-4.1\t2.4\t-1.4\tUnited Kingdom\t76.5\t0.0\t3.8\t0.0\t1 Employed people as a percentage of the population (aged 16-64).\t2 Unemployed people as a percentage of the economically active population (aged 16+).\t3 Percentage points.\tSource: Office for National Statistics1.7  ProductivityUK labour productivity (measured as output per hour) did not grow at all in 2019, following subdued growth of 0.5% in 2018. This weakness has partly contributed to the OBR\u2019s judgement to revise down potential productivity growth \u2013 the underlying rate that determines how quickly productivity can grow sustainably \u2013 by an average of 0.1 percentage points per year across the forecast.[footnote 6] The OBR does note that \u201cthe significant planned increase in public investment potentially boosts productivity by raising the public capital stock, but we have assumed that the effect is likely to be felt mainly beyond our forecast horizon.\u201d[footnote 7]The UK\u2019s level of productivity has been lower than that of other advanced economies since the 1960s. The UK\u2019s level of productivity is more than 20% lower than other major advanced economies such as the US, France and Germany (Chart 1.4). In addition, UK productivity growth has slowed more since the financial crisis than other advanced economies. UK productivity growth has averaged 0.3% since 2008, slowing from 2.3% in the decade prior. By comparison, growth across the G7 has averaged 0.8% since 2008, compared to 1.9% in the decade prior.Chart 1.4: Comparison of productivity levels relative to USThere is wide variation in productivity within the UK. As measured by output per hour, the only two areas with average levels of productivity above the UK average in 2018 were London (31.6% higher than the UK average) and the South East (9.1% higher than average). Productivity can vary significantly within each of the nations and regions as well as between them (Chart\u00a01.5).In the long term, higher productivity remains the only path to sustainable economic growth and rising living standards. Investing in skills and infrastructure to improve productivity across the UK permits growth by enabling firms to pay higher wages, offer goods and services at lower prices, and increase their profits. Productivity improvements, by enhancing economic growth, are also a fundamental source of long-run growth in tax receipts and the government\u2019s ability to fund public services. A low average level of productivity \u2013 as well as significant variation between and within regions \u2013 are signs of untapped economic potential. The government is committed to levelling up investment across nations and regions to improve living standards nationally, as well as to address disparities in economic and social outcomes.Chart 1.5: Spread of productivity across the UK, 2018 (1,2,3,4)1.8  PricesThe annual rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation was 1.8% in 2019, down from 2.5% in 2018. Inflation fell through much of 2019, reaching 1.4% in the final quarter of the year, before increasing to 1.8% in January 2020. The ONS\u2019s headline measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs (CPIH), was also 1.8% in January 2020.[footnote 8] The OBR forecasts CPI inflation to be 1.4% in 2020, gradually rising to 2.1% in 2022 and 2023, and settling at 2.0% by 2024.Alongside the Budget, the government and UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) are launching a consultation, announced on 4 September 2019,[footnote 9] on UKSA\u2019s proposal to address the shortcomings of the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation. The consultation will cover, among other things, the issue of timing, including whether the UKSA\u2019s proposal might be implemented at a date other than 2030, and if so, when between 2025 and 2030, and issues on technical matters concerning the implementation of its proposal. The consultation will be open for a period of six weeks, closing on 22 April 2020. The government and UKSA will respond to the consultation before the Parliamentary summer recess.1.9  Current AccountThe current account measures the flow of goods, services, income and transfers between the UK and the rest of the world. In 2018, the current account balance widened to a deficit of 3.9% of GDP from 3.5% in 2017. This was driven by a widening of both the trade and income deficits. The current account deficit averaged 4.7% of GDP in the first three quarters of 2019. The OBR expects the current account deficit for the whole of 2020 to be 3.8%. It is then forecast to remain close to 4.0% of GDP throughout the forecast period.1.10  Monetary PolicyThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England has operational independence to set monetary policy to meet its primary objective of price stability and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of the government, including its objectives for growth and employment.Independent monetary policy is a critical element of the UK\u2019s macroeconomic framework, alongside sustainable public finances and a resilient financial system. Low and stable inflation supports living standards and provides certainty for households and businesses, helping them make decisions about saving, investment and spending.The Chancellor is responsible for setting the MPC\u2019s remit. In the Budget, the Chancellor reaffirms the symmetric inflation target of 2% for the 12-month increase in the CPI measure of inflation. This target applies at all times.[footnote 10] The Chancellor also confirms that the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) will remain in place for the financial year 2020-21.Table 1.2: Summary of the OBR\u2019s central economic forecast (percentage change on year earlier, unless otherwise stated) (1)\t\tForecast\t\t2019\t2020\t2021\t2022\t2023\t2024\tGDP growth\t1.4\t1.1\t1.8\t1.5\t1.3\t1.4\tGDP growth per capita\t0.8\t0.5\t1.3\t1.1\t0.9\t1.1\tMain components of GDP\t\u00a0Household consumption (2)\t1.3\t1.1\t1.2\t1.2\t1.4\t1.4\t\u00a0General government consumption\t3.6\t3.7\t2.8\t2.1\t1.9\t2.2\t\u00a0Fixed investment\t0.4\t-0.8\t3.4\t2.9\t2.0\t1.8\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Business investment\t0.3\t0.0\t1.8\t3.0\t2.4\t2.3\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General government\t2.1\t1.9\t10.9\t4.6\t1.8\t1.2\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Private dwellings (3)\t-0.3\t-4.2\t1.5\t1.6\t1.3\t1.2\t\u00a0Change in inventories (4)\t0.1\t-0.1\t0.1\t0.0\t0.0\t0.0\t\u00a0Net trade (4)\t0.0\t-0.1\t-0.3\t-0.2\t-0.4\t-0.3\tCPI inflation\t1.8\t1.4\t1.8\t2.1\t2.1\t2.0\tEmployment (millions)\t32.8\t33.0\t33.1\t33.2\t33.3\t33.4\tUnemployment (% rate)\t3.8\t3.8\t3.8\t3.9\t4.0\t4.1\tProductivity per hour\t0.0\t0.9\t1.2\t1.2\t1.1\t1.2\t1 All figures in this table are rounded to the nearest decimal place.

The deficit has been reduced by four-fifths from a peak of 10.2% of GDP in 2009-10 to 1.8% of GDP in 2018-19.[footnote 11] As Chart 1.6 and 1.7 show the cost of government debt as a share of government revenues is now at a post-war low, due to historically low interest rates on government borrowing.With low borrowing costs and the public finances in a more secure position, the government can support the economy and fund the response to COVID-19 in the short-term and take action over the medium-term to drive growth and improve public services, without compromising fiscal sustainability. In addition to short-term support for the COVID-19 response, the Budget provides for a significant medium-term increase in day-to-day spending on public services. With historically low borrowing costs, it is right that the government borrows to invest in the country\u2019s future and address challenges. The government is therefore borrowing to fund a new set of growth-enhancing policies focused on delivering a step-change in infrastructure investment, which aims to raise the UK\u2019s productivity growth in the long-run.Chart 1.6: Debt interest to revenue ratio from 1946-47 to 2024-25Chart 1.7: Historical quarterly 10-year gilt yields from 1989 to 20191.12  The fiscal frameworkThis Budget has been delivered to meet the following fiscal rules:\t    to have the current budget at least in balance by the third year of the rolling five-year forecast period  \t    to ensure that public sector net investment (PSNI) does not exceed 3% of GDP on average over the rolling five-year forecast period  \t    if the debt interest to revenue ratio is forecast to remain over 6% for a sustained period, the government will take action to ensure the debt-to-GDP ratio is falling  The Budget also sets the spending envelope for the upcoming CSR within these rules, which allow for significant investment in growth-enhancing infrastructure while maintaining control of day-to-day spending. They allow policy to meet the economic demands of today while ensuring that borrowing and debt remain under control. Chart 1.8 shows that public sector net debt has stabilised after the sharp rise driven by the financial crisis and is expected to be broadly stable across the forecast period. The rules also provide the flexibility to respond fully to near-term shocks to the economy and public finances such as from COVID-19.Chart 1.8: Public sector net debt from 2000-01 to 2024-25Interest rates are expected to remain at very low levels for an extended period. This has prompted an international debate around the implications of this environment for fiscal sustainability and the role of fiscal policy. In this context, the Chancellor has announced that HM\u00a0Treasury will conduct a review of the UK\u2019s fiscal framework, to:\t    ensure that it remains appropriate for the current macroeconomic environment  \t    support the ambitious new policy agenda of the government to invest in and level up every part of the country  \t    keep the United Kingdom at the leading edge of international best practice in macroeconomic policy  The review will report back by Autumn Budget 2020, to allow the government to confirm its fiscal objectives for the Parliament. It will be undertaken by HM Treasury and will involve broad consultation with external experts from across the UK and internationally. The review will be guided by the following principles:\t    fiscal policy should support the government\u2019s economic objectives, while maintaining the sustainability of the public finances by keeping control over borrowing and debt  \t    low and stable inflation should be supported, as an essential pre-requisite to deliver the government\u2019s economic objectives  \t    the UK\u2019s existing institutional strengths in fiscal policy making \u2013 the independent Office for National Statistics (ONS) producing official economic and fiscal statistics, and the independent OBR producing the official economic and fiscal forecasts and assessing the government\u2019s performance against its fiscal objectives \u2013 should be preserved and built on  The review will consider the following areas:\t    The low interest rate environment: It has been argued that, given persistently very low interest rates, there is further fiscal space to borrow for investment. This needs to be weighed against the risks posed by high levels of public debt, for example from rapid changes in economic conditions and from longer-term fiscal pressures. The review will look at how to balance the opportunities and risks within the fiscal framework.  \t    Macroeconomic stabilisation: The review will consider the case for a more active role for fiscal policy in stabilising the economy, especially if there is reduced space for monetary policy due to low interest rates. This will be judged alongside consideration of the extent to which active fiscal policy can provide timely and effective demand management, and the implications for wider policy objectives and fiscal sustainability. The review will look at how to reflect these trade-offs within the fiscal framework.  \t    Incentives for value for money prioritisation: The fiscal framework should support the prioritisation of public investments which most enhance growth. The review will consider whether some well-evidenced spending, beyond what the current international frameworks class as capital investment, is currently disincentivised. This will include an assessment of the practical challenges in evolving the framework: including measurement issues, consistency with internationally recognised statistical and accounting frameworks, how other countries have approached these issues, and the need to balance fiscal sustainability objectives.  \t    Developments in the management and measurement of the balance sheet: Completion of HM Treasury\u2019s Balance Sheet Review discussed in Box 1.A in the summer provides an opportunity to consider its conclusions and options to improve the management of loans, guarantees, contingent liabilities, and wider balance sheet transactions. The review will also consider the strengths and limitations of using broader balance sheet measures to assess fiscal sustainability.  \t    Mitigating fiscal risks and pressures: The review will consider how to further support the effective management of fiscal pressures and risks, through a framework which can provide operationally-effective controls on the short and medium-term fiscal position, and can address and mitigate the challenge of longer-run pressures on fiscal sustainability, including from the ageing population and the actions needed to achieve net zero by\u00a02050.  \t    Building on the strength of the UK\u2019s world class institutions: The review will consider options to support and strengthen the practices and institutions that deliver the UK\u2019s fiscal framework, including the independent OBR and ONS, and advisory bodies such as the National Infrastructure Commission. The review will also consider the case for strengthening the legislative underpinning for the UK\u2019s system of public financial\u00a0management.  When the review is concluded, HM Treasury will lay before Parliament a new Charter for Budget Responsibility; the Autumn 2016 Charter therefore remains in force at the current time.[footnote 12] The Budget has been delivered within the fiscal rules set out above in section 1.12. The Chancellor wrote to the OBR ahead of the Budget to ask it to assess the government against these rules, in addition to those set out in the Autumn 2016 Charter.[footnote 13]Box 1.A: Balance Sheet ReviewThe government manages assets worth \u00a32 trillion alongside \u00a34.6 trillion of liabilities on behalf of citizens.[footnote 14] The Balance Sheet Review (BSR) was launched in 2017 to identify opportunities to dispose of assets that no longer serve a policy purpose, improve returns on retained assets, and reduce the risk and cost of liabilities. This work aims to put the UK at the forefront of the international drive to reduce waste and deliver improvements in the cost-effective management of public wealth, as recognised by the IMF in its October 2018 Fiscal Monitor. The BSR will conclude and report at this year\u2019s Comprehensive Spending Review.\u00a0Strengthening the assessment of balance sheet transactionsThe BSR has highlighted the importance of considering the impacts on the government\u2019s balance sheet, as well as on income flows over the longer term, when deciding to buy or sell assets and settle or incur liabilities. The government is therefore considering a new framework to evaluate the case for proceeding with significant balance sheet transactions. This will take into account impacts across a range of fiscal metrics, including Public Sector Net Debt (PSND), Public Sector Net Financial Liabilities (PSNFL) and Public Sector Net Worth (PSNW). The government will work with the ONS and OBR to further develop statistics and forecasts for PSNW and depreciation in the public sector finances, as well as assessing how these reconcile with the Whole of Government Accounts (WGA). This will inform the fiscal framework review set out in section 1.12.Managing risk from contingent liabilitiesThe government is exposed to \u00a3192 billion of contingent liabilities, including guarantees and insurance provided to the private sector.[footnote 15] The BSR has developed proposals to improve the management of these liabilities and address a key balance sheet risk recognised by the OBR in its July 2019 Fiscal Risk Report.[footnote 16] The government is publishing a report alongside Budget: \u2018Government as insurer of last resort\u2019 providing more detail on the policy approach.\u00a0Knowledge assetsTo improve social, economic and financial returns from its c.\u00a3150 billion[footnote 17] of knowledge assets in the public sector, and following publication of a report at Budget 2018,[footnote 18] the government will establish a new unit and fund to develop knowledge assets.\u00a01.13  The fiscal outlookBorrowing this year is forecast to be \u00a347.4 billion, \u00a30.2 billion lower than the OBR\u2019s restated March 2019 forecast. Underlying receipts are forecast to be \u00a34.9 billion higher, driven by a combination of stronger National Insurance contributions (NICs), capital gains tax and onshore corporation tax receipts. The strength in receipts is offset by higher spending, which is forecast to be \u00a35.3 billion higher and is largely due to an increase in local and public corporations\u2019 capital expenditure, an increase in company tax credits and lower than expected underspends by government departments. Policy decisions made by the government at Spending Round 2019 and at Budget, and described in Chapter 2, decrease borrowing by \u00a30.6\u00a0billion in 2019-20.[footnote 19]Across the rest of the forecast, compared to the OBR\u2019s restated March 2019 forecast, the underlying forecast for borrowing is expected to be higher by \u00a33.1 billion on average from 2020-21 onwards. The changes in the underlying fiscal outlook are due to a combination of the following\u00a0factors:\t    A downward revision to underlying receipts from 2020-21 onwards that is predominantly driven by downward revisions to growth in GDP and its components. Excluding a fiscally neutral switch that means that customs duty revenues previously remitted to the EU are now recognised in both receipts and spending, receipts are lower by an average of \u00a33.0\u00a0billion a year from 2020-21 onwards. Lower wage growth, consumer spending and profits, and an adjustment to fuel efficiency assumptions have downward effects on income tax and NICs, VAT, corporation tax and fuel duty receipts respectively. Lower interest rates reduce the interest received from government\u00a0assets.  \t    Underlying spending (excluding debt interest expenditure) is forecast to be higher in every year from 2020-21 onwards. Excluding the fiscally neutral change to the treatment of customs duties, non-interest spending is higher by an average of \u00a37.4 billion. Higher expenditure on welfare, company tax credits, capital transfers associated with new student loans, and capital spending by local government are the main reasons for this increase.  \t    However, underlying debt interest expenditure has been revised down by \u00a37.4 billion on average from 2020-21 onwards. This is due to downward revisions in the forecasts for RPI inflation and interest rates.  The most significant changes to the forecast since restated March 2019 are the decisions taken by the government in the Budget and described in Chapter 2, which increase borrowing across the forecast. On average they increase borrowing by \u00a321 billion from 2020-21 onwards. The direct cost of the measures is partly offset by the positive short-term impact on the fiscal position of the higher economic growth that is generated as a result of the Budget package. Higher growth in the short term, and a medium-term increase in nominal GDP leads to increased tax revenues. This is partly offset by the effect of higher borrowing, interest rates and inflation which increase debt interest and welfare spending.In the usual way, the OBR have incorporated Budget policy decisions (set out in Table 2.1) into their final post-measures forecast. The government has not asked the OBR to incorporate the fiscal and economic impacts of the government\u2019s plan to tackle the economic impact of COVID-19 into their final forecast. This reflects that the OBR\u2019s baseline forecast does not incorporate the most recent estimate of the likely economic and fiscal impacts of a spread of COVID-19 and to do so would have introduced an inconsistency between the baseline forecast and the policy package. Moreover, given the fast-developing situation, the government will continue to adapt its policy to best respond to the latest circumstances. The OBR has said that, relative to their Budget forecast, COVID-19 is likely to put upward pressure on borrowing in the short term but expect limited impact over the medium and longer term.The government will therefore reflect the costs of its response to COVID-19 at a future fiscal event alongside an updated OBR forecast. The current fiscal framework provides the near\u2011term flexibility to respond fully to the challenge of COVID-19, and the government has built headroom against the medium-term rules should it be needed.Table 1.3: Changes to the OBR\u02bcs forecast for public sector net borrowing since restated March 2019 forecast (\u00a3 billion)\t\t2019-20\t2020-21\t2021-22\t2022-23\t2023-24\tRestated March 2019\t47.6\t40.2\t37.6\t35.4\t33.3\tTotal underlying forecast changes since restated March 2019 (1)\t0.4\t2.3\t5.1\t3.6\t1.5\tof which\t\u00a0Receipts forecast (2)\t-4.9\t1.0\t3.5\t4.1\t3.5\t\u00a0Debt interest forecast\t-2.0\t-6.7\t-6.6\t-7.7\t-8.5\t\u00a0Other spending forecast (2)\t7.3\t7.9\t8.2\t7.1\t6.5\tTotal effect of government decisions since March 2019 (1)\t-0.6\t12.3\t24.0\t22.5\t25.4\tof which\t\u00a0Direct effects\t-0.6\t15.6\t31.1\t32.2\t33.8\t\u00a0Indirect effects\t0.0\t-3.3\t-7.1\t-9.7\t-8.4\tTotal changes since restated March 2019\t-0.2\t14.6\t29.1\t26.0\t26.9\tBudget 2020\t47.4\t54.8\t66.7\t61.5\t60.2\tFigures may not sum due to rounding.\t1 Equivalent to lines from Table 1.3 of the OBR (March 2020) \u02bdEconomic and fiscal outlook\u02bc; full references available in \u02bdBudget 2020 data sources\u02bc.\t2 Excludes a fiscally neutral change to the treatment of customs duty revenues previously remitted to the EU.\tSource: Office for Budget Responsibility and HM Treasury calculations.Compared to the restated March 2019 forecast, borrowing is lower in 2019-20, but higher in every other year of the forecast.

Public sector net debt is expected to continue to fall over the forecast, from 79.5% in 2019-20, to a low of 75.0% in 2021-22 before rising slightly to 75.2% in 2024-25.

The new fiscal framework allows for a significant increase in growth-enhancing infrastructure investment, while maintaining control of day-to-day spending and the commitment to long-term fiscal\u00a0sustainability.At Spending Round 2019, the government increased departmental spending by 4.1% in real terms between 2019-20 and 2020-21, delivering the fastest planned growth in day-to-day departmental spending in 15 years.[footnote 20] Spending Round 2019 funded vital public services: high\u2011quality, readily accessible healthcare; schools and colleges that ensure every child receives a superb education; and action to cut crime and help keep our streets safe.Individual budgets for all departments have been set until 2020-21 for both departmental capital totals (CDEL) and departmental resource totals (RDEL). Longer-term settlements have already been announced for the NHS and schools, which have confirmed budgets until 2023-24 and 2022-23 respectively.Table 1.8: Departmental Capital Budgets in 2019-20 and 2020-21 (Capital DEL, in \u00a3 billion)\t\t2019-20\t2020-21\tCapital DEL\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\tHealth and Social Care\t7.1\t8.2\tEducation\t4.6\t4.5\tHome Office\t0.7\t0.8\tJustice\t0.5\t0.7\tLaw Officers' Departments\t0.0\t0.0\tDefence\t10.5\t10.6\tSingle Intelligence Account\t0.6\t0.8\tForeign and Commonwealth Office\t0.1\t0.1\tInternational Development (1)\t2.0\t4.8\tMHCLG Housing and Communities (2)\t8.4\t13.1\tMHCLG Local Government\t0.0\t0.0\tTransport (3)\t14.6\t17.6\tBusiness, Energy and Industrial Strategy (4)\t11.2\t12.3\tDigital, Culture, Media and Sport\t0.6\t0.6\tEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs\t0.8\t0.9\tInternational Trade\t0.0\t0.0\tWork and Pensions\t0.1\t0.2\tHM Revenue and Customs\t0.3\t0.4\tHM Treasury\t0.1\t0.0\tCabinet Office\t0.1\t0.1\tScotland\t4.4\t5.5\tWales (5)\t2.3\t2.4\tNorthern Ireland (6)\t1.4\t1.7\tSmall and Independent Bodies\t0.4\t0.5\tReserves (7)\t0.0\t3.4\tAdjustment for Budget Exchange (8)\t0.0\t-0.6\tTotal Capital DEL\t71.1\t88.5\tRemove CDEL not in PSGI (9)\t-11.2\t-13.3\tAllowance for shortfall (10)\t0.0\t-3.9\tPublic Sector Gross Investment in CDEL\t59.9\t71.2\t1 Figures for 2020-21 do not reflect all transfers which will be made from DfID to other government departments.\t2 MHCLG's CDEL budget in 2020-21 includes technical adjustments along with Budget announcements since Budget 2018.\t3 DfT's CDEL budget in 2020-21 includes a net reduction due to business rates retention pilots.\t4 BEIS and other government departments' CDEL budgets increased in 2020-21 to account for the reclassification of R&D in the National Accounts.\t5 This includes the 5% needs-based Barnett formula uplift.\t6 This includes the 2.5% VAT abatement.\t7 2020-21 adjusted to account for a change in the accounting treatment of leases.

The Budget launches the CSR, which will conclude in July.[footnote 21]1.16  Path of Public Spending1.17  The Comprehensive Spending Review envelopeThe CSR will set Resource DEL budgets for three years to 2023-24 inclusive and Capital DEL funding for departments to 2024-25. The CSR will be delivered within the fiscal rules set out in section 1.12. The Budget sets the overall spending envelope for resource and capital spending within which the CSR will be delivered. Total departmental spending is set to grow twice as fast as the economy over the CSR period. Day-to-day departmental spending is set to grow at the fastest rate over a spending review period since Spending Review 2004.Having left the EU, from 2021 the UK will no longer contribute to the EU budget as a Member State, leaving only payments due as part of Financial Settlement obligations. The government has accounted for this when setting its spending plans, allowing it to determine how an additional \u00a314.6 billion[footnote 22] of spending by 2024-25 can be allocated to its domestic priorities, rather than be sent in contributions to the EU. The implementation period (IP) will end on 31 December 2020. The baseline scenario is that the UK will exit the IP at this time without a future relationship being agreed with the EU. HM Treasury will ensure that all necessary funding is made available to prepare for this outcome at the end of 2020.Table 1.10: Total departmental budgets (Total DEL); Resource DEL excluding depreciation and Capital DEL from 2019-20 to 2024-25 (1), (2), (3) (\u00a3 billion, unless otherwise stated)\t\t2019-20\t2020-21\t2021-22\t2022-23\t2023-24\t2024-25\tAARG 2019-20 to 2024-25 (4),(5),(6)\tTotal Resource DEL excluding depreciation\t330.4\t360.6\t384.6\t400.7\t417.6\t435.5\t3.3%\tOBR allowance for shortfall\t-0.5\t-3.2\t-3.9\t-4.1\t-4.3\t-4.4\t\tOBR resource DEL excluding depreciation forecast\t329.9\t357.3\t380.8\t396.6\t413.3\t431.1\tTotal Capital DEL\t71.1\t88.5\t101.7\t107.5\t109.1\t112.8\t6.9%\tOBR allowance for shortfall\t0.0\t-3.9\t-7.3\t-7.8\t-8.0\t-8.1\t\tOBR capital DEL forecast\t71.2\t84.6\t94.3\t99.6\t101.1\t104.7\tTotal departmental spending (Total DEL)\t401.5\t449.0\t486.3\t508.1\t526.8\t548.3\t4.0%\t1 Budgeting totals are shown including the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast Allowance for Shortfall.\t2 Resource DEL excluding ring-fenced depreciation is the Treasury's primary control within resource budgets and is the basis on which departmental Spending Review settlements are agreed.

The OBR publishes Public Sector Gross Investment (PSGI) in DEL and AME. A reconciliation is published by the OBR.\t4 DEL in 2019-20 and 2020-21 is reduced by Business Rates Retention pilots that switched spending into AME. To ensure consistency, growth rates for Resource DEL and Capital DEL have been adjusted to reverse this DEL-AME switch.\t5 Resource DEL from 2020-21 onwards is increased by the devolution of areas of welfare spending to the Scottish Government which has caused a decrease in the Block Grant Adjustment and subsequent increase in Resource DEL. To ensure consistency, growth rates for Resource DEL and Capital DEL have been adjusted to reverse this switch.\t6 Capital DEL from 2020-21 onwards includes a provision for the impact of the IFRS16 reclassification of leases on departmental capital budgets. To ensure consistency, growth rates have been adjusted to reverse this provision.1.18  ResourceThe CSR will see an increase in day-to-day spending from \u00a3360.6 billion in 2020-21 to \u00a3417.6 billion by 2023-24. Overall Resource DEL spending will increase by 2.8% per year on average in real terms over the CSR period. Over the Parliament, it will grow by 3.3% on average in real terms. Chart 1.9 shows the real terms growth in day-to-day departmental spending over the forecast period.Chart 1.9: Resource DEL excluding depreciation growth from 2002-03 to 2024-25 (1,2,3,4)1.19  CapitalOver the next five years the public sector will invest \u00a3640 billion, as set out in Table 1.11. This significant increase in spending means that by 2024-25, public sector net investment will be triple the average investment over the last 40 years in real terms, as shown in\u00a0Chart 1.9.This spending will provide world-class infrastructure and public services, delivering value for money and focussing on efficient delivery. The CSR will allocate capital funding for projects across the UK to drive growth, level up economic opportunity, decarbonise the economy, and maintain and build high quality public infrastructure, including schools and hospitals. The Budget sets out plans to increase public R&D investment to \u00a322 billion per year by 2024-25, taking public spending on R&D to 0.8% of GDP.These allocations will be informed by early findings from the review of HM Treasury\u2019s Green Book, which will consider how the design and use of project appraisal affects the ability of all areas to achieve their economic potential. The review will enhance the strategic development and assessment of projects, consider how to assess and present local impacts and look to develop new analytical methods for transformative or place-based interventions. It will also consider how project approval decisions are being made and provide clearer guidance and support to practitioners. The government will work with users, academics and others, and a revised Green Book will be published alongside the CSR.Chart 1.10: Public sector net investment from 1980-81 to 2024-251.20  Total managed expenditureThese firm decisions on the Departmental Expenditure Limits (DEL) envelope for the CSR mean that the average annual real growth of Total Managed Expenditure (TME), the total amount of money that the government spends through departments, local authorities, other public bodies and social security, will be 1.9% between 2019-20 and 2024-25. Table 1.11 sets out planned TME, public sector current expenditure (PSCE) and public sector gross investment (PSGI) up to 2024-25. Chart 1.11 which shows the change in government spending as a share of GDP over time, shows that tough decisions made in the aftermath of the financial crisis have restored the public finances to health and the government can now afford to invest more in public services and growing the economy.Government spending is now set to be 40.7% of GDP in 2024-25. TME as a percentage of GDP has also increased because of classification and methodology changes that have impacted underlying spending, in particular those relating to student loans, public sector pensions and depreciation.[footnote 23] These are technical revisions that have been applied to the entire time series of data to ensure comparison to other years can be done on an equal basis.Table 1.11: Total Managed Expenditure(1) from 2019-20 to 2024-25 (\u00a3 billion, unless otherwise stated)\t\t2019-20\t2020-21\t2021-22\t2022-23\t2023-24\t2024-25\tCurrent expenditure\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\tResource AME\t426.5\t421.6\t433.5\t443.4\t453.2\t464.7\tResource DEL excluding depreciation\t330.4\t360.6\t384.6\t400.7\t417.6\t435.5\tRing-fenced depreciation\t30.8\t33.6\t35.9\t37.4\t39.0\t40.6\tTotal public sector current expenditure\t787.7\t815.8\t854.1\t881.5\t909.9\t940.8\tCapital expenditure\tCapital AME\t33.6\t30.4\t26.6\t26.9\t28.5\t29.2\tCapital DEL excluding financial transactions\t65.5\t81.6\t96.7\t102.3\t106.5\t110.2\tTotal public sector gross investment\t99.1\t111.9\t123.3\t129.2\t135.0\t139.4\tTotal managed expenditure\t886.8\t927.7\t977.4\t1010.7\t1044.9\t1080.2\tTotal managed expenditure % of GDP\t39.8%\t40.3%\t40.8%\t40.8%\t40.8%\t40.7%\t1 Budgeting totals are shown including the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast Allowance for Shortfall.

A reconciliation is published by the OBR.Chart 1.11: Total Managed Expenditure (% GDP) from 1990-91 to 2024-251.21  Allocations for the Comprehensive Spending ReviewChapter 2 of this document sets out further detail on the allocations made at the Budget. The overall allocations of total resource and capital funding over the CSR period will be determined at the CSR in July.The CSR will prioritise:\t    levelling up economic opportunity across all nations and regions of the country by investing in infrastructure, innovation and people, to drive productivity and spread opportunity  \t    improving outcomes in public services, including supporting the NHS and taking steps to cut crime and ensure every young person receives a superb education  \t    strengthening the UK\u2019s place in the world  \t    reducing carbon emissions and improving the natural environment  All new spending will be accompanied by a rigorous new focus on outcomes. To support this the government is conducting an exercise across departments to identify savings and projects that do not provide value for money or support these priorities. The government will redirect this spending through the CSR to help achieve its priorities. The CSR will also set out plans to improve the use of data, science and technology across the public sector, and to ensure all programmes are supported by robust implementation and evaluation plans.In conducting the CSR, the government will also build on the lessons of previous spending reviews and ensure that policy issues are considered across departmental boundaries to maximise the effectiveness and value for money of government spending. The Budget announces the first allocation from the Shared Outcomes Fund to pilot improved approaches to supporting adults with complex needs. This fund was established at Spending Round 2019 to pilot new programmes to build an evidence base and test new ways of working collaboratively across the public sector. Further details on this bid can be found in\u00a0Chapter 2.The CSR will be informed by the Integrated Security, Defence, Development and Diplomacy Review (Integrated Review). The government intends to publish the main conclusions of the Integrated Review alongside the CSR.At the CSR the government will set out funding to meet commitments to replace the Common Agricultural Policy and EU structural funds. The government may also choose to participate in certain EU programmes, where it is in UK interests and the contributions are fair and appropriate.1.22  Improving public services1.23  Priority outcomes and evaluationThe government\u2019s spending plans provide for significant real increases in spending on public services. It is crucial that increased government funding leads to real-world improvements that make a difference to people\u2019s lives. At the CSR, the government will establish a new approach to link departments\u2019 spending proposals to the outcomes they intend to achieve as part of a new Public Value Framework (PVF).[footnote 24]The government is developing the medium- to long-term priority outcomes that it is seeking to deliver for priorities such as levelling up, as well as the metrics that will be used to measure and improve performance against these outcomes. Assessment of spending\u2019s impact on these priority outcomes will be central to making spending decisions at the CSR. These priority outcomes and metrics will be published as part of the CSR and will include cross-cutting outcomes in areas where closer working between departments could help achieve better results.In order to ensure government programmes deliver for the public, it is crucial that spending decisions are based on robust evidence and evaluation of their impact. At the CSR, the government will assess the state of evaluation across all departmental spending programmes and require every department to produce plans to improve evaluation of its work. This will lead to more evidence-based allocation of public funding and better outcomes in the long term.These reforms will ensure that spending decisions are based on the delivery of outcomes and will put the UK at the forefront of international approaches to driving public value. This will help the government provide world-class public services and the best value for taxpayers\u2019 money.1.24  Public representationsThroughout the CSR the government will engage with all regions and nations of the UK to ensure that its policies level up and spread opportunity. The government has started this engagement at Budget by launching a process for individuals and organisations to submit written CSR representations to HM Treasury.1.25  Financial transactionsSome policy measures do not directly affect PSNB in the same way as conventional spending or taxation. These include financial transactions, which predominantly affect the central government net cash requirement (CGNCR) and public sector net debt (PSND).

To reflect the additional powers devolved to the Scottish and Welsh Governments their block grants will be adjusted as set out in their respective fiscal frameworks. This includes a substantial increase in the Scottish Government\u2019s block grant to reflect the additional welfare responsibilities being devolved from April 2020. The Scottish and Welsh Governments have already set provisional budgets for 2020-2021 using block grant adjustments based on previous OBR forecasts. They have been given the choice of taking on the updated block grant adjustments following the UK Budget or waiting for the outturn reconciliation processes that will take place after the end of 2020-2021.While all block grant funding remains in DEL, the Scottish Government now has such substantial self-funding powers (from taxation, borrowing and reserves) that its spending is recorded in Annually Managed Expenditure (AME).1.27  Welfare capThe welfare cap was introduced in 2014 to limit the amount spent on certain social security benefits and tax credits. It improves Parliamentary accountability for welfare spending and supports the government\u2019s aim of ensuring the welfare system is sustainable.The cap was last reset at Autumn Budget 2017, following the OBR\u2019s judgement that the government had successfully met the terms of the welfare cap set at Autumn Statement 2016. The cap applies to spending within its scope in 2022-23, with a 3% margin of flexibility to manage unavoidable fluctuations in spending.In accordance with the Charter for Budget Responsibility, as is mandated for the first fiscal event of the Parliament, the OBR has formally assessed spending against the welfare cap in its \u2018Economic and fiscal outlook\u2019. Total relevant spending is forecast to be within the welfare cap and margin, and so the fiscal rule is judged to have been met with \u00a33.4 billion of headroom.The government is now required to reset the welfare cap for the new Parliament. The cap will be based on the OBR\u2019s Budget forecast of the benefits and tax credits in scope, as set out in Annex B, and will apply to spending in 2024-25. In the interim years, progress towards the cap will be managed internally, based on monitoring by HM Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) of the OBR\u2019s welfare spending forecasts. As before, there will be a margin rising to 3% above the forecast to manage unavoidable fluctuations in spending. The cap will be breached if spending exceeds the cap plus the margin at the point of assessment. Performance against the cap will be formally assessed by the OBR at the first fiscal event of the next Parliament. This will avoid the government having to make short-term responses to changes in the welfare forecast, while ensuring welfare spending remains sustainable in the medium\u00a0term.Table 1.13: New welfare cap (in \u00a3 billion, unless otherwise stated)\t\t2019-20\t2020-21\t2021-22\t2022-23\t2023-24\t2024-25\tCap\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t137.2\tInterim pathway\t119.3\t125.7\t127.5\t130.5\t133.8\t-\tMargin (%)\t0.5\t1.0\t1.5\t2.0\t2.5\t3.0\tCap, pathway and margin\t119.9\t127.0\t129.5\t133.1\t137.1\t141.3\tSource: HM Treasury.1.28  Debt and reserves managementThe government\u2019s financing plans for 2020-21 are summarised in Annex A. They are set out in full in the \u2018Debt management report 2020-21\u2019, published alongside the Budget.1.29  Supporting those affected by COVID-19Since emerging in China in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread widely, with a significant number of cases reported worldwide, including an increasing number in the UK.\u00a0The impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on the UK economy is highly uncertain, and while the effect could prove significant, it is expected to be temporary.\u00a0As an open economy, the UK will be affected because of the wider impacts the outbreak is having on the global economy. In a domestic outbreak, there could also be direct economic impacts in the UK driven by health-related factors, including how many people are infected and the persistence of any outbreak. Disruption could include temporary absences from work and interruptions to global supply chains, both of which would constrain the UK\u2019s productive capacity for a temporary period. In addition, the economy could be affected by demand-side impacts through a reduction in consumer spending, and lower business investment and exports. The government\u2019s Action Plan on Coronavirus sets out the potential scale of these effects in the event of a severe outbreak.\u00a0The government recognises that people will be concerned about the impact COVID-19 could have on their lives, and some businesses will be concerned about reduced demand, potential disruptions to supply chains and export markets, and to their workforce during this temporary period. Therefore, the Budget announces a three-point plan to provide support for:\t    public services  \t    individuals  \t    businesses  The plan includes a range of timely, targeted and temporary measures to deliver support when and where it is needed, at a total cost of \u00a312 billion. The wider Budget policy decisions set out in Table 2.1 represent \u00a318 billion of additional government spending, which will provide support to the economy. Together, the government is taking \u00a330 billion of policy action in 2020\u201121, equivalent to approximately 1.3% of GDP.\u00a0In addition to the measures set out here, the government will continue to monitor the situation and stands ready to provide further support, should it be needed. Support will be available for as long as it is needed, based on the latest scientific evidence. HM Treasury will continue to work closely with the Bank of England to coordinate the response of the UK authorities to ensure it is as effective as possible.The government is working closely with the devolved administrations on this issue and it stands ready to provide further support. Where measures do not apply UK-wide, the devolved administrations will receive a share of any additional funding for support in devolved areas through the Barnett Formula. As set out in the Statement of Funding Policy the devolved administrations can also access the Reserve where they are unable to manage any disproportionate costs from their own resources.The government welcomes the statement by UK Finance on behalf of the sector which announced that banks, building societies and credit card providers are ready and able to offer support to consumers, including offering or increasing an overdraft or allowing repayment relief for loan or mortgage repayments. Banks and other providers of SME finance will also provide support for businesses that are facing cash flow disruption and stand ready to help when\u00a0needed.\u00a0Tackling COVID-19 is a global challenge. To complement its domestic response, the UK is leading the way to ensure a swift and effective global response, including by working closely with all our international partners and supporting the most vulnerable countries to deal with the impacts of the virus, including cooperating closely with counterparts in the G7 and G20.\u00a0The Chancellor will continue to co-operate closely with his counterparts in the G7 and G20. G20 Finance Ministers last week committed to monitoring the evolution of COVID-19 including its impact on markets and economic conditions, and highlighted their readiness to take further actions to aid in the response to the virus, support the economy and maintain the resilience of the financial system.1.30  Support for public servicesPublic safety is the government\u2019s top priority in its response to COVID-19. The government will ensure that public services receive the funding they need to respond to the outbreak as the situation develops. This includes continuing to ensure our health services have the resources they need to respond.COVID-19 response fund \u2013 HM Treasury is creating an emergency response fund, set aside to ensure the National Health Service (NHS) and other public services have the resources they need to tackle the impacts of COVID-19. Initially set at \u00a35 billion, it will fund pressures in the NHS, support local authorities to manage pressures on social care and support vulnerable people, and help deal with pressures on other public services. The size of the fund will be reviewed as the situation develops, to ensure all necessary resources are made available.\u00a0Funding for research and development \u2013 The government is providing the National Institute for Health Research with \u00a330 million of new funding to enable further rapid research into the disease. Research is essential in order to understand COVID-19, and it will inform how the NHS frontline service approach tackling the virus. The funding could also allow rapid screening of potential therapeutics and support clinical trials to inform treatment and improve patient outcomes.Funding for diagnostic testing \u2013 The government will increase the capacity and capability of diagnostic testing and surveillance facilitated by Public Health England to support the NHS, by providing an additional \u00a310 million of new funding to DHSC.1.31  Support for individualsThe Budget announces measures to support people who are unable to work because of\u00a0COVID-19.Eligibility for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) \u2013 The Prime Minister has already announced that the forthcoming COVID-19 Bill will temporarily allow SSP to be paid from the first day of sickness absence, rather than the fourth day, for people who have COVID-19 or have to self\u2011isolate, in accordance with government guidelines. The Budget sets out a further package to widen the scope of SSP and make it more accessible. The government will temporarily extend SSP to cover:\t    individuals who are unable to work because they have been advised to self-isolate  \t    people caring for those within the same household who display COVID-19 symptoms and have been told to self-isolate  Medical Evidence for SSP \u2013 The government has already issued guidance to employers, advising them to use their discretion not to require a GP fit note for COVID-19 related absences. This Budget announces that the government and the NHS will bring forward a temporary alternative to the fit note in the coming weeks which can be used for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. This system will enable people who are advised to self-isolate to obtain a notification via NHS111 which they can use as evidence for absence from work, where necessary. This notification would meet employers\u2019 need for evidence, whilst taking pressure away from General Practices.Support for those ineligible for SSP \u2013 The government recognises that self-employed people and employees below the Lower Earnings Limit are not entitled to SSP. The best system of financial support for these people is the welfare system and, in particular, \u2018new style\u2019 Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit. The government is committed to supporting these groups, and the Budget announces further support by making it quicker and easier to receive benefits:\t    \u2018New style\u2019 Employment and Support Allowance will be payable for people directly affected by COVID-19 or self-isolating according to government advice for from the first day of sickness, rather than the eighth day\u00a0  \t    people will be able to claim Universal Credit and access advance payments where they are directly affected by COVID-19 (or self-isolating), without the current requirement to attend a jobcentre  \t    for the duration of the outbreak, the requirements of the minimum income floor in Universal Credit will be temporarily relaxed for those directly affected by COVID-19 or self-isolating according to government advice for duration of the outbreak, ensuring self\u2011employed claimants will be compensated for losses in income  Hardship Fund \u2013 The government will provide Local Authorities in England with \u00a3500\u00a0million of new grant funding to support economically vulnerable people and households in their local area. The government expects most of this funding to be used to provide more council tax relief, either through existing Local Council Tax Support schemes, or through complementary reliefs.\u00a01.32  Support for businessesSome businesses may experience increased costs or disruptions to their cash flow as a result of COVID-19. The Budget announces a set of measures to provide support to businesses during this temporary period by either reducing their costs or bridging cashflow problems arising from the outbreak, and to protect people\u2019s jobs.\u00a0Statutory Sick Pay \u2013 The government will support small and medium-sized businesses and employers to cope with the extra costs of paying COVID-19 related SSP by refunding eligible SSP costs. The eligibility criteria for the scheme are as follows:\t    this refund will be limited to two weeks per employee  \t    employers with fewer than 250 employees will be eligible. The size of an employer will be determined by the number of people they employed as of 28 February 2020  \t    employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19  \t    employers should maintain records of staff absences, but should not require employees to provide a GP fit note  \t    the eligible period for the scheme will commence from the day on which the regulations extending SSP to self-isolators come into force  \t    while existing systems are not designed to facilitate such employer refunds for SSP, the government will work with employers over the coming months to set up a repayment mechanism for employers as soon as possible  Business Rates Reliefs \u2013 The government has already announced the Business Rates retail discount will be increased to 50% in 2020-21. To support small businesses affected by COVID-19 the government is increasing it further to 100% for 2020-21. The relief will also be expanded to the leisure and hospitality sectors. These temporary measures, taken together with existing Small Business Rates Relief, mean that around 900,000 properties, or 45% of all properties in England, will receive 100% business rates relief in 2020-21. The government has also already announced the introduction of a \u00a31,000 Business Rates discount for pubs with a rateable value below \u00a3100,000 in England for one year from 1 April 2020. To support pubs in response to COVID-19 the discount will be increased to \u00a35,000. Local authorities will be fully compensated for these Business Rates measures.Small business grant funding \u2013 The government recognises that many small businesses pay little or no business rates because of Small Business Rate Relief (SBRR). To support those businesses, the government will provide \u00a32.2 billion of funding for Local authorities in England. This will provide \u00a33,000 to around 700,000 business currently eligible for SBRR or Rural Rate Relief, to help meet their ongoing business costs. For a property with a rateable value of \u00a312,000, this is one quarter of their rateable value, or comparable to 3 months of rent. Most properties that are eligible for SBRR will have a lower rateable value, and so this will represent an even greater proportion of their annual rent.Time to Pay \u2013 The government will ensure that businesses and self-employed individuals in financial distress and with outstanding tax liabilities receive support with their tax affairs. Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has set up a dedicated COVID-19 helpline to help those in need, and they may be able to agree a bespoke Time to Pay arrangement. Time to Pay was successfully used in response to flooding and the financial crisis, giving businesses a time-limited deferral period on HMRC liabilities owed and a pre-agreed time period to pay these back. These tailored arrangements will give a business the time it needs to pay HMRC to support their recovery while operating through any temporary financial challenges that occur. To ensure ongoing support, HMRC have made a further 2,000 experienced call handlers available to support firms when needed. HMRC will also waive late payment penalties and interest where a business experiences administrative difficulties contacting HMRC or paying taxes due to\u00a0COVID-19.\u00a0Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme \u2013 The government will launch a new, temporary Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, delivered by the British Business Bank, to support businesses to access bank lending and overdrafts. The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to a per lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs. The government will not charge businesses or banks for this guarantee, and the Scheme will support loans of up to \u00a31.2\u00a0million in value. This new guarantee will initially support up to \u00a31 billion of lending on top of current support offered through the British Business Bank.1.33  International responseThe government has already committed \u00a391 million to the international response. The Budget makes available \u00a3150 million from the UK\u2019s ODA budget to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT), of which \u00a375 million is an immediate commitment. This demonstrates that the UK can use its ODA budget to directly support our national interest. The government stands ready to provide further support as the situation develops, playing our full part in a well-coordinated global response.Alongside the Budget, the government has published information about the support available to individuals and businesses whose finances are affected by COVID-19. This information, which will be regularly updated as the situation develops, can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-those-affected-by-covid-19.\u00a01.34  Investing in excellent public servicesThe government is delivering world-class public services for hard-working people across the UK. The Budget builds on the significant investment in public services made at Spending Round 2019, with action to make the UK a safer, healthier place to live.1.35  Investing in the NHS\u00a0The NHS is the government\u2019s number one spending priority. The NHS settlement, confirmed in January 2019, provided the largest cash increase in public services since the Second World War \u2013 an additional \u00a334 billion per year by 2023-24.[footnote 25] Spending Round 2019 confirmed the government\u2019s commitment to the NHS, with \u00a3139 billion for health budgets in 2020\u201121.[footnote 26] The Budget provides over \u00a36 billion of further funding to strengthen the NHS in England and pay for vital services that will improve people\u2019s health, reaffirming the government\u2019s commitment to health and social care.\u00a0The government will invest to increase staffing, making sure that the NHS has the people it needs. This will include a significant funding package to improve the recruitment, training and retention of nurses in England, ensuring there are 50,000 more in the NHS; and for the recruitment, training and retention of up to 6,000 more GPs and 6,000 more primary care professionals in England, such as physiotherapists and pharmacists. This will create 50 million more GP surgery appointments a year. The government will also change pensions tax rules to ensure that NHS staff across the UK, including senior doctors, whose income is less than \u00a3200,000 can work additional hours for the NHS without their annual allowance being reduced. (7)The government will invest in our hospitals, including over \u00a3100 million in 2020\u201121 to make progress on 40 new hospital projects, as part of a long-term programme of investment in health infrastructure to ensure the NHS has world-class facilities for patients.[footnote 27] This will be accompanied by an increase in DHSC\u2019s capital budget of \u00a3683\u00a0million in the 2020-21 financial year to protect the level of NHS operational capital investment. This will allow Trusts to continue to invest in important capital projects such as estate refurbishments and building maintenance. (5)To ensure that new arrivals to the UK contribute to the funding of the NHS, the Immigration Health Surcharge will be increased to \u00a3624. The government will also introduce a new discounted rate of \u00a3470 for children in recognition of the increased financial impact on family\u00a0groups. (6)The government is committed to long-term reform of adult social care and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has written to parliamentarians to begin building cross-party consensus on reform. Ahead of those discussions, the government will invest \u00a31 billion of additional funding for social care next year, as announced at Spending Round 2019. The Budget confirms that this additional funding will continue for every year of the current Parliament to continue to stabilise the system.1.36  Supporting schools and young people\u00a0At Spending Round 2019, the government committed to a \u00a37.1 billion cash increase in funding for schools in England by 2022-23, compared to 2019-20 budgets. This funding settlement included an increase to minimum per-pupil funding levels, a commitment now enshrined in law.[footnote 28] The minimum per pupil amount will increase to \u00a33,750 for primary schools and \u00a35,000 for secondary schools in 2020-21, with the primary schools minimum then rising to \u00a34,000 in 2021-22.[footnote 29] The settlement also provides for \u00a3780 million extra in 2020-21 to support children and young people with special educational needs, to ensure all can reach their\u00a0potential.On average, schools will see an increase of over 4% in funding per pupil compared to 2019\u201120 budgets.[footnote 30] The three-year settlement will also allow the government to raise starting salaries for teachers to \u00a330,000 by September 2022.\u00a0This funding settlement reflects the government\u2019s commitment to high quality education for all school children.\u00a0The Budget sets out new steps the government is taking to support children to have the opportunity of an active and enriching school experience.To ensure that children get an active start in life, the government will bring forward an updated School Sport and Activity Action Plan following the Comprehensive Spending Review. Ahead of that, the Budget provides \u00a329 million a year by 2023-24 to support primary school PE teaching and help schools make best use of their sports facilities. The funding will support high quality teacher training and professional development for PE, informed by best practice PE teaching.\u00a0The government also believes in the benefits of participating in the arts and the essential role it plays in all children\u2019s education. The Budget provides \u00a390 million a year to introduce an Arts Premium from September 2021, averaging out as an extra \u00a325,000 a year per secondary school for three years.[footnote 31] The funding will help schools to provide high quality arts programmes and extracurricular activities for pupils, including those delivered in partnership with arts organisations, as well as supporting teachers to deliver engaging and creative lessons in the arts.\u00a01.37  Ensuring people\u2019s safety and securityProtecting people and keeping them safe from crime and other threats is a principal responsibility of any government. The government announced an extra \u00a3750 million of funding at the 2019 Spending Round to begin the recruitment of 20,000 additional police officers, with the first 6,000 officers to be recruited by March 2021. The Budget makes further important investments in the police, security services and justice system.In addition, the Budget will include \u00a3114 million in 2020-21 for counter-terrorism, to maintain capability and officer numbers in the face of a changing terrorist threat. This includes an extra \u00a383 million for counter-terrorism policing, in addition to the government\u2019s police recruitment commitment, and \u00a331 million for the UK Intelligence Community. The government will also provide an additional \u00a367 million for the UK Intelligence Community which will enable them to develop further their world\u2011leading technological capabilities to protect the UK\u2019s security and help keep the country safe. (9)The government is committed to increasing support for victims of crime in their experience of the criminal justice system. The government will provide an additional \u00a315\u00a0million to improve our offer to victims. This will boost the support available to victims of rape and create a new digital hub to make the criminal justice process in England and Wales easier to understand. The government will also provide an additional \u00a35 million to begin a trial of domestic abuse courts in England and Wales, allowing criminal and family matters to be considered together. To protect victims of severe domestic abuse and their children and reduce the number of serial perpetrators, the government will provide \u00a310 million for innovative new approaches to preventing domestic abuse, working with Police and Crime Commissioners to expand projects like the \u201cDrive\u201d prevention programme.\u00a0The Budget contains an additional \u00a35 million for the Youth Endowment Fund to support the creation of a Centre of Excellence for Tackling Youth Violence. This will create a single evidence hub on what works to divert young people away from criminal activity and improve the effectiveness of our wider investments in crime reduction, including the work of the Youth Endowment Fund and violence reduction units. The Budget will also provide \u00a368.5 million to toughen community sentences, including by increasing the number of offenders who are required to wear an electronic tag.\u00a0The government will also provide \u00a320 million for Fire and Rescue Services to enable them to increase fire inspection and enforcement capability and to build capacity to respond to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry\u2019s findings, by investing in training, equipment and a stronger strategic centre for the fire service.\u00a01.38  Improving local services and infrastructureThe government is committed to supporting the work of local authorities, in delivering high quality local services in communities across the country. The 2020-21 local government finance settlement enables a 6.3% nominal increase in councils\u2019 Core Spending Power.[footnote 32]Local authorities also invest billions of pounds of capital finance every year in their communities. The government supports this activity, in part, by offering low cost loans through the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB). However, in recent years a minority of councils have used this cheap finance to buy very significant amounts of commercial property for rental income, which reduces the availability of PWLB finance for core local authority activities. To address this the government will consult on revising the terms of PWLB lending to ensure LAs continue to invest in housing, infrastructure and front-line services. To further enable high quality investment by local authorities, the government is cutting the interest rates for investment in social housing by 1 percentage point, and making an extra \u00a31.15\u00a0billion of discounted loans available for local infrastructure projects. (11)Further details and additional announcements relating to public services can be found in Chapter 2.1.39  Levelling up and getting Britain buildingThe Budget sets out the next stage of the government\u2019s comprehensive plan to level up opportunity and share prosperity across the UK. The only sustainable way to drive economic growth and improve living standards in every corner of the country is to boost productivity. The government is therefore investing in people and places \u2013 by taking the first steps in its plan to level up skills across the country, ahead of setting out further details at the CSR, and by committing record levels of investment to infrastructure that will directly support productivity. These actions will boost national growth as well as addressing economic and social disparities and restoring the fabric of our towns and cities.\u00a01.40  InfrastructureInfrastructure underpins the economy: it is essential for markets to function effectively, it supports jobs, attracts investment, and it matters to families, communities, towns and cities. Later in the spring the government will publish a landmark National Infrastructure Strategy which will set out plans for a once in a generation transformation of the UK\u2019s economic infrastructure.1.41  Strategic transport projectsThe government is transforming regional connections through the largest ever investment in England\u2019s motorways and major A roads.[footnote 33] The second Road Investment Strategy (RIS2) will spend over \u00a327 billion between 2020 and 2025. It will take forward schemes such as dualling the A66 Trans-Pennine and upgrading the A46 Newark bypass to address congestion, and building the Lower Thames Crossing to increase road capacity across the Thames east of London by 90%.[footnote 34] RIS2 will be delivered alongside the government\u2019s plans for decarbonising the transport sector, which are set out in the \u2018Growing a greener economy\u2019 section of this chapter.\u00a0The government is also investing \u00a320 million to develop the Midlands Rail Hub, progressing plans for a major programme of improvements to rail services across these regions.\u00a01.42  Local transportThe government intends to make an unprecedented investment in urban transport, starting by confirming allocations of over \u00a31 billion from the Transforming Cities Fund. This will deliver a range of local transport schemes, including an iconic new Central Park Bridge in Plymouth, a significant increase in the capacity of the Tyne and Wear Metro, and new cycleways in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. In line with the government\u2019s priorities, this will also include around \u00a3800 million for bus and cycling infrastructure.\u00a0Building on the Transforming Cities Fund, the government will also provide \u00a34.2\u00a0billion from 2022-23 for five-year funding settlements for eight Mayoral Combined Authorities (in West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, Liverpool City Region, Tyne and Wear, West of England, Sheffield City Region and Tees Valley). While it will be for elected Mayors to put forward ambitious plans, the government would welcome the opportunity to support a range of schemes, such as the renewal of the Sheffield Supertram, the development of a modern, low-carbon metro network for West Yorkshire and tram-train pilots in Greater Manchester. As a first step, the government will open discussions with Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region and the West Midlands in the coming months.\u00a0The government also intends to deliver better local transport for towns, rural areas and other cities. In February, the Prime Minister announced \u00a35 billion of new funding for buses and cycling. Further details will be announced at the CSR, alongside a National Bus Strategy.\u00a0Well-maintained roads are important for all road users, including cyclists and bus passengers. To that end, the Budget announces a new Potholes Fund that will provide \u00a3500 million a year, resulting in a 50% increase to local road maintenance budgets in 2020\u201121. Furthermore, the Budget confirms the development of 15 local road upgrades across the country, helping to reduce congestion, improve journey times and unlock housing and employment opportunities in England. These include junction improvements to the A350 in Wiltshire, a link road connecting Chesterfield to Staveley, and a dual carriageway in\u00a0Warwickshire.\u00a0The CSR will set out further plans for investment in local transport spending. To inform these plans,\u00a0the Infrastructure and Projects Authority\u00a0will\u00a0lead a study, working with departments,\u00a0into supply chain capacity, to assess how industry can best deliver the government\u2019s ambition.1.43  Digital connectivityInvestment in broadband has had significant benefits to the UK economy.[footnote 35] Forty times faster than standard superfast broadband, gigabit broadband provides a step change in the UK\u2019s digital connectivity. The government is committing \u00a35 billion to support the rollout of gigabit-capable broadband in the most difficult to reach 20% of the country, so that all areas are able to benefit. This investment will level up connectivity across the UK, particularly in rural areas.\u00a0As part of over \u00a31 billion that the government has already committed to next generation digital infrastructure, the Budget announces the next seven areas that have successfully bid for funding from the third wave of the Local Full Fibre Networks Challenge Fund: North of Tyne (\u00a312 million), South Wales (\u00a312 million), Tay Cities (\u00a36.7 million), Pembrokeshire (\u00a34 million), Plymouth (\u00a33 million), Essex and Hertfordshire (\u00a32.1 million) and East Riding of Yorkshire (\u00a31\u00a0million).\u00a0In too many places, phone reception is not good enough and people lack choice of mobile provider. The Budget announces that the Shared Rural Network agreement has been finalised between the government and industry. The government will commit up to \u00a3510 million of funding, which will be more than matched by industry. This means 95% of the UK\u2019s landmass will have high quality 4G mobile coverage by 2025.1.44  Flooding and waterFlooding has a devastating impact on homes, businesses and communities, and the government is currently investing \u00a32.6 billion in flood defences to ensure they are better protected. This winter, the Environment Agency\u2019s flood defences protected 127,000 properties.[footnote 36]\u00a0However, the twin pressures of climate change and population growth mean that further action is needed. The government will double the amount it invests in the flood and coastal defence programme in England to \u00a35.2 billion over six years, better protecting a further 336,000 homes and non-residential properties. According to Environment Agency modelling, this will reduce national flood risk by up to 11% by 2027. This doubling of funding exceeds the level of investment recommended by the National Infrastructure Commission.\u00a0The government is also making available \u00a3120 million to the Environment Agency to repair the assets damaged by the storms this winter.\u00a0Where flooding and coastal erosion is inevitable, further action is needed to ensure that communities can respond and recover more quickly. The government will provide \u00a3200\u00a0million over the next six years for a place-based resilience programme. This will support over 25\u00a0local areas,\u00a0urban, rural and coastal, from the North, the Midlands and the South, to take forward wider innovative actions that improve their resilience to flooding and coastal erosion. Areas will be selected based on a range of criteria, including repeated significant flooding in the\u00a0past.Climate change also makes it even more important that water resources are properly managed and conserved. The government will invest \u00a339 million in the Environment Agency\u2019s network of water supply and water navigation assets.\u00a0As floods do not respect national boundaries, it is right that the devolved administrations will benefit from the Barnett consequentials of this substantial increase in government investment in flood and water infrastructure.\u00a01.45  Housing\u00a0Everyone should be able to access a safe and affordable home. Increasing housing supply is essential to creating a fairer, more affordable housing market and boosting productivity across the country.The government has made good progress in boosting housing supply with over 240,000\u00a0new homes created in 2018-19, the highest level in 32 years.[footnote 37],[footnote 38] To continue to support the country\u2019s needs the government has committed to creating at least 1\u00a0million new homes in England by the end of this Parliament and an average of 300,000\u00a0homes a year by the\u00a0mid\u20112020s.The Budget sets out an ambitious package of investment to build the high quality and affordable homes the country needs. This includes \u00a312.2 billion for the Affordable Homes Programme and \u00a3400 million for ambitious Mayoral Combined Authorities and local areas to establish housing on brownfield land across the country. The Budget also confirms allocations from the Housing Infrastructure Fund totalling \u00a31.1 billion for nine different areas including Manchester, South Sunderland and South Lancaster.\u00a0Land availability, as constrained by the planning system, is the most significant barrier to building more houses. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government will shortly set out comprehensive reforms to bring the planning system into the 21st century, followed by a Planning White Paper in the spring. These reforms will aim to create a simpler planning system and improve the capacity, capability and performance of Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) to accelerate the development process. Where LPAs fail to meet their local housing need, there will be firm consequences, including a stricter approach taken to the release of land for development and greater government intervention. The government will also explore long-term reforms to the planning system, rethinking planning from first principles, to ensure the system is providing more certainty to the public, LPAs and developers.1.46  SkillsSupporting people to improve their skills is a vital part of the government\u2019s aim to level up opportunity across the country. Increasing productivity depends on improving the skills levels of this generation and the next. Achieving this will require vocational and technical education that genuinely responds to the needs of business and the country as a whole. The government will confirm its plans on skills at the CSR. But the first steps come now.Further education should be at the forefront of providing all learners with the opportunity and tools to progress into skilled employment. At Spending Round 2019, the government increased day-to-day spending on further education by \u00a3400 million in 2020-21, recognising its vital role in equipping people with the skills they need to succeed.The Budget goes further, providing \u00a31.5 billion over 5 years (\u00a31.8 billion inclusive of indicative Barnett consequentials) in capital investment to ensure that all further education college estates are in good condition. This investment will ensure that colleges have cutting-edge facilities to train people for jobs in the industries of the future, and is part of the government\u2019s plan to upgrade the nation\u2019s infrastructure.\u00a0Alongside this, adult skills provision must improve to meet the needs of people and business now and in the future. To address this issue, the government has committed to a new \u00a32.5 billion (\u00a33 billion inclusive of indicative Barnett consequentials) National Skills Fund to improve the technical skills of adults across the\u00a0country.\u00a0The government will consult widely in the spring on how to target this fund most effectively, before confirming details at the CSR. The government wants to hear directly from people and employers across England to understand what works in the current system and what does not, and to ensure that the fund is focused on helping people gain the skills they need for rewarding, well-paid jobs.More broadly, the government wants to facilitate two culture changes with this fund: for individuals to be able to train and retrain over the course of their lifetimes; and for employers and the government to increase investment and fill the skills gaps that hold back productivity at a local, regional and national level.\u00a0Apprenticeships also provide the opportunity for people to learn valuable skills and get good jobs. Since its introduction in April 2017, the Apprenticeship Levy has enabled the government to raise the standard of apprenticeships, supporting employers to make a long\u2011term, sustainable investment in training. The government will now look at how to improve the working of the Apprenticeship Levy, to support large and small employers in meeting the long-term skills needs of the economy. In the meantime, the government will ensure that sufficient funding is made available in 2020-21 to support an increase in the number of new high-quality apprenticeships in small- and medium-sized businesses.1.47  Growth across the countryThe growth of every region and nation in the UK is important for boosting the economy and creating a strong and inclusive society. In addition, the government will publish an English Devolution White Paper in the summer, setting out how it intends to meet its ambition for full devolution across England.Towns are home to some of our key businesses and employers. This is why the government has already set up the \u00a33.6 billion Towns Fund to support the regeneration of high streets, town centres and local economies. The government is also supporting our ports, which are major hubs for trade, innovation and commerce \u2013 it has launched a consultation on creating up to 10 new Freeports that will work for all of the UK.The Budget goes further to support places, regions and nations to grow. As part of this the government has agreed a devolution deal with West Yorkshire to establish a Mayoral Combined Authority with a directly-elected Mayor from May 2021. This deal will provide \u00a31.1 billion of investment for the area over 30 years, as well as devolving significant new decision-making powers on transport, planning and skills. It also underpins the agreement of a long-term intra-city transport settlement for the region starting in 2022-23. This devolution deal is an important step in delivering on our levelling up agenda by giving power and investment to local areas. As part of this, the government is also providing up to \u00a3500,000\u00a0to support Bradford in its regeneration and development plans to increase the benefits of potential Northern Powerhouse Rail connections.In repatriating the EU structural funds, the government has an historic opportunity to design a UK Shared Prosperity Fund to match domestic priorities. The UK Shared Prosperity Fund will replace the overly bureaucratic EU structural funds, levelling up opportunity in each of the four nations of the country. Funding will be realigned to match domestic priorities, not the EU\u2019s, with a focus on investing in people. At a minimum, it will match current levels of funding for each nation from EU structural funds. The government will set out further plans for the Fund, including at the CSR.\u00a0The Budget also sets out how the government will make decisions differently in future. To ensure the civil service reflects the public it serves, the government is committed to moving 22,000 civil service roles out of central London within the next decade, the vast majority to the other regions and nations of the UK. The government will establish a significant new campus in the north of England focused on economic decision making, which will include teams from HM Treasury, DIT, BEIS and MHCLG. Furthermore, as the UK\u2019s economics and finance ministry HM Treasury will establish representation in all the nations of the UK, building on its existing presence in Scotland with new positions based in Northern Ireland and Wales for the first time.\u00a0A cornerstone of the government\u2019s levelling up agenda is its commitment to regional connectivity. The aviation industry has an important role to play in connecting the nations and regions of the UK. Following the review of Air\u00a0Passenger\u00a0Duty (APD)\u00a0that has been undertaken by HM Treasury, the government will consider the case for changing the APD treatment of domestic flights, such as reintroducing a return leg exemption, and for increasing the number of international distance bands. These considerations will form part of a consultation on aviation tax reform that will be published in spring 2020.1.48  Scotland, Wales and Northern IrelandAs part of its commitment to levelling up the whole of the UK, the government will support economic growth in each of the four nations and will strengthen the ties that bind them into a prosperous United Kingdom. The government will work closely with the devolved administrations on this agenda, especially where it is possible to achieve better outcomes in partnership with Cardiff Bay, Holyrood and Stormont.\u00a0The Budget announces changes across tax, welfare and public spending that apply across the whole of the UK and so will directly benefit people and businesses in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This includes steps to upgrade digital infrastructure, support decarbonisation and reduce tax for employees and the self-employed.Where Budget measures do not apply across all nations, the devolved administrations will receive significant additional funding through the Barnett formula to invest further in public services, infrastructure and other priorities:\u00a0\t    the Scottish Government\u2019s block grant will increase by over \u00a3640 million through to 2020-21 before adjustments for tax devolution\u00a0  \t    the Welsh Government\u2019s block grant will increase by over \u00a3360 million through to 2020-21 before adjustments for tax devolution, this includes a 5% uplift in Barnett consequentials agreed as part of the Welsh Government\u2019s fiscal framework in 2016  \t    the Northern Ireland Executive\u2019s block grant will increase by over \u00a3210 million through to\u00a02020-21  The Budget announces \u00a3242 million to fund a further four City and Growth Deals across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This builds on the \u00a32.5 billion already allocated to existing deals and ensures that every part of Wales and Nothern Ireland benefits from a City or Growth Deal, with another deal that benefits Scotland.The government will also take action to improve cross-border links, including improving transport links between North Wales and England by developing the A483 Pant Llanymynech Bypass, and supporting an independent economic review of the Western Gateway, which stretches across Wales and the west of England.\u00a0The Budget announces further support targeted at each of the nations \u2013 including a package for the whisky industry, action to allow TV channel S4C to recover in full any VAT it pays, and legislation to provide appropriate exemptions for payments for injuries relating to the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\u00a0Additionally, the government is working with the Scottish Government to devolve further tax and welfare powers as set out in the Scotland Act 2016. This includes transferring responsibility to the Scottish Government for around \u00a33 billion of disability benefits in April 2020 and, from 2021, assigning half of the VAT revenues generated in Scotland.\u00a0Further details and additional announcements targeted at levelling up and getting Britain building can be found in Chapter 2.1.49  Supporting people and familiesRecord employment and rising real wages have benefited households across the country.[footnote 39] The OBR forecasts employment to rise by 522,000 by the first quarter of 2025 and wages to outpace inflation in every year of the forecast.[footnote 40] The government\u2019s ambition is to support people and families through a fair and sustainable tax system, that rewards hard work, minimises economic distortions and funds first class public services.The Budget announces a range of measures to improve living standards for people across the UK, delivering on commitments to cut taxes and costs, to put more money in people\u2019s\u00a0pockets.1.50  Helping hard-working people\u00a0The government is committed to keeping taxes low, helping hard-working people keep more of what they earn. In less than a decade, the Personal Allowance has increased by over 90% and has taken 1.7 million individuals out of income tax altogether compared to 2015-16.[footnote 41],[footnote 42] The Budget confirms the government\u2019s commitment to increase the National Insurance contributions (NICs) Primary Threshold and Lower Profits Limit, for employees and the self-employed respectively, to \u00a39,500 from April 2020.[footnote 43] (12)\u00a0This increase will benefit around 31 million people,[footnote 44] with a typical employee saving around \u00a3104 and a typical self-employed person around \u00a378 in 2020-21.[footnote 45] Around 1.1 million people will be taken out of paying Class 1 and Class 4 NICs entirely.[footnote 46] This is the first step in meeting the government\u2019s ambition to increase these thresholds to \u00a312,500, which would save a typical employee over \u00a3450 per year.[footnote 47] Taken together with increases to the National Living Wage (NLW) and previous increases to the Personal Allowance, an employee working full-time on the NLW anywhere in the UK will be over \u00a35,200 better off compared to April 2010.[footnote 48] This reform is in line with the government\u2019s ambition to support hardworking people and families through a fair and sustainable tax system.\u00a0By saving towards their future, families can give children a significant financial asset when they reach adulthood\u00a0\u2013 helping them into further education, training, or work. Junior ISAs (JISAs) and Child Trust Funds (CTFs) are tax-advantaged accounts for children, designed to encourage a long-term savings habit. The Budget announces that the amount families can save into a JISA or CTF will be more than doubled in 2020-21, increasing from \u00a34,368 to \u00a39,000.1.51  Fairer wages for the lowest paidSince its introduction in 2016, the NLW has supported rapid earnings growth for the lowest\u00a0earners. Supported by the NLW, real wages have grown fastest for the lowest paid full\u2013time workers, by 11% above inflation between 2015 and 2019.[footnote 49] Following the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission (LPC), the government announced in December 2019 that it will increase the NLW by 6.2% from \u00a38.21 to \u00a38.72 from April 2020, which is projected to meet its current target of 60% of median earnings by 2020.[footnote 50] In total, the annual gross earnings of a full-time worker on the NLW will have increased by over \u00a33,680 since the introduction of the NLW in April 2016.Chart 1.12: Percentage change in individual full-time employee gross weekly real earnings across the UK, 2015 to 2019, at example percentile pointsThe Budget commits to a new, ambitious target for the NLW to reach two-thirds of median earnings and extending this to workers aged 21 and over by 2024, provided economic conditions allow. This emergency brake will ensure that the lowest-paid workers across the UK continue to see pay rises without significant risks to their employment prospects.1.52  Cutting the cost of livingThe government will introduce legislation to apply a zero rate of VAT to e-publications from 1 December 2020, which will make it clear that e-books, e-newspapers, e-magazines and academic e-journals are entitled to the same VAT treatment as their physical counterparts. The government expects the publishing industry, including e-booksellers, to pass on the benefit of this relief to consumers. It should benefit all who read digitally, including children from poorer backgrounds: nearly 1 in 4 pupils on free school meals read fiction digitally, compared to 1 in 6\u00a0of their peers who are not eligible for free school meals.[footnote 51]In recognition of the rising cost of living, the government will freeze fuel duty for a record tenth year in a row, saving the average car driver a cumulative \u00a31,200 compared to what they would have paid under the pre-2010 fuel duty\u00a0escalator.[footnote 52]\u00a0(13)Now that the UK has left the EU, it can reduce the cost of essential sanitary products for women in the UK. From 1 January 2021, the tampon tax will be abolished through the application of a zero rate of VAT on women\u2019s sanitary products. (17)The Budget also announces that the government will freeze duty rates on beer, spirits, wine and cider, meaning that a pint of beer is 1p cheaper than it would have been if it had risen with inflation.\u00a0The government is announcing a service improvement that will make Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) compatible with school payment agents. This will allow parents of up to 500,000 school-aged children across the UK to access TFC and use it towards the cost of their wraparound childcare. (14)Recognising housing costs are the biggest pressure on household finances for low income households, these measures go alongside other substantial new packages of support to increase housebuilding and improve the affordability of housing, as detailed in Levelling Up and getting Britain building.[footnote 53]1.53  Supporting the most vulnerableThe government is delivering on its commitments to provide a clear route to work and support the most vulnerable through the welfare system. This government is ending the benefit freeze and increasing working age benefits by 1.7% from April 2020. Providing further support for Universal Credit (UC), the government will help ensure claimants can repay debts in a more sustainable and manageable way by reducing the maximum rate at which deductions can be made from a UC award from 30% to 25% of the standard allowance and giving claimants up to 24 months to repay advances.\u00a0The government will give people with disabilities greater certainty over their award levels for longer, by guaranteeing that Personal Independence Payment claimants will not have an award period of less than 18 months. (19)The government will create an entitlement to Neonatal Leave and Pay for employees whose babies spend an extended period of time in neonatal care, providing up to 12 weeks paid leave so that parents do not have to choose between returning to work and taking care of their vulnerable newborn. In addition, the government will consult on the design of a new in\u2011work entitlement for employees with unpaid caring responsibilities, such as for a family member of dependents. (20)The government is committed to helping people in problem debt and, from early 2021, will introduce breathing space. This will provide a period of up to 60 days, where people in problem debt will be protected from enforcement action by their creditors and the charging of further interest and fees on their debts. This includes debts owed to central and local government. To support that, the government will invest an additional \u00a312.5\u00a0million in HMRC in 2020-21 to begin work immediately on the implementation of breathing\u00a0space.\u00a0The government will commit \u00a346 million from the Shared Outcomes Fund to provide improved support to individuals overcoming multiple complex needs, such as homelessness, reoffending and substance misuse.\u00a0Following the Grenfell tragedy, one of the government\u2019s most important objectives is to ensure residents feel safe and secure in their home. Having taken expert advice, the Budget confirms an additional \u00a31 billion to remove unsafe cladding from residential buildings above 18 metres to ensure people feel safe in their homes.\u00a0The government wants to support alternatives to high-cost credit such as payday loans, particularly for the most financially vulnerable consumers, by improving access to social and community lenders. The Budget announces the three winners of the \u00a32 million Affordable Credit Challenge Fund, which is designed to harness the UK\u2019s world-leading fintech expertise to develop tech solutions to the challenges faced by the affordable lending sector, making it easier and quicker to access their products.\u00a0The Budget also announces that the government will provide protection against misleading sales tactics for consumers who are planning for their funeral, ensuring that all pre-paid funeral plan providers are subject to robust regulation by bringing the market within the remit of the FCA.\u00a0The Budget announces that the government will bring forward legislation to protect access to cash and ensure that the UK\u2019s cash infrastructure is sustainable in the long-term.\u00a01.54  Rough SleepingThe government is committed to ending rough sleeping in this Parliament. Government action is already having an impact, with the latest annual count for England published in February showing a 9% fall on the previous year.[footnote 54] The Budget seeks to build on this progress with \u00a3643 million for accommodation and support services to help people off the streets and to start rebuilding their lives. Money raised from a 2% non-UK resident Stamp Duty Land Tax surcharge will be used to help fund policies to reduce rough sleeping in England. (22, 47)The government is introducing additional exemptions from the Shared Accommodation Rate (SAR) for Universal Credit and Housing Benefit claimants to protect those at risk of homelessness. This will enable rough sleepers aged 16-24, care leavers up to the age of 25, and victims of domestic abuse and human trafficking to live on their own, supporting their recovery from homelessness. (21)Further details and additional announcements targeted at supporting people and families can be found in Chapter 2.1.55  Backing businessBusinesses provide the jobs that hard-working families depend on today, and through investment and innovation they will create the jobs of tomorrow. Backing business is vital to levelling up the economy across the regions and nations of the UK and boosting productivity\u00a0growth.The government is committed to making the UK the best place to start and grow a business, supporting enterprising businesses to succeed while attracting established businesses to locate and invest in the UK. In order to do so, the government is investing in the priorities of the business community by improving transport networks and digital connectivity and by investing in people\u2019s skills and health. The government will ensure that the UK\u2019s tax system remains competitive and that the regulatory regime supports competition and innovation, along with improving business support and ensuring the UK becomes a 21st century exporting\u00a0superpower.\u00a01.56  Business and enterprise supportSupporting enterprise is an important part of the government\u2019s ambition to level up opportunity across the UK. The government will do this directly by extending the funding of the British Business Bank\u2019s Start-Up Loans programme to the end of 2021\u201122, supporting up to 10,000 further entrepreneurs across the UK to access finance to start a\u00a0business.\u00a0To ensure that all businesses have access to high quality support and advice in their region, the government will invest \u00a310 million to increase Growth Hub capacity and provide high\u2011quality, core business advice and guidance across all 38 Growth Hubs.\u00a0In addition, the government will invest \u00a313 million to expand the British Library\u2019s network of Business and Intellectual Property Centres to 21 cities and 18 surrounding local library networks across England, providing entrepreneurs with business support, free access to market intelligence, IP workshops and one-to-one coaching. (29)The government will use the forthcoming CSR to make it easier for businesses to access the information and support that is relevant for them. As a first step, BEIS will lead the development of a digital service to provide businesses with tailored information about appropriate sources of support.The UK is a global financial centre, with world-leading finance hubs in London, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Leeds that support jobs across the country. To maintain the competitiveness of the UK financial services sector, the government will be taking a number of steps to ensure that the UK\u2019s regulatory regime remains proportionate and effective. These will enhance coordination between regulators and ensure the UK continues to lead the way on financial services innovation and the use of technology, including on the regulation of payments and cryptocurrencies. The government will also introduce a Financial Services Bill later in the session which will ensure that the UK maintains its world-leading regulatory standards and remains open to international\u00a0markets.1.57  Support for the self-employedThe government has reviewed how support for the self-employed can be strengthened. It\u00a0will improve access to finance and credit for self-employed people, by extending funding for the Start-Up Loans programme as above and by exploring how to improve the guidance available for self-employed people applying for a mortgage. Self\u2011employed people will also benefit from the government\u2019s continued efforts to tackle late payments. BEIS will shortly publish a consultation on the merits of strengthening the powers of the Small Business Commissioner.\u00a0The government will make it easier for self-employed people to find the information and guidance that is relevant to them and their business. The Budget announces that HMRC will launch new interactive guidance in summer 2020 which will make it easier for self\u2011employed taxpayers to navigate the tax system. They will also benefit from the new digital support service described above. Self-employed people working in rural and hard to reach areas will benefit from the \u00a35 billion for gigabit-capable broadband rollout and funding to improve mobile coverage that the Budget announces.\u00a0Additionally, the government will consider how to provide appropriate support to self-employed parents so that they can continue to run their businesses, as part of its wider review of Parental Pay and Leave.1.58  Competition and regulationCompetition is essential to drive innovation, produce better outcomes for consumers and allow new entrants to the market to grow. The UK is at the forefront of designing smarter and more flexible regulation that allows competition to flourish and minimises unnecessary burdens for business.To empower consumers and boost competition, the government will accept all six of the Furman Review\u2019s[footnote 55] strategic recommendations for unlocking competition in digital\u00a0markets.\u00a0To reduce regulatory barriers for businesses and ensure that regulation is sensible and proportionate now that the UK has left the EU, the Budget launches the Reforming Regulation Initiative to invite ideas from business and the public for regulatory reform. Boosting regulators\u2019 capacity is also essential to unlock the potential of emerging technologies and help businesses to\u00a0develop\u00a0innovative products and services, and the Budget announces that the government will invest \u00a310 million in a second round of the Regulators\u2019 Pioneer\u00a0Fund.\u00a0The government intends to introduce a levy to be paid by firms subject to the Money Laundering Regulations to help fund new government action to tackle money laundering and ensure delivery of the reforms committed to in the Economic Crime Plan. These reforms will help safeguard the UK\u2019s global reputation as a safe and transparent place to conduct business. The levy will be additional to ongoing public sector funding. The government will publish a consultation on the levy later this spring.1.59  Global BritainThe UK is an outward-looking and open economy. The government is implementing an independent trade policy for the first time in over 40 years, continuing to support businesses seeking to export and encouraging investors to choose the UK. The Budget takes further steps to enhance this support for trade and investment.To strengthen the global ties of our digital technology sector, DIT and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will pilot a Digital Trade Network in the Asia Pacific region, helping innovative UK companies to access opportunities in major new markets. DIT will establish local champions based at key overseas posts to support exporters from the Northern Powerhouse, Midlands Engine, and Western Gateway, and will increase the number of international trade advisers outside London.\u00a0The Budget also announces further support for exporters by extending and increasing the lending capacity of UK Export Finance (UKEF). This will make permanent the additional \u00a32 billion provided to UKEF at Budget 2018 as well as provide a new \u00a32 billion lending facility for projects supporting clean growth and a new \u00a31 billion to support overseas buyers of UK defence and security goods and services. UKEF will also expand its face-to-face support for exporters focused on clean growth in the North of England and Scotland where energy supply chains are economically important.\u00a0The government will support the UK\u2019s world-leading fintech sector, along with the wider digital economy. The Budget announces a review of the UK fintech sector led by Ron Kalifa OBE to support growth and competitiveness in the sector. In addition, the government will convene a summit looking at what further data needs to be made accessible to make it faster and easier for SMEs to shop around for credit.\u00a01.60  A competitive tax environmentThe government will maintain a sustainable and efficient business-friendly tax environment in which innovative and enterprising businesses can grow and thrive.\u00a0By confirming that the headline corporation tax rate will remain at 19% in 2020, the lowest in the G20,[footnote 56] the Budget ensures that the UK will continue to be an attractive place to do business while allowing the government to take action to address the most important challenges businesses face and increase funding for infrastructure and vital public services. An increase in the annual rate of the structures and buildings allowance to 3% will provide over \u00a31 billion in additional relief for businesses by the end of 2024-25. Together with measures to incentivise spending on R&D, this will unlock new investment and further enhance the international competitiveness of the UK tax system. The Budget also announces reforms to the intangible fixed assets regime to reinforce the attractiveness of the UK as a place for businesses to own and manage intellectual property, a review of the UK funds regime, as well as an industry working group on the future of VAT and financial services. (45, 23, 28)Small businesses play a crucial role in driving the economy and creating jobs. The government will help small businesses take on extra staff to fulfil their potential and boost employment by delivering on its commitment to increase the Employment Allowance to \u00a34,000. As a result, businesses will be able to employ four full-time employees on the National Living Wage without paying any employer National Insurance contributions (NICs). This measure will benefit around 510,000 businesses, including around 65,000 businesses which will be taken out of paying NICs entirely.[footnote 57] From April, over 650,000 businesses will have been taken out of paying NICs since the introduction of the Employment Allowance in 2014.[footnote 58] The government will also meet its commitment to introduce a National Insurance holiday for employers of veterans in their first year of civilian employment. (25,16)The government will continue to use the tax system to support genuine risk-taking and creativity where it is proven to be effective. In response to evidence that Entrepreneurs\u2019 Relief has primarily benefited a small number of very affluent taxpayers and done little to generate additional entrepreneurial activity,[footnote 59] the government will reduce the lifetime limit on gains eligible for relief to \u00a31 million. This will ensure that enterprising small business owners will continue to benefit, leaving over 80% of those using the relief unaffected,[footnote 60] while making the tax system fairer and more sustainable. (46)The government is committed to supporting businesses which form an important part of our communities and high streets. The Budget confirms that the government will support shops, pubs, cinemas, and music venues in England by increasing and expanding the business rates discount for retail properties, introducing a new pubs discount, and extending the local newspaper discount. To support businesses affected by COVID-19, the government has gone further than previously announced, as detailed earlier in the chapter. A fundamental review of business rates will consider further reforms to the business rates system and will report in the autumn. (26, 27)The government wants to make the most of the opportunity of leaving the EU to make our VAT and excise system more business-friendly, while continuing to recognise the significant contribution of VAT and excise towards the public finances. The Budget meets the government\u2019s commitment to review the alcohol duty regime to ensure it works for UK producers and consumers. Postponed VAT accounting will also change the time when import VAT is due to HMRC, providing an important cash flow advantage to businesses across the country that are integrated in international supply chains as they adapt to the UK\u2019s position as an independent trading nation.The Budget announces a set of targeted measures to ensure that businesses pay the tax they owe, ensuring fairness for everyone. This includes measures to crack down on tax abuse in the construction industry, illicit tobacco, and among big business, as well as measures to tackle the promoters of tax avoidance schemes. (57)Further details on how the government is backing business can be found in Chapter 2.1.61  Investing in innovationThe UK has a long and rich history as a hub for scientific discovery and transformative technological progress. From the foundations of scientific investigation and the development of the laws of motion, through the industrial revolution and into the modern digital age \u2013 for centuries the UK has led the world. With less than 1% of the world\u2019s population, the UK hosts\u00a04\u00a0of the world\u2019s 20 best universities,[footnote 61] has produced up to 14% of the world\u2019s most impactful research[footnote 62] and has the second highest number of Nobel Laureates of any nation.[footnote 63] Today, UK researchers and businesses are cutting carbon emissions, curing genetic diseases and pushing the frontier of artificial intelligence. The UK is also home to some of the world\u2019s foremost technology-pioneering businesses, and UK research attracts significant foreign direct\u00a0investment.Research and innovation lead to better products, services and processes. These drive growth and prosperity across the country, and generate ideas and tools to tackle global challenges such as climate change and an ageing population. That is why the government set the objective of increasing economy-wide investment in R&D to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, and why the Budget puts science, innovation and technology at the heart of the UK\u2019s investment strategy.\u00a0The Budget sets out ambitious plans to increase public R&D investment to \u00a322\u00a0billion per year by 2024-25. This landmark investment is the largest and fastest ever expansion of support for basic research and innovation, taking direct support for R&D to 0.8% of GDP and placing the UK among the top quarter of OECD nations \u2013 ahead of the USA, Japan, France and China.[footnote 64] This unprecedented increase in investment will support a range of objectives, including:\u00a0\t    supporting world-leading research in all regions and nations of the UK, including by cutting bureaucracy, experimenting with new funding models, and establishing a new funding agency to focus on high-risk, high-reward research  \t    meeting the great challenges facing society, including climate change and an ageing population, and providing funding to pursue \u2018moonshot\u2019 scientific missions  \t    investing in the government\u2019s own strategic science capability and improving public services  \t    backing businesses to invest and innovate so that they can compete in the global technology-driven economy  Details of how this funding will support these and other objectives will be set out at the forthcoming CSR, but the Budget announces a set of measures that will have an immediate\u00a0impact.\u00a01.62  Supporting world-leading research in all regions and nationsThe UK has excellent universities in every region and nation that attract business investment, deepen the skills and knowledge of the population, and drive economic growth. The government is providing an immediate funding boost of up to \u00a3400 million in 2020\u201121 for world-leading research, infrastructure and equipment. This will help build excellence in research institutes and universities right across the UK, particularly in basic research and physical sciences. The government will also provide \u00a3300 million for experimental mathematical research to attract the very best global talent over the next five years. This will double funding for new PhDs and boost the number of maths fellowships and research\u00a0projects.\u00a0In addition, the government will invest at least \u00a3800 million in a new blue-skies funding agency here in the UK, modelled on the extraordinary \u2018ARPA\u2019 in the US.[footnote 65] This agency will fund high-risk, high-reward science.\u00a0In recognition of their excellence and global reach, the government will increase funding for the UK\u2019s foremost specialist institutions by \u00a380 million over the next five years. This will support world-leading organisations such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Royal College of Art and the Institute of Cancer Research among others. At the CSR, the government will examine how R&D funding as a whole can best be distributed across the country to help level up every region and nation of the country.\u00a01.63  Overcoming societal challengesThe UK is a world leader in many of the scientific fields that are essential for responding to society\u2019s greatest challenges. For example, 25 of the world\u2019s top 100 medicines were discovered in the UK,[footnote 66] and the UK is the second largest expert contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on\u00a0Climate Change (IPCC).[footnote 67] The Budget is backing UK scientists and businesses to maintain and build on this international leadership.As part of this, to help meet the challenge of net zero and ensure that the UK is at the forefront of new decarbonisation technologies, the Budget commits to at least double the size of the Energy Innovation Programme.The government is also committed to deepening understanding of how to reduce the burden of illness in the future. To this end, the government is committing an extra \u00a312 million for the National Institute for Health Research in 2020-21. This increased investment will target research into preventable diseases to work towards solving a range of major health challenges.\u00a01.64   Invest in government science capabilities and public science estateCutting-edge science and innovation can also help the government to ensure that it is sufficiently equipped to foresee challenges and opportunities and improve public services. The government will therefore invest \u00a32 million in 2020-21 to expand the cross\u2011cutting strategic science and resilience capabilities provided by the Government Chief Scientific Adviser and the Government Office for Science. Furthermore, by investing \u00a31.4 billion over 10 years in the animal health science facility at Weybridge, the government will enhance this world\u2011class capability, underpinning agricultural trade and protecting the UK from the increasing threats of current and emerging animal diseases.In recognition of its global scientific significance, the Budget provides \u00a3180 million over 6 years for a new state-of-the-art storage and research facility for the Natural History Museum at Harwell Science and Innovation Campus. This upgrade will put the facility at the forefront of natural sciences research and international collaboration, housing and increasing access to around 40% of this world-leading biological collection.1.65  Backing businesses to innovate and growPrivate investment will be crucial to meeting the government\u2019s objective of increasing economy-wide investment in R&D to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, and to creating an innovation-intensive and technology-driven economy. The Budget will support and encourage this by increasing the rate of Research & Development Expenditure Credit from 12% to 13%. The government will also consult on whether qualifying R&D tax credit costs should include investments in data and cloud computing. (24)The government is committed to ensuring that the UK\u2019s fast-growing and innovative businesses continue to have access to the finance they need to invest and grow.\u00a0The Life Sciences Investment Programme will provide the British Business Bank with additional resources to make up to \u00a3200 million in equity commitments to support the UK\u2019s most innovative health and life sciences firms over the next five years. Invested alongside private sector capital, this is expected to enable \u00a3600\u00a0million of finance to create high-quality jobs and help UK patients benefit from more ground-breaking treatments and care. This funding will build on the \u00a3350 million of finance to life sciences firms currently supported by the British Business Bank by supporting large-scale venture growth funds. The programme will launch within a year. The government will also provide the British Business Bank with the resources to make up to \u00a3200 million of additional investment in UK venture capital and growth finance in 2020-21.The Budget will also invest over \u00a3900 million to ensure UK businesses are leading the way in high-potential technologies. This will involve commercialising nuclear fusion technology, offering potentially limitless clean energy, and supporting the government\u2019s ambitious National Space Strategy and space innovation fund. A portion of this funding contributes to a wider investment of up to \u00a31 billion to develop UK supply chains for the large\u2011scale production of electric vehicles, as announced in September.Further details on the support offered in the Budget for innovation can be found in Chapter 2.\u00a01.66  Growing a greener economyReducing carbon emissions and enhancing the environment are major government priorities. The UK is already a leader in climate change and clean growth, having reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation since 1990,[footnote 68] and being the first major economy to legislate for net zero greenhouse gas emissions.This year, as the UK prepares to host the COP26 Climate Summit,[footnote 69] the government is raising its ambition to decarbonise the economy. This will level up green economic opportunities in every nation and region and boost innovation, whilst also improving the natural environment.\u00a0The Budget sets out ambitious action on tree planting, ultra-low emission vehicles, heat decarbonisation and carbon capture and storage. Further climate policy measures will follow in the coming months.HM Treasury will also publish two reviews this year \u2013 one into the economic costs and opportunities of reaching net zero, the other led by Professor Sir Partha Dasgupta into the economics of biodiversity.\u00a01.67  Decarbonising power, industry and heatResearch and innovation will reduce the costs of meeting net zero and put the UK at the forefront of the new technologies needed to decarbonise the world economy. The Budget therefore commits to at least doubling the size of the Energy Innovation Programme. But innovation alone is not enough. Whilst new technologies are being developed, the government will continue to take action to reduce emissions now.The government has already made significant progress in reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation, driven by the switch from coal to gas and the growth in renewable energy. Costs have fallen so quickly that offshore wind, onshore wind and solar are likely to be the UK\u2019s primary source of electricity in the future. However, the power generated by these renewable sources is dependent on the weather, so the UK also needs reliable low carbon power from technologies such as nuclear, gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and hydrogen.To meet the net zero target, the UK must also decarbonise industry. There are a number of possible routes \u2013 from using low carbon energy sources like hydrogen or electricity, to capturing industrial emissions and storing them safely under the ground. This challenge provides opportunities not only to reduce emissions, but also to enable our manufacturing heartlands to become leaders in the green markets of the future.Carbon capture and storage will be important to decarbonising both power and industry. It can provide flexible low carbon power and decarbonise many industrial processes, whilst also offering the option for negative emissions at scale. The Budget announces a CCS\u00a0Infrastructure Fund to establish CCS in at least two UK sites, one by the mid-2020s, a second by 2030. Using consumer subsidies, the government will also support the construction of the UK\u2019s first CCS power plant.The heating of our homes will need to be virtually zero carbon by 2050, replacing natural gas and other fossil fuels with low carbon alternatives \u2013 likely to be primarily a mix of green gas, heat pumps and heat networks. To meet this challenge, the Budget accelerates the greening of the gas grid by announcing a new support scheme for biomethane, funded by a Green Gas Levy. The government will also support the installation of heat pumps and biomass boilers by introducing a Low Carbon Heat Support Scheme. Recognising the energy efficiency benefits of heat networks, the Budget confirms funding for the Heat Networks Investment Project for a further year to 2022 and provides \u00a3270 million of new funding to enable new and existing heat networks to adopt low carbon heat sources.To encourage businesses to operate in a more environmentally friendly way, the government is raising the Climate Change Levy on gas in 2022-23 and 2023-24 (whilst freezing the rate on electricity) and reopening and extending the Climate Change Agreement scheme by two years. (40, 41)1.68  Reducing vehicle pollutionMeeting the UK\u2019s net zero commitment will require emissions reductions across all modes of transport. However, road transport is responsible for 91% of domestic transport greenhouse gas emissions[footnote 70] and is one of the biggest contributors to poor air quality in the UK\u2019s towns and cities. The government has set ambitious targets to increase the number of zero emission vehicles on the road and is currently consulting on bringing forward the phaseout date for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040. Meeting these targets will require a combination of spending, regulation and taxes.Consumer incentives support the development of markets for new transport technology. The government is considering the long-term future of incentives for zero emission vehicles alongside the 2040 phase-out date consultation. Until then, the government will provide \u00a3403\u00a0million for the Plug-in Car Grant, extending it to 2022-23. Recognising that the market for other ultra-low emission vehicles is still very small, the government will also provide \u00a3129.5 million to extend the Plug-in Grants for vans, taxis and motorcycles to 2022\u201123. In addition, the Budget announces the exemption of zero emission cars from the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) \u2018expensive car supplement\u2019 and the publication of a call for evidence on VED, which will include how it can be further used to reduce vehicle emissions.\u00a0(35,\u00a044)Access to high quality, convenient charging infrastructure is critical for drivers to make the switch to electric vehicles confidently. The government is therefore providing \u00a3500\u00a0million over the next five years to support the rollout of a fast-charging network for electric vehicles,\u00a0ensuring that drivers will never be further than 30 miles from a rapid charging station. This will include a Rapid Charging Fund to help businesses with the cost of connecting fast charge points to the electricity grid. To target spending from this fund effectively, the Office for Low Emission Vehicles will complete a comprehensive electric vehicle charging infrastructure review.\u00a0The government will also remove the entitlement to use red diesel from April 2022, except in agriculture, fish farming, rail and for non-commercial heating (including domestic heating). By removing this tax relief on pollution, the government will encourage businesses and industry to improve the energy efficiency of their vehicles and machinery or look for greener alternatives. The development of these alternatives will be supported by the government more than doubling its investment in the Energy Innovation Programme. (39)Cleaner vehicles will improve air quality. The government is committed to bringing roadside concentrations of polluting nitrogen dioxide gas within legal limits in the shortest possible time. The Budget therefore allocates an additional \u00a3304 million to enable local authorities to take immediate steps to reduce nitrogen dioxide emissions. This brings the total amount that government has provided to affected local authorities to \u00a3880\u00a0million, meeting the government\u2019s obligations to all affected local authorities. (36)1.69  Natural environmentThis government aims to be the first to leave the natural environment in a better condition than we inherited it. The \u201825 Year Environment Plan\u2019 sets out the government\u2019s ambitions for clean air and water, thriving plants and wildlife, and mitigating and adapting to climate change.[footnote 71]The Budget announces the Nature for Climate Fund which will invest \u00a3640 million in tree planting and peatland restoration in England, increasing the rate of tree planting by over 600%[footnote 72] and covering an area greater than Birmingham over the next five years. In addition, the Budget announces the Nature Recovery Network Fund, which will partner with businesses and local communities to protect, restore and support existing habitats and wildlife. The government will also introduce the Natural Environment Impact Fund to help prepare green projects that could be suitable for commercial investment in order to encourage private sector support for environmental restoration.The UK\u2019s commitment to protecting the natural environment extends beyond Great Britain and Northern Ireland and into the UK Overseas Territories. The government is tripling funding for the Darwin Plus programme to help protect and conserve the globally significant biodiversity found in UK Overseas Territories.[footnote 73] This builds on the \u00a3220 million for biodiversity conservation in developing nations, and the doubling of UK international climate finance, announced by the Prime Minister at the UN General Assembly last year.\u00a01.70  Waste and recyclingThe government is committed to improving waste management, boosting recycling and reducing plastic pollution. Following consultation in spring 2019, the government will introduce a new Plastic Packaging Tax from April 2022 to incentivise the use of recycled plastic in packaging and help tackle the scourge of plastic in the natural environment. An\u00a0additional \u00a3700,000 will establish the Extended Producer Responsibility scheme, designed to encourage producers to make their packaging more recyclable and reduce the amount of unnecessary packaging in their products. (38)The government will also take action to fight waste crime. The Budget will provide funding for a digital waste tracking system to provide better data on waste transport, as well as \u00a32 million to improve evidence on where fly-tipping happens and the best ways to deter it.\u00a0Further details on carbon reduction measures in the Budget can be found in Chapter 2.\u00a02.  Budget policy decisionsChapter 1 explains how the measures announced in the Budget support the Government\u2019s long-term strategy. This chapter sets out all Budget 2020 policy decisions. Unless stated otherwise, the decisions set out are ones which are announced at the Budget.Table 2.1 shows the cost or yield of all Budget 2020 decisions with a direct effect on PSNB in the years up to 2025-26. This includes tax measures, changes to Departmental Expenditure Limits (DEL) and measures affecting annually managed expenditure (AME).The government is also publishing the methodology underpinning the calculation of the fiscal impact of each policy decision. This is included in the supplementary document \u2018\u2018Budget 2020: policy costings\u2019 published alongside the Budget.The supplementary document \u2018Overview of Tax Legislation and Rates\u2019, published alongside the Budget, provides a more detailed explanation of tax measures.Table 2.1: Budget 2020 policy decisions (\u00a3 million) (1)\t\tHead

(74)Changes to the duration of high level sanctions \u2013 The government is removing the 3-year sanction from Universal Credit and Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance.

This will allow Trusts to continue to invest in important capital projects such as estate refurbishments and building maintenance. (5)National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) \u2013 In order to improve our understanding of how to reduce the burden of illness in the future, the government is committing \u00a312 million of new funding for the National Institute for Health Research to invest in prevention research, supporting local authorities to grow their research capabilities for the longer term.Diagnostic equipment replacement \u2013 As announced in September 2019, the government is providing \u00a3200 million for the NHS in England to replace its oldest diagnostic equipment, including MRI machines, CT scanners, and breast screening equipment.

The Budget goes further by investing \u00a316.4 million over the next three years, including \u00a36.8 million for the ONS to make it easier to share more, higher-quality data across government. This will improve policy making and evaluation, and combine datasets in new ways to detect fraud. This investment is a first step in the government\u2019s National Data Strategy to unlock the power of data across government and the wider economy, while building trust in its use.General grants transformation program \u2013 General grants are awarded to an organisation for an agreed purpose and are considered the category of grants with the highest risk of being spent ineffectively.

(4)2.24  Trade and investmentDigital Trade Network \u2013 The Budget announces \u00a38 million for DIT and DCMS to pilot a Digital Trade Network in the Asia Pacific region, helping innovative UK companies to access opportunities in key markets.UK Export Finance (UKEF) Direct Lending Facility \u2013 UKEF offer loans to buyers of UK goods and services, particularly in emerging markets, to encourage them to buy from the UK. This lending has been capped at \u00a33 billion with an additional \u00a32 billion provided at Budget 2018 for use in 2020-21 and 2021-22 only. The Budget announces that UKEF will permanently retain this additional capacity as well as have a new \u00a32 billion lending facility for projects supporting clean growth and a new \u00a31 billion facility to support overseas buyers of UK defence and security goods and services.UKEF support for exporters \u2013 To provide improved support for exporters in energy transition and clean growth sectors, UKEF will enhance its face-to-face support in the North of England and Scotland where energy supply chains are economically important.UKEF support for fixed rate finance \u2013 UKEF will update its terms to allow it to better support export finance on a fixed-rate basis across its full product range, allowing customers to benefit from certainty of financing costs.Regional exports and investment \u2013 DIT will drive investment into and end-to-end support for exporters from the Northern Powerhouse, the Midlands Engine and the Western Gateway through dedicated local champions based at key overseas posts.Advice for exporters \u2013 DIT will increase its capacity to support exporters focused on the Northern Powerhouse, the Midlands Engine and the South West by increasing the number of international trade advisers available to provide personalised support to exporters.Enhanced market access support \u2013 DIT will increase its resource and capability to identify and address market access barriers preventing UK exporters from accessing particular markets.British Film Commission \u2013 The Budget allocates \u00a34.8 million to expand the work of the British Film Commission to promote the UK as a destination of choice for studio space investment. The British Film Commission will act as a single source of expert advice for investors and developers and provide targeted support at the early stages of viable projects to facilitate increased provision of studio facilities across the UK.Start-up and Innovator visas \u2013 DIT will become an endorsing body to allow it to directly support visa applications for eligible foreign investors seeking to start a business in the UK.Technical amendment to the process of import duty variation \u2013 The government will legislate to amend section 15 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 by refining the criteria used to determine when the government may vary the amount of import duty in the context of an international trade dispute. This will allow the government to vary import duty where it considers this appropriate, having regard to relevant international agreements and obligations. The amendment will enable the UK to respond adequately to developments in the international trading system.2.25  Tax decisions2.26  Personal taxIncreasing National Insurance thresholds \u2013 The Budget confirms the government\u2019s commitment to increase the thresholds at which employees and the self-employed start paying National Insurance contributions (NICs) to \u00a39,500 from April 2020.[footnote 84] Around 1.1 million people will be taken out of paying Class 1 and Class 4 NICs entirely.[footnote 85] This is the first step in meeting the government\u2019s ambition to increase these thresholds to \u00a312,500, which would save a typical employee over \u00a3450 per year.[footnote 86] (12)Income tax and National Insurance exemptions for bursary payments to care leavers \u2013 The government will legislate in Finance Bill 2020 to introduce an income tax exemption for the bursary paid by the Education and Skills Funding Agency to care leavers aged 16 to 24 who start an apprenticeship. Corresponding legislation will be introduced to mirror the income tax exemption for NICs. This legislation will confirm HMRC\u2019s current position that care leavers\u2019 bursaries are tax exempt, including those paid prior to the 2020-21 tax year.Increasing the flat rate deduction for homeworking \u2013 The government will increase the maximum flat rate income tax deduction available to employees to cover additional household expenses from \u00a34 per week to \u00a36 per week where they work at home under homeworking arrangements. This will take effect from April 2020.Tax treatment of the Troubles Permanent Disablement Payment Scheme \u2013 The government will legislate in Finance Bill 2020 to introduce income tax, inheritance tax and capital gains tax exemptions for payments made on or after May 2020 under the Troubles Permanent Disablement Payment Scheme.Tax treatment of social security benefits in Scotland \u2013 The government will legislate in Finance Bill 2020 to clarify the income tax treatment of three new social security payments. The legislation will confirm that the following three benefits introduced by the Scottish government are exempt from income tax: Job Start; Disability Assistance for Children and Young People; and, the Scottish Child Payment. The legislation also includes a new power which permits the government to confirm by secondary legislation when new social security benefits introduced by the UK government or any of the devolved administrations will be tax exempt. The changes will take effect from April 2020.Tax treatment of the Windrush Compensation Scheme \u2013 As announced in April 2019, the government will legislate in Finance Bill 2020 to introduce exemptions from income tax, inheritance tax and capital gains tax for payments made on or after 3 April 2019 under the Windrush Compensation Scheme. The legislation also includes a new power to exempt any necessary future compensation payments by statutory instrument from income tax, inheritance tax and capital gains tax, where appropriate. (64)Review of changes to the off-payroll working rules (commonly known as IR35) \u2013 At Budget 2018 the government announced that it would reform the off-payroll working rules in the private and third sectors from April 2020. The government has recently concluded a review of the reform, and is making a number of changes to support its smooth and successful implementation. The government believes it is right to address the fundamental unfairness of the non-compliance with the existing rules, and the reform will therefore be legislated in Finance Bill 2020 and implemented on 6 April 2020, as previously announced.National Insurance holiday for employers of veterans in first year of civilian employment \u2013 To support the employment of veterans, the government is meeting the commitment to introduce a National Insurance holiday for employers of veterans in their first year of civilian employment. A full digital service will be available to employers from April 2022; however, transitional arrangements will be in place in the 2021-22 tax year which will effectively enable employers of veterans to claim this holiday from April 2021. The holiday will exempt employers from any NICs liability on the veteran\u2019s salary up to the Upper Earnings Limit. The government will consult on the design of this relief. (16)Tax treatment of welfare counselling provided by employers \u2013 The government will extend the scope of non-taxable counselling services to include related medical treatment, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, when provided to an employee as part of an employer\u2019s welfare counselling services. The changes will take effect from April 2020.Top Slicing Relief (TSR) on life insurance policy gains \u2013 Following a recent First-Tier Tribunal case, the government will legislate in Finance Bill 2020 to put beyond doubt the calculation of TSR by specifying how allowances and reliefs can be set against life insurance policy gains. This measure will apply to all relevant gains occurring on or after 11 March 2020. (49)2.27  Pensions and savings tax2.28  Pensions taxCall for evidence on pension tax administration \u2013 Those earning around or below the level of the personal allowance and saving into a pension may benefit from a top-up on their pension savings equivalent to the basic rate of tax, even if they pay no tax. Whether they receive this top-up depends on how their pension scheme administers tax relief. The government has committed to reviewing options for addressing these differences and will shortly publish a call for evidence on pensions tax relief administration.Tapered annual allowance for pensions \u2013 The pensions annual allowance is the maximum amount of tax-relieved pension savings that can be accrued in a year. For those on the highest incomes, the annual allowance tapers down from \u00a340,000. HM Treasury has reviewed the tapered annual allowance and its impact on the NHS, as well as on public service delivery more widely.To support the delivery of public services, particularly in the NHS, the two tapered annual allowance thresholds will each be raised by \u00a390,000. This means that from 2020-21 the \u201cthreshold income\u201d will be \u00a3200,000, so individuals with income below this level will not be affected by the tapered annual allowance, and the annual allowance will only begin to taper down for individuals who also have an \u201cadjusted income\u201d above \u00a3240,000. (7)For those on the very highest incomes, the minimum level to which the annual allowance can taper down will reduce from \u00a310,000 to \u00a34,000 from April 2020. This reduction will only affect individuals with total income (including pension accrual) over \u00a3300,000. Proposals to offer greater pay in lieu of pensions for senior clinicians in the NHS pension scheme will not be taken forward. (7)Lifetime allowance for pensions \u2013 The lifetime allowance, the maximum amount someone can accrue in a registered pension scheme in a tax-efficient manner over their lifetime, will increase in line with CPI for 2020-21, rising to \u00a31,073,100.2.29  Savings taxStarting rate for savings tax band \u2013 The band of savings income that is subject to the 0% starting tax rate will remain at its current level of \u00a35,000 for 2020-21.Individual Savings Account (ISA) annual subscription limit \u2013 The adult ISA annual subscription limit for 2020-21 will remain unchanged at \u00a320,000. (55)Junior ISA and Child Trust Fund annual subscription limit \u2013 The annual subscription limit for Junior ISAs and Child Trust Funds will be increased from \u00a34,368 to \u00a39,000.2.30  Business tax2.31  Employer NICsIncreasing the Employment Allowance \u2013 The government will increase the Employment Allowance from \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 from April 2020. This will benefit around 510,000 businesses by reducing their costs of employment, with an average gain of \u00a3850 per year.[footnote 87] The increase will take around 65,000 businesses out of paying NICs entirely and means the government will have doubled the value of the Employment Allowance in four years.[footnote 88] (25)2.32  Business ratesBusiness rates retail discount \u2013 The government has already announced that, for one year from 1 April 2020, the business rates retail discount for properties with a rateable value below \u00a351,000 in England will increase from one third to 50% and will be expanded to include cinemas and music venues. To support small businesses in response to Covid-19 the retail discount will be increased to 100% and expanded to include hospitality and leisure businesses for 2021. (26)Business rates pubs discount \u2013 The government previously committed to introducing a \u00a31,000 business rates discount for pubs with a rateable value below \u00a3100,000 in England for one year from 1 April 2020. To further support pubs, in response to Covid-19 the discount for pubs will be increased to \u00a35,000. (27)Business rates local newspaper office space discount \u2013 The \u00a31,500 business rates discount for office space used by local newspapers in England will be extended for an additional five years until 31 March 2025.Business rates public lavatories relief \u2013 The government will bring forward legislation as soon as possible in this session to provide mandatory 100% business rates relief for standalone public lavatories in England from April 2020.Local authorities will be fully compensated for the loss of income as a result of these business rates measures.Business rates review \u2013 The government is launching a fundamental review of business rates to report in the autumn. The Terms of Reference for this review are published alongside this Budget and a call for evidence will be published in the spring.Valuation Office Agency (VOA) business systems transformation programme \u2013 The government will invest an additional \u00a311.5 million in the VOA in 2020-21 to support the modernisation of VOA systems and processes, to increase efficiency and improve customer service in the future.2.33  Enterprise taxCapital Allowances: Structures and buildings allowance (SBA) rate \u2013 The annual rate of capital allowances available for qualifying investments to construct new, or renovate old, non-residential structures and buildings will increase from 2% to 3%. The change will take effect from 1 April 2020 for corporation tax and 6 April 2020 for income tax. The introduction of SBA at Budget 2018 greatly enhanced the international competitiveness of the UK\u2019s tax system and this increased rate of relief goes even further, providing businesses who invest with over \u00a31 billion in additional relief by the end of 2024-25. (23)Capital Gains Tax: Reduction in the Entrepreneurs\u2019 Relief lifetime limit \u2013 From 11 March 2020, the lifetime limit on gains eligible for Entrepreneurs\u2019 Relief (which offers a reduced 10% rate of Capital Gains Tax on qualifying disposals) will be reduced from \u00a310 million to \u00a31 million, in response to evidence that it has done little to incentivise entrepreneurial activity and that most of the benefit accrues to a small number of very affluent taxpayers.[footnote 89] This will help ensure that the tax system is fair and sustainable while leaving over 80% of those using the relief unaffected.[footnote 90] (46)Review of Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) scheme \u2013 The government will review the EMI scheme to ensure it provides support for high-growth companies to recruit and retain the best talent so they can scale up effectively, and examine whether more companies should be able to access the scheme.Research & Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) rate \u2013 The rate of RDEC will increase from 12% to 13% from 1 April 2020, supporting businesses investing in R&D and helping to drive innovation in the economy. (24)Consultation on R&D tax credit qualifying costs \u2013 The government will consult on whether expenditure on data and cloud computing should qualify for R&D tax credits.Preventing abuse of the R&D relief for small and medium-sized enterprises: Summary of responses and consultation \u2013 Following consultation last year, the introduction of the PAYE cap on the payable tax credit in the SME R&D schemes will be delayed until 1 April 2021. The government has listened to industry and will also consult on changes to the cap\u2019s design, to ensure it targets abusive behaviour as intended while ensuring that eligible businesses are able to access the relief. (60)2.34  Corporate taxCorporation tax (CT) rate \u2013 Since 2010 the government has cut the headline rate of CT from 28% to 19%, giving the UK the lowest headline rate in the G20.[footnote 91] To provide support for vital public services while maintaining the UK\u2019s competitive rate of CT, the government will legislate to retain the current 19% rate in April 2020. (45)Digital services tax (DST) \u2013 As announced at Budget 2018, the government will introduce a new 2% tax on the revenues certain digital businesses earn from 1 April 2020. This will ensure the amount of tax paid in the UK reflects the value these businesses derive from their interactions with, and the contributions of, an active user base. Legislation will require businesses to pay the DST on an annual basis, consistent with the draft legislation published in July 2019. The government will continue to give consideration to how the legislation applies to marketplace delivery fees and whether that application is consistent with the policy rationale of the DST. The government remains committed to developing a multilateral solution to the challenges digitalisation has created for the corporate tax system and will repeal the DST once an appropriate global solution is in place. (50)Intangibles reform \u2013 The government will legislate in Finance Bill 2020 to remove the pre-2002 exclusion from the Intangible Fixed Assets (IFA) regime to support UK investment in intellectual property and other intangible assets. This means tax relief for the cost of acquiring corporate intangible assets on or after 1 July 2020 will be provided under a single regime, subject to restrictions to prevent tax avoidance. (28)Corporate capital loss restriction \u2013 As announced at Budget 2018, from 1 April 2020, the government will restrict the proportion of annual capital gains that can be relieved by brought-forward capital losses to 50%. This measure includes an allowance that gives companies unrestricted use of up to \u00a35 million capital or income losses each year, meaning that 99% of companies will be unaffected.[footnote 92] Following consultation on the detailed design of the rules,[footnote 93] the government will also exclude certain companies in liquidation from the scope of the restriction. (51)Review of the UK funds regime \u2013 The government will undertake a review of the UK\u2019s funds regime during 2020. This will cover direct and indirect tax, as well as relevant areas of regulation, with a view to considering the case for policy changes. The review will begin with a consultation, to be published at the Budget, on whether there are targeted and merited tax changes that could help to make the UK a more attractive location for companies used by funds to hold assets. The review will also consider the VAT treatment of fund management fees and other aspects of the UK\u2019s funds regime.Transfer of unlisted securities to connected companies for Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax \u2013 In Finance Act 2018-19, the government introduced a targeted market value rule to prevent artificial reduction of the tax due on share acquisitions when listed shares are transferred to a connected company. This rule is being extended to unlisted shares in Finance Bill 2020 to prevent further tax avoidance. As part of this change, the government will amend legislation to prevent a double tax charge arising on certain company reorganisations. (67)Consultation on the tax impact of the withdrawal of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) \u2013 The government will consult to ensure that where tax legislation makes reference to LIBOR it continues to operate effectively. The consultation will also enable the government to ensure it is aware of all the significant tax issues that arise from the reform of LIBOR and other benchmarks.Consultation on aspects of the hybrid mismatch rules \u2013 The government will publish a consultation on the corporation tax rules that apply to hybrid mismatch arrangements that seek to exploit the differences in tax treatment between two jurisdictions. The consultation seeks to ensure that the hybrid mismatch rules work proportionately and as intended.2.35  Property taxNon-UK resident Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) surcharge \u2013 The government will introduce a 2% SDLT surcharge on non-UK residents purchasing residential property in England and Northern Ireland from 1 April 2021. This will help to control house price inflation and to support UK residents to get onto and move up the housing ladder. The money raised from the surcharge will be used to help address rough sleeping. (47)Housing co-operatives: Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (ATED) and Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) \u2013 To make the taxation of housing co-operatives fairer, the government will introduce a relief for qualifying housing co-operatives from the ATED and the 15% flat rates of SDLT on purchases of dwellings over \u00a3500,000. The SDLT relief in England and Northern Ireland will take effect from Autumn Budget 2020 and the UK-wide ATED relief from 1 April 2021 with a refund available for 2020-21.2.36  Energy and environmental taxPlastic Packaging Tax \u2013 As announced at Budget 2018 and following consultation in spring 2019,[footnote 94] the government will introduce a new Plastic Packaging Tax from April 2022 to incentivise the use of recycled plastic in packaging. The Budget sets the rate at \u00a3200 per tonne of plastic packaging that contains less than 30% recycled plastic. This will apply to the production and importation of plastic packaging. The government will keep the level of the rate and threshold under review to ensure that the tax remains effective in increasing the use of recycled plastic. The government will also extend the scope of the tax to the importation of filled plastic packaging and apply a minimum threshold of 10 tonnes of plastic packaging to ensure the smallest businesses are not disproportionately impacted. The Budget also announces the launch of a further consultation on the detailed design and implementation of the tax, which includes consideration of an exemption for certain types of medical packaging. (38)Aggregates Levy \u2013 The government will freeze the Aggregates Levy rate in 2020-21 and will be publishing a summary of responses and government next steps to last year\u2019s comprehensive review of the levy. (52)Increasing the gas rates under the Climate Change Levy (CCL) for years 2022-23 and 2023-24 \u2013 To meet the UK\u2019s net zero commitment, the UK must continue to remove incentives to choose gas over electricity, which is a cleaner energy source. Building on the Budget 2016 announcement to make gas and electricity rates equal by 2025, the government is raising the rate on gas to \u00a30.00568/kWh in 2022-23 and to \u00a30.00672/kWh in 2023-24 whilst freezing the rates on electricity. To ensure the tax system treats fuels that are used off the gas grid more equitably, the government will freeze LPG at 2019-20 levels until April 2024. (41)Extending the Climate Change Agreement (CCA) scheme \u2013 To support energy-intensive businesses to operate in a more environmentally sustainable way, the government will reopen and extend the CCA scheme by two years. The CCA scheme allows businesses to reduce their CCL bill in exchange for meeting targets to improve their energy efficiency. The terms of the extended scheme will be set out in a consultation to be launched shortly after Budget. As part of this, the government will simultaneously consult on long-term options for the CCA scheme.Carbon price support (CPS) rate \u2013 The government will freeze the rate of the CPS at \u00a318t/CO2e in 2021-22. Alongside wider carbon pricing policies, this will continue to encourage decarbonisation of the power sector. (43)Carbon pricing after the transition period \u2013 The UK will continue to apply an ambitious carbon price from 1 January 2021 to support progress towards reaching net zero. The government will legislate at Finance Bill 2020 to prepare for a UK Emissions Trading System (ETS), which could be linked to the EU ETS. The government will also legislate for a carbon emissions tax as an alternative carbon pricing policy and consult on the design of a tax in spring 2020.2.37  Transport taxesFuel duty \u2013 The government will freeze fuel duty for a tenth year in a row, cumulatively saving the average car driver \u00a31,200 compared to the pre-2010 escalator.[footnote 95] Future fuel duty rates will be considered alongside measures that are needed to help meet the UK\u2019s net zero commitment. (13)Air Passenger Duty (APD) rates \u2013 APD rates will increase in line with RPI for 2021-22, meaning that short haul rates remain frozen at \u00a313, benefitting 80% of passengers.[footnote 96] The rate for long haul economy will increase by \u00a32, and the rates for those travelling in premium economy, business and first class will increase by \u00a34. Those travelling long-haul by private jets will see the rate increase by \u00a313.Aviation tax reform \u2013 In January 2020 the government announced that it would undertake a review of APD ahead of the Budget to ensure that regional connectivity is supported while meeting the UK\u2019s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. As a result, the government will consult on aviation tax reform in spring 2020. The government will consider the case for changing the APD treatment for domestic flights, such as reintroducing a return leg exemption, and for increasing the number of international distance bands.Vehicle Excise Duty (VED): Rates \u2013 The government will uprate VED rates for cars, vans and motorcycles in line with RPI from 1 April 2020. To support the haulage sector, the government will freeze HGV VED and the HGV Road User Levy for 2020-21. (53)VED: Zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) \u2013 From 1 April 2020, the government will exempt all ZEVs registered until 31 March 2025 from the VED \u2018expensive car\u2019 supplement. The measure will incentivise the uptake of ZEVs to support the phasing out of petrol and diesel vehicles. (44)VED: Motorhomes \u2013 From 12 March 2020, the government will reduce annual VED liabilities for most new motorhomes to a flat rate of \u00a3265, which will rise to \u00a3270 for 2020-21, as motorhome manufacturers and dealers will not be required to provide a CO2 emissions figure when registering new motorhomes with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. From 1 April 2021, the government will align the VED treatment of new motorhomes and vans. (18)Call for evidence on VED \u2013 The government is publishing a call for evidence which will include how VED can be used to support the take-up of zero and ultra-low emission vehicles and reduce overall emissions from road vehicles.Company car tax (CCT): Rates \u2013 As set out in July 2019,[footnote 97] the government will reduce most CCT rates by 2% in 2020-21 for cars first registered from 6 April 2020. Rates will return to planned levels over the following two years, increasing by 1% in 2021-22 and 1% in 2022-23. Rates will then be frozen until 2024-25. (66)Van benefit charge nil-rating for zero emission vans \u2013 From April 2021, the government will apply a nil rate of tax to zero-emission vans within van benefit charge. This measure will save businesses an estimated \u00a3433 per van in tax in 2021-22.[footnote 98]Company vehicles \u2013 From 6 April 2020, fuel benefit charges and the van benefit charge will increase in line with CPI. (54)First year allowances for business cars from April 2021 \u2013 To support the uptake of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) and ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs), from April 2021, the government will extend first year allowances to ZEVs only and apply the main rate writing down allowance (WDA) of 18% to cars with emissions up to 50g/km. The special rate WDA of 6% will apply to higher polluting cars with emissions above 50g/km. First year allowances for zero emission goods vehicles and natural gas and hydrogen refuelling equipment will also be extended. (42)Red diesel: Removing entitlement \u2013 The government will remove entitlement to the use of red diesel and rebated biofuels from April 2022, except for agriculture (including horticulture, pisciculture and forestry), rail and for non-commercial heating (including domestic heating). The government will consult on whether the entitlement to use red diesel and rebated biofuels is justified for any other users, for example there is a strong case for continued use by ferries carrying paid passengers on the UK\u2019s rivers and inland waterways, or public entertainment. Commercial boats on open waters, including ferries and fishing boats, will remain entitled to the Marine Voyages Relief so will not have to pay more for their fuel. This measure will incentivise businesses to improve the energy efficiency of their vehicles and machinery or look for greener alternatives. To support the development of alternatives that these businesses can switch to, the Budget has also committed to at least doubling the size of the energy innovation programme, accelerating the design and production of innovative clean energy technologies. (39)Red diesel: Prohibition of use for propelling private pleasure craft \u2013 Private pleasure craft already pay the standard white diesel rate for propulsion. They will still be entitled to use red diesel for their heating use. Where they have one tank for propulsion and heating, the government will explore options that prevent them from having to pay a higher rate of duty on their heating use than they would otherwise have to pay. Details on the implementation of this power will be set out in due course.2.38  VATVAT on e-publications \u2013 The Government will introduce legislation to apply a zero rate of VAT to e-publications from 1 December 2020, to make it clear that e-books, e-newspapers, e-magazines and academic e-journals are entitled to the same VAT treatment as their physical counterparts. (15)VAT Postponed Accounting \u2013 From 1 January 2021 postponed accounting for VAT will apply to all imports of goods, including from the EU. This will provide an important boost to those VAT registered UK businesses which are integrated in international supply chains as they adapt to the UK\u2019s position as an independent trading nation.Abolition of tampon tax \u2013 From 1 January 2021 the government will use freedom from EU law to enable a zero rate of VAT to be charged on women\u2019s sanitary products. (17)Long-term passengers\u2019 policy consultation \u2013 The government is publishing a consultation alongside Budget to gather views on the potential approach to duty- and tax-free goods policy after the transition period following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU.Long-term cross-border goods policy \u2013 The government will launch an informal consultation over spring 2020 on the VAT and excise treatment of goods crossing UK borders after the EU exit transition period.VAT on fund management \u2013 As announced on 4 March 2020[footnote 99] the government is legislating to clarify when fund management services are exempt from VAT.VAT on financial services \u2013 The government will set up an industry working group to review how financial services are treated for VAT purposes.VAT Quick Fixes Directive \u2013 The government will introduce legislation to introduce simplified rules for the VAT treatment of intra-EU movements of call-off stock, allowing businesses to delay accounting for VAT until the goods are called-off. The legislation will apply to goods which are removed from a Member State on or after 1 January 2020 (sic).VAT Partial Exemption \u2013 Following the recent call for evidence on the simplification of the VAT rules on Partial Exemption and the Capital Goods Scheme,[footnote 100] the government will continue to engage with stakeholders in relation to their responses and will publish a response in due course.2.39  Alcohol, tobacco and other dutiesAlcohol duty rates \u2013 Duty rates on beer, spirits, wine and cider will be frozen. (14)Post-EU exit alcohol review \u2013 The government recognises the complexity of the current duty system and will review potential reforms to be implemented after the transition period, beginning by publishing a call for evidence by the summer.Small Brewers\u2019 Relief (SBR) \u2013 The government will publish the results of our review into Small Brewers Relief in the spring.Tobacco duty rates \u2013 Duty rates on all tobacco products will increase by RPI + 2% until the end of this Parliament. The rate on hand-rolling tobacco will increase by RPI + 6% this year. These changes will take effect from 6pm on 11 March 2020. (48)Gaming Duty \u2013 The government will legislate in Finance Bill 2020 to raise the Gross Gaming Yield (GGY) bandings for Gaming Duty in line with inflation. The revised bandings must be used for accounting periods starting on or after 1 April 2020.2.40  Avoidance, evasion and non-complianceSince 2010 the government has secured and protected over \u00a3200 billion of tax that would have otherwise gone unpaid.[footnote 101] The Budget builds on this work and announces further action to tackle tax avoidance, evasion and other forms of non-compliance that will raise an additional \u00a34.7 billion between now and 2024-25.Preventing the illicit trade of tobacco \u2013 The government is announcing increased resources for Trading Standards and HMRC to combat the illicit tobacco trade, including the creation of a UK-wide HMRC intelligence sharing hub. The government will also consult on proposals for stronger penalties for tobacco tax evasion.Tackling Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) abuse \u2013 The government will legislate to prevent non-compliant businesses from using the CIS to claim tax refunds to which they are not entitled. The government is also publishing a consultation which introduces options on how to promote supply chain due diligence. (57)Domestic reverse charge for building and construction services \u2013 As announced in September 2019,[footnote 102] the implementation of the VAT domestic reverse charge for building and construction services, which prevents losses through so-called \u2018missing trader\u2019 fraud, will be delayed until 1 October 2020. (68)VAT Agricultural Flat Rate Scheme (AFRS) \u2013 Following informal consultation with stakeholders in 2019 the government will introduce new entry and exit rules for the AFRS.Conditionality: Hidden economy \u2013 The government will legislate in Finance Bill 2020-21 to make the renewal of licenses to drive taxis and private hire vehicles (PHVs, e.g. minicabs), operate PHV firms, and deal in scrap metal conditional on applicants completing checks that confirm they are appropriately registered for tax. This measure will make it more difficult for non-compliant traders to operate in the hidden economy and help level the playing field for the compliant majority. These changes will take effect in England and Wales in April 2022. The government is considering extending this reform to Scotland and Northern Ireland in the future and will work with the devolved administrations to this effect. (58)Conditionality: Wider application \u2013 The government will publish a discussion document seeking views on the wider application of tax conditionality in the spring. Tax conditionality refers to a principle whereby businesses are granted access to government awards and authorisations (such as approvals, licenses, grants) only if they are able to demonstrate good tax compliance.Additional compliance resources for HMRC \u2013 The government is investing in additional compliance officers and new technology for HMRC. This investment is forecast to bring in \u00a34.4 billion of additional tax revenue up to 2024-25 by enabling HMRC to further reduce the tax gap through additional compliance activity and expanding debt collection capabilities.[footnote 103] (59)2.41  Response to the Loan Charge ReviewResponse to the independent Loan Charge Review \u2013 The Budget confirms the government\u2019s response to Sir Amyas Morse\u2019s Independent Loan Charge Review[footnote 104] and sets out the Exchequer costs of accepting the recommendations. These will be legislated for in the forthcoming Finance Bill. To implement the changes, the government will also provide HMRC with additional operational funding. However, disguised remuneration schemes continue to be used. Therefore, the government will shortly issue a call for evidence on further action to stamp out these schemes. (63)Tackling promoters of tax avoidance \u2013 As announced in the government\u2019s response to the independent Loan Charge Review,[footnote 105] the government will legislate in Finance Bill 2020-21 to take further action against those who promote and market tax avoidance schemes. The legislation, which will take effect following Royal Assent, will:\t    allow HMRC to obtain information about the enabling of abusive schemes as soon as they are identified by strengthening information powers for HMRC\u2019s existing regime to tackle enablers of tax avoidance schemes  \t    ensure enabler penalties are felt without delay for multi-user schemes, meaning anyone enabling tax avoidance arrangements that are later defeated will face a penalty of 100% of the fees they earn  \t    enable HMRC to act promptly where promoters fail to provide information on their avoidance schemes. In particular, these changes will help HMRC obtain the information needed to bring a scheme into the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes regime and empower HMRC to act faster where avoidance schemes are being promoted  \t    equip HMRC to more effectively stop promoters from marketing and selling avoidance schemes as early as possible  \t    ensure promoters fulfil their obligations under the Promoters of Tax Avoidance Scheme (POTAS) regime, including where they have tried to abuse corporate structures to get around the rules  \t    make further technical amendments to the POTAS regime, including preventing spurious legal challenges from disrupting the process of scrutinising promoters, so the regime can continue to operate effectively  \t    make additional changes to the General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) so it can be used as intended to tackle avoidance using partnership structures  HMRC\u2019s promoter strategy \u2013 On top of the legislative changes the government will introduce in Finance Bill 2020-21, HMRC will publish a new ambitious strategy for tackling the promoters of tax avoidance schemes. This will outline the range of policy, operational and communications interventions both underway and in development to drive those who promote tax avoidance schemes out of the market, disrupt the supply chain to stop the spread of marketed tax avoidance, and deter taxpayers from taking up the schemes.Raising standards in the market for tax advice \u2013 The government will publish a call for evidence in the spring on raising standards for tax advice. This will seek evidence about providers of tax advice, current standards upheld by tax advisers, and the effectiveness of the government\u2019s efforts to support those standards, in order to give taxpayers more assurance that the advice they are receiving is reliable.2.42  Tax administrationFuture of Making Tax Digital \u2013 The government will publish an evaluation of the introduction of Making Tax Digital for VAT, along with related research.Large business notification \u2013 From April 2021 large businesses will be required to notify HMRC when they take a tax position which HMRC is likely to challenge. This policy will draw on international accounting standards which many large businesses already follow. The government will consult shortly on the detail of the notification process. (56)Protecting your taxes in insolvency \u2013 As announced at Budget 2018, the government will change the rules so that when a business enters insolvency, more of the taxes paid in good faith by its employees and customers and temporarily held in trust by the business go as intended to fund public services, rather than being distributed to other creditors. The Budget delays the commencement date of this measure from 6 April to 1 December 2020 and extends this measure to Northern Ireland. This reform will only apply to taxes collected and held by businesses on behalf of other taxpayers (VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NICs and CIS deductions). The rules will remain unchanged for taxes owed by businesses themselves, such as corporation tax and employer NICs. The legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2020. (65)Clarifying the treatment of Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) returns \u2013 The government will legislate prospectively and retrospectively in Finance Bill 2020 to put beyond doubt that LLPs should be treated as general partnerships under income tax rules. This will ensure HMRC can continue to amend LLP members\u2019 tax returns where the LLP operates without a view to profit. This measure does not create any new or additional obligations or liabilities for taxpayers. It clarifies the legislation to ensure the rules work as designed and intended.HMRC automation \u2013 As announced on 31 October 2019,[footnote 106] the government will legislate to confirm that HMRC may use automated processes to issue taxpayers with notices to file tax returns and penalty notices. This measure will apply prospectively and retrospectively to put beyond doubt that the rules work as designed and intended. This does not create any new or additional obligations or liabilities for taxpayers.Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) call for evidence \u2013 The government will shortly publish a summary of responses to the recent call for evidence on the operation of IPT,[footnote 107] along with information on a forthcoming consultation setting out the next stage in reforming how IPT operates.Funding HMRC to prepare for breathing space \u2013 The government will invest an additional \u00a312.5 million in HMRC in 2020-21 to begin work immediately on the implementation of breathing space. From early 2021 this will mean that those in problem debt can access a 60-day breathing space, including for debts to HMRC, while they engage with debt advice and work towards a sustainable debt solution.2.43  Competition and regulationBoosting competition in the digital and wider economy \u2013 The government will accept all six of the Furman Review\u2019s[footnote 108] strategic recommendations for unlocking competition in digital markets. The government will consult on these in due course. A new cross-regulator taskforce, based in the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will report to the government within six months on a pro-competitive regime for digital platform markets. This will include advice on implementing a pro-competitive code of conduct for digital platforms with strategic market power. The government will also look at existing domestic or EU derived regulations that might hinder digital competition and entrench monopoly behaviours and will ensure that regulatory reforms applying to digital and tech businesses are pro-innovation and coherent.Reforming Regulation Initiative \u2013 Good regulation is essential to successful businesses. The government will strive to achieve the right balance between supporting excellent business practice and providing protections for people and the environment. The Budget announces that BEIS is launching the Reforming Regulation Initiative. This will invite ideas from business and the public for regulatory reform in order to ensure that regulation is sensible and proportionate now that the UK has left the EU, and that the interests of small businesses are taken into account.Regulators\u2019 Pioneer Fund \u2013 The government will launch a second round of the Regulators\u2019 Pioneer Fund, building on the success of the first round which was launched at Autumn Budget 2017. This \u00a310 million of funding will enable regulators to unlock the potential of emerging technologies and help businesses to develop innovative products and services.Financial Services Bill \u2013 The Financial Services Bill will provide long-term market access between the UK and Gibraltar for financial services firms following EU exit, support a vibrant asset management industry by simplifying the process for overseas investment funds seeking to market into the UK and enable the implementation of the remaining Basel banking standards and a more proportionate prudential regime for investment firms. The government has published further details alongside Budget ahead of legislating later in the session. As a result of the proposed changes to the prudential regime for investment firms, the government will be taking steps to ensure that bank tax legislation continues to operate in line with current policy.Regulatory Coordination \u2013 The Financial Services Future Regulatory Framework Review was announced at Mansion House 2019, with the first phase launching a call for evidence on regulatory coordination in July. The government is publishing a response to the call for evidence alongside Budget and setting out the next steps in the review. This response announces a new forum, bringing together government and regulators, to provide industry with a forward-look of upcoming regulatory initiatives. This forum will be made up of the Bank of England, Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Payment Systems Regulator and Competition and Markets Authority, with HM Treasury as an observer member.Access to cash legislation \u2013 The government will bring forward legislation to protect access to cash for those who need it. This will ensure industry continues to meet the changing needs of cash users.Regulation of pre-paid funeral plans \u2013 The government is publishing the response to its consultation on the regulation of pre-paid funeral plans and will legislate to bring funeral plan providers within the remit of the FCA. This will protect consumers by ensuring, for the first time, that all pre-paid funeral plan providers are subject to robust regulation.Changes to the Credit Unions Act \u2013 The government will bring forward legislation to allow credit unions to offer a wider range of products and services to their members, supporting their vital role in financial inclusion.Fintech review and delivery panel \u2013 The government has invited Ron Kalifa OBE to lead a major review into the fintech sector. The review will identify what more industry and government can do to support growth and competitiveness, to ensure that the UK maintains its global leadership in this vital sector. The government will also extend funding for the Fintech Delivery Panel, as well as touring the regions and nations of the UK to showcase its diverse range of fintech firms.Digital currencies discussion paper \u2013 The government looks forward to the publication of the Bank of England\u2019s discussion paper on a possible UK central bank digital currency (CBDC). The UK will continue to take a leading role in exploring digital currencies, and the wide-ranging opportunities and challenges they could bring.Cryptoassets consultation \u2013 To protect consumers and support innovation in cryptoassets, the government intends to consult on a measure to bring certain cryptoassets into scope of financial promotions regulation. The government also intends to consult later in 2020 on the broader regulatory approach to cryptoassets, including new challenges from so-called \u2018stablecoins\u2019.Call for evidence for the Payments Landscape Review \u2013 In light of rapid technology developments, HM Treasury, working alongside the regulators and the Financial Policy Committee, is leading a Payments Landscape Review to make sure the UK\u2019s payments infrastructure and regulation are keeping pace. As part of this, HM Treasury will shortly be publishing a call for evidence to ask what more could be done by the government, industry and regulators to support a more innovative and resilient payments system and ensure the UK payments sector remains world leading.Open finance for SMEs \u2013 In order to realise the vision for truly open finance, in which SMEs can share their data at the touch of a button, making it faster and easier to shop around for credit, HM Treasury will convene a summit with those at the cutting edge of industry innovation to establish what further data needs to be opened up.Digital Identity Unit \u2013 The government will work to create a digital identity market that makes it possible for people to prove things about themselves without showing paper documents. This will help make opening a bank account, claiming benefits or buying a house simpler, safer and quicker. More secure and cost-effective online transactions will also boost business and the digital economy.Affordable Credit Challenge Fund \u2013 By harnessing the UK\u2019s world-leading fintech expertise, this \u00a32 million challenge fund promotes the development of innovative tech solutions that improve awareness and access to affordable lenders as an alternative to high cost credit. The winners of the challenge are Fair for You with EML and Lending Metrics, Police Credit Union with Credit Kudos, and Capital Credit Union with Nivo and Soar who will each receive \u00a3200,000 to further develop and scale their solutions.2.44  Financial transactions, asset sales and other decisionsRoyal Bank of Scotland \u2013 The government intends to fully dispose of its Royal Bank of Scotland shareholding, subject to market conditions and achieving value for money for taxpayers. The government expects the programme of sales to be completed by 2024-25.UK Asset Resolution (UKAR) \u2013 UKAR\u2019s balance sheet has reduced from \u00a3115.8 billion in 2010 to \u00a38 billion following the latest sale of assets.[footnote 109] The government expects to return UKAR\u2019s subsidiaries Bradford & Bingley (B&B), NRAM Ltd[footnote 110] and their remaining assets to private ownership in 2020, subject to achieving value for money and market conditions remaining supportive.In May 2019, the government transferred sponsorship of B&B\u2019s and NRAM Ltd\u2019s pension schemes to UKAR in preparation for B&B and NRAM Ltd being returned to private ownership. The government intends, subject to securing the necessary parliamentary time, to create a new central government pension scheme for the members of the B&B and NRAM schemes. Members\u2019 pensions will not be affected by this transfer. Following the establishment of a new central government pension scheme, the government intends to sell assets held by the NRAM and B&B schemes over 2023-24 and 2024-25, subject to the necessary legislation being brought forward, supportive market conditions and achieving value for money.Student loan sale \u2013 In December 2018, the government completed the second in its programme of sales of pre-2012 income-contingent student loans, expected to raise \u00a315 billion by 2022-23. The sale raised \u00a31.9 billion, reducing PSND and achieving value for money. Following an internal review, which was published at Budget, the government has decided not to pursue additional sales of pre-2012 income-contingent student loans.The government continues to explore options for the sale of wider corporate and financial assets, where there is no longer a policy reason to retain them and when value for money can be secured for taxpayers.Retail Prices Index consultation \u2013 Alongside the Budget, the government and UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) are launching a consultation, announced on 4 September 2019,[footnote 111] on UKSA\u2019s proposal to address the shortcomings of the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation. The consultation will cover, among other things, the issue of timing, including whether the UKSA\u2019s proposal might be implemented at a date other than 2030, and if so, when between 2025 and 2030, and issues on technical matters concerning the implementation of its proposal. The consultation will be open for a period of six weeks, closing on 22 April 2020. The government and UKSA will respond to the consultation before the Parliamentary summer recess.MPC remit \u2013 The Chancellor is responsible for setting the MPC\u2019s remit. In the Budget, the Chancellor reaffirms the symmetric inflation target of 2% for the 12-month increase in the CPI measure of inflation. This target applies at all times.[footnote 112] The Chancellor also confirms that the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) will remain in place for the financial year 2020-21.Balance Sheet Review \u2013 The government manages assets worth \u00a32 trillion alongside \u00a34.6 trillion of liabilities on behalf of citizens.[footnote 113] The Balance Sheet Review (BSR) was launched in 2017 to identify opportunities to dispose of assets that no longer serve a policy purpose, improve returns on retained assets, and reduce the risk and cost of liabilities. This work aims to put the UK at the forefront of the international drive to reduce waste and deliver improvements in the cost-effective management of public wealth, as recognised by the IMF in its October 2018 Fiscal Monitor. The BSR will conclude and report at this year\u2019s Comprehensive Spending Review.The government is exposed to \u00a3192 billion of contingent liabilities, including guarantees and insurance provided to the private sector.[footnote 114] The BSR has developed proposals to improve the management of these liabilities and address a key balance sheet risk recognised by the OBR in its July 2019 Fiscal Risk Report.[footnote 115] The government is publishing a report alongside Budget: \u2018Government as insurer of last resort\u2019 providing more detail on the policy approach.Annex A: FinancingThis annex sets out the details of the government\u2019s financing plans in 2020-21. Further details can be found in the \u2018Debt management report 2020-21\u2019, available at www.gov.uk.Debt management objectiveThe debt management objective, as set out in the \u2018Debt management report 2020-21\u2019, is\u201cto minimise, over the long term, the costs of meeting the government\u2019s financing needs, taking into account risk, while ensuring that debt management policy is consistent with the aims of monetary policy.\u201dDebt management policyWhile decisions on debt management policy must be taken with a long-term perspective, specific decisions on funding the government\u2019s gross financing requirement are taken annually. Those decisions are announced before the start of the forthcoming financial year and can be updated during the year.Index-linked giltsAt Budget 2018 \u2013 and as part of the government\u2019s responsible approach to fiscal risk management \u2013 the government announced that it would look to reduce the proportion of index-linked gilt issuance in a measured fashion over the medium term. Consistent with this, the 2020-21 financing remit includes a reduction in index-linked gilt issuance compared with 2019-20.Alongside the Budget, the government and the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) are launching a consultation, announced on 4 September 2019, on UKSA\u2019s proposal to address the shortcomings of the RPI measure of inflation. The consultation will be open for responses for a period of six weeks, closing on 22 April. The government and UKSA will respond to the consultation before the Parliamentary summer recess.Financing arithmeticThe financing arithmetic is set out in Table A.1.The OBR\u2019s March 2020 \u2018Economic and fiscal outlook\u2019 forecast for the 2020-21 central government net cash requirement (excluding NRAM ltd, Bradford & Bingley and Network Rail), which is referred to as CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B and NR), is \u00a365.3 billion. This measure is used in the financing arithmetic as it reflects the forecast cash requirement of the Exchequer. The relationship between public sector net borrowing and CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B and NR) is set out in the OBR\u2019s March 2020 \u2018Economic and fiscal outlook\u2019. The OBR\u2019s forecast does not incorporate either the most recent estimate of the likely fiscal impact of Covid-19 or the government\u2019s policy response. The government\u2019s financing plans for 2020-21 will be updated to reflect this at a later date.The net financing requirement (NFR) for the Debt Management Office (DMO) comprises: CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B and NR) plus any financing for gilt redemptions and other adjustments, less the net contribution to financing from NS&I and any other in-year contributions to financing.The NFR for 2020-21 is forecast to be \u00a3156.1 billion, reflecting:\t    the forecast for CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B and NR) of \u00a365.3 billion  \t    gilt redemptions of \u00a397.6 billion  \t    a planned short-term financing adjustment of -\u00a30.8 billion resulting from unanticipated over funding in 2019-20  \t    a net contribution to financing from NS&I of \u00a36 billion  As set out in Table A.1, the NFR for 2020-21 will be met by gilt sales of \u00a3156.1 billion. It is currently anticipated that there will be a zero net contribution to debt financing in 2020-21 from Treasury bills.Gilt issuance by method, type and maturityDecisions on the skew of gilt issuance are made annually with reference to the government\u2019s debt management objective, as set out in the \u2018Debt management report 2020-21\u2019.Auctions will remain the government\u2019s primary method of gilt issuance. It is anticipated that \u00a3124.1 billion (79.5%) of total gilt sales will be issued by auction in 2020-21, and up to around \u00a324.0 billion (15.4%) will be issued by syndication. The government will continue to use gilt tenders to supplement issuance by auction and syndication.Issuance by auction and syndication is planned to be split by maturity and type as follows:\t    \u00a351.0 billion of short conventional gilts (32.7% of total issuance)  \t    \u00a334.2 billion of medium conventional gilts (21.9% of total issuance)  \t    \u00a342.3 billion of long conventional gilts (27.1% of total issuance)  \t    \u00a320.6 billion of index-linked gilts (13.2% of total issuance)  The financing plans of the DMO include an initially unallocated portion of issuance through which gilts of any maturity or type may be issued, subject to prior notification. This unallocated portion is set at \u00a38.0 billion (5.1% of total issuance). The unallocated portion is used in such a way as to respond appropriately to evolving market conditions in-year.Treasury billsTreasury bills for debt management purposes are forecast to constitute \u00a362.0 billion of the total debt stock at the end of 2019-20. It is currently anticipated that net issuance of Treasury bills for debt management purposes will be zero, which means that they will make no net contribution to debt financing in 2020-21.NS&INS&I will have a net financing target of \u00a36 billion in 2020-21, within a range of \u00a33 billion to \u00a39 billion.

This letter sets out the Department\u2019s view on some of the most common queries.   On 24 March, the Department published guidance and allocations to billing authorities on delivery of the hardship fund. The guidance can be found at:  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/council-tax-covid-19-hardship-fund-2020-to-2021-guidance  In preparing the guidance, the Government took into account requests from the sector for a balanced approach which gave a clear steer on the target group for the support while providing opportunities for local discretion, allowing councils to reflect the existing support mechanisms available locally.  Following queries from local authorities and others, we have developed the Q&A at Annex A to address some of the most common topics raised and assist councils in determining how to administer the fund locally in line with the published guidance. The Q&A provides views on how councils might want to implement their schemes. Local authorities are responsible for administering the hardship fund and retain the discretion to make their own decisions on the levels and methods of delivering the additional support. In doing so, they should have regard to the hardship fund guidance and the Government\u2019s aims for the fund, which are to support economically vulnerable people and households through additional council tax relief.     https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/council-tax-covid-19-hardship-fund-2020-to-2021-guidancehttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/council-tax-covid-19-hardship-fund-2020-to-2021-guidanceAnnex A COVID-19 hardship fund Q&A Q. Who qualifies for a discount?  The Government\u2019s expectation is that all working-age LCTS claimants in 2020-21 (who are entitled to working-age LCTS in respect of any part of the 2020-21 council tax liability) will receive a further discount of \u00a3150.  Where, at the point a claimant first becomes entitled to working-age LCTS in 2020-21, their liability for the remainder of the financial year is less than \u00a3150, the discount should be applied to bring the liability down to nil.  The reduction is to be made through the use of powers under section 13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 and is referred to in this document as a hardship fund discount.   Q. Should the hardship fund discount be applied pro-rata based on length of LCTS eligibility?  The hardship fund discount should be applied at the point a claimant first becomes entitled to working-age LCTS in 2020-21.  It should be applied against the claimant\u2019s liability for the remainder of the financial year, after the application of any relevant discounts, exemptions and council tax support. Where the liability for the remainder of the financial year is less than \u00a3150, the discount should be applied to bring the liability down to nil. A current working-age LCTS claimant whose LCTS eligibility ends part way through the year (or who reaches pension-age and switches to pension-age LCTS), should retain their hardship fund discount unaltered.  A claimant receiving working-age LCTS for the first time from, for example, mid-year, should also be entitled to a full \u00a3150 discount against their liability for the remainder of the financial year, after the application of any relevant discounts, exemptions and council tax support. Where the liability for the remainder of the financial year is less than \u00a3150, the discount should be applied to bring the liability down to nil.  Q. How should the discount be applied? Councils should consider how best to profile support delivered using the fund, balancing the need to get support quickly to those in need with deliverability and simplicity of administration.  Where council tax discounts are offered, councils can spread the reduction over the usual instalments.    Q. What happens where an individual\u2019s liability for council tax changes mid-year? An individual\u2019s liability may change mid-year due to a change in their circumstances which impacts on relevant discounts, exemptions or level of council tax support. In such cases, councils may also need to reassess the level of hardship fund discount.  If liability increases, and an individual had not previously been entitled to a full hardship fund discount because their former liability was less than \u00a3150, they should receive a further reduction to take their total hardship fund discount to \u00a3150, even if their LCTS eligibility has ended.  If liability decreases mid-year (as a result of increased eligibility for LCTS or discounts and exemptions), councils may need to reassess the level of hardship fund discount, noting that the level of discounts cannot exceed the total liability. Individual councils should satisfy themselves that they are using their discretionary section 13A(1)(c) powers in accordance with the regulations, noting that a taxpayer\u2019s liability cannot be reduced below nil.   Q. Can we offer a discount of more than \u00a3150? Yes. Councils can use their discretionary section 13A(1)(c) powers to reduce council tax liability to any level.  When determining the level of discount to provide, councils will want to reflect on their allocated amount from the hardship fund and the Government\u2019s expectation that all working-age LCTS claimants in 2020-21 will receive a further discount of \u00a3150.  Q. Can we use the fund to award reductions to non-LCTS recipients/to fund local welfare schemes?  Where councils have allocated funding to meet the Government\u2019s expectation that all working-age LCTS claimants in 2020-21 will receive a further discount of \u00a3150 (up to a maximum of the remaining liability for the financial year from the point of LCTS eligibility, after the application of any relevant discounts, exemptions and LCTS) they can use any remaining allocation as they see fit. In doing so, they should take into account the Government\u2019s expectation that the fund should support economically vulnerable people and households, and that most of the funding will be used to provide more council tax relief, either through existing local council tax support schemes, or through complementary reliefs.  Q. What happens where an individual moves address? When individuals move address within an authority area, councils should ensure that all working-age LCTS recipients receive a discount of \u00a3150 against their total council tax liability from the point they first became entitled to LCTS. If people move between local authority areas, where possible the councils should liaise to ensure that an appropriate level of assistance is provided.    Q. What happens in the case of joint and several liability? Where individuals are jointly and severally liable for council tax, and any of the individuals are entitled to LCTS, the government expects the reduction of \u00a3150 to be applied to the liability for the whole property (regardless of whether one or all of the liable parties are entitled to LCTS), from the earliest date of LCTS entitlement for any of the liable parties.   Q. What records should councils be keeping? Authorities should keep a separate record of grant expenditure under this scheme, both through the council tax system and their own local support mechanisms. MHCLG will be collecting data on the implementation of the scheme as part of wider data collection exercises regarding the response to COVID-19.  Councils should as a minimum keep records as follows: \u2022 Grant expenditure on the expected \u00a3150 s13A(1)(c) reductions for working-age LCTS recipients \u2022 Grant expenditure on any other s13A(1)(c) council tax reductions  \u2022 Grant expenditure through additional support outside of the council tax system (eg. local welfare schemes)  Q. When will New Burdens funding be provided?  The Government will provide funding to cover the additional costs of delivering the fund in line with the New Burdens doctrine. We are working with the sector and software suppliers to assess those costs.   "}]}
