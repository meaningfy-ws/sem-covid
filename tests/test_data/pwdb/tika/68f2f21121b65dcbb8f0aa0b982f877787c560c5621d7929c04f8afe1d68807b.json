In total the measure will cost around \u20ac200 million to the federal government. Minister of Health Vandenbroucke (SP.a) stated that the care personnel did not specifically request the measure, but deserve it because of their ongoing (and continuing) efforts during this crisis.", "descriptionContentOfMeasure": "The measure is quite straightforward and provides a gross premium of \u20ac985 to all care personnel. The measure should have been paid out relatively quickly before the 31 December 2020. People that do not perform a fulltime job in the sector receive a percentage of the amount.\rThe premium goes hand in hand with the recent extension of the consumption cheque to the entire care sector. In addition, a large social agreement was signed providing \u20ac600 million to the care sector for the future in order to fund structural and sustainable investments in the sector. This includes a re-evaluation of care jobs via increased wages and better working conditions.", "descriptionUseOfMeasure": "The entire care sector is eligible.\rAt the end of the year it became clear that after taxes relatively little remained of the \u20ac985, which was heavily criticised by the sector.", "descriptionInvolvementOfSocialPartners": "The social partners were involved and an additional important agreement granting \u20ac600 million to the sector was signed as well.", "socialPartner_form": "", "socialPartner_role": "", "calc_githubURL": "https://static.eurofound.europa.eu/covid19db/cases/BE-2020-45_1682.html", "isOccupation": "No", "isSector": "Yes", "sector_privateOrPublic": "Not specified", "calc_type": "Legislations or other statutory regulations", "statusOfRegulation": "Entirely new measure "}, "portalData": {"sources": [{"recordId": "2527", "sources::title": "RIZIV", "sources::url": "https://www.riziv.fgov.be/nl/covid19/Paginas/aanmoedigingspremie-ziekenhuispersoneel.asp", "sources::d_date": "11/15/2020", "modId": "0", "content_path": "res/2ae1e9656a78f876213b5e70a3f19ada81a6b95cc1f1ba956dd8efbbc2e570a6", "content": null}], "actors": [{"recordId": "1", "actors::name": "National government", "modId": "3"}], "targetGroups": [{"recordId": "73", "targetGroups::name": "Workers in care facilities", "modId": "8"}], "funding": [{"recordId": "7", "funding::name": "National funds", "modId": "0"}], "occupations": [], "sectors": [{"recordId": "118", "sectors::code": "Q86", "sectors::name": "Human health activities", "modId": "0"}, {"recordId": "119", "sectors::code": "Q87", "sectors::name": "Residential care activities", "modId": "0"}], "updates": [], "regions": []}, "recordId": "1592", "modId": "22"}
