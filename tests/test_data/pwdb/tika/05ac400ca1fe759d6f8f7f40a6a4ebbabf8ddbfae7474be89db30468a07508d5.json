Although, these same measures had an unprecedented impact on the entirety of the tourism sector.\r\rWith a view to the immediate introduction of specific public support mechanisms for the\rtourism sector in order to safeguard the full activity of companies and their human capital, Normative Order  4/2020, of 20 March, created the Support Line for Tourism Microenterprises. The performance of that Line was reinforced through Normative Order 10/2020, of 11 August.\r\rThe current epidemiological situation, as well as the measures recently adopted for prevention,\rcontainment and mitigation of infection, justify a new update of the support line for micro tourist companies, through the introduction of a set of changes that, in the current context, ensure continuity of access to liquidity by economic agents, thus minimizing the significant disruptions in its activity resulting from public health and safety imperatives.", "content_of_measure_description": "Normative Dispatch 1/2021, of 11 January, creates a financial support line for micro and small tourist companies aimed at meeting the cash flow needs of micro and small tourist companies whose activity is strongly affected by the economic effects resulting from the outbreak of the disease COVID-19.\r\rThe maximum budget available is \u20ac100 million, broken down as follows: micro-enterprises: \u20ac90,000,000; and small businesses: \u20ac10,000,000.\r\rThe financial support to be granted under this line is in the nature of repayable support, without any associated remuneration interest.
