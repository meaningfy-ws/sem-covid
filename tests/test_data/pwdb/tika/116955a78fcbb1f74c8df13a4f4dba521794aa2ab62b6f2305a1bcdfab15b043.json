In this Chapter \u2013 \t\t\t\u2018medical officer of health\u2019 has the same meaning as it has in the Health Act 1947; \t\t\t\u2018Covid-19\u2019 means a disease caused by infection with the virus SARS-CoV-2 and specified as an infectious disease in accordance with Regulation 6 of, and the Schedule to, the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 (S.I. No. 390 of 1981) or any variant of the disease so specified as an infectious disease in those Regulations. \t\t\tPersons deemed incapable of work \t\t\t28J. For the purpose of Chapter 8 of Part 2, and for no other purpose, a person who is not incapable of work shall, if it is so decided under the provisions of the Principal Act, be deemed to be incapable of work by reason of a specified infectious disease by virtue of \u2013 \t\t\t(a) being certified in accordance with article 28Q by a registered medical practitioner as being a person who is a probable source of infection of Covid-19, \t\t\t(b) having been notified by a medical officer of health that he or she is a probable source of infection of Covid-19, or \t\t\t(c) being a person in respect of whom an order under section 38A(1) of the Health Act 1947 is in force. \t\t\tMinimum contribution conditions \t\t\t28K. Where a claimant is a person to whom section 40(7) applies and who would be entitled to illness benefit but for the fact that he or she does not satisfy the contribution conditions contained in section 41(1), he or she shall be entitled to benefit if, immediately before claiming illness benefit, he or she \u2013 \t\t\t(a) is an employed contributor who \u2013 \t\t\t(i) has qualifying contributions in respect of not less than 1 contribution week in the 4 weeks immediately before claiming illness benefit, and \t\t\t(ii) has not engaged in employment since the date of his or her claim for illness benefit, \t\t\tor \t\t\t(b) is a self-employed contributor, or has verified that he or she was self-employed immediately before claiming illness benefit by making a declaration, in such form as the Minister may determine or consider appropriate having regard to the circumstances, whether in writing, by means of an electronic communication or in another manner, that he or she \u2013 \t\t\t(i) was engaged in self-employment immediately before claiming illness benefit, \t\t\t(ii) has not engaged in self-employment since the date of his or her claim for illness benefit, and \t\t\t(iii) will have reckonable income in the current contribution year and will be liable for the payment of a self-employment contribution under section 21. \t\t\tAdditional conditions \t\t\t28L. Where a claimant is a person to whom section 40(7) applies and has claimed illness benefit he or she must \u2013 \t\t\t(a) not be carrying out his or her employment or self-employment, \t\t\t(b) be following medical advice, and \t\t\t(c) be following relevant guidelines set out by the Executive in relation to the specified infectious disease. \t\t\tPersons not entitled to illness benefit \t\t\t28M. Where a claimant is entitled to illness benefit in respect of any day of incapacity arising from their being a person to whom subsection 40(7) applies, he or she \u2013 \t\t\t(a) shall not be entitled to benefit in respect of any day of incapacity for work, if he or she is entitled to full wages, salary, or paid sick leave under a contract of employment, in respect of any such day, and \t\t\t(b) shall be entitled to a reduced rate or reductions in the rate of illness benefit in respect of any day of incapacity for work, if he or she is entitled to reduced wages, salary, or paid sick leave, for those same days, which is less than the rate of illness benefit to which he or she would otherwise be entitled. \t\t\tInformation to be given when making a claim \t\t\t28N. Where a claim for illness benefit is made by an employed contributor in respect of any day of incapacity arising from being a person to whom subsection 40(7) applies, his or her employer shall, on being so required by an officer of the Minister, furnish to the Minister the following information relating to the employee \u2013 \t\t\t(a) the nature of his or her employment, \t\t\t(b) the total amount of paid sick leave paid to the employee from his or her employment with the employer in respect of any period, \t\t\t(c) the total number of hours worked by the employee in that employment in any period, and \t\t\t(d) any other relevant information that may be required by the said officer. \t\t\tRate of benefit \t\t\t28O.
