Funds are forwarded to employers who are in turn obliged to forward these to their employees. Full time employees in specific sectors will receive \u20ac800 a month from the government through their employers. As part of the agreement, employers in these sectors will continue providing their workers with a further \u20ac400 a month. Employers who were too highly impacted by the pandemic and cannot afford the further \u20ac400 must register with the Department of industrial relations. ", "content_of_measure_description": "Full time employees working in organisations that operate in sectors severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, or on order of the Superintendent of Public Health had to suspend their operations are entitled up to five days salary based on a monthly wage of \u20ac800. This is also applicable to self-employed individuals. Part-time employees are eligible for \u20ac500 a month. The sectors that can apply for this supplement are under constant review and are listed on the Malta Enterprise website (Annex A). \r\rIn other sectors also thought to have been hit by the pandemic but to a lesser degree, the list of which are also available on the Malta Enterprise website (Annex B), full time and part-time employees are entitled to the equivalent of one days' salary per week, set at \u20ac160 per month and \u20ac100 per month, respectively. Those in Gozo are entitled to two days' salary per week; \u20ac320 per month for full-time and \u20ac200 per month for part-time employees.  \r\rFull-time self-employed in sectors thought to have been hit but to a lesser degree who have employees will receive \u20ac320 per month, part-time self employed \u20ac200 per month. Full-time self-employed based in Gozo in these same sectors will also be entitled to \u20ac320 per month but will rise to  \u20ac480 if they employ staff, and the employees will be entitled to two days salary. Part-time self-employed in Gozo will be entitled to \u20ac200, rising to \u20ac300 if they employ staff. The employees will receive two days salary. \r\rIn July 2020, the sectors in Annex A were reviewed and reduced. Those sectors previously supported by this scheme but not included in the updated Annex A will from July 2020 receive a wage supplement of \u20ac600 for full time workers and up to \u20ac375 for part time workers, termed Annex C. It was also announced in July 2020 that pensioners and students who were registered as employed with JobsPlus since the 9 March, may now also be considered for the Wage supplement. These were previously ineligible.", "use_of_measure_description": "By the end of May it was announced that \u20ac55 million had been disbursed, saving 93,580 jobs. A futher \u20ac25 million was expected to be distributed by the beginning of June. \r\rBy mid-September 2020, the Malta Enterprise CEO announced that \u20ac200 million had been spent on this measure. Furthermore, around 85% of those who benefitted from the measure were micro, small and medium enterprises. \r\rA September 2020 study by the Malta Employers Association which was conducted amongst its members found that the COVID-19 wage supplement was rated as the most effective financial measure with 62% rating it as effective. \r\rIn mid-September 2020, the measure had cost \u20ac200 million. This amounts to almost the entire \u20ac215 million budget approved by the EU Commission under the State Aid Temporary Framework adopted by the Commission on 19 March 2020. However, this figure needs to be treated with caution, as various ministers and stakeholders mentioned different sums.\r", "involvement_of_social_partners_description": "Social partners initially aired their COVID-19 related concerns both publicly and directly with the government. This led the government to announce a series of packages, with the current measure forming part of the third package. The measures that formed part of this third package were the result of tripartite negotiations between Malta's largest trade unions, employer associations, the government and the Central Bank. It was unanimously approved by the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development (MCESD). The measure is administered by the Government via the Malta Enterprise.", "social_partner_form": null, "social_partner_role": null, "is_sector_specific": "Yes", "private_or_public_sector": "Only

The scheme was amended following various consultative meetings with the business community and the stakeholders.The details were given out during a press conference addressed by Enterprise Minister Miriam Dalli and Malta Enterprise chief Kurt Farrugia.The wage supplement scheme which was first rolled out last year when the coronavirus pandemic hit the country, is aimed at job retention and assisting the business community and employees.Performing arts sector to receive \u20ac800 wage supplementMinister Dalli explained that one of the main modifications in the renewed scheme is that the government will now also be giving the wage supplement to employees who have started working in May after non-essential shops reopened following their closure due to Covid-19 restrictive measures.\u201cIf a chef quit his job, the employer would have lost the wage supplement he had been receiving for that employee and would not receive a wage supplement for the new employee. With the newly introduced modifications, the employer would receive a wage supplement for the newly employed chef,\u201d Minister Dalli explained.The Wage Supplement Scheme 2021 covers employees who were replaced in summer 2020 and will be paid from October 2020. However, the wage supplement will only be given to the equivalent number of employees that were employed until May.According to the amended scheme, employers are now required to submit documentation showing that the employee resigned from the job out of their own will and that the new employees are enjoying the same work conditions as their predecessors. This is being done to ensure that no abuse takes place and that workers\u2019 rights are protected, the minister stressed.\u201cWe do not want to give any incentives to those employers who have fired employees,\u201d Dalli said, adding that the new system is designed to be fairer in order to help businesses and self-employed who were hit worse by the Covid-19 economic fall-out.60% of the applicants will be retaining their current wage supplement or will be given an increase. Businesses which incurred 55% or more in losses will be eligible to the full wage supplement of \u20ac800 while those who have registered a profit or have registered a loss of 9% or less over the previous year will no longer be eligible for wage supplement.\t% drop in sales\tWage supplement monthly rate (gross) \u2013 full timers \tWage supplement monthly rate (gross) \u2013 part timers & casual workers \t55% or greater\t\u20ac800\t\u20ac500\t45% \u2013 54%\t\u20ac640\t\u20ac400\t35% \u2013 44%\t\u20ac480\t\u20ac300\t25% \u2013 34%\t\u20ac320\t\u20ac200\t10% \u2013 24%\t\u20ac160\t\u20ac100\tIncrease in revenue up to 9% drop in sales\t\u20ac0\t\u20ac0Supplement according to % drop in salesMalta Enterprise CEO Kurt Farrugia said businesses need not to re-apply as the agency will be making use of the original applications.
