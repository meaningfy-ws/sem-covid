", "content_of_measure_description": "To make the necessary changes and maintain continuous operation throughout the crisis, approximately 55% of all employees within the hospital have moved towards another function. Doctors moved to other departments and nurses from 'regular' departments to intensive care. Support personnel was also utilised to man the triage centres in front of the hospitals that were used for large scale testing. Administrative personnel was however also to a large extent obliged to continue working on site (in contrast to the general lockdown rules that apply to the majority of white collar workers). This to try to keep necessary operations going as fluently as possible.\r\rAnother example was the fact that the hospital psychologists were retrained to assist the care personnel instead of their regular clients (that were no longer allowed to enter the hospital). In additional specific stress coaches were appointed in order to deal with stress related issues among staff. Other initiatives were the implementation of fitness rooms for staff use as well as hairdresser services. According to HR managers within the hospital there has been no significant increase in the amount of burn-out cases, this in part due to the attention for mental wellbeing of all employees and the stress of sufficient rest and leave days.
