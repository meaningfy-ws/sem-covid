over redundancies and reformsUpdated / Tuesday, 17 Nov 2020 19:21Earlier this year, the daa said it was seeking between 750 and 1,000 voluntary redundancies to secure savings, following the catastrophic collapse in aviationBy Ingrid MileyIndustry and Employment CorrespondentSIPTU members at the daa, which manages Dublin and Cork Airports, have warned of a challenging industrial relations environment ahead as a row has broken out about redundancies and work practice reforms.\u00a0However, the daa has defended its position on entitlement to redundancy, saying a recent agreement provides that in order to facilitate voluntary redundancies for staff, the company would have to devise \"alternative models of operation\".The dispute involving operatives including cleaners and trolley staff centres on the daa's demand earlier this year for between 750 and 1,000 voluntary redundancies to secure savings, following the catastrophic collapse in aviation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.At the same time the daa was also seeking a set of work practice reforms, which were accepted in a ballot.In a letter to daa Employee Relations manager Brendan O'Hanlon, SIPTU Aviation Sector Organiser Neil McGowan says that at the time, there were \"public pronouncements from all levels of management\" that \"staff options\" including voluntary redundancy would be available for those who wished to avail of them, \"and did not see a future for themselves at the airport under the new ways of working\".Mr McGowan says SIPTU is keen to ensure that those who applied for those staff options prior to the deadline of 17 June are facilitated in availing of these options.However, he states: \"As we have met in recent weeks it has become clear that that is not the case in relation to this group of workers in Dublin Airport unless SIPTU agree to alternative measures that are unpalatable to us.\"Mr\u00a0McGowan says SIPTU has proposed a model based on fixed term contracts, that would allow daa to reduce permanent numbers through redundancy, and deal with future seasonal peaks through short-term contracts.However, he believes this has not been given serious consideration, \"...and we can only speculate as to the reason why.\"The daa manages Dublin and Cork AirportsMr McGowan warns of conflict if, over the coming months, the daa were to decide further redundancies were required, but attempted to reduce the terms of any severance deal.\"In our last meeting we made a point that needs repeating, in a situation where, in a number of months if daa decides that it needs to reduce numbers in this area further and a VSS [Voluntary Severance Scheme] on any lesser terms is offered this will not be acceptable to SIPTU and it will result in an exceptionally challenging industrial relations environment,\" he writes.Mr McGowan tells management that avoiding such a scenario would require a real focus on allowing staff to avail of the options they have applied for - adding that this will in turn necessitate \"movement on the numbers that are afforded the staff options and progress on a redeployment process to enable this\".Mr McGowan concludes by saying that further implementation of the new ways of working must be deferred\u00a0\"until this matter is progressed to a satisfactory outcome\".Speaking to RT\u00c9 News, Mr McGowan also warned that SIPTU would never accept compulsory redundancies.A daa spokesperson said the company had stated from the outset that the overall staff options process was a voluntary one - \"both on behalf of the employee and the company\".\"In this specific part of the business there is a clause in the recently negotiated and approved agreement with SIPTU which states that in order to facilitate staff options in this area, the company would have to devise alternative models of operation,\" he stated.He said that daa was currently doing that, and would continue to engage with staff and their representatives.More stories

The interaction came after the staff member emailed him to raise concerns about industrial relations issues, prompting Philips to arrange a face-to-face meeting.                                                                                                                                DAA's passenger numbers at Dublin and Cork airports were down 85pc in August compared to 2019, and by June it had already lost \u20ac160m in turnover due to the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                According to communications seen by the Sunday Independent, Siptu and the airport authority have now agreed a set of proposals that the trade union is prepared to put to a ballot of airport search unit staff following what it described as \"an extensive set of discussions\".                                                                                                                                 \"Significant progress\" had been made after \"exceptionally challenging\" negotiations, according to a senior trade union official. \"We have arrived at the best possible set of proposals achievable given the current circumstances and the long term outlook for the airport,\" the official added.                                                                                                                The staff member who met with Philips began the interaction \"in the hopes that somehow, despite the state of relations between our department and management, some understanding may be had,\" they said in the email to Philips,  detailing a long list of grievances but insisted that staff understood the company's situation.                                                                                                                                 \"Savings are here to be made. We are not unbending but we are utterly without trust,\" the person wrote. Philips responded to request a meeting with the individual staff member: \"Clearly there's a total miscommunication between what I'm trying to say and what you are hearing in your team. We're heading into a wall economically as a company - and whilst in many areas there is work, in others we're totally over-staffed. I thought that keeping people's wages going was the right thing to do in this crisis (vs what other companies have done). But clearly you have strong and clear views - which I'd love to talk to you about further. Would you mind me giving you a call - as it would really help me to talk this through.\"                                                                                                                Following a subsequent lunch meeting, the staff member reacted angrily in a follow-up email to the CEO after another senior DAA manager sent out a set of proposed work practice changes that unions had refused to put to ballot. Philips replied that the manager's intent \"was one of trying to help - not hinder the process. I'm sorry if others felt there was more to it. There absolutely wasn't\".                                                                                                                                A DAA spokesman said while it would not be appropriate to comment on the contents of a personal email between Philips and an individual employee, \"it's normal for Dalton to respond directly to staff members who raise issues with him and to meet them to discuss any concerns they may have\".

DAA, the State company responsible for both airports, is losing \u20ac1 million per day while Covid-19 restrictions continue to hit air travel.                                                        Dalton Philips, DAA chief executive, told staff on Friday that unions representing the \u201cvast majority\u201d of working groups will be recommending agreed changes to staff.                                                        As a result, unions including Mandate, Siptu and F\u00f3rsa will shortly begin balloting members in these areas.                                                        Mr Philips noted that DAA has already opened applications for voluntary redundancy to these staff.                                                        However, craft unions Unite and Connect, and security staff, represented by Siptu, have not yet reached agreement with DAA, so are not in a position to ballot members.                                                                                                                                                                                            As a consequence, Mr Philips said DAA could not guarantee that those workers will continue to receive 80 per cent of their pay beyond August 29th, nor could it open applications for voluntary redundancy to staff in those areas.                                                        DAA staff took a 20 per cent pay cut in April after air travel was largely grounded across Europe and the US, but the company pledged there would be no further reductions until August 29th.                                                        The company says that workers who are balloting will continue to receive 80 per cent of their pay beyond that date.                                                        Mr Philips confirmed that, assuming a yes vote in a ballot, DAA would continue to guarrantee staff 80 per cent of their pay while working to restore this to 100 per cent as quickly as possible.                                                        SurpriseUnite regional officer, Willie Quigley, who represents airport workers, expressed surprise at the DAA chief executive\u2019s remarks.                                                        He explained that the union was not at the point where it could make a recommendation to DAA members, and thus could not hold a ballot.                                                                                                                                                \u201cBut we do intend to get to that point, we are trying to get to that point as soon as possible,\u201d Mr Quigley said.
