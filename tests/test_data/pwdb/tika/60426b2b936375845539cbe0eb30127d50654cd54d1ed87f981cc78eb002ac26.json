The plan is focused on boosting economic recovery, following the UK's lockdown and the recent easing of restrictions. The Chancellor described the plan as the 'second phase' of response to the coronavirus crisis and as being about jobs. He began his speech by stating that the government will not accept rising unemployment and that it will do all it can to give 'everyone the opportunity of good and secure work.' The Plan for Jobs has 'a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs', given the 25% contraction in the UK economy in the preceding months and the predictions by the\u00a0Office for Budget Responsibility and Bank of England as to\u00a0significant job losses.\r", "content_of_measure_description": "These initiatives are aimed at supporting young people, who it is predicted, will be hardest hit by the crisis (the Chancellor reported that the under-25s are two and a half times more likely to work in a sector that has been closed e.g. retail and hospitality).\u00a0The new Kickstart Scheme is thus a\u00a0'new programme to give hundreds of thousands of young people, in every region and nation of Britain, the best possible chance of getting on and getting a job.'\r\rUnder the scheme, employers will be directly paid to create new jobs for any\u00a016 to 24-year-old at risk of long-term unemployment.\u00a0These will have to be new jobs, as the\u00a0funding will be conditional on proof that\u00a0these jobs are additional. The jobs will have to be 'decent';\u00a0with a minimum of 25 hours per week paid at least the National Minimum Wage.\u00a0 Employers will also have to provide\u00a0'Kickstarters' with training and support to find a permanent job.\u00a0If employers meet these conditions, the Government\u00a0will pay young people\u2019s wages for six months, plus an amount to cover overheads. Thus, for\u00a0a 24-year-old, the grant will be around GBP 6,500.\r\rEmployers can apply to be part of the scheme from August. There is to be no cap on the numbers of places available and the Chancellor has pledged\u00a0an initial GBP  billion, a sum he says will be enough to fund hundreds of thousands of jobs.\r\rThe Government also pledged on the 8 July\u00a0to: \r\r* pay employers GBP 1,000 to take on new\u00a0trainees, with triple the number of places;\r* provide GBP 100 million to create more places on Level 2 and 3 courses, so as to support 18-19-year olds leaving school or college to find work in high-demand sectors like engineering, construction and social care;\u00a0\r* funding for\u00a0new careers advisers to support over a quarter of a million more people; \r* for the next six months, paying employers to create new apprenticeships and paying businesses to hire young apprentices, with a payment of GBP 2,000 per apprentice. \r* In addition, there will be a new bonus for businesses to hire apprentices aged 25 and over, with a\u00a0payment of GBP 1,500.\r", "use_of_measure_description": "As yet unknown.

And the independent Office for Budget Responsibility and Bank of England are both projecting significant job losses \u2013 the most urgent challenge we now face.I want every person in this House and in the country to know that I will never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome.We haven\u2019t done everything we have so far just to step back now and say, \u2018job done\u2019. In truth, the job has only just begun.Mr Speaker,If the first phase of our economic response was about protection\u2026\u2026and the second phase \u2013 the phase we are addressing today - is about jobs\u2026\u2026there will come a third phase, where we will rebuild.My Right Honourable Friend the Prime Minister has set out our vision to level up, unite the country, spread opportunity, and repair and heal the wounds exposed through this crisis.I can tell the House we will produce a Budget and Spending Review in the autumn.And, we will deal too, with the challenges facing our public finances.Over the medium-term, we must, and we will, put our public finances back on a sustainable footing.In other words, our Plan for Jobs will not be the last action \u2013 it is merely the next - in our fight to recover and rebuild after coronavirus.Mr Speaker,Let me now turn to the detail of our plan for jobs.Central to our economic response has been the Jobs Retention Scheme.Furlough has been a lifeline for millions, supporting people and businesses to protect jobs.But it cannot and should not go on forever.I know that when furlough ends it will be a difficult moment.I\u2019m also sure that if I say the scheme must end in October, critics will say it should end in November.If I say it should end in November, critics will just say December.But the truth is: calling for endless extensions to the furlough is just as irresponsible as it would have been, back in June, to end the scheme overnight.We have to be honest.Leaving the furlough scheme open forever gives people false hope that it will always be possible to return to the jobs they had before.And the longer people are on furlough, the more likely it is their skills could fade, and they will find it harder to get new opportunities.It is in no-one\u2019s long term interests for the scheme to continue forever\u2026\u2026least of all those trapped in a job that can only exist because of a government subsidy.So the furlough will wind down, flexibly and gradually, supporting businesses and people through to October.But while we can\u2019t protect every job, one of the most important things we can do to prevent unemployment\u2026\u2026is to get as many people as possible from furlough back to their jobs.So, today, we\u2019re introducing a new policy to reward and incentivise employers who successfully bring furloughed staff back \u2013 a new Jobs Retention Bonus.If you\u2019re an employer and you bring someone back who was furloughed - and you continuously employ them through to January \u2013 we will pay you a \u00a31,000 bonus per employee.It is vital people aren\u2019t just returning for the sake of it \u2013 they need to be doing decent work.So for businesses to get this bonus, the employee must be paid at least \u00a3520 on average, in each month from November to January\u2026\u2026the equivalent of the lower earnings limit in National Insurance.The House should understand the significance of this policy.We will pay the bonus for all furloughed employees.So if employers bring back all nine million people who have been furloughed, this would be a \u00a39 billion policy to retain people in work.Our message to business is clear: if you stand by your workers, we will stand by you.Mr Speaker,The furlough was the right policy to support people through the first phase of this crisis.But now, in this new phase, we need to evolve our approach.Today, I want to set out for the House a new three-point plan for jobs. We need to:\t    first \u2013 support people to find jobs  \t    second \u2013 create jobs  \t    and third \u2013 protect jobs  Mr Speaker,Let me start with supporting jobs, and in particular the help we want to provide for those who will be hardest hit by this crisis: younger people.Over 700,000 people are leaving education this year.Many more are just starting out in their careers.Coronavirus has hit them hard - under 25s are two and a half times as likely to work in a sector that has been closed.We cannot lose this generation, so today, I am announcing the Kickstart Scheme:A new programme to give hundreds of thousands of young people, in every region and nation of Britain, the best possible chance of getting on and getting a job.The Kickstart Scheme will directly pay employers to create new jobs for any 16 to 24-year-old at risk of long-term unemployment.These will be new jobs - with the funding conditional on the firm proving these jobs are additional.These will be decent jobs \u2013 with a minimum of 25 hours per week paid at least the National Minimum Wage.And they will be good quality jobs \u2013 with employers providing Kickstarters with training and support to find a permanent job.If employers meet these conditions, we will pay young people\u2019s wages for six months, plus an amount to cover overheads.That means, for a 24-year-old, the grant will be around \u00a36,500.Employers can apply to be part of the scheme from next month, with the first Kickstarters in their new jobs this autumn.And I urge every employer, big or small, national or local, to hire as many Kickstarters as possible.Today, I\u2019m making available an initial \u00a32 billion; enough to fund hundreds of thousands of jobs.And I commit today: there will be no cap on the number of places available.We can do more for young people:\t    traineeships are a proven scheme to get young people ready for work. We know they work, so for the first time ever we will pay employers \u00a31,000 to take on new trainees, with triple the number of places  \t    to support 18-19-year olds leaving school or college to find work in high-demand sectors like engineering, construction and social care, we\u2019ll provide \u00a3100 million to create more places on Level 2 and 3 courses  \t    and the evidence says careers advice works, so we will fund it, with enough new careers advisers to support over a quarter of a million more people.  We will also expand our universal skills offer:Sector-Based Work Academies provide training, work placements, and a guaranteed job interview in high-demand sectors.The evidence shows they work, so we will expand them \u2013 tripling the number of places.And we know apprenticeships work, too \u2013 91% of apprentices stay in work or do further training afterwards.So for the next six months, we\u2019re going to pay employers to create new apprenticeships.We will pay businesses to hire young apprentices, with a new payment of \u00a32,000 per apprentice.And we will introduce a brand-new bonus for businesses to hire apprentices aged 25 and over, with a payment of \u00a31,500.And let me thank my Right Honourable Friend the Education Secretary for his support and commitment in developing these measures.Mr Speaker,We know the longer someone is out of work, the harder it is to return.Millions of people are moving onto Universal Credit \u2013 they need urgent support to get back to work.So, we are:\t    doubling the number of Work Coaches in Job Centres  \t    increasing the Flexible Support Fund  \t    extending the Rapid Response Service  \t    expanding the Work and Health Programme  \t    and developing a new scheme to support the long-term unemployed  The academic and economic evidence tells us these are among the most effective things we can do.So I\u2019m investing an extra billion pounds in DWP, to support millions of people back to work.And I\u2019m grateful for everything my Right Honourable Friend the Work and Pensions secretary, and her incredible team, have done.\u00a31 billion of support for the unemployed; more money for skills, traineeships, and apprenticeships; and a new, good quality job for hundreds of thousands of new Kickstarters \u2013 the first part of our plan for jobs.Mr Speaker,The second part of our plan is to support job creation.That begins with historic investment in infrastructure \u2013 creating jobs in every region and nation of the UK.At Budget, I announced \u00a388 billion of capital funding this year; and last week the Prime Minister announced our plans to accelerate \u00a35 billion of additional investment projects.We are doubling down on our ambition to level up\u2026\u2026with better roads, better schools, better hospitals, better high streets, creating jobs in all four corners of our country.Mr Speaker,As well as investing in infrastructure, we want to create green jobs.This is going to be a green recovery with concern for our environment at its heart.As part of that, I\u2019m announcing today a new, \u00a32 billion Green Homes Grant.From September, homeowners and landlords will be able to apply for vouchers to make their homes more energy efficient and create local jobs.The grants will cover at least two thirds of the cost, up to \u00a35,000 per household.And for low income households, we\u2019ll go even further with vouchers covering the full cost - up to \u00a310,000.On top of the \u00a32 billion voucher scheme, I am releasing \u00a31 billion of funding to improve the energy efficiency of public sector buildings\u2026\u2026alongside a \u00a350 million fund to pilot the right approach to decarbonise social housing.Taken together, we expect these measures to:\t    make over 650,000 homes more energy efficient  \t    save households up to \u00a3300 a year on their bills  \t    cut carbon by more than half a mega tonne per year, equivalent to taking 270,000 cars off the road  \t    and, most importantly right now, support around 140,000 green jobs  A \u00a33 billion green jobs plan to save money; cut carbon; and create jobs.Mr Speaker,One of the most important sectors for job creation is housing.The construction sector adds \u00a339 billion a year to the UK economy;House building alone supports nearly three quarter of a million jobs;With millions more relying on the availability of housing to find work.But property transactions fell by 50% in May.House prices have fallen for the first time in eight years.And uncertainty abounds in the market \u2013 a market we need to be thriving.We need people feeling confident - confident to buy, sell, renovate, move and improve.That will drive growth. That will create jobs.So to catalyse the housing market and boost confidence, I have decided today to cut stamp duty.Right now, there is no stamp duty on transactions below \u00a3125,000.Today, I am increasing the threshold to half a million pounds.This will be a temporary cut running until 31st March next year.And, as is always the case, these changes to stamp duty will take effect immediately.The average stamp duty bill will fall by \u00a34,500.And nearly nine out of ten people buying a main home this year, will pay no stamp duty at all.Stamp duty cuts; A \u00a35,000 Green Homes Grant; And tens of billions of pounds of new capital projects.We are creating jobs, the second part of our Plan for Jobs.Mr Speaker,The final part of our plan will protect jobs that already exist by helping some of our highest-employing but hardest-hit sectors: hospitality and tourism.Our economy relies on consumption, especially social consumption:The pubs, cafes, restaurants, hotels and B&Bs that bring life to our villages, towns and cities.Taken together these sectors employ over 2 million people disproportionately younger, women and people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.And many rural and coastal communities rely on these industries.80% of hospitality firms temporarily stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers have been furloughed, the highest proportions of any sector.So the best jobs programme we can do is to restart these sectors and get our pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s and B&Bs bustling again.I know people are cautious about going out.But we wouldn\u2019t have lifted the restrictions if we didn\u2019t think we could do so safely.And I\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks how hard businesses are working to make their premises safe.And if we follow the guidance, and respect what they ask us to do, we can all enjoy summer safely.In turn, we need to give these businesses the confidence to know that if they open up, invest in making their premises safe, and protect jobs, demand will be there, and be there quickly.So today, I\u2019m announcing two new measures to get these sectors moving and protect jobs.First, at the moment, VAT on hospitality and tourism is charged at 20%.So I\u2019ve decided, for the next six months, to cut VAT on food, accommodation and attractions.Eat-in or hot takeaway food from restaurants, cafes and pubs;Accommodation in hotels, B&Bs, campsites and caravan sites;Attractions like cinemas, theme parks and zoos;All these and more will see VAT reduced from next Wednesday until January 12th, from 20% to 5%.This is a \u00a34 billion catalyst for the hospitality and tourism sectors, benefiting over 150,000 businesses, and consumers everywhere - all helping to protect 2.4 million jobs.But, Mr Speaker, we will go further.The final measure I\u2019m announcing today has never been tried in the UK before.This moment is unique. We need to be creative.So, to get customers back into restaurants, cafes and pubs, and protect the 1.8 million people who work in them\u2026\u2026I can announce today that, for the month of August, we will give everyone in the country an Eat Out to Help Out discount.Meals eaten at any participating business, Monday to Wednesday, will be 50% off, up to a maximum discount of \u00a310 per head for everyone, including children.Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a simple website, open next Monday.Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within 5 working days.1.8 million people work in this industry. They need our support and with this measure we can all eat out to help out.A VAT cut to 5%;And a first-of-its-kind government-backed discount for all;That\u2019s the third part of our Plan for Jobs. \u2003So, Mr Speaker,A \u00a31,000 Jobs Retention Bonus.New, high quality jobs for hundreds of thousands of young Kickstarters.\u00a31bn to double the number of work coaches and support the unemployed.More apprenticeships; more traineeships; more skills funding.Billions of pounds for new, job creation projects around the country.A \u00a33 billion plan to support 140,000 green jobs.And in this vital period, as we get going again:VAT cut.Stamp duty cut.Meals out cut.Mr Speaker, all part of our Plan for Jobs worth up to \u00a330 billion.Mr Speaker,Governments, much less people, rarely get to choose the moments that define them. What choice there is comes in how we respond.For me, this has never just been a question of economics, but of values:I believe in the nobility of work.I believe in the inspiring power of opportunity.I believe in the British people\u2019s fortitude and endurance.And it is that value, endurance, more than any other, we need to embody now.A patience to live with the uncertainty of the moment\u2026\u2026to find that new balance between safety and normality.We will not be defined by this crisis, but by our response to it.It is an unambiguous choice to make this moment meaningful for our country in a way that transcends the frustration and loss of recent months.It is a plan to turn our national recovery into millions of stories of personal renewal.Mr Speaker, it is our Plan for Jobs and I commend it to this House.

The jobs will give young people \u2013 who are more likely to have been furloughed, with many working in sectors disproportionately hit by the pandemic - the opportunity to build their skills in the workplace and to gain experience to improve their chances of finding long-term work.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:  This isn\u2019t just about kickstarting our country\u2019s economy \u2013 it is an opportunity to kickstart the careers of thousands of young people who could otherwise be left behind as a result of the pandemic.  The scheme will open the door to a brighter future for a new generation and ensure the UK bounces back stronger as a country.Businesses of all sizes looking to create quality jobs for young people can apply and there is no cap on the number of places. Household names including Tesco have already pledged to offer Kickstart jobs.Young people will be referred into the new roles through their Jobcentre Plus work coach with the first Kickstarts expected to begin at the start of November.The scheme, which will be delivered by the Department for Work and Pensions will initially be open until December 2021, with the option of being extended.The Chancellor and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Therese Coffey, today invited young people hoping to take part in the scheme to a speed mentoring session with CEOs.Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Therese Coffey said:  As we launch our \u00a32 billion Kickstart programme, putting young people at the heart of our revival - we are urging businesses to get involved in this innovative scheme and take advantage of the enormous pool of potential out there.  There is no limit on the number of opportunities we\u2019ll open up through Kickstart and we\u2019ll fund each one for six months as part of Our Plan for Jobs to create, support and protect jobs.  Young people taking part will receive on-the-job training, skills development and mentoring, as we get them on that first rung of the jobs ladder and on their way to successful careers.To help smaller businesses, employers offering fewer than 30 placements will be asked to make a bid through an intermediary, such as a Local Authority or Chamber of Commerce, who will then bid for 30 or more placements as a combined bid from several businesses. This will make the process easier and less labour intensive to apply for these smaller companies who only want to hire one or two Kickstarters.Young people are usually amongst the worst hit by financial crises, and unemployment can have longstanding implications for their future jobs and wages. We know people are leaving education into an extremely difficult jobs market, we know that young people are more likely to have been furloughed, so we are stepping in to provide more help.Around 700,000 young people are set to leave education and enter the job market this year, with a quarter of a million more people aged under 25 claiming unemployment benefits since March \u2013 with youth unemployment having a long-term impact on jobs and wages.The Kickstart scheme was announced in July as part of the Chancellor\u2019s Plan for Jobs, which set out the biggest package of support for youth unemployment in decades \u2013 including tripling the number of traineeships, incentivising employers to hire more apprentices through a \u00a32,000 payment to employers for every apprentice they hire under the age of 25 and investing in our National Careers Service so people can receive bespoke advice on training and work.
